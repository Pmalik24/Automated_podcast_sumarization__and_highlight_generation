The. Joe Rogan. Experience

2 (6s):
Train by day. Joe Rogan podcast by night. All day.

3 (13s):
Oh yeah. No. Yeah. I'll have a little taste. Just a little

4 (16s):
Taste. Mr. Hey, you

3 (21s):

4 (22s):
Sir. Cheers. Good to see you again.

3 (24s):
Good to be seen.

4 (25s):
Ha ha. Woo. So tell me what the fuck is going on. How is it, how's, how's things cracking First of all? Congratulations on being proved correct and that there are literally mammoth bones, bison, bones, all kinds of bones in the East River. Yes, sir. You, you said it on this podcast. Dirty Water. Dan went out and looked for 'em. They found bones, they found multiple bones. It's real.

3 (56s):
It's very real.

4 (57s):
So the museum dumped bones that belonged to your property. Yeah. Out there in the East River. And they're still out there for people to find. How, how many pounds were dumped?

3 (1m 8s):
50. Roughly. 50 tons.

4 (1m 10s):
50 tons.

3 (1m 12s):
50

4 (1m 13s):
50 tons.

3 (1m 14s):
And that was told to me by one of the guys that wrote that report that I read on your show.

4 (1m 19s):
Good Lord. That's a lot. I didn't know it was that many. Yeah.

3 (1m 22s):
Fox Car.

4 (1m 24s):
And they found How many bones so far?

3 (1m 27s):
Don? Don't know.

4 (1m 28s):
You don't know.

3 (1m 29s):
I think Dirty Water, Don. And those guys found three so far.

4 (1m 33s):
Did I say Dan? Sorry.

3 (1m 34s):
Sorry. It is either Dan or Don.

4 (1m 36s):
Don. I think it's, is it Dirty Water Dan? Or Dirty Water or Don? It's Don. Dirty Water. Don. I'm sorry. That's a risky thing that the guy's diving in the East River. Yeah. That guy's,

3 (1m 47s):
Yeah. There's more guys out there too.

4 (1m 49s):
How many guys are out there right now?

3 (1m 50s):
Don't know how many, but I know there's others out there that are making fines. So

4 (1m 55s):
Are they using spotlights? Like how are they seeing things at the bottom of the East River?

3 (2m 0s):
One is a research vessel.

4 (2m 2s):
A research vessel. Yeah.

3 (2m 4s):
And whoa. Yeah, I'm in the gold mining industry and we have a code that we don't talk about. So

4 (2m 10s):
This is one piece and this is a jawbone, correct?

3 (2m 14s):
Yes, sir.

4 (2m 15s):
Of a step bison?

3 (2m 17s):
I believe so. I have never seen it. Mm. But I know he found that was one of the first things he found. He found some Mammoth Ivory.

4 (2m 24s):
Yeah. And he found another bone, right?

3 (2m 27s):
Yes sir.

4 (2m 27s):
Some So like a,

3 (2m 28s):
Looks like a leg bone.

4 (2m 31s):
Yeah. Right there. Yeah. So this is his, his Instagram is dirty water dawn on Instagram. And that's another bone that they found right there.

3 (2m 40s):
Yes sir.

4 (2m 40s):
And so they know roughly the location. And it's kind of amazing that this stuff was dumped in, was it the thirties? When was this dumped

3 (2m 49s):
In the forties. The forties.

4 (2m 51s):
Yes sir. So this stuff was dumped. That's outrageous. That's an outrageous photograph. How dare You don this stuff was dumped in the forties. And to this day, like this is the first time that people have actually gone looking for things,

3 (3m 6s):
Correct? Yes sir.

4 (3m 8s):
So

3 (3m 9s):
It's been a dirty little secret for decades. Yeah.

4 (3m 12s):
Well proven true now.

3 (3m 13s):
Yeah. It sure has been.

4 (3m 16s):
The museum still continues to deny it though, correct?

3 (3m 21s):
They won't talk to me.

4 (3m 24s):
Why won't they talk to

3 (3m 25s):
You? Well, when I drew and Laura and I and my wife went to New York a few years ago, they were supposed to meet with us and they decided to have us stand out in the rain for four hours. Really?

4 (3m 37s):
Yeah. And they wouldn't meet with you? No. So you went all the way to New York to meet with

3 (3m 40s):
Them? Yes, sir. Well, I went there to the Explorers Club to show the documentary. There was a screening of the documentary on the Boneyard.

4 (3m 47s):
And what did they just decide that you're too problematic?

3 (3m 51s):
I think so. Yeah. Well,

4 (3m 52s):
How are you problematic, don? Don't understand.

3 (3m 55s):
I'm problematic in many, many ways. I think you're great because I don't think they ever envisioned somebody like me owning this company. Right.

4 (4m 3s):
That's probably the problem. Yeah. The problem is, you're honest.

3 (4m 7s):
To some degree I'm a gold miner after all. Yeah. You know, mark Twain's said, minors is a liar standing next to a hole in the ground.

4 (4m 16s):
Oh, that's funny. Yeah. Mark Twain was the shit.

3 (4m 18s):
Yeah. Wasn't he?

4 (4m 19s):
He really was. Boy was that guy ahead of his time. You know, a lot of people credit him for being the first standup comedian.

3 (4m 26s):
I didn't know that.

4 (4m 27s):
Yeah, because you know, there's a standup comedy is a truly American art form. And it seems like Twain was the first guy to do it. 'cause essentially what he would do is read his humorous works in front of people and they would all laugh. So he would, you know, be playing to the crowd. And it, it was one of the first iterations of standup comedy was Mark Twain. And obviously he's a very funny guy. Yep. Very insightful and humorous and Yep. So many great quotes from this one individual, you know? Yep. So they left you in the rain and then nobody has spoken to you since, or what?

3 (5m 9s):
They don't talk to me. I What

4 (5m 11s):
Are they afraid of? It's not even them. You gotta think this is all done in the 1940s. Everybody who did is probably dead.

3 (5m 19s):
They just don't wanna return the bones.

4 (5m 21s):
Oh, so they have more bones.

3 (5m 23s):
Oh yeah. This is just the, the stuff they threw in the river is not even the good stuff. don don't know if you saw that little video I posted of the, their collecting techniques where they threw 'em in a big pile. No idea where they came from. It's on my, it's on my Instagram,

4 (5m 41s):
So they just don't want to address it. So do you have lawyers involved? Like, what's going on So far?

3 (5m 48s):
Everybody's encouraged me to litigate this. I've been involved in litigation before, and I have a pretty good track record because I protect my property rights. I don't care if it's real property or intellectual property.

4 (6m 0s):
Well, this seems like they're gonna have to I mean there's just too much pressure now with the fact that they've actually found real bones in the East River, that there's no other way they could have gotten there. I mean just how the, how else are you gonna find a step bison bone in the fucking East River? It's clear that they dumped that stuff. Oh

3 (6m 20s):
Yeah. And they, they denied it at first, you know, check this out.

4 (6m 25s):
So it says, I

6 (6m 26s):
Film tons of ivory unearthed in a year. Wow. These are the fearsome reminders of a period when cave men were not the only things girls had to look out for.

4 (6m 35s):
Wow.

3 (6m 35s):
That was, that was am money

6 (6m 37s):
Isn't always so easy to find gold miners in Alaska loosening up the frozen earth found not gold, but the treasures of past ages. A mammoth tusk nine feet long was just a part of the 12 tons of ivory unearthed in a year. Wow. These are the fur. Some reminders of a period when cavemen were not the only things girls had to look out for.

4 (6m 54s):
Hilarious. The way they talked back then was so strange. What a weird way to talk. Like why, why did they all choose to talk like that? don

3 (7m 1s):
Don't

4 (7m 1s):
Know. Very weird. It's like when they first heard themselves recorded, they, I would like the sound of little more of fancy.

3 (7m 8s):
Anyways, that's, that's, that's their collecting techniques. And they sent everything. They weren't supposed to take all that stuff. They were only supposed to take bones of scientific value. And, and they were supposed to research everyone they took. And they're supposed to, under the agreement I had with them or my, my company, do a report annually on everything they took. and it was a tripartite agreement with the University of Alaska, a m and h and my company Fairbanks Exploration. And they didn't do any of it. And when I bought the company, I went to the University Museum and the curator there, I said, I bet you know why I'm here.

3 (7m 52s):
He goes, I think I do. I said, I want the bones back. He goes, let's go to New York City. Let's go get 'em. So we all went to New York City to get 'em. And they gave me a nice tour downstairs of the, of the basement and showed me the tons and tons they had down there. Hundreds and hundreds of mammoth tusks

4 (8m 10s):
Really?

3 (8m 11s):
In those crates. The wooden crates and everything else. And what

4 (8m 13s):
Are they doing with

3 (8m 14s):
'em? Nothing. They're supposed to do reports and research on 'em. They haven't done anything in a hundred years.

4 (8m 19s):
So is it because they don't have the funding to do the work on them and they just wanna store them? 'cause they're pack rats? Like what, what are they

3 (8m 26s):
Doing? Well, they don't have, they don't have the stratographic information about where that stuff comes from.

4 (8m 31s):
Oh, you have that.

3 (8m 33s):
I have all of that. Yeah. And one of the authors of that report I read last year was trying to get us together so we could make some sense outta this collection. And like Drew and I were talking earlier, it's like a thousand piece jigsaw puzzle. and I only got 20 pieces. I want the whole thing on the table and we'll research all of it. 'cause the secrets to the the extinction event are in those bones.

4 (8m 57s):
Yeah. It seems like it.

3 (8m 59s):
It is.

4 (8m 60s):
Well, let's, let's talk about that because one of the things that you have found is a layer of carbon, a layer of dark carbon that seems to indicate a, a mass fire.

3 (9m 11s):
Yes.

4 (9m 11s):
And that where your, the animals are, it's, it's so unusual that there are so many bones in this same sort of layer that exist in one place. Yep. That something had to happen for them to all die in that one spot. And this is something that Randall Carlson has pointed out before. You know, when they found the other places were, I, I forget where the other places were. Was it Siberia where they found massive amounts of mammoths that were all in one area that seemed to have died instantaneously. Some of them with like broken leg bones seemed to have died because of an impact or the, the, the force of the impact?

3 (9m 54s):
Well, like I told you last time, I think it's all secondary deposition from water that, because there's such a wide spectrum of very few mummified remains. Although we found some this summer and I think I told you last year that the oldest sample we took was 22,000 years old. And some people, you know, I, I have that ice age fossil works by little shards of ivory. and I told the one guy, I said, why don't you carbonated if you wanna know the story? So he sent it off to a lab and had it carbonated 40,000 years old. Wow. So there might be enough in there for two driest events.

4 (10m 36s):
Mm. Which is probably likely could have. Yeah. What Well, what Randall and Graham Hancock, what they believe and the younger driest impact theory proponents believe is that distinctly something around 11,800 years ago. And then maybe something also around 10,000 years ago. But that doesn't preclude or that doesn't dismiss the idea that there could have been one 30,000 years, 40,000 years. It could have been multiple events.

3 (11m 5s):
Could have been.

4 (11m 6s):
And because of this time that we pass through this comet shower, it's every June and November I believe.

3 (11m 13s):
And I've, I've posted that picture before of the burnt bedrock and the gravel above it. Yes.

4 (11m 18s):
See if you can find that photo, Jamie. 'cause that's fascinating too, because that, that seems to indicate that something massive happened.

3 (11m 25s):
Something did happen. Yeah. And the problem with this deposit, now I gotta be careful what I say after last time. What would

4 (11m 34s):
You do

3 (11m 34s):
When I was here with you last time? Did

4 (11m 36s):
You get crazy? What'd you say?

3 (11m 38s):
I'm afraid I bullshitted you a little bit.

4 (11m 40s):
In what way?

3 (11m 41s):
Because when I got back to Fairbanks, my surveyor comes up to me, his name's Albert. He says, you got a lot of nerve bullshitting him like that. and I said, what are you talking about? He said, you told him the site that you dug all these up in. It's five acres. I said, yeah. He goes, it's 2.1 acres.

7 (12m 1s):
Oh,

3 (12m 2s):
Okay. I'm gonna tell him. I'm sorry. Tell Joe

4 (12m 4s):
It's even small. Well, that's,

3 (12m 6s):
I I apologize.

4 (12m 7s):
That's actually even more insane. Right. So do you, you you think that this is like the water had washed these bodies into a very specific area?

3 (12m 17s):
I I think, I think there's a, a bigger system of water in play that we don't really understand yet. When, when we started the going up the gulch, it's what it is as a gulch. And it's, it's about not the way I can describe it, it's sure is narrow, but it sure is long. So this year we decided, let's go back to the beginning. And we moved the pump and everything back down to where we started 15, 16 years ago thinking, okay, let's see how wide this is. As soon as we started doing it, we started finding more tusks. Wow. Or animal parts. More of everything.

3 (12m 58s):
And we found those crazy saw bones.

4 (13m 0s):
Yeah. The crazy saw bones are very interesting. Yep. So let's talk about that because we've, we've showed photos on the podcast before and that these sod bones, now you have carbon dated them and they're to win here. They're

3 (13m 14s):
Yeah. You're not gonna believe this. 'cause we got all excited when we found them. Yeah. Plus or minus 200 years or 190 years.

4 (13m 23s):
So what, what kind of animal are these from?

3 (13m 27s):
Don? Don't know,

4 (13m 29s):
But they're 200 years old.

3 (13m 31s):
190 here. I brought one with me. Oh really? This is the story about how these were found is I got a call one day. I was out there at the Boneyard. My daughters have a tourist business around the corner, a little bit called Gold Daughters. and I Laura called me and goes, dad, there's a state troop over here wanting to talk to you and I look around my truck to see what I got in it. I said, okay, I'll be right over. I go over and we had some stuff going on at the time and I didn't think there was any reports filed any place.

3 (14m 11s):
But I go over there and introduce myself to this guy. And it's, his name's Eric Spitzer. He's the head state trooper in Fairbanks. He says, I was just out in the neighborhood. I I wanted to come by and introduce myself. I saw you on Joe Rogan's podcast. I love fossils. I love what this is all about. It's my kids like to look for bones and I, take 'em out in the woods and we look for stuff. and I just wanted to come by and introduce myself. And he, the, the excitement in his just him talk, talking to me. I said, well, follow me over. We'll go, I'll go show it to you right now. So he went over to the Boneyard and he got out and, and he looked around.

3 (14m 52s):
He just couldn't believe it. He picked up some bone parts and I said, well now you're a boner. You just gotta find one. And we bullshit a little bit. He goes, do you mind if I bring my kids out sometime? I said, bring 'em out this weekend. We'll fire the pumps up. I'll turn you guys loose and then we'll come check on you once in a while. And they found a palor tooth full of bones, little fragments, leg bones. And then they came back the next weekend, they found a mammoth tusk and they found these sod bones, a few of 'em. We got 15 of 'em now that they found. And so I told told everybody the, those bones are now called the Spitzer, the Spitzer fines.

3 (15m 35s):
Mm. Two little young daughters found them. Sometimes it just takes a new set of eyes. I don't know how many of those we've picked up in the past, but we never looked at it that way. So I brought one with me. All right. This, this is the one that I carbonated.

4 (15m 50s):
And so this is the one that's 200 plus years old

3 (15m 53s):
Right now that, see, you see that notch right there. That's what I cut out. Sent in to get carbon dated.

4 (15m 58s):
And so this is, boy, this is some sort of a joint. Is that a femur is the top of a femur.

3 (16m 8s):
Do we think the lady Jeanette r Dakota Huntress, she thinks it's a moose, moose leg bone. But set it on its end there. Other, other end.

4 (16m 19s):
Okay.

3 (16m 20s):
Now, 200 years ago, what kind of utility would that have to do that?

4 (16m 27s):
What kind of utility to do that? Yeah. What do you mean?

3 (16m 30s):
Well, the people that did that, why would they have a, a bone like that,

4 (16m 36s):
I would imagine to get to the marrow.

3 (16m 37s):
Yeah. But then what you eat it maybe a candle. Maybe some like some marrow to,

4 (16m 45s):
Well, I would imagine they're eating the marrow. 'cause

3 (16m 47s):
People, they are eating the

4 (16m 48s):
Marrow. People have always eaten the marrow and that's how they do it. I mean if you get marrow now, that's how you do it.

3 (16m 53s):
But I think there's some utility to that bone is what I'm saying. Yeah. Just the way it sits. It could have put fire embers in it to keep, you know, overnight. 'cause this was 200 years ago. Yeah. This was a hundred years before Fairbanks was discovered. This was, this is even more of a mystery to me.

4 (17m 11s):
So was this Russians? It's obviously it's owned by Russia.

3 (17m 15s):
It's about the same timeframe. Yeah. Russians owned Alaska and you know, I wouldn't surprise me if they didn't go up. They founded Anchorage in the late 17 hundreds.

4 (17m 26s):
I think the utility of it is just a coincidence, honestly. Because it doesn't look like it's been worked at the bottom. Nope. No,

3 (17m 32s):
No. I, I agree with you. I don don't know. Yeah. That's the whole thing. None of us know I mean,

4 (17m 37s):
I I'm sure they have used some of these before like that for something. But if I had to guess, I would, I would guess that this is just something that they did to get at the marrow where all the good fat is, you know,

3 (17m 50s):
Maybe they had some vodka and they poured it in there. Eh,

4 (17m 53s):
Perhaps

3 (17m 54s):
Don don't know.

4 (17m 54s):
They probably had some kind of metal cups back then.

3 (17m 57s):
Well, those two little you just showed, they looked like cups to me.

4 (18m 1s):
Mm. They could have been, they, they certainly could be some sort of a, a thing that you could drink out of certainly the right size for a good shot of vodka. Yep. But, so were there supposedly people living in that area back then? No. No,

3 (18m 17s):
No.

4 (18m 19s):
Hmm

3 (18m 20s):
Hmm. That's right. 'cause up till now, the dating sequences have been 3000 be before present to now it's 40,000 years before present. Mm. That puts it up to 200 years before present.

4 (18m 32s):
Which is interesting.

3 (18m 33s):
It is interesting.

4 (18m 35s):
So what do, what do you think is

3 (18m 36s):
Going on? I have no idea.

4 (18m 39s):
Does anybody have a, a theory?

3 (18m 41s):
There's probably a lot of theories, but that's the whole point about all this stuff. Nobody knows.

4 (18m 46s):
Well, at least we know. You didn't come up with evidence that the saw is older than 5,000 years old. Which is one of the things that we're

3 (18m 53s):
Thinking, which is I was hoping that was gonna be the case. Yeah. That

4 (18m 56s):
Would've been

3 (18m 56s):
Wild. Then when he, when I got the car carbon dates, I'm going, oh, damnit. But thinking about it though, it's even more of a, more of an interesting thing. How much

4 (19m 8s):
Of a recorded history do we have of that area from 200 years

3 (19m 11s):
Ago? None.

4 (19m 12s):
None. Uhuh. So was it mostly like, have you ever seen that Werner Herzog documentary Happy People Life in the Tiger Uhuh? It's about people who live in Siberia right now to this day. And they live this in incredibly primitive life. The, the really all they have is snowmobiles and some hand tools and, you know, maybe some chainsaws. And most of what they do is just living off the land, trapping, fishing, hunting. That's it. Yep. And they, you know, there the very low instances of mental illness, everybody's very happy. All these communities of these people living together just, you know, surviving, living off the land, sub sub subsistence lifestyle.

4 (19m 56s):
But don don't think there's much historical record on those people. You know, the people that are alive there right now, if they were to die off 200 years from now, what evidence is there of them other than you might, you might find some stuff that they did. You might find some trees they cut down or some, some logs or whatever's gonna be a, a round still 200 years from now that'd be preserved.

3 (20m 17s):
Yep. Well we did find that skinning rock across the valley on top of a hill that still don't know where, that's how old that is or where that's from.

4 (20m 28s):
Skinning rock.

3 (20m 29s):
The skinning rock is posted there. That,

4 (20m 31s):
And it's been worked. So it's, yeah,

3 (20m 34s):
There's even a little indent on the side for your finger as you flesh something out.

4 (20m 38s):
And what is it made out of

3 (20m 40s):
Stone from Eastern Europe. Remember we talked a little bit about

4 (20m 43s):
Oh, that's right. That's right.

3 (20m 44s):
And it wasn't local. Right. So there was a lot of traveling, migrating, going on across that bearing land bridge. 'cause it was ice free corridor. Yeah. and it went all the way into the lower 48.

4 (20m 57s):
Mm.

3 (20m 58s):
So there's a lot of stuff that we find, as I said last time that they say didn't live there, but it sure died there. Yeah.

4 (21m 5s):
Like, let's talk about that. Like what different animals did they say didn't live there, that you personally in your company has found evidence of

3 (21m 13s):
Dire wolfs being one of 'em. Saber tooth being another one. My, I found one in my company found one before, before I was around, sent 'em to New York City. I asked to see 'em, but they didn't have 'em available. And let's see what else we got. Badgers, elk.

4 (21m 36s):
And they didn't think they were around back then. No. Why did they not think that elk were in that area back then? Because Elk are in Alaska

3 (21m 43s):
Because they, they never found any elk bones.

4 (21m 46s):
Right. But that's it. It's just they didn't find the bones.

3 (21m 48s):
They didn't find the bones.

4 (21m 50s):
But they literally didn't think that Saber two titles lived in that area.

3 (21m 53s):
They didn't think that. In fact, in that film, that documentary film, Pat Druckenmiller, who's the cur curator now in the director of the museum, says, to their knowledge, n none of 'em ever been found there. Wow. But to my knowledge, they have been 'cause on a shipping manifest, a m and h, that one was sent to 'em.

4 (22m 11s):
Ah.

3 (22m 11s):
The one I found was stolen by the British Museum never returned. So I'm on kind of a little bit of a rampage these days about the museums and what they're doing with these collections. It's, it is kind of a one man, one man thing. It's a cause I think it's important.

4 (22m 32s):
Well, I think it is important because these museums are run by these academics and academics. Unfortunately, some of them tend to be very arrogant and they, they want to be able to control whatever narrative they have or whatever information they have. And they don't wanna be open about it.

3 (22m 51s):
No. And the am and H is a private institution, but the Smithsonian's a public entity that's owned by us. So they answered a different set of rules. The Smithsonian has to respond to a FOIA request. Mm. M and H says, what are you gonna do? Sue us? We'll Don break you.

4 (23m 10s):
What does that mean?

3 (23m 11s):
Bend you over a log and we'll break you.

4 (23m 13s):
Oh, with money.

3 (23m 14s):
With money, with lawyers, with all that litigation costs. Why

4 (23m 18s):
Don't we fucking crowdfund something?

3 (23m 20s):
Well, because I have another plan. Oh, this is, the plan's gonna work.

4 (23m 25s):
Okay.

3 (23m 27s):
I have people in our state legislature working on this right now. There's a senator named Click Bishop who's on the finance committee. He's on the resources committee. He's, he's the majority whip. And he's in making efforts to get the bones back to Alaska from the state of Alaska. Now m and H might be able to take on John Reeves, this don't break me, but they can't do it to the state of Alaska, state of Alaska. Go toe to toe them some bitches. Now, after we get that through the house and state legislature, the Senate and the House, we'll go to a congressional delegation.

3 (24m 9s):
You've heard what an act of congress is, don't you? You know what that is? Sure. M and H give them their goddamn bones back. And m and H is going See the light. This is a political solution to this. Not, not lawyers, not all that stuff. I got nothing to gain from this, you know, I'm just trying to get 'em back in Alaska. So we have that thousand piece puzzle to put together. Mm. They were supposed to be studied and researched in answers to the extinction event arc within the bones.

4 (24m 40s):
And so you've never been given any explanation as to why they haven't done this research.

3 (24m 49s):
They didn't feel like it.

4 (24m 50s):
They just didn't feel like it. Is it because they don't have the resources? Or it just wasn't a priority for them. And this was all done from the 1940s and there's no reason for them to go back and take that stuff and reenact the research or begin the research.

3 (25m 3s):
It's impossible for them to come up with any scientific research because they don't have the stratographic information. They don't even know where it was found. Right. But I do, let's put it all together boys, and then we'll study it. Why?

4 (25m 17s):
I just don't understand why they wouldn't wanna do that. That seems to me an incredible opportunity to attain enlightenment on an area that's fascinating. Yep. I mean. Have have any academics reached out to you after the podcast?

3 (25m 33s):
Not that I, not that I know of how

4 (25m 36s):
Not how not I mean me just finding your Instagram page I was like, Jesus Christ. Like how does this guy have all these bones? Like, this is crazy. What is this place? This place seems like, what an amazing fortunate find that you guys have this one spot, 2.1 acres and probably a whole lot more around that area. Yes sir. That you have just haven't uncovered yet. Right. That has this incredible wealth of bones.

3 (26m 6s):
It's amazing.

4 (26m 7s):
It's fucking incredible. Yep.

3 (26m 9s):
And that's why that cut bone, by the way, I noticed you don't have a, a Spitzer bone out there in your lobby. What's

4 (26m 15s):
A Spitzer

3 (26m 15s):
Bone? That, that's what we call the Spitzer bones.

4 (26m 18s):
Oh

3 (26m 19s):
Yeah. You ain't got one of those in your lobby?

4 (26m 21s):
No, I

3 (26m 21s):
Don't. I'm gonna fix that shit. Okay.

4 (26m 23s):
Thank you.

3 (26m 23s):
You're welcome.

4 (26m 26s):
We do have the step bison head though.

3 (26m 28s):
I saw it out there. It looks nice where it's sitting.

4 (26m 29s):
We're trying to figure out how to display it. I think I'm gonna have a stand built and just have it sit out there.

3 (26m 37s):
I've got people going, oh, he needs to get a Cadillac. I'm mounted on the hood. Ooh. Well yeah,

4 (26m 43s):
That's not a bad idea.

3 (26m 44s):
As long as you don't drive it around.

4 (26m 46s):
Once I get a ranch out here, I'll do that. I'll put it on the ranch truck.

3 (26m 50s):
There you go.

4 (26m 53s):
But I think it would, nah, that's not good. That could

3 (26m 55s):
Be, needs to be preserved. Be the Blue Bay bison was 38,000 years old and that's, you know, they could have known each other back in the day.

4 (27m 3s):
Well, it looks old as fuck.

3 (27m 4s):
It is old as fuck. Yeah.

4 (27m 6s):
What an amazing, amazing spot you have. Do you ever stop and just think how insane it is?

3 (27m 12s):
I do. and I have people like Eric Spitzer and his daughters show up and they're just the happiness, they're just so gleeful. Yeah. And sometimes I need to see that, to remember that what we're doing is kind of worthwhile.

4 (27m 25s):
No, it's very worthwhile.

3 (27m 26s):
It, it means that people enjoy it and they like seeing it and they like doing it and they, we just haven't figured out a way to let everybody do it.

4 (27m 34s):
Well it just seems to me that this is an extraordinary opportunity to gain some understanding. Yeah. And that's why I don't understand why these universities or you know, someone hasn't reached out to you and said, Hey, we need to really have a full scale investigation. Find out what happened here. This is an extraordinary place and it may unlock a lot of pieces to this puzzle as to what happened to humanity. There's clearly some indication that we have a very limited understanding of the history of human beings in terms of what took place, where we're starting to uncover these immense structures that seem to indicate that people had very complex construction methods many thousands of years before we thought they were capable of doing that.

4 (28m 31s):
Many thousands. Yeah. You'll go back Lee Tepi, which is buried 11,000 plus years ago, back when they thought people were hunter-gatherers. And that's just what we found. We, we and that now they've done through lidar, that whole area around Go Beckley, Tepi. They found tons of these things. They're all over the place out there. Yeah. And that's, how many more of these spots are there on Earth that we just haven't found yet?

3 (28m 57s):
Who knows.

4 (28m 58s):
Who knows? And your area where that, that, have they done a core sample where they've gone through that carbon layer to find out like what, what year that all took place yet? No. Wow. That

3 (29m 13s):
Seems, and and, and it is partially my fault because I, I tell everybody, look, until we get our bones back from the bowels of the a m and H, nothing's gonna get studied. If they want to, if they wanna do this and continue doing this, they can deal with Drew out there. 'cause we're not gonna, we're not gonna just say, okay, we'll study 20 pieces of this a thousand piece puzzle. We're just two guys with one giant. My company had 200 giants running at the same time for over 40 years. Recovered tens of thousands and thousands of bones, all of which were taken to New York. 50 tons of which were dumped at least one time in the East River and maybe more than that.

4 (29m 54s):
Now, why did they dump those in the East River? They just needed the storage.

3 (29m 58s):
I don't know. I'm,

4 (29m 59s):
They just had an abundance of

3 (30m 0s):
Them. They had so many of 'em and they said, ah, nobody's gonna give us any money for this. I I have an idea that's a good cover story for making sure your wealthy donors get a little something, something and getting 'em off the books.

4 (30m 13s):
Oh. So some of 'em they dumped and some of 'em they gave away.

3 (30m 17s):
I would think.

4 (30m 18s):
I would imagine

3 (30m 19s):
Museums aren't money making institutions. Right. And so I I think a lot of the times they get something donated, especially when there's no control at all. There was no control on this, what was going on.

4 (30m 31s):
Right. Sort of like when we send money to Ukraine,

3 (30m 34s):
Okay. It's

4 (30m 35s):
Going all over the place.

3 (30m 35s):
Yeah. Why aren't we sending money to Maui? Right.

4 (30m 38s):
Yeah.

3 (30m 38s):
Okay.

4 (30m 39s):
I've said that many times.

3 (30m 40s):
A hundred, a hundred billion dollars to Ukraine. We could have built a gas land from the North slope to the lower 48 and a water line from southeast Alaska to Northern California and took care of the people in Maui. Yeah. And still have some change left over. Yeah.

4 (30m 54s):
A lot of change,

3 (30m 55s):
But no.

4 (30m 57s):
Yeah.

3 (30m 58s):
It's crazy.

4 (30m 60s):
It is. It is. And that's, it seems like what's happening with your bones and your property and the, the lack of don don't wanna say if it's a lack of interest. I'm sure they're interested, but the lack of action, it's symbolic of a lot of the problems that we have in our society today.

3 (31m 20s):
Mismanagement man.

4 (31m 21s):
Massive, massive mis and confederacy of Ds that are running the show. Yeah.

3 (31m 26s):
They're, and seemingly they don't care what we think.

4 (31m 31s):
No. Well that's, you know, it's, they have too much on their plate. Why are they gonna talk about some fucking dude in Alaska who's out of his mind blowing water into this side of permafrost pulling out all kinds of crazy skulls? Oh yeah. Yeah.

3 (31m 48s):
Well I think, you know, I'm in business, you're in business and we have a divided congress. We got half that. A little bit more than half that think this president we got should be impeached. And we got the other lower, little bit less than half. Not one of 'em think he should be impeached. So my belief as a business guy is as long as they're fucking with each other, they're not fucking with me. They're leaving us alone.

4 (32m 15s):
Right.

3 (32m 16s):
And that's kind of what's going on right now.

4 (32m 19s):
Boy, imagine that being the best case scenario in 2023 with all the information that we have today with ai, with chat GPT-4 0.0 soon, soon to be five with all the technology we have available, all the understanding that we have available and we're still just want everybody to just leave us alone. That's the best case scenario.

3 (32m 42s):
It just, they've, they stay busy with themselves and do what we want.

4 (32m 47s):
Yeah. It's better than them helping us.

3 (32m 50s):
Yeah. We don't want it. Yeah. But if, if the other part is, I, I don't want to let my bones leave Alaska. Right. Of course I don, they never seemed to come back. Right.

4 (33m 0s):
I wouldn't trust them anymore. Nope. And the British Museum, like what has, have they given any sort of an explanation of what they did with that Saber-tooth tiger skull?

3 (33m 9s):
No,

4 (33m 10s):
Somebody's probably got that in their living room. Yeah, they do.

3 (33m 12s):
Yeah.

4 (33m 13s):
By George. Look what I have here. Oh my. I made a sizable donation to the museum and they gifted me with this wonderful CO tooth tiger skull

3 (33m 23s):
In that case, I think the guy never even got back to the museum. I think he just took it home. Mm. You know, he was working for him. But they're a bunch of, it's like we don't sell bones from the Boneyard. We don't sell bones. We've given some bones away. That's 'cause I own 'em. I can give 'em away. They didn't own them. You know, museums don't own 'em.

4 (33m 46s):
So they were supposed to research them. What were they supposed to do? There it is Saber two Tiger Skull. Wow. A million dollars at auction. Yep. Wow. That's 2019. I I know a guy who has one of those and he's a very wealthy guy and he, he actually has a real saber tooth tiger skull on his desk in a plexiglass case.

3 (34m 8s):
That's awesome.

4 (34m 8s):
Yeah, just like that. and I think that's how he got it. I think he got it at an auction.

3 (34m 13s):
Yep.

4 (34m 14s):
Yeah.

3 (34m 14s):
And how did it get to the auction?

4 (34m 18s):
Good question. Right? It's probably yours. He probably bought yours.

3 (34m 21s):
Mine wasn't that good looking. That was a good looking skull.

4 (34m 25s):
That's a good looking skull. Yeah. His is a good looking skull as well. His is fully intact. Yeah.

3 (34m 29s):
No, mine wasn't that good. How

4 (34m 30s):
Many of them do they have that are fully intact out there in the, in the wild

3 (34m 35s):
Floating around? Well, LaBrea, there's a lot of 'em at LaBrea Tar Pits I believe. Yeah. Alaska's a, you know, you keep it in perspective. I'm down here, your neck of the woods. There's probably two or 300,000 more people living in this city of Austin than live in the entire state of Alaska. Mm. The whole state. Yeah. I mean yesterday Drew and I were going, Hey, let's, let's drive out and look at the farms and the countryside. We drove for two hours. We couldn't get out of town. We ended up at the airport every time. But there's a lot of, boy, there's a lot of building going on over last year.

4 (35m 13s):
Yeah.

3 (35m 14s):
Seems like there's a whole lot booming. Yeah, it is.

4 (35m 17s):
It's now the 10th largest city in the country. It's a little tiny ass city at one point in time.

3 (35m 22s):
Not anymore.

4 (35m 23s):
Now it's blowing up.

3 (35m 25s):
When you guys gonna get a football team?

4 (35m 27s):
That's a good question. That's a good question. don.

3 (35m 30s):
Don't know. I don't know. I don't know how that shit works, but

4 (35m 32s):
I don't know how that shit works either. But boy, they love football out here Game.

3 (35m 35s):
Houston's got one. Dallas got one.

4 (35m 37s):
I went to the UT game. It's massive boy. The just the, the college team out here. Holy shit. Yep. Crazy.

3 (35m 45s):
Yeah.

4 (35m 46s):
Wild. It's like a religion out here. Football is nuts out here. Yep.

3 (35m 52s):
It's crazy. Yeah.

4 (35m 54s):
It's a fucking cool place to live too. Yeah,

3 (35m 57s):
It's awesome. So we, we looked around, looked around and said, oh, let's just look around a little bit more and saw parts of Austin that probably are not on the beaten track, beaten track.

4 (36m 10s):
Hmm.

3 (36m 10s):
But hey, I thought, well, let's drive down to the border and see if we get kicked outta Mexico. He goes, it's 485 miles. I said, we ain't going.

4 (36m 24s):
Yeah, it's a hall. I've gone down to South Texas to do some hunting and the place that I went to, they actually found a dead migrant on their property. And he said it's not uncommon that it happens quite often poor guys get lost and trying to make their way across and run outta water. And they do it in July and just die out there, unfortunately.

3 (36m 47s):
Well, don don't, I don't blame the people for wanting to come here at all.

4 (36m 51s):
No.

3 (36m 51s):
My my family and we all came from Europe.

4 (36m 54s):
Mine did too.

3 (36m 55s):
And it's just, it doesn't seem to be any management of, you know, of what's going on.

4 (37m 2s):
Seems to be the opposite of management. Yeah. Seems like a concerted effort to flood the country.

3 (37m 7s):
It sure does.

4 (37m 8s):
And not just this country. It seems like it's happening all over Europe. It's it's real weird. Yeah, it's a weird time because like, this is the only time in my life that I've ever wondered like really, really wondered and seriously considered the fact that there's some puppet masters that are slowly orchestrating the collapse of civilization.

3 (37m 30s):
You know, you talked about ai Well someday and probably not too far in the future, you'll be able to do your podcast without even being here. It'll AI will have you sitting there, have me sitting here and it we'll be guessing what we're gonna talk about.

4 (37m 45s):
Yeah. Good luck.

3 (37m 47s):
Yeah. No shit.

4 (37m 49s):
AI is going to be able to do a really good job of recreating the kind of conversations that we've had, but they're not gonna be able to really recreate human stupidity. I don't understand what, like, what happens when people get drunk. You know, don don't think AI is gonna be able to recreate, protect our parks. don don't, don don't think they're gonna, they're not. There's like, there's certain aspects of just genuine human chaos that AI I don't think is ever gonna grasp because it doesn't have a soul.

3 (38m 23s):
And the other thing is You don't know if you, what you just saw is real. Right. I mean

4 (38m 28s):
That's a real problem now.

3 (38m 29s):
That is a real problem. Yeah. Because right now the stuff you say it can be real. Yeah. but it is real. Wait till they get AI going.

4 (38m 37s):
It's already going I mean, I think what we're seeing right now is just really the tip of the iceberg. Their capabilities. And I wonder, you know, I had Sam Altman on who is the, he was the head dog at Open AI and they kicked him out and they brought him back in and there's some sort of weird explanation of why they kicked him out and they were saying that he wasn't forthcoming about something. And the concern is that this artificial intelligence has reached sentt like it can think for itself. It can, it could act on its own. It can create things. It can do It literally is a life form now.

4 (39m 18s):
Yeah. It's going to be, yeah. It's going to be at one point in time an artificial life form. Has it done it already? It's very possible.

3 (39m 27s):
You know, I've, I've been thinking, you know, the speed of light was always the standard growing up nothing faster than the speed of light. Then I thought there is something faster than that. It's the speed of thought.

8 (39m 42s):
Mm.

3 (39m 42s):
We can think faster than that. Light can travel.

8 (39m 45s):
Mm.

3 (39m 46s):
I'll give you an example of that. I saw it online has to be true. There's 200 billion trillion stars in a known galaxy. That's not just some guy making that shit up. That's a, that's a real smart person that's done the studies on this universe. Yeah. 200 billion trillion galaxies or stars. How many planets would that be if they averaged five a piece?

8 (40m 19s):
Yeah,

3 (40m 20s):
That's a bunch.

4 (40m 21s):
That's a bunch.

3 (40m 22s):
That's such a massive thing to think about. There's no point in even thinking about it. You know, you, you, it is by me. I I just want to go pick up bones at the Boneyard.

4 (40m 33s):
Well then it goes deeper than that. Well there's a, a couple ways it goes deeper than that. First of all in the center of every galaxy is a super massive black hole that I think is, I think it's, what is it? One half of 1% of the mass of the entire galaxy that's in the, so something along those lines. It's at every, so the larger the galaxy, the larger the super massive black hole. And there's real speculation that if you went through that black hole, you, you reach another universe with also hundreds of billions of galaxies each with hundreds of billions of stars.

4 (41m 16s):
Each one of those galaxies has a super massive black hole. You go through that another universe, hundreds of billions of galaxies, hundreds of billions of black holes go through them. Hundreds of billions of galaxies, new universes everywhere. And then there's dimensions. This is the real speculation when, you know, when people start talking about UAPs and alien life. And there's two thoughts. One thought, well, there's more than two thoughts. One thought is that they are us from the future. Another thought is they, they're us from their people, their things, their intelligent life forms, maybe even artificial intelligence.

4 (41m 57s):
Something that has been created from other galaxies that is physically transported here. And then the other thought is there's inter interdimensional travel that there are beings from somewhere that are capable of visiting this dimension that we exist in. But they exist in something. So they're here all the time. They're just here in a way that we have no ability to access them, but they can access us.

3 (42m 26s):
But and time, and I've heard you say this something we made up. Right? There's no such thing as time. Right?

4 (42m 33s):
This is the only time right now.

3 (42m 34s):
Yeah. And it's gone already. Yep. It was here. It's gone right now. You talk about it'd be nice

4 (42m 41s):
To, what is this Jamie? Quick

9 (42m 42s):
Animation NASA made to give you a, a size reference if you will. Okay. It starts with the middle thing. Is the sun. Okay. Our sun and I think these are different super massive black holes. Right. They're small, obviously. I'm gonna try to speed it up so it doesn't take too long. Let me go to speed. This is the orbit of mercury. There's one there. It gets really big here really quick though.

4 (43m 10s):
So these are other super massive black holes that are just in our galaxy.

9 (43m 13s):
Yeah. There's the Milky Way asteroid belt just went away. Watch how speed's up here. Here comes a big one outside of the solar system.

4 (43m 25s):
What the fuck?

9 (43m 26s):
Hold on. Bigger one and wait for the big one.

4 (43m 31s):
Oh my God.

9 (43m 32s):
So that one's just sitting out there. Tons 6 1 8.

4 (43m 35s):
Wow.

9 (43m 37s):
And I guess in theory then. Yeah. All of that times two. Or don don't know how big is inside that like reverse don don't know.

4 (43m 44s):
Yeah. Go inside that and you find another universe. Yeah. Which is weird that like the universe is so big we can't even wrap our head around it. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. The tip of the iceberg is not even a good way to describe it. It's grain of sand. Yep. Maybe it's not even a grain of sand. Maybe it's an atom. Maybe it's not even an atom. Maybe it's a subatomic particle. And maybe, maybe the whole thing is fractal. So maybe what we are and what this planet is I mean. I'm sure you've seen when they look at, have you ever seen the, a map of the known universe in comparison to a neuron in the human brain?

4 (44m 28s):
See if we can find that it, it's entirely possible that it, it just constantly, if you constantly expand further and further out, that this entire universe is an atom. It's a part of a much larger organism that exists in another universe that is infinitely large, that is impossible for us to grasp our head around. So that's a brain cell and that's galaxies. And when you look at that I mean God damn, those things look the same.

4 (45m 8s):
They look the same neural network and the cosmic web they look the same. And if, if they are the same, if that is what a brain cell is and that the entire universe is a part of the brain of an infinitely large individual that's a part of a civilization that also exists in another universe, that's a part of an infinitely large being that's a brain cell of that, that universe is a brain cell of that thing. And that it just keeps going and going and going. And even the idea of the big bang, it's just like, maybe not, maybe it's always been here.

4 (45m 54s):
Maybe maybe it's just constant and maybe it's God, maybe the whole thing.

3 (46m 2s):
Maybe those people, aliens, whatever you wanna call it, visited Earth about sixty five, seventy 5 million years ago. And he said, Hey, no life like us can live here with these dinosaurs running around. Yeah. That's burned. This some bitch down.

4 (46m 19s):
It could be.

3 (46m 20s):
And poof

4 (46m 22s):
It could be. That's just how it's sort of designed that the, the thing is designed to like, the only reason for us to advance, and the only reason for us to create civilization is you can't live where you are without structure. You can't live where, where you are without agriculture. You can't live where you are without controlling resources. And so then as they fight off the predators, they develop better weapons as they fight off the mongol hoards. They develop better me methods of protecting civilization and societies. and it just keeps expanding further and further and further all of it to encourage technological innovation.

4 (47m 6s):
And that without that strife, without the problem, like with the problems that we have in the world today, what if they didn't exist? Everyone's like, oh, we'd have utopia. But, but would be, would we don don't know I mean it seems like we're designed for chaos. We're designed for constant struggle. And maybe that's like an engine to further encourage innovation and to further encourage society to progress further and further. And that you have to battle against these evil, evil forces. You have to battle against incompetent government. Otherwise you have no motivation to do better.

3 (47m 42s):
Well, I I think the pandemic was brought on a whole series of mental disorders in this country. Oh yeah. In this world. We're getting set up for it again probably. Yeah. And you, you, you were talking once about quiet desperation.

4 (47m 59s):
Yeah.

3 (48m 1s):
There's a lot of people that were worried. I was worried, you know, I have a family when all that started going on going, oh no. Yeah. I want to protect my family if I can. I can't. Nobody can not when not when they're making viruses in labs for what reason. Right. Would, why would you make that virus? Right. You know, it's crazy. Right.

4 (48m 27s):
Why, why are you making them more infectious, more dangerous, more deadly? Why are you taking viruses that were never designed to infect humans and didn't exist in the human population And you're engineering them. Why? So you could study them so you can get research money. Like what are you doing?

3 (48m 47s):
Maybe that virus is designed to make people go crazy.

4 (48m 50s):
I'm sure there are.

3 (48m 51s):
You know, just make 'em go nuts. Right. Kind of like, what's going on?

4 (48m 55s):
Right.

3 (48m 56s):
We got shit going on. You know, talking about planet killers. We can, we can kill this planet right now if we want, if all the triggers get pulled and all the Oh yeah. Many times over. Yep. That's where we're at. It's unfortunate that we have to live like that and think about that. We shouldn't be thinking about that.

4 (49m 15s):
No,

3 (49m 16s):
We shouldn't be.

4 (49m 17s):
No, we shouldn't be. But,

3 (49m 18s):
But we are.

4 (49m 21s):
But again, maybe that's part of the design of how the human race evolves. That it has to go through these things in order to, to have an incentive to, to restructure things and get better. I don't know. I don't know if the problem is also our, our personal timeline of being a human being is so limited and so short that by the time you realize how fucked everything is, it's sort of the end of your ride. Yep. By the time you, have you ever read War as a racket by Smedley butler? No. It's a, a a great piece that was written by a guy who was a general, who it was in the 1930s and at the end of his career he wrote this piece called War is a Racket And what he thought he was doing versus what the motivation for these military actions actually were.

4 (50m 17s):
See if you can find that Jamie. and it, it's a very famous piece that was written by Smedley Butler Wars A racket's very long. But this Yeah, the book's not very long, but this is a great quote. War is a racket. It's always been, it's possibly the oldest easily the most profitable. Surely the most vicious is the only international in scope. The only one international in scope is the only one in which profits are reckoned in dollars and the losses in lives. And he wrote this very long piece explaining all the military campaigns that he was involved in. And what they were really about was about making things, you know, protecting bankers, protecting the investments of oil companies and all, all the different things that what he thought they were and what they really were.

4 (50m 58s):
I spent 33 years in active military service and during that period I spent most of my time as a high class muscle man for big business for Wall Street and for bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism. And he wrote that in 1935. Wow. Yeah. And he was, he had figured it out by the end of his tenure. You know, when he, when he was looking back at his career, he was like, Jesus Christ. I thought I was doing the right thing. I thought I was protecting the world.

3 (51m 26s):
You know, you get so many years and like we've made it both around one more trip around the sun since I saw you last time. Yeah. And Willie Mammoths had a built in escape. You get six sets of teeth when the last set is gone, you starve to death. Yep. Real simple.

4 (51m 46s):
Real simple. Yeah. That's the wild. Yeah, the wild is a built in system.

3 (51m 52s):
And our ancestors, you know, that, that were living with us. And I'll say this 'cause I know they were living with us back in the ice age. They weren't working against us and we weren't working against them. All that we wanted to do was survive from one day to the next.

4 (52m 11s):
'cause it was

3 (52m 11s):
So brutal. And that's all they wanted to do. Yeah. and I, I went off on this a little bit recently about the way we portray mammoths being the extinction caused by humans. I'm going, no, you got it all wrong. We live with them side by side for tens of thousands of years. What if we kinda lived together? What if, what if we went out and collected their wool and made clothing? What if, what if we didn't run 'em off cliffs? I've seen the spear tips. You're not gonna stick that through five inches of fur, three inches of, you know, skin leather to hit a vital organ and a wooly mammoth thrown by a guy from me to Jamie First of all, you're not gonna get that close.

3 (52m 57s):
It'll stomp the shit outta you. Wooly mammoths had 10 12 foot tusks. They just don't stand there going, oh, stick a spear in me. They're swinging their head and they're cleaning, they're cleaning stuff out the short face. Bears knew better short face barrel go after baby mammoth, but not a big wooly mammoth. I think they were kinda like domesticated to some degree. Same thing with Muskox. Oin and I talked to Matt Slingsby up there in, in Nome about this. And he, he spends a lot of time out there with the musk oin. He sees how they protect their young Yeah. I can see kind of us living with those guys and domesticate him to some degree.

3 (53m 43s):
Hey, you leave us alone. We'll leave you alone, but let's work together. We didn't always stick spears in them. You know, all the, all the paintings you see now, even prints on online shows. This caveman sticking a spear in a mammoth. I call bullshit on that. And you know why I can do that? 'cause nobody can say you're full of shit. 'cause they don't know either.

4 (54m 8s):
No, it's a lot of speculation. And until the younger driest impact theory, the main theory is to the extinction event was the berserker theory that human beings had become such effective hunters. And by the way, this was, this preceded the invention of the bow and arrow. This was the add add. So which is essentially like a, a better method of throwing a spear. Like I have this thing that I throw the ball for with my dog. Yeah.

3 (54m 34s):
We got one of those. You

4 (54m 35s):
Know what I mean? It's like, it's like a, a cup at the end of it. A long stick. and it allows you to whip that ball really far with leverage. And they had something along those lines that they would throw a spear with and you know, you probably could kill some young mammoths with that. Definitely could kill some bison with that

3 (54m 54s):
Caribou.

4 (54m 55s):
You could kill some stuff but kill 'em all. No, no. don don't think so either. I think it was a, I think it was an impact event.

3 (55m 2s):
There were very few people in the ice age anyways, you know, very few. They didn't travel in groups of a hundred or 200. I don't think we'd have found evidence of that. But if your choice is to go, let's go knock over that, that caribou over there. Or let's go over there to that wooly mammoth and half a half of us get killed. Right. What, what do you say boys? Well, First of all, you can go kill that caribou skin it, gut it and eat it for a few days. Meat won't go bad. Right. You knock over wooly mammoth of 2,500 pounds of meat, you ain't gonna eat very much before it all goes bad.

4 (55m 41s):
Yeah.

3 (55m 42s):
And you know, we have a wooly mammoth brain in our, one of our permafrost tunnels.

4 (55m 47s):
Oh really?

3 (55m 48s):
Yeah. We we're way ahead on this frozen DNA stuff. We, we formed a little, we have permafrost tunnels. They stay frozen year round. There's no electricity, there's no, no cost to it just stays frozen. And that's what you have to do with DNA material. Keep it frozen. So you find something substantial, you put it in one of the tunnels and come back to that later. You know. We'll we will get that later.

4 (56m 16s):
So you have the brain that's inside of the skull?

3 (56m 19s):
No, it's outside the skull. Really? Yeah, it was found frozen and we've had paleontologists.

4 (56m 25s):
How was it outside the skull?

3 (56m 29s):
Probably the wooly mammoth got ripped apart and it, the brain got frozen into the, into the gravel in the muck.

4 (56m 36s):
How intact is it?

3 (56m 37s):
Half of it's there. Wow. And the paleontologist, you

4 (56m 41s):
Got a photo of this thing?

3 (56m 43s):
I don't know if I posted one or not. I'll have to look.

4 (56m 47s):
That's pretty intense.

3 (56m 48s):
It is. I think I got one. If not, I'll ask you if he's got one.

4 (56m 51s):
There's a company in Dallas that's gonna supposedly bring them back. You know about this. They're, they're, they have I think an Indian elephant, which has a large percentage of the DNA that a woolly mammoth has. And then they're gonna splice that with whatever DNA they have of woolly mammoths. And they're gonna recreate woolly mammoths. Well, how far away are we from Jurassic Park? How far, how far, how far away are we from some asshole putting a fucking dinosaur in Costa Rica?

3 (57m 27s):
They, those guys Were all up in Fairbanks. The ones you're talking about brought 'em out to the Boneyard. Yeah. Showed 'em some of the stuff we got. I'll go out on a limb here. This ain't about cloning Willie Mammoths. This is about cloning humans.

4 (57m 47s):
And so you think they're trying to do it effectively with Willie Mammoths first?

3 (57m 51s):
I think they're already doing the humans. We just don't know about it. 'cause of the ethical issues it brings up.

4 (57m 58s):
Yeah. I've always said that if the moment they tell you they can clone humans, the person telling you is probably a clone by the time they tell us.

3 (58m 8s):
All I know is that some of my DNA material is in that permafrost tunnel and with instructions. If down the road somebody in the family wants to bring the old man back, I'm your huckleberry.

4 (58m 22s):
Well, you know, they're doing it right now with human pets. Yeah, with people's pets. You can get your cat cloned. You can get your dog cloned.

3 (58m 28s):
Get your horse cloned. Yeah. Race horses. Ooh, Dolly sheep. Yeah. I think Dolly was the first one. Yeah.

4 (58m 35s):
Well, there was a, there was a group called the Second Coming Project. It was a while back where they were trying to use DNA material from the shroud of turn to, to clone Jesus.

3 (58m 49s):
Jesus h Christ. That guy.

4 (58m 54s):
I think though the shroud of turn has been proven to be fraudulent and that it's, I believe it's only 500 years old, so it's not really Jesus's image that was in the cloth, and it looks fake. You ever seen the shroud of

3 (59m 12s):
Turin? I've seen pictures of It.

4 (59m 14s):
Looks a little hokey. Yeah. Looks like what someone 500 years ago would make. Look, I found Jesus's covering. This is, this is what he died in. There it is right there. Yeah.

3 (59m 27s):
That looks like a guy saw him just outside the hotel

4 (59m 30s):
Last night. Yeah. That looks like, you know, when they find like the Virgin Mary and a fucking grilled cheese sandwich, you know, you know. Yeah. Shroud of turn. Okay. Is a length of linn cloth that bears a faint image of the front. And the back of a man has been venerated for centuries, especially by members of the Catholic church as the actual burial burial shroud used to wrap the body of Jesus, of Nazareth. Nazareth after his crucifixion. And upon which Jesus' bodily image is miraculously imprinted, the human image on the shroud can be discerned more clearly in a black and white photograph.

4 (1h 0m 11s):
Negative photographic negative than in its natural ceia color and effect discovered in 1898 by S Pia, who produced the first photographs of the shroud. This negative image is associated with the popular Catholic devotion to the holy face of Jesus. The shroud's authentic authenticity as a Holy Relic has been disputed, even within the Catholic Church. And Radiocarbon dating has shown it to be medieval artifact with the main image created each via prolonged differential exposure of a prepared fabric to bright sunlight. So the documented history of the Shroud dates back to 1354 when it's exhibited.

4 (1h 0m 51s):
And the new Collegiate Church of Leary, a village north of France, the shroud was denounced as a forgery by the Bishop of Troys in 1389. It was acquired by the House of Savoy in 1453 and later deposited in a chapel in chare where it was damaged by fire in 1532 and 1578. The Savoys moved the shroud to their new capital in Turrin where it has remained ever since. So what is the, what was the years that they found? Yeah, scroll down a little bit. In 1988, radiocarbon dating by three different laboratories established as shroud's linen material was produced between the years 1260 and 1390 to a 95% confidence level.

4 (1h 1m 42s):
Defenders of the au authenticity of the shroud have questioned those results. Usually on the basis of the samples tested, might have been contaminated or taken from a repair of the original fabric. Hmm. Yeah. But imagine if that's how Jesus comes back, I mean, you know, the whole idea is that Jesus is eventually gonna come back when the shit's hit the fan. Like, okay guys, I'll let you try it on your own forever. But now I'm back I mean What better time for Jesus to come back when they've figured out a way to fucking make humans outta DNA Oh, that. Yeah. That would be a good time for Jesus to go, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

4 (1h 2m 22s):
Slow down. Don't you guys have bigger problems?

3 (1h 2m 27s):
Yeah. Our our site is called Clone Fathers, and we haven't done a lot with it because it's, it's emerging technology, let's say. But can you imagine raising your own clone?

4 (1h 2m 42s):
Imagine raising a little, you

3 (1h 2m 46s):
Uhuh, I'd have, I'd have to put it in a bag and throw it over the, into the river. I

4 (1h 2m 51s):
Wouldn't know what to teach it, because I would want it, if it was gonna be me, it would've to make all the fucking mistakes that I've made. and I would try to tell it, Hey, don't do that. But you can't because it has to make those mistakes in order to really appreciate the negative consequences of those actions.

3 (1h 3m 9s):
Yeah. Your folks were telling you, don't do that, and you did it anyway. They

4 (1h 3m 11s):
Weren't telling me shit, which is why I did it. I was the lock key kid, you know, which is probably how I turned out the way I am. But the, the baby, the, if I had a baby, me and I was raising, I wouldn't raise it that way. I'd bring it to the best schools. I'd take care, I'd give it hugs all the time. Yeah. I'd give it all this love. It would have no motivation to be the kind of person that I am today who is motivated, at least in part by neglect.

3 (1h 3m 42s):
Well, you've done quite well, and congratulations on being the most widely washed podcast on the face of this planet. If

4 (1h 3m 51s):
That's not reason for the aliens to land, don don't know what is.

3 (1h 3m 54s):
No. You're bringing, you're bringing, you're bringing a lot of needed information to the world. You really are.

4 (1h 3m 60s):
Well, all I'm doing is I, all I'm doing is going after what I'm curious about. That's all I'm doing. All all I'm doing is approaching and engaging with things that I'm curious about. That's it. Yep. That's the whole, it's this, this whole thing is run basically with three people and my iPhone. Literally. Yeah. I don't, there's no, no one's telling me who to have on or what to do. And you know that 'cause how you and I have booked these podcasts. Yeah. Just you and me. Text messaging. Yeah. Hey, what are you doing? Come on back. I loved it too. Let's do it. Yeah. It's fun.

4 (1h 4m 40s):
and I. I that I think that's part of what also the reason why it's successful is that people know, even though this is on Spotify and there's a massive corporation behind it that distributes it and all that, Spotify leaves me alone at the end of the line. It's just me and Jamie I mean the real, the people that are making this podcast, the people that decide things Jamie and I have, we just have conversations. It's just me and him. Yeah. Just talking. What do you think we should do? That's it. That's it.

3 (1h 5m 10s):
It's kind of what Drew and I are like. We're just two guys in a truck. Yeah. We leave the house in the morning and the phone rings.

4 (1h 5m 15s):
That's also why it's interesting. That's also why it, it, it resonates with people. Yeah. People don't like it. Like, if you get your news from CNN Jesus Christ, how many fucking people are behind that thing? How many executives and producers and how much financial influence is involved and everything that gets on the air. How much incentive do the people that have that are saying those things, what, how are they being pushed? How are they being motivated by progressing their careers along these same path? What lines are they not willing to cross? What toes are they not willing to step on? What narratives are they, are they pushing you? Don't trust it. There's just too much nonsense.

4 (1h 5m 55s):
And also the way they talk, like the way those old Tommy, they had things to worry about more than just a caveman. Like, that's phony talk. Right. That's the, the modern phony talk is the phony talk of the people that are the broadcasters on M-S-N-B-C. That's modern, phony talk. People don't like that. It doesn't feel right to them. They like, when, when they talk to a guy like you, it's like, what did I found? I fucking sprayed water at the permafrost. Like, like, I found this I know, this is a guy who actually found it. I don't have to deal with an institution. I'm not dealing with a, a museum. I'm not dealing with a university. I'm not dealing with a board of investors. And you're dealing with one guy.

4 (1h 6m 36s):
Yep. That's what people like. Because the only thing that resonates with a human being that's listening to this on the other end.

3 (1h 6m 41s):
And I, I think what resonates with people about our Boneyard is that it's real time. This shit's going on real time. Real time. I'm not hiding anything. I'm not going, oh, well that, that bone there is only 190 years old, so I better put it away. So nobody knows. Right.

4 (1h 6m 57s):
Right. Exactly.

3 (1h 6m 58s):
I, when we found that, I'm going, holy shit. Yeah. It's in the bone zone, man. Yeah. This is ice age shit. That's

4 (1h 7m 5s):
What we thought.

3 (1h 7m 6s):
And then boom. No, it's 190 years. Okay, now we got a real problem. Yeah.

4 (1h 7m 11s):
Now it's even more interesting.

3 (1h 7m 12s):
It is. Yeah. And like I said, we don't sell 'em, we, how could you put a price on that?

4 (1h 7m 19s):
Right.

3 (1h 7m 20s):
Could you,

4 (1h 7m 21s):
Could you I mean is a million dollars for a Saber two tiger skull. You know? How much is it I mean? How many millions and millions and millions of dollars are all the bones, such as the A MNH has?

3 (1h 7m 36s):
Yeah.

4 (1h 7m 38s):
How many, how many I mean if you put 'em for up for auction? Hundreds

3 (1h 7m 42s):
Of hundreds of millions. Oh yeah.

4 (1h 7m 45s):
Lot of money. Yeah. Meanwhile, it's just on your Instagram.

3 (1h 7m 49s):
Yeah. By the way, that bone's yours.

4 (1h 7m 50s):
This is mine. Yeah. Thank you.

3 (1h 7m 52s):
I love it. I told I told you I was gonna fix that shit.

4 (1h 7m 54s):
Oh, well thank you very much.

3 (1h 7m 55s):
Now you got, you got a Spitzer bone. That's

4 (1h 7m 57s):
Pretty dope. I, I love it that it's actually the bone you see here, folks. The chunk has been sought off.

3 (1h 8m 3s):
That's what I took carbonated. Yeah, that's what I took. I I was a little aggressive on that. 'cause I wanna make sure they had enough material.

4 (1h 8m 10s):
I wonder what, what kind of a saw they had back then 200 years ago.

3 (1h 8m 16s):
It could have been a whip. So I, who knows? It could have been a little, little handheld.

4 (1h 8m 21s):
It's just so fascinating to think back to 200 years ago. The, the actual human sown through that. Yep. And then as it goes through time, frozen into the ground, pushed out with water, found by you cut and sent to get DNA tested and carbonated. And, and then it comes back to here.

3 (1h 8m 46s):
Boom. Where it belongs.

4 (1h 8m 49s):
It seems like it belongs here. It does. For whatever reason it

3 (1h 8m 51s):
Does belong here. Yeah.

4 (1h 8m 52s):
It'll sit right here. Yeah. Forever.

3 (1h 8m 55s):
You put your pens in there.

4 (1h 8m 56s):
That's not a bad idea. No.

3 (1h 8m 58s):
I mean they had pens back in the day with feathers. Make a

4 (1h 9m 0s):
Good asterisk.

3 (1h 9m 0s):
They wrote a constitution with that shit.

4 (1h 9m 3s):
Taps are gone. That sucker.

3 (1h 9m 5s):
There you go. We have some that aren't empty of the marrow, but we only sampled one so far. Mm. We might have to sample one or two more.

4 (1h 9m 15s):
How many things have you carbonated?

3 (1h 9m 18s):
That's the only one I've ever,

4 (1h 9m 20s):
The of the bones

3 (1h 9m 21s):
Of the 300,000 we found. That's the only one I ever carbonated. And we've had maybe 10 others carbonated by other people.

4 (1h 9m 28s):
And what is the oldest one that you found?

3 (1h 9m 30s):
40,000.

4 (1h 9m 31s):
40,000.

3 (1h 9m 32s):
That's off the, the most latest one and probably goes back farther than that. But 50,000 is about as reliable as you can get on Carbon 14.

4 (1h 9m 42s):
And what animal is it? That was 40,000 years old.

3 (1h 9m 45s):
Willie Mammoth. Mm. It was Mammoth Ivory.

4 (1h 9m 50s):
Hmm.

3 (1h 9m 51s):
So it went from 40,000 to our next oldest US was 22,000. There's a lot of thousands in between 'em. What happened then? Yeah. We're the people.

4 (1h 10m 2s):
Right. Well, you have found evidence of human beings. Right? What's that one bone that has a human face carved into it that you've Yeah, that

3 (1h 10m 12s):
One, that one there is was found on a tailing pile

4 (1h 10m 18s):
That looks a lot like the shroud of tur, by the way. Yeah. Doesn't it? That's

3 (1h 10m 22s):
Geez. Paleontologist told us that that was natural. That's

4 (1h 10m 25s):
The Virgin Mary and a grilled cheese sandwich. What paleontologist told you that's natural.

3 (1h 10m 29s):
Natural and I. Look. I go,

4 (1h 10m 31s):
What? Come cut. Cut the shit cheeks, nose, mouth, eyes.

3 (1h 10m 37s):
And I posted that Joe. And about half the comments were Jesus Christ learned how to take a picture. Would you?

4 (1h 10m 44s):
Yeah. Right.

3 (1h 10m 45s):
The only thing in focus is your better your pickup truck.

4 (1h 10m 47s):
That's true. But that's the problem with iPhones. Right. Or any kind of phone. Yeah.

3 (1h 10m 50s):
I mean, come on guys. Yeah. I'm a boner.

4 (1h 10m 54s):
Yeah. That does not look even remotely natural. That looks absolutely like a face that was carved into a bone. Yep. Why would they say that? That's natural. That's so silly. It is. It's so silly to say that because it just makes you look stupid. 'cause that might be natural under the craziest of circumstances. It might be natural that a symmetrical face with eyelids and eyebrows and cheeks and a nose and a mouth and I mean everything about it is carved.

3 (1h 11m 27s):
It almost looks like that. Shrouded Jesus. Yeah.

4 (1h 11m 30s):
That's what I'm saying.

3 (1h 11m 30s):
Almost the same face.

4 (1h 11m 32s):
Very similar. But the idea that that is natural is just fucking stupid. Yeah. Like, come on, come on. So stupid. Has that been carbonated? Nope. No.

3 (1h 11m 45s):
You see what I did to the one I gave you? A lot of people go, oh, you, you need to carbonate all your fossils. Okay. That 400 bucks a pop and I got 300,000. That's 1.2 million. I'm sorry. 120 million. You want me to spend

4 (1h 12m 1s):
Well also with that, maybe it's an old bone that someone carved thousands of years later. Could be. That's

3 (1h 12m 7s):
Possible. It was on top of a tailing pot. One at the Boneyard. Yeah. We have gravel and gravel pits and mines everywhere.

4 (1h 12m 15s):
How could paleontologists with a straight face say, if that's natural I mean? It might be under the craziest of circumstances. It might be natural. But the, if you had a bet, if you had a bet, everything you had, I'm going put it on red or put it on black. You know, like I'm putting it on. Someone had a fucking stone or a knife or whatever it was, and they carved that face. Yep. That looks carved as fuck.

3 (1h 12m 44s):
It looks like it to me. Yeah.

4 (1h 12m 46s):
I think it looks at to 99.9% of the population. Yeah. Other than people with a vested interest in it being natural. Yep. Yeah. For what reason? Just to, to push a narrative. Like why would you say that that's natural?

3 (1h 13m 1s):
No, I have with my friends at a and h, they, they said with witnesses, unfortunately for them, two of the uppity ups there said, the reason they don't want to give the bones back to me is they think I'm gonna sell 'em. Now let's, let's think about that for a second.

4 (1h 13m 20s):
That's so stupid. You have a hundred times more than that. Just sit in a fucking warehouse that you've never sold.

3 (1h 13m 28s):
And I met with the University of Alaska state Senate recently. Drew and I met with them and we said, we had this deal lined out 22 years ago. They were supposed to return everything in the basement to Alaska. We agreed to it. I funded it. I put money in the account to make that happen. Time goes by. Well, we can't because there's asbestos in the ceiling. Blah, blah. It has to be abated. Okay. Abate it. Let me know when you're done. I'll come get 'em. Well, we got sidetracked with 15 years at the Boneyard. 16 years. I said, nah, I better, that's unfinished business. I I need to go get those. In the meantime, they said, fuck this guy.

4 (1h 14m 9s):
Yeah.

3 (1h 14m 9s):
Fuck this dirt tramp. We're gonna keep 'em. He's just gonna sell 'em.

4 (1h 14m 13s):
How crazy. Let's, let's show the images of what you have that you haven't sold. Just so people understand how silly that is. 'cause you have photographs on the Instagram that show massive amounts of tusks and bones. And

3 (1h 14m 28s):
That's just one day right

4 (1h 14m 30s):
There. That's just one day. Yep. I mean. We'll go and scroll down because Show, show the warehouses, Jamie. 'cause he's got warehouses. What is that? The cave drawings. What is that? Scroll back up. That art.

3 (1h 14m 44s):
The one in the middle

4 (1h 14m 45s):
A little right above the guy with the guitar. Yeah.

3 (1h 14m 47s):
That was something that I saw online after I came out. and I said that we domesticated the Willy Mammoth. Somebody sent me that picture.

4 (1h 14m 55s):
It's a guy on top of a mammoth.

3 (1h 14m 57s):
Yeah. A guy on top of a mammoth.

4 (1h 14m 58s):
Whoa.

3 (1h 14m 60s):
And you know how your kids, you got a golden retriever. You know your kids take a brush and that dog de slays there and they comb the hair out of it. Yeah. Why wouldn't we do that with the Willy Mammoth? Well,

4 (1h 15m 11s):
Listen, we know people ride elephants. I wrote an elephant in Thailand. You can ride elephants and domesticate them. If you treat 'em right, they'll let you ride 'em. Yeah. The fossilized creature.

3 (1h 15m 24s):
The mummy. Yeah.

4 (1h 15m 25s):
What is that? Scroll down a little bit, Jamie. Down. It's right up here. Is it up there? No. You had it. It's, it's a little down further buddy. There it is. There it is. There it is. Yep. What is that little fella?

3 (1h 15m 38s):
Well, we don't know yet. We does

4 (1h 15m 40s):
It look like a rat or a

3 (1h 15m 42s):
Shrew? When Dick Mall was up there doing his research for that film, you know Dick Mall?

4 (1h 15m 51s):
Yeah. You talked about him before. Yeah. Yeah.

3 (1h 15m 54s):
I'm just waiting for you to say wasn't an unfortunate name.

4 (1h 15m 56s):
Yeah, it was an unfortunate name.

3 (1h 15m 59s):
He said, keep your eyes out for Arctic ground squirrel. And that, that's been a few years ago. This year. We just found that this year we've never found one before. and it was still frozen. So

4 (1h 16m 13s):
That looks like it could be a ground squirrel.

3 (1h 16m 15s):
Could be. And I've got other pictures of it where you can actually see the ribs. I mean. It is really unbelievable. Well preserved. I gave it to the museum up there. I said, here you guys, this is outta my league. You guys do the research. And they took it and they're still studying it, but it's, they've had it since July.

4 (1h 16m 36s):
Hmm. Scroll back up a little Jamie. A little down. Little down. Little down. What is that? To the right? That

3 (1h 16m 44s):
Yeah, that, that's a mammoth tooth that my buddy that carved those pipes.

4 (1h 16m 48s):
Oh, he carved that into the mammoth tooth? Yeah.

3 (1h 16m 50s):
Wow. That's cool. Couple faces. By the way, this is a good time for me to give you something that I got from him. Oh, you like it? Okay.

4 (1h 17m 7s):
What's that?

3 (1h 17m 8s):
That's a pipe.

4 (1h 17m 10s):
Oh wow. What is this made out of?

3 (1h 17m 13s):
Do you think it'll work?

4 (1h 17m 15s):
Yep.

3 (1h 17m 17s):
It's a ic.

4 (1h 17m 20s):
An usic? Yeah. What's that mean,

3 (1h 17m 22s):
Jamie? What's a IC

4 (1h 17m 23s):
Boxer? don don't know. Yeah. That one guy. The heavyweight champ.

3 (1h 17m 27s):
Oh oh

4 (1h 17m 28s):
S-I-K-O-O-S-I-K-O-O-S-I-K. Oh, it's a dick.

3 (1h 17m 34s):
Well, I can't believe Joe Room not put a walrus dick in his mouth. Not, that's not the first one we have.

4 (1h 17m 38s):
We've got another one in another room somewhere. Yeah. We have a what do we have Another walrus dick? Fossilized walrus bone I

3 (1h 17m 44s):
Know where it is. Anyways, that's

4 (1h 17m 47s):
So this is a walrus dick. Yeah.

3 (1h 17m 48s):
Well, not a big one.

4 (1h 17m 50s):
No.

3 (1h 17m 50s):
There's a broken one.

4 (1h 17m 52s):
Yeah. Which tends to happen with dick bones sometimes people get wild. Yeah.

3 (1h 17m 58s):
You never know what happens. Ooh. Sick. Yeah.

4 (1h 18m 0s):
Wow.

3 (1h 18m 0s):
They, anyways, he carved, he carved that up and I said, well, I'm gonna lemme give it to Joe. It's a good conversation starter.

4 (1h 18m 10s):
Yeah. What are they called again? There's a word for those bones other than usic. There's a word for fossilized. I, God, I forget what the word is. Steve. Ella told it to me when he gave it to me. Baum. Yeah, that's right. Balum. That's the technical term.

3 (1h 18m 37s):
How do you remove a raccoon? Balum. Is that what I just read? Yeah. Yeah.

4 (1h 18m 40s):
How do you remove it? It's very

3 (1h 18m 42s):
Greasy. From where?

4 (1h 18m 43s):
Raccoons,

3 (1h 18m 46s):
Yeah. Carefully.

4 (1h 18m 47s):
I guess

3 (1h 18m 48s):
There's a little bag for it. Thank you very much. Yes, sir.

4 (1h 18m 51s):
Pretty cool.

3 (1h 18m 52s):
Yeah. But we just been doing what we did when we saw you last time. I just

4 (1h 18m 59s):
Continuing,

3 (1h 19m 0s):
I I told you that, Hey man, I don't have a whole lot new to report on the, all the new bones we found, because we're finding so many different kind of things we've never found before. But when we moved the whole operation down to where we started, bought a new pump, started up that left, left limit. We're starting to find all kinds of shit. We're just trying to find, yeah. That's so new. But that's what's still in the basement.

4 (1h 19m 26s):
It's just nuts. The amount of stuff you have is just absolutely nuts.

3 (1h 19m 30s):
You know, when that guy wasn't looking, I grabbed a sample of that asbestos containing material over the, where the lights are. So

4 (1h 19m 35s):
This is in the A MNH. Yeah. This is all your stuff. Yep. That they think you're gonna sell if you get it outta there. Yeah. Which is hilarious.

3 (1h 19m 43s):
What's funny about that is, so what? It's my stuff, right? It came off patented ground. I can sell it if I want to.

4 (1h 19m 51s):
Yeah.

3 (1h 19m 52s):
But I don't need to. and don don't want to. I wanna study it. I wanna find out what happened. Why did all the animals go extinct? Right. The 65% of the megaphone at the same time. Right. Something big going on something big. And Pat Druckenmiller says the secrets are in the bones. They have diagnostic tools now that can tell what the animal was eaten and how many times it had sex, how far it traveled, how long it lived. Things that, we don't even know what the questions are yet. We just need the puzzle pieces back so it can be studied.

4 (1h 20m 23s):
What really fascinates me is the, the skull on your T-shirt.

3 (1h 20m 27s):
What skull?

4 (1h 20m 28s):
The one on your T-shirt.

3 (1h 20m 29s):
That one. Yeah.

4 (1h 20m 30s):
That one. I know finding some of those there. I know the, the problem with finding some of those there though, that would change everything in terms of like, who goes and who could look at it. Right? You want another one?

3 (1h 20m 44s):
Can you fill me up?

4 (1h 20m 45s):
Sure, I can. We can talk deeper. Right? That's the problem.

3 (1h 20m 51s):
I think. I think you called him the dude.

4 (1h 20m 53s):
Yeah. The dude. Yep. The problem with the dude is then it becomes archeology, right?

3 (1h 20m 60s):
Yeah. Dudes are archeology. Yeah.

4 (1h 21m 2s):
And dudes mean that the universities come and, or whoever governments come and

3 (1h 21m 9s):
Hypothetically, let's say you found a dude,

4 (1h 21m 12s):
Right?

3 (1h 21m 15s):
And hypothetically, let's say the university did come look at it, and hypothetically they said, okay, you need to go turn yourself into the troopers. Why? Because that's, those are human remains. So if somebody did find that they'd have to go to the troopers and fill out a report,

4 (1h 21m 36s):
Say, we found a dead body.

3 (1h 21m 37s):
They'd have to say, we found human remains. Right. And let's say the person taking the report said, let me get a homicide team out here to talk to you. And you, you hypothetically said that bone is older than everybody in this building. All their ancestors combined and going back a hundred generations. Well, we're not interested in that then. Get outta here. Well get outta here after the report's written. Hypothetically.

4 (1h 22m 7s):
Hypothetically. Yeah.

3 (1h 22m 9s):
So everything was okay.

4 (1h 22m 13s):
So if hypothetically completely, hypothetically, if they found a dude that's 40,000 years old, then shit gets wild.

3 (1h 22m 23s):
Sure could.

4 (1h 22m 24s):
Because if they found this dude in the same level of permafrost where you're finding wooly mammoths,

3 (1h 22m 32s):
Hypothetically, let's say it was 10 feet away from a wooly mammoth skull.

4 (1h 22m 36s):
Hypothetically.

3 (1h 22m 37s):
Hypothetically.

4 (1h 22m 38s):
Yeah.

8 (1h 22m 41s):
Wow.

3 (1h 22m 42s):
That would be very interesting. It

4 (1h 22m 44s):
Would be very

3 (1h 22m 44s):
Interesting. That's a really interesting hypothesis.

4 (1h 22m 47s):
Also, is it anatomically modern? Is it Dennis o You know those, the type of humans that they found in that cave in Russia. Completely different branch of humans.

3 (1h 23m 1s):
I don't know about that. Those, I haven't heard about those.

4 (1h 23m 4s):
Yeah. They found, I don't know how much they found, but they found bones that are from, I believe this was like, I wanna say 2007 ish, 2017. Some, somewhere around there. Real recently, they found this new branch of the, the human tree that's called the Dennis O. When did they find that? Jamie? They're find Jamie's gonna look it up. But they were in Russia. There's, there's many versions of human beings that coexisted, apparently. And homo sapiens were, the article

10 (1h 23m 42s):
From 2019 says, they recreated what it looks like from a

4 (1h 23m 45s):
Pinky bone. They found mm, first portrait of extinct ovn human relative created from pinky bone, DNA Wow. Ovn girl shown with dark hair, piercing eyes, and a broad face. So those was a completely different kind of human being. Not a neanderthal, not a homo sapien. Something different. More than a hundred thousand years ago, modern humans in Eurasia lived alongside Neanderthals and Dennis os two other hominins that have since gone extincts. While much is known about Neanderthals and how they lived, Dennis os have remained enigmatic because only a handful of bone fragments from the ancient group have ever been found. But now they have a good idea of how Dennis Oovs looked.

4 (1h 24m 27s):
And the study published Thursday in the journal cell scientists took DNA from a Dennis o pinky bone found in a Siberian cave in 2008. There it is. And used it to predict Dennis o anatomical features. I wonder how they did that. Jesus Christ. Yeah. Click that. 56 features that differ. What? Yeah. That's all they found. Oh, that's, that's all it is. Wow. That little tiny piece of bone. How much Dennis o bones have they found degraded? DNA molecules from a group of human relatives who went extinct tens of thousands of years ago, have been reassembled using a new technique, yielding a genetic code for the mysterious Dennis Os that meets the standard for modern humans.

4 (1h 25m 16s):
The findings are based on samples drawn from 40 milligrams of ground up bone from a Siberian girl's finger. They confirm what, imagine that. They can tell it's a girl too. They confirm what scientists saw in a mu How do they know what gender it is? Why are they misgendering? This poor Dennis o Scientists saw much less detailed genetic sequence they produced a couple years ago and addressed some of the deep questions surrounding the Dennis Os. But they also raised a few new questions, including a basic one. Just how old was the sample that they analyzed? Wow. Is that all they found? How much Google, how much, how much, how many bone fragments have they found from Dennis Os?

4 (1h 25m 56s):
Thank God for scientists. They got a jawbone. They got a jawbone. Pam Jawbone. Oh wow. Half a jaw bone. Oh wow.

11 (1h 26m 7s):
Hmm.

4 (1h 26m 8s):
In Tibet. Wow. Isn't they m it with Neanderthals? Wow. A hybrid bone reveals in live science. Click on that. What year was that? Where they figure that out? That was 2022. Wow. So they're finding, so from 2008 to 2022, they're finding more and more of these bones, closest known extinct relatives of modern humans with a thick brow. Neanderthals. And the mysterious Dennis Owens, a bone fragment from Ian Caves, per perhaps of a teenage girls, revealed the first known hybrid of these groups. A new study concludes the finding confirms in breeding that had only been hinted at in earlier genetic studies. Very amazing. Now, a, a number of now extinct human lineages not only lived alongside modern humans, but it even interbred with them leaving traces of their DNA and the modern human genome.

4 (1h 26m 57s):
These lineages included the stocky Neanderthals as well as the enigmatic Dennis Os known from only a few teeth and bones unearthed in the Denisova Cave. In the Altai mountains. Click on that now. Extinct human lineages. How many they have. Wow. They got a tooth.

11 (1h 27m 20s):
Wow.

4 (1h 27m 23s):
The, the scientists have just completed sequencing, sequencing the entire genome of a species scroll up. It was above it of a species of archaic humans called Denisovan. The fossils that consist of a finger bone and two molars from the extinct lineage. Hmm. Scientists don't know the precise age of the material found though. The estimated ranges between 30,000 and 80,000 years of age. Wow. So that would be 40,000 years ago or so, somewhere. Yeah. Somewhere along the same lines as the oldest shit you found in the Boneyard. Yep. Woo. Wild stuff.

3 (1h 28m 3s):
We have no idea the range that we find.

4 (1h 28m 6s):
Yeah.

3 (1h 28m 7s):
'cause we've only sampled a few of 'em. Well,

4 (1h 28m 9s):
That's what's really crazy is that the sheer amount of material that you guys have excavated is just a drop in the bucket of what's still there.

3 (1h 28m 23s):
You talked about the carbon.

4 (1h 28m 25s):
Yeah.

3 (1h 28m 27s):
We don't know how far it goes. We just know's there. Yeah. We know that in front of it. Downstream of it's decomposed bedrock. And decomposed bedrock in that area has gold in it. But it's very hard to recover the gold from, 'cause it's a clay and you can't fs it. Very good. But underneath, that's another layer of bedrock. Did something come in hot? Something came in hot. Something caused a lot of water to melt real quick. Sea levels rose. 400 feet worldwide.

4 (1h 29m 3s):
400 feet.

3 (1h 29m 4s):
We came from Jacksonville yesterday. The east coast from Jacksonville was 85 miles farther east. That was all dry land. Holy shit. And now it's worldwide. This happened. Yeah. Talk about climate change. You know, climate change is climate change. It's always gonna be a climate changing. Right. And I'm, I'm comfortable with that. You know, we, we say, oh, we're melting the climate. We're melting the world. We're doing all this shit. Don't worry about the world. World take care of itself. You know, we don't have to be assholes. We don't have to pollute it, but we should take some care of it. But now let's go, let's go electric vehicles all the time.

3 (1h 29m 47s):
Well, people are saying that don't realize how much more copper has to be mined. How much more lead has to be mined. You're using fossil fuels for all that. You're not gonna, you're not gonna get a D 11 dozer on, on batteries. You're just not, you gotta use fossil fuels.

4 (1h 30m 7s):
Yeah. And also the, the thing about this whole climate change argument is climate's never been stable. It's not like before humans, it was ever like flat. Like you could predict it every year. Oh, September 13th it's gonna be 75 degrees. Nope. It's never been, never ever. It's always been up and down. Yeah. It's a constant, constant changing environment on this planet. It, it exists within a range where biological life can survive. But have you ever seen those structures that they found under the ocean outside of Japan? No. Fascinating. It's called yuni. And they've tried to say that these things are natural naturally occurring.

4 (1h 30m 49s):
But Graham Hancock is dived with them and many other people as well. And there's right angles and there's portals, there's, there's all this stuff down there that just doesn't look at all like something that's natural. It looks like some ancient structure that was under the ocean a long, long, long time ago. Look, look at that. There's corridors and steps. They have no idea who made it. Why? It's just this immense structure that's underneath the ocean.

3 (1h 31m 21s):
Do they know how deep that is?

4 (1h 31m 24s):
I'm sure they do. It's 165 known structure of unknown origin. 85 feet underwater. The southern coast of Raq Islands in Japan.

3 (1h 31m 34s):
That would fit right in with the 400 foot.

4 (1h 31m 38s):
Yeah. Yeah. Fit right in with it. Yeah. I

3 (1h 31m 41s):
Mean, look at that thing. Yeah.

4 (1h 31m 43s):
It's insane. But what's what's really insane is the, the pathways and the, the corridors and these things that just don't seem to the right angles that exist everywhere. That just absolutely don't seem to be natural. They seem to be be carved. They seem, it seems to be something that someone made a long fucking time ago. Graham Hancock is absolutely convinced. He's like, when you, when you swim down there with those things, there's, there's no way. There's just no way. There's, there's no way that the, that wasn't created wild stuff. And who knows what it really looked like how many thousands of years ago before the water erosion, before whatever the impact did to it.

4 (1h 32m 30s):
You know,

3 (1h 32m 31s):
You know, if you, nowadays people want to get something done, they always put in the effects on the climate will benefit us from this study. You know, if we do this study Yeah. It's good for climate change. I know the guys that are cloning the wooly mammoth are saying, you know, they wanna bring 'em back and put 'em in Siberia to keep the permafrost from melting and it methane gas from escaping.

4 (1h 32m 59s):
Yeah.

3 (1h 32m 59s):
But for some reason, I have an idea that as soon as they get one out there on the, on the, on the steps, somebody's gonna come along and go, Hmm, I'm gonna shoot me a woolly mammo.

4 (1h 33m 12s):
Especially if you put 'em in Russia. Russia, yeah. Yeah.

3 (1h 33m 16s):
No, I, we've have,

4 (1h 33m 17s):
They got a steady population of them in Russia. Someone for sure is going to say, do you want to hunt the Moon mammoth? We can make this happen.

3 (1h 33m 26s):
We can make it happen.

4 (1h 33m 26s):
Alright. How much money do you have, my friend?

3 (1h 33m 30s):
There's never enough.

4 (1h 33m 31s):
Never enough.

3 (1h 33m 32s):
No I mean I, you know, we're, we're involved in the fossilized ivory market a little bit 'cause we find broken tusks and we make stuff out of it. And there's a very few American crafts people that use woolly mammoth ivory to manufacture stuff. And I know, last time we talked about it, you're going, eh, it might be kind, eh. But that's what we do. Right. And like I said, this is an adorable little hobby. That's what my wife calls it. But when I go to pay 400 bucks for a carbon 14 sample, that means that's a hundred gallons of fuel I didn't buy.

3 (1h 34m 11s):
So I kind of, I kind of go like this, eh.

4 (1h 34m 14s):
Right.

3 (1h 34m 14s):
I just soon buy the fuel. 'cause this little hobby pays for itself. You guys buy this and I'll buy fuel, put it in a pump and I'll go find more and da do and we'll just do that. Yeah. We'll make real, real nice things out of it. And this is a good time to give you this.

4 (1h 34m 32s):
She's got another gift.

3 (1h 34m 34s):
Oh yeah. My daughter

4 (1h 34m 34s):
Spoiling me buddy.

3 (1h 34m 36s):
My daughter Laura, Drew's wife out there. Laura Longley, last time I was here I told her, told you she's Sack fifth Avenue. She's beyond sex Fifth Avenue. She wanted to give you that.

4 (1h 34m 50s):
Hmm. Oh, it's a pendant

3 (1h 34m 57s):
On a silver chain. Oh

4 (1h 34m 59s):
Wow.

3 (1h 35m 0s):
She didn't know if you wear jewelry or not, but I said I'll give it to

4 (1h 35m 3s):
'em. I wear that. Hell, how old is that?

3 (1h 35m 7s):
It's old. Old.

4 (1h 35m 10s):
It's not gonna go around this fat head.

3 (1h 35m 14s):
And she also said, you know, Joe gets all the stuff I want to give something to his wife. So this is for your wife? Oh. Huh. IOR made that too.

4 (1h 35m 29s):
Oh cool. Another one. Yep. Wow.

3 (1h 35m 33s):
Little gold. There's a little tiny gold in the top. And

4 (1h 35m 36s):
How old do you think this is?

3 (1h 35m 38s):
30, 40,000 years. So

4 (1h 35m 44s):
Imagine if you could follow the timeline of the animal roaming around. Yeah.

3 (1h 35m 50s):
No, she's to

4 (1h 35m 51s):
Being converted into jewelry.

3 (1h 35m 54s):
Like I said last time she was sax fifth Avenue. But she's putting those guys to shame with this stuff. She finds the ivory, she finds the gold. She makes the stuff I

4 (1h 36m 4s):
Think she gave us from last time here.

3 (1h 36m 5s):
Oh, that's a nice one.

4 (1h 36m 6s):
Yeah. No one's gotten high off this yet.

3 (1h 36m 10s):
No, I bet that other one I sent you hasn't ever seen the seen a match either.

4 (1h 36m 14s):
I know. I wouldn't do that to it, but I'm sure you guys do sell them. I'm sure there's people out there

3 (1h 36m 20s):
Actually I,

4 (1h 36m 20s):
Who have gone into space smoking weed off of a mammoth bone.

3 (1h 36m 25s):
If I was an astronaut, I wouldn't even, if I didn't go into space, I'd do it. Now the other thing is, I had a guy call me. He goes, I love that Joe Rogan podcast. I wanna make him some pistol grips for a 1911.

4 (1h 36m 45s):
Oh.

3 (1h 36m 46s):
And I said, don don't know if he's got a 1911. He says, well gimme his address and I'll mail it to him. I said, I ain't gonna do that. I'm gonna see him. If you want me to give them to him, I'll give 'em to him. But I, I'm not giving out his address. He says, okay. So he sent me these ette Customs is the name of his operation.

4 (1h 37m 4s):
Check that out.

3 (1h 37m 5s):
Yeah, check 'em out.

4 (1h 37m 6s):
Wow. Oh wow. Look at that.

3 (1h 37m 20s):
Only mammoth. There's a little wrench in there for you to attach it to your 1911. I see.

4 (1h 37m 26s):
That's pretty badass.

3 (1h 37m 27s):
It is badass.

4 (1h 37m 31s):
Look at that. Yeah. Oh wow. So he sells 'em Mammoth Ivory, full size 1911 grips. Wow. That's beautiful. It's just crazy that there's so much of this stuff. Yeah. That you can make stuff off of it.

3 (1h 37m 45s):
It all starts with a broken for us a broken tooth or a broken piece of ivory.

4 (1h 37m 50s):
Wow.

8 (1h 37m 52s):
That's cool.

3 (1h 37m 53s):
Yeah. Yeah. Nice. And they're very functional.

4 (1h 37m 58s):
Yeah, no, I'd imagine. And and beautiful.

3 (1h 38m 2s):
Now this is for your, you got

4 (1h 38m 3s):
More stuff. Jesus Christ,

3 (1h 38m 4s):
Dude. Yeah. This is, this is for your kids.

4 (1h 38m 6s):
Okay.

3 (1h 38m 8s):
Just add sandpaper.

4 (1h 38m 9s):
Just add sandpaper. Yeah.

3 (1h 38m 11s):
They're little I ards. And you give him a piece of sandpaper and he sand it to a mirror finish. That's what you make. Stuff like what we make out of it. Oh, that's a raw, those are raw shards.

4 (1h 38m 24s):
Okay.

3 (1h 38m 25s):
And I'll

4 (1h 38m 26s):
Give it to him. Yeah.

3 (1h 38m 27s):
And last but not least, for you and Jamie,

4 (1h 38m 29s):
Another one.

3 (1h 38m 31s):
You each get one of these little packets.

4 (1h 38m 33s):
Okay.

3 (1h 38m 34s):
Now I know that he plays golf.

4 (1h 38m 37s):
Golf.

3 (1h 38m 38s):
I don't know if you play

4 (1h 38m 38s):
Golf. No, I don't. I'm scared of

3 (1h 38m 40s):
Golf. Well, You don't have to steal the ball ball marker from you. But I made you a ball marker. Awesome. Thank you. You're welcome. And Joe too. And there's a guitar pick in each one of those too. Oh

4 (1h 38m 49s):
Wow. Yeah. I've got the guitar picks for Gary Clark Jr. Oh, nice. Ball marker. And guitar pick. Alright Jamie. Time to play golf. No, you need to mark your ball. I don't have the time. Ah, we could try. I'm scared of golf.

3 (1h 39m 4s):
I've never played a game of golf. Golf

4 (1h 39m 6s):
Absorbs your time.

3 (1h 39m 7s):
It scares me too. Let's play

4 (1h 39m 8s):
Nine holes. Yeah. The nine holes leads to me being a fucking golf junkie. Nine holes half the time. Tony Hinchcliffe and you and Ron White out there playing every day. Imagine the

3 (1h 39m 16s):
Foursome. That'd be a

4 (1h 39m 17s):
Great time. It would be a good time. See I said I'll go with you guys and get, it's all, it's about just get drunk. Have

3 (1h 39m 21s):
A great time. That's all Laura's stuff.

4 (1h 39m 22s):
I'll do that. All right. Tough. Nice. Wow. Beautiful. Incredible. Yep. It is amazing that you could, there's so much stuff that you could make things make jewelry and make pistol grips. And

3 (1h 39m 40s):
Like I told you, drew and I are, we're, we're the Dollar General. I told you that last year. But I think we got a meeting with Family Dollar coming up next week.

4 (1h 39m 50s):
Yeah,

3 (1h 39m 51s):
No, I'm just bullshitting you. We, we, we just enjoy working with it. It's a really cool material to work with. 'cause you take a piece, Joe and you look at it and go, what can I make out of that? It might take a week or two to figure it out.

4 (1h 40m 6s):
I have a pool cue that has a Mammoth Ivory joint and a mammoth ivory butt cap that my friend Eric Crisp of Sugartree Cues makes.

3 (1h 40m 17s):
Oh cool.

4 (1h 40m 18s):
Yeah. He's from Alaska and he has Mammoth Ivory that he puts inside pool cues. And it's, it's beautiful. It's got like a very, see if you could Google Sugar tree q with Mammoth Ivory joint. 'cause I know he's made a few of these, you know, he doesn't have a lot of the material, but he's made a few and absolutely beautiful.

3 (1h 40m 40s):
We, we've had people contact us about that and I'm, I'm going, Hey man, I know how to do it. You know, I can't make pool cue stuff, but I have the raw ivory. If you need a little bit to work, do it. You know? Yeah. You can do it.

4 (1h 40m 54s):
Well, I'll connect you with him. Alright. I, yeah. He's the man. He, he makes some of the most beautiful pool cues in the world. And he's an interesting guy. Kind of like yourself. He doesn't give a fuck. He makes him when he wants to. Yep. Sells him if he wants to. Yep. I, I can't give him money. Just keeps giving me cues. Never, never been able to give him money for 'em. I'm like, you gotta, you gotta take some money. Yeah. He won't take any money. No,

3 (1h 41m 18s):
Don don't. I

4 (1h 41m 18s):
Don't blame him. He'll sell 'em to other people. Yeah. But have you found one that has a Mammoth Ivory? I've found people talking about it

3 (1h 41m 26s):
For

4 (1h 41m 26s):
Sure. No images, don don't think, I

3 (1h 41m 27s):
Don't know if this is

4 (1h 41m 28s):
Actually his or Yeah, that's hiss a hundred percent his, I could tell by the ring work. So that's, that's just not coming up here. That's Mammoth Ivory joint. That, that might actually be my cue because it looks real similar. So he puts that mammoth ivory scroll. Scroll down a little bit, Jamie. So scroll down. That one right there in the middle, right? Yeah. Click on that. Yeah, I think it's the same picture. That's exactly what it looks like. Yeah. Wow. It's not clear don don't know why it's not wasn clear. Ah, it's probably someone with a fucking Android phone or some shit from the early two thousands. Yeah. That's what it looks like. It's beautiful.

3 (1h 41m 59s):
Yeah. That's what you start with. Those little shards

4 (1h 42m 4s):
That's just, it's just so crazy that there's so much of that stuff that you could actually make things out of it.

3 (1h 42m 9s):
Yeah. No, it's

4 (1h 42m 11s):
Something happened

3 (1h 42m 13s):
Something big time.

4 (1h 42m 14s):
Something big time happened. Yeah.

3 (1h 42m 16s):
Nobody knows.

4 (1h 42m 17s):
But it's crazy that this particular subject of the mass extinction event, which is related to Atlantis, which is related to the melting of the polar ice caps that led to some sort of a mass extinction event in North America. That all this stuff is connected and one of the big pieces of the puzzle is your property. Yep. And maybe one of the biggest pieces that's ever been discovered.

3 (1h 42m 45s):
I think so. And if I can get the other stuff back. Well, you saw the video, all that stuff probably got dumped in East River. You know, they, eh, it's a mammoth leg bone, but it's broken at the, at the end and we don't want it, it's not museum quality to throw it away. Right. And so a lot of that stake, they say in a report, mistakes made in the field. Well, those are your people. Those are, those are your employees that made those mistakes. Don't blame it on my company guys.

4 (1h 43m 11s):
Is it mistakes made in the field? Meaning that the bones got damaged,

3 (1h 43m 14s):
Means they didn't document where they came from. Oh, I see. And and the paleontologists, if they don't know exactly what level of soil, where it came from, they, they want all that stuff. And if they don't know that stuff, it's got no scientific value. None. And so the stuff they sent back, none of it, maybe a couple pieces have scientific value. They weren't supposed to take that. And they know it. And that's why they don't wanna return it because it, it is quite valuable.

4 (1h 43m 44s):
Which

3 (1h 43m 45s):
Is so crazy when you saw that film, 12 tons in one year. Yeah. They did it for 1928 to 1958.

4 (1h 43m 52s):
That's nuts.

3 (1h 43m 53s):
That's a lot of tusks. And they talk about hundreds and hundreds of 'em shipped there. I've seen 'em I mean I saw 'em and when I met with the head guy, I said, I want 'em all back. I want all the bones back. And he said to himself, who is this fucking guy? Mm. Get him outta my office. Next time he shows up, make him stand in the rain. Which we did. It's not like I'm afraid of getting wet or dirty.

4 (1h 44m 19s):
Jamie, see if you could find the photo from the Boneyard Instagram page that shows that carbon layer. I've been

9 (1h 44m 26s):
Looking for it the whole time. don don't know why I can't find it. I kind of know what it looks like. But do

4 (1h 44m 30s):
You know how far back it is?

3 (1h 44m 32s):
I'll find it real quick.

4 (1h 44m 34s):
Do you know, is it old? Like how, when did you post it?

3 (1h 44m 39s):
Oh, it's been a few years.

4 (1h 44m 41s):
Okay. So it's probably you post quite a bit. So it's probably pretty far back in there.

3 (1h 44m 46s):
I've reposted it a few times.

4 (1h 44m 50s):
That's the big P. What's that

9 (1h 44m 51s):
Jen? I said I found a few that looked like it. I just couldn't tell the description wasn't saying like this is the carbon layer or anything.

4 (1h 44m 56s):
How far back was the ones that you found

3 (1h 44m 59s):
Back

9 (1h 45m 0s):
To? Right when he was on the far first time. So I'm back in the bone rush

4 (1h 45m 5s):
Last year. How thick is that carbon layer?

3 (1h 45m 8s):
You know the picture you pulled up with the guy riding the mammoth? There's a picture right next to it showing it.

4 (1h 45m 14s):
Oh, okay. You'll find that. Oh there it is. Okay.

3 (1h 45m 18s):
And there's the picture of the guy. Right.

4 (1h 45m 20s):
So it's right next to it.

9 (1h 45m 26s):
Not that.

4 (1h 45m 27s):
Oh, right above. Right there. Right here. No, right there. Yep. That that this, that's the carbon layer. Oh. So here it is. It says something came in hot, this burnt gravel laying on top of burnt bedrock 80 feet below the surface topography at the Boneyard. Tell me it's not natural. It's the most natural thing in the solar system. Of course. It's natural. Right. That's something came in boom and burned everything. And it's 80 feet down in the permafrost. I wonder if they did a core sample. What, what they would find. Imagine if they did that and they said 11,800 years.

4 (1h 46m 9s):
I bet I'd be willing to bet. Bet that's it. It totally makes sense.

3 (1h 46m 17s):
Oh, the short face bear. That jaw only just saw. No, those are badass and they're extinct.

4 (1h 46m 24s):
Oh yeah. I mean that animal was, they think that might have been one of the animals that kept people from crossing that bearing land bridge. That it was just such a fucking monstrous predator. Far bigger than a polar bear. Oh, an immense, immense predator. Like the biggest bear ever. Yeah. That existed and went extinct along with all the other megafauna. 65% of the North American megafauna instantaneously existed. That's one of the reasons why we have weird stuff here. Like, like pronghorn antelope. Like why are they so fast? Well, they were so fast. 'cause there was a North American cheetah that lived here. Wow.

3 (1h 47m 2s):
Yeah. Which was faster. Yeah.

4 (1h 47m 4s):
So they, we had a North American lion that lived here back then that was bigger than the African lion.

3 (1h 47m 11s):
And we have those up north. We found one. Really? We found more than one the American lion. Really? Oh yeah. The skull that you see sticking outta the muck bench. That's what Dick Mo calls the American Lion. Wow. And, and when we were going through just some bones I had on a pallet and he goes, oh, do you know what that is? I said, no, that's a lion scapula. and I told him we got a bunch of those. Really? Yeah. We, and we, we do. We got a bunch of those.

4 (1h 47m 37s):
So was there supposed to be a North American lion as far as the,

3 (1h 47m 41s):
The skull I have they say is the best one of the four that have been found.

4 (1h 47m 47s):
Wow.

3 (1h 47m 47s):
And some guy offered me 85 grand for it. and I said, ah, there's a door

4 (1h 47m 54s):
That's not enough fella.

3 (1h 47m 55s):
That ain't, we don't sell this shit.

4 (1h 47m 57s):
Yeah. Al also like that's a historically important piece of bone. That's a very important piece. Yep. And to think that again, you have just, that's a drop in the bucket. I shouldn't say a drop in the bucket. That's a drop in the fucking Olympic swimming pool that you have up there. Yep. I mean I mean if someone made a full scale excavation, just really went all in to see what the fuck is going on up here. God, that would be amazing.

3 (1h 48m 31s):
The problem is that it scares 'em. It's a scary site. 'cause we're not talking about dirt and rocks. We're talking about melting ice. And you get over next to that muck bench and you look up 60 feet and up there there's trees and there's bold, not boulders, but big chunks of ice that can fall. And so we we're real careful with, with our guys. Don't go under there.

4 (1h 48m 57s):
Oh, have you had any kind of collapses before?

3 (1h 49m 1s):
Oh yeah. Yeah. We had a, we had a piece of ice we knew was gonna collapse and we kept working on it to make it happen quicker by undercutting it with the giant. and it was,

4 (1h 49m 12s):
When you say the giant, you're talking about the water sprayer, right?

3 (1h 49m 14s):
Yeah. and it collapsed two days after we shut the pumps off. We knew it was gonna go. We said, okay, stay out. That was five stories tall. The piece that broke off. Wow. It took us a whole summer to get rid of it with the giant, but within that thing was about half a dozen tusks.

4 (1h 49m 32s):
Wow.

3 (1h 49m 32s):
So we just sprayed it and sprayed it and come back and get a tusk. And we restore the tusks. If they're not broken, we fix 'em. We got a bunch of 'em restored a bunch.

4 (1h 49m 45s):
It's just so nuts that there's this one area that has so much,

3 (1h 49m 49s):
Not five acres either. 2.1 Albert

4 (1h 49m 53s):
I mean 2.1 is like a, a really big backyard for a nice suburban house. Yeah.

3 (1h 50m 1s):
And, and I, think I mentioned to you, it goes all the way. It goes downstream where there is a creek that's a mile long and that creek is gonna, when we ever, if we ever get to it someday somebody will get to it. Maybe Drew and Allure or my, my other kids might get to it. Their grand, my grandkids.

4 (1h 50m 19s):
So here's the area and this is showing the giant inaction Yeah. As it's spraying.

3 (1h 50m 25s):
Yep.

4 (1h 50m 25s):
And so do you just spray for a specific amount of time and then just start looking at what's been uncovered? Or do you like look at it while it's doing it?

3 (1h 50m 34s):
Sometimes we'll hang out. If we see something coming up, we'll aim it. But a lot of times that one's an automatic giant, it'll sweep by itself. You turn the pumps on and it just goes back and forth.

4 (1h 50m 45s):
And then you come back and just start looking around. Wow.

3 (1h 50m 49s):
It's like looking for Easter eggs.

4 (1h 50m 50s):
It's not I mean, it seems to me insane that no one's contacted you that doesn't want to do some sort of a collaboration with you and do some massively funded expedition where

3 (1h 51m 4s):
They, it's gonna take massive amounts of money. and I don't, I'm not opposed to having 'em do that, but generally speaking, what I get is some guy goes, Hey, I'd, I'd like a mammoth test.

4 (1h 51m 13s):
What's that, Jamie?

9 (1h 51m 14s):
It's ice, right? It's like ice. Just like,

3 (1h 51m 18s):
What is that coming outta the

9 (1h 51m 19s):
Dirt. It doesn't say what it is.

4 (1h 51m 20s):
It's just to see a lot of ice age cool stuff emerge from the frozen

3 (1h 51m 23s):
Muck. Yeah. We, 'cause we don't know what that is.

9 (1h 51m 27s):
Or it's just shiny black. Can't tell.

4 (1h 51m 30s):
Huh?

9 (1h 51m 31s):
Reflect in

3 (1h 51m 31s):
The sky. But the stuff, the little things on the side. The micros, we, we've spent a lot of time looking for tips, spear tips. Have

4 (1h 51m 40s):
You found them? Yeah. Yeah.

3 (1h 51m 42s):
We found one mammoth hip bone with a spear tip still sticking in it. Really? And I've got that one posted little video thing.

4 (1h 51m 50s):
Ooh, find that Jamie. That's wild.

3 (1h 51m 53s):
Yeah, it is wild.

4 (1h 51m 54s):
How, how old is that?

3 (1h 51m 56s):
Gotta be tens of thousands.

4 (1h 51m 59s):
There's gotta be some people in there. You might have like a full Dennis O in there.

3 (1h 52m 9s):
I found things that I thought,

4 (1h 52m 11s):
Oh, there's a tip.

3 (1h 52m 12s):
Yeah. Now they're gonna tell me that tip went through the fur and the hide and hit a vital organ in a mammoth. And,

4 (1h 52m 20s):
But if you found one in a mammoth hip bone, it has to, you don't think

3 (1h 52m 23s):
We found a tip? We found a tip

4 (1h 52m 25s):
In a mammoth hip bone. Yeah. But don't you think that they hunted those things? Especially if they're above them. Like if you were above them on a cliff or something like that. Well there's, you could sneak up and throw spears down.

3 (1h 52m 37s):
They could've don don't know. I

4 (1h 52m 39s):
Mean they did it with elephants. I know people hunt elephants with bow and arrows. They, they, there's a video of people hunting them with traditional bows. Like long bows. Yep. From like the 19 hundreds, early 19 hundreds.

3 (1h 52m 54s):
But remember the step had no trees. Mm. No wood saw grasslands. And so the browsers, you know, the willy mammoth, the caribou, the step bisons, they ate grass and the moose came in later, the browsers. And there was no wood to fasa spear out of really to speak of. It was all, it was all grass. So I'm thinking they kind of might have moved through a little bit and got a little bit farther south. Maybe they went somewhere else that was on the limits that was emerging into uplands.

4 (1h 53m 35s):
So maybe some nomadic people traveled with spears they had gotten from somewhere else and they made it to your place. 'cause that's where the mammoths were.

3 (1h 53m 46s):
The carnivores had a field day up there. 'cause short face bears, the cave lions, they had all kinds of stuff to eat cave bears. Oh yeah. Yeah. They were, they were eating good. And that was for thousands of years they did that. And they got along. You know that balance is there. We have 'em right now with wolves. You know, you'll have a year with a lot of wolves and then you'll have a, you know, they'll kill everything. All the moose. Then you'll have a few years with the wolves disappear 'cause there's nothing to eat. And then the moose come back and then the wolves come back and it's just, it's time.

4 (1h 54m 23s):
Constant cycle.

3 (1h 54m 24s):
Constant cycle. Yeah. I've got a creek now with two packs of wolves on it. The one I invited you to go hunting on, there won't be a moose left on that creek, don don't think this summer.

4 (1h 54m 35s):
Probably not. No. Yeah,

3 (1h 54m 37s):
I'll put you on different creek.

4 (1h 54m 38s):
They're a fascinating animal. Yeah, they're, they just, they just, we just showed yesterday. They, they reintroduced him to Colorado recently. Good luck guys.

3 (1h 54m 47s):
I don't think the people in Colorado understand what just happened. No,

4 (1h 54m 50s):
No. They have no idea. They did. Fucking city dwellers think wolves are amazing. They're so beautiful. Why'd they go extinct

3 (1h 55m 0s):
And I have that video of a little young wolf that's right by our road. You know, we're driving down to look at a cut and he's just sitting there looking at us like, Hey, what's up? And he's howling and he can hear another one in the background howling. They show up out at the pony yard going time to eat.

4 (1h 55m 21s):
Oh,

3 (1h 55m 21s):
Right. Oh yeah. They smell that rotten flesh and

4 (1h 55m 24s):
I'm sure, right.

3 (1h 55m 25s):
Oh, the stench of that is you can't avoid it.

4 (1h 55m 28s):
How bad does it smell when you start excavating?

3 (1h 55m 31s):
It's the kind of stench that you'll never forget, but you'll never smell it anywhere else.

4 (1h 55m 35s):
Mm.

3 (1h 55m 36s):
So the invite is still open for you to come up there.

4 (1h 55m 39s):
I need to make it my way out there. If I do, I wanna bring Randall do

3 (1h 55m 42s):
It. Yeah. But here's the other caveat to that. Okay. We built our new building. We put 2 18 85 Brunswick pool tables in there and it got 'em restored.

4 (1h 55m 55s):
I saw,

3 (1h 55m 56s):
And I told Drew, I said, you're welcome to play on it. But I ain't playing until Joe. Rogan plays on it with me. And as soon as you queue it up and rack it I'm gonna run out the door and leave. Okay. I'm not a very good pool player.

4 (1h 56m 10s):
Well, that's why I'm scared of golf. 'cause I am a good pool player. I

3 (1h 56m 14s):
Know you're a good and it takes I know you're a good pool player.

4 (1h 56m 16s):
But that's what it, what it takes to play good pool. It's just massive amounts of time that I don't have. Yeah.

3 (1h 56m 22s):
That's practice,

4 (1h 56m 22s):
Man. I already have one thing that sucks my time. And if I was living where you are, I probably, my, my time would be spent spraying, spraying water.

3 (1h 56m 30s):
We're trying to figure out a way to do it while we don't have to be there. You know? Put the auto giant up there.

4 (1h 56m 36s):
Did you get a bunch of people that reached out to you after the podcast? They wanted to volunteer to help and, yeah,

3 (1h 56m 41s):
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But I can't do it. You know, they

4 (1h 56m 46s):
Too many weirdos.

3 (1h 56m 47s):
Look, dude, you talking about you two? Yeah. It's me and Drew.

4 (1h 56m 51s):
Yeah.

3 (1h 56m 52s):
And when it's all hands on deck, when something is happening, like the day, then it's all hands on deck. And that day we pulled out a whole wooly mammoth and a half. Wow. In one day.

4 (1h 57m 5s):
A whole wooly

3 (1h 57m 6s):
Mammoth and a half

4 (1h 57m 7s):
And

3 (1h 57m 7s):
A half. And we got the other half the next day.

4 (1h 57m 10s):
Have you thought about putting that thing together? Oh

3 (1h 57m 12s):
Yeah. Yeah. We got it all.

4 (1h 57m 15s):
Like museum style. don don't want that. Piecing it together,

3 (1h 57m 17s):
We'll put it together and put it in our building.

4 (1h 57m 20s):
How do they do that?

3 (1h 57m 21s):
They,

4 (1h 57m 22s):
They use like metal to connect the bones and

3 (1h 57m 25s):
The ones, the one, the museum I saw in the Yukon, they use a metal frame and they attach it somehow to that. But I've seen them, I've seen these wooly mammoth replicas that they have of the skeletons and you see the tusk going out and I'm looking and there's nothing supporting those tusk. Those are made out of foam.

4 (1h 57m 45s):
Oh.

3 (1h 57m 46s):
You can't hold a 250 pound tusk in a skull without it just breaking. You gotta have something underneath it to support

4 (1h 57m 54s):
It. Oh, so those are replicas.

3 (1h 57m 56s):
Oh yeah. Most of 'em are just all foam.

4 (1h 57m 58s):
Well, that's the thing about the dinosaurs. Right. They'll have some pieces and then they, the rest of it is just kind of bullshit. It's just what they know it looked like in the, the dimensions that it would be based on the shape of whatever bones they do have.

3 (1h 58m 11s):
Yeah. Yeah. And they, we have all the bones, we have whole herds of those things.

4 (1h 58m 17s):
Wow.

3 (1h 58m 18s):
And it just a matter, that thing that we invented called time. Yeah. Yeah. My time's better spent doing, collecting it than it is to trying to put it together. It's

4 (1h 58m 26s):
Just amazing that there's this one spot in Alaska and it really makes you think, how many spots are like that somewhere else that just have not been explored.

3 (1h 58m 36s):
Well, I told you last time that that guy, Chuck says there's 10,000 of those dead animals on my property. Willie Mammoth.

4 (1h 58m 45s):
10,000.

3 (1h 58m 46s):
10,000.

4 (1h 58m 47s):
That's the estimate.

3 (1h 58m 48s):
Yeah. He's the carver and he's dealt more Willie mammoth bones and tusk than anybody I know probably in the world.

4 (1h 58m 59s):
It just makes you really wanna imagine what the scene was like when it all went down. What the scene was like, sh boom

3 (1h 59m 10s):
Boom.

4 (1h 59m 11s):
When they all just died all at once.

3 (1h 59m 14s):
Yeah. And all at once. Might've been 500 years, right? Might've been a thousand years. Right. But faster than they could, you know, adapt to it. Yeah. So, and you know, all the silt and all the shit that covers the ground there, that's left over from the melting glaciers. The glaciers melted and the wind came in and blew all that stuff deposit itself on the gravels. And the, that's why in gold mining, you gotta strip that shit off to get down to the gravel and the bedrock, you know, that's all covering it.

4 (1h 59m 46s):
Have you paid attention to any of Randall Carlson's work? Little bit. Little bit. He thinks it all happened very quickly.

3 (1h 59m 52s):
I think he's right. Yeah, I

4 (1h 59m 53s):
Think he's right too.

3 (1h 59m 54s):
But I think there's another one in there earlier.

4 (1h 59m 57s):
Mm. I bet

3 (1h 59m 59s):
By about 20,000 years maybe.

4 (2h 0m 1s):
Completely makes sense. Yeah. I mean, if you go 20,000 years ago from US I mean, look, we think about the pyramids and we think about Egypt and we, we really don't know when they made those. But Robert Shock, who's the guy who was the geologist from Boston University who did the work on the Sphinx and the temple, the Sphinx, and found water erosion that indicates thousands of years of rainfall after they carved that thing, after they carved that area out, he's like, this is thousands of years of rainfall. And the last time there was like, rainfall in the Nile Valley was more than 9,000 years ago.

4 (2h 0m 41s):
So you have 9,000 years ago, and then you have thousands of years before that. So now you're in that area. Now you're in 12,000 years ago, 13, 14. Who knows? There's also speculation as to when the, these hinx, which used to have the head of a lion before they carved it and made it an, an Egyptian head. And they think that because the, the head of the hinx is much smaller than the rest of the body, it's also has much less erosion. And then they go back to, okay, at what point in time was this thing pointed towards the constellation Leo? Right. And now, now you're at 30,000 years ago. Yep. And they think that might've been when these people had made this

3 (2h 1m 21s):
Thing. And I've heard you talk about the pyramids and the engineering that went into it. And how did you, how do you move a block like that? 500 miles?

4 (2h 1m 28s):
Yeah. Insane.

3 (2h 1m 29s):
So, so well intricately cut. You can't even put a razor blade between the fits. Yeah.

4 (2h 1m 35s):
Amazing.

3 (2h 1m 36s):
You can't do that now.

4 (2h 1m 37s):
Well, 2 million, 300,000 stones the way between like two and 80 tons perfectly placed the true north, south, east, and west, they align with constellations. You have these shafts that align to certain star patterns. And it's like, who, what was going down in Egypt?

3 (2h 1m 57s):
I gotta think Elon Musk has come back. He might've been there.

4 (2h 2m 4s):
Well, I I bet there was millions of Elon Musk back then. Who knows? I mean? I, I really firmly believe that we are sort of a re-imagining of human civilization. And that human civilization, as it were when they did construct the pyramids, was probably more advanced than we are today. In a different way.

3 (2h 2m 26s):
Yeah.

4 (2h 2m 26s):
And this is what Graham thinks. This is what Randall thinks. And a lot of these people think that whatever technology they had, whatever, you know, so far undiscovered technology, we don't really know how they carved that stuff. We don't know what methods they used. You know, because modern conventional thinking is that they only had copper, they didn't even have steel. Hmm. So how the fuck are they doing that? There's also these drill marks that these cores that have been cord out that seem to indicate diamond drills, diamond bit drills moving at insane rates of speed that have cord out sections of stone. Like who the fuck did that?

4 (2h 3m 6s):
Who, how, where, why, when, even if it really is 2,500 bc what the fuck did you use? What did you use? How'd you do that? Yeah. It's probably not 2,500 years ago. 'cause that's just based on organic matter. It's also based on, they find like little pieces of organic matter that they can carbon date. That there's no real proof that that wasn't done. That they didn't sort of like resurface things or re-fix things or try to update things. There's also the hieroglyphs, which is really fascinating. 'cause the hieroglyphs, they accept the hieroglyphs up to a certain point. And then when the hieroglyphs go back and they indicate kings that existed 30,000, 40,000 years ago, they're like, oh, that's just myth.

4 (2h 3m 55s):
Like says, who says, who says you? Because you've, you've written books on this and you've taught lectures and been, you know, you, you've, you've based your life work on this timeline. Is that why you think that old stuff is myth? Because you don't You don't think the new, you don't think ramsey's is myth. You don't think that tooton common is myth. You don't think that all those other things are myth. Why do you think it's myth when it gets back 30, 40,000 years ago? I bet that's not myth. I bet whatever was going on back then 30, 40,000 years ago,

3 (2h 4m 27s):
The real

4 (2h 4m 27s):
Deal, those people were probably insanely advanced in a completely different direction than, than we have gone today. and I think that if you wiped us out and left a few nomadic tribes of people and they repopulated the earth over the next 20,000 years, we'll probably figure out some completely new direction of technology. Yep. You know, I think people get on a path, they innovate on that path and then everybody sort of chips in on all the different inventions that have been previously established and they make 'em better and they refine them and make new versions of them and make better stuff. And then it keeps going and going and going and whatever direction some ever Genius heads in and some, there was probably some fucking insane geniuses 30, 40,000 years ago that figured out some stuff that we haven't figured out yet.

4 (2h 5m 18s):
And they probably were more advanced in that direction than we are today.

3 (2h 5m 22s):
We can't even tell what happened in the case of that Spitzer there, what happened 200 years ago? Right?

4 (2h 5m 29s):
Who are those folks?

3 (2h 5m 31s):
Who the fuck did that? Right. And why?

4 (2h 5m 34s):
Well do they think people were living there 200 years

3 (2h 5m 37s):
Ago? Nobody thinks nothing about nothing because Fairbanks wasn't there. Fairbanks wasn't discovered till 1902.

4 (2h 5m 48s):
So they have no idea.

3 (2h 5m 50s):
Eight or eight or 12% of the carbon dating. You know, they, they say that they spread out a a long timeline. 12% I think came in around 1600. Late 16 hundreds for that. Then it's under the 17 hundreds. There's more than the early 18 hundreds. And then pretty soon they have a Okay. 95% certainty that's 190 years old or something like that. But we can't even tell why, who, what, where, when. Right. 200 years ago. Yeah. Gimme 2000. Well we got Jesus over there with the, the shroud.

3 (2h 6m 30s):
Right. Somebody 500 years ago said, I'm gonna make some money on this. Right. I'm gonna get me some tourism bus business

4 (2h 6m 39s):
Now go 2000 years before that and then 2000 years before that, like, we have no evidence. You have the burning of the library of Alexandria. All the records are destroyed

3 (2h 6m 49s):
Then go 20,000 years before that might as well Oh really get going here.

4 (2h 6m 53s):
Well that's what's really crazy is that they find older stuff in Egypt that's buried under newer construction. So they build temples on top of older temples and then as they excavate the sand, they find different construction methods that seem to indicate different ages. They do d things differently back then. And as they get deeper, the things seem to be more sophisticated, more difficult to make. Yeah.

3 (2h 7m 16s):
Look at Austin. Tell me, that's not gonna happen here in 1500 years. Right? Or any city in the country. Yeah. You know, it's, but we're only here for like, eh, maybe a hundred. If we're lucky.

4 (2h 7m 30s):
If we're lucky.

3 (2h 7m 31s):
I'm thinking a hundred. You maybe not be that lucky. Maybe 80 is better.

4 (2h 7m 37s):
Depends with modern science, I mean they think that we're gonna be able to live to be 150 and, and thrive.

3 (2h 7m 44s):
I'm gonna get me a clone going.

4 (2h 7m 46s):
Yeah. Just download your brain into the clone. Imagine a 20-year-old John with the brain of you now all spry and young. Oh,

3 (2h 7m 57s):
You know, as I can tell Drew, drew, I'm gonna run over the 9 66. I'm gonna scam, run up the ladder and then I'm gonna run that some bitch. But we translated into that. I drew, I'm gonna shuffle over to that machine over there. Can you lift me up with the loader to get inside it? Right. You know, it's just, I had one shoulder out last year. I couldn't pull myself up a ladder and I go rotator cuff gone.

4 (2h 8m 26s):
Can I get you some stem cells?

3 (2h 8m 30s):
I just need a new me.

4 (2h 8m 31s):
Well, we

3 (2h 8m 32s):
Gotta clone me.

4 (2h 8m 33s):
We also need to take care of the me that you got right now.

3 (2h 8m 36s):
Yeah. I'm gonna be around a while.

4 (2h 8m 38s):
How long are you planning another?

3 (2h 8m 40s):
15, 20 years.

4 (2h 8m 41s):
That's it.

3 (2h 8m 42s):
Yeah.

4 (2h 8m 44s):
If you do, if you wanted to plan your life out, what would you want to happen with the Boneyard over the next 15 to 20 years? What's ideal for you? Best case scenario.

3 (2h 8m 56s):
To get the bones, all the bones back. First of all,

4 (2h 9m 0s):
Why are you so concerned with those bones when you have so many?

3 (2h 9m 5s):
Because they have so many more. So many more.

4 (2h 9m 11s):
So they have more there than you have where you are.

3 (2h 9m 13s):
Oh, they, they took, you gotta remember there's 200 nozzles running. They took 'em all, they took hundreds and hundreds of thousands of bones to New York City. Hundreds of thousands. I've only got a couple hundred thousand. They took millions

4 (2h 9m 33s):
And they've got 'em all.

3 (2h 9m 34s):
They got 'em. Every one of 'em. And the, and the guy that was their collector, excuse me. He was, he was a, just a field hand on the Alaska railroad. And they said, Hey, you want to collect bones for us? He said Sure. So he ended up, when it was all said and done with an honorary doctorate from the University of Alaska who was in on it, by the way, on this tripartite agreement. And probably influenced by, you know, child's Frick, the son of the industrialist that used to shoot his laborers because they wanted more money in the really in the steel industry. Yeah. Henry Frick was a prick.

4 (2h 10m 16s):
Where was

3 (2h 10m 17s):
This? In America. Look up Henry Frick.

4 (2h 10m 21s):
He, he used to shoot his workers if they wanted more money.

3 (2h 10m 23s):
He had, he had a gang of gun gunmen come in when they were striking to make better wages and yet he was killing them. It's in our steel industry. What

4 (2h 10m 33s):
Year was this?

3 (2h 10m 34s):
It was on the men who Built America that was on that show. Ah, he was the old man. So it was back when the steel industry was just getting going with Carnegie and those guys. Childs was his kid.

4 (2h 10m 50s):
So here it is. So lifelong opponent of organized labor. And his refusal to allow union workers at his minds led to the infamous homestead strike of July in 1892 in which 10 men were killed and 60 wounded the same month. Frick himself was attacked in a failed assassination attempt by a 25-year-old Russian anarchist. Wow. What did Frick do to his workers? In June of 1892, he slashed wages, evicted workers from their company houses, stopped negotiating with union leaders and threatened to bring the Pinkertons, a detective agency for hire that amounted to a private army of thugs. Wow.

3 (2h 11m 26s):
That's what he did too.

4 (2h 11m 29s):
Oh

3 (2h 11m 30s):
Man. And the guy, so the guy that his kid Childs is the one that was head of a m and h and he, he hired this guy Geist to go out and collect fossils in Alaska. And he just didn't, he just didn't limit himself to here. He went out to the West coast,

4 (2h 11m 51s):
It says Frick fired 2,500 of his workers and cut their pay in half of those who remained. At one point he was named the most hated man in America. Wow. Fucking greed

3 (2h 12m 3s):
Unfuck. Unbelievable

4 (2h 12m 4s):
Fucking greed. It's always, always been the fucking, the bane of mankind.

3 (2h 12m 10s):
Oh. The geist went out to Nome and St. Lawrence Island and dig up babies outta the permafrost 'cause they wouldn't decompose and put 'em in pickle jars, send 'em back to Henry or Child's Frick and m and h I've seen these jars of pickled babies and now they're being repatriated and 60 Minutes just had a big thing on Cambodia and all the things they stole out of there, m and h and Smithsonian and all those guys are in on it. They just don't wanna return 'em.

4 (2h 12m 41s):
And they justify this based on the idea that they're the, the keepers of this historical record. Yeah. Natural history.

3 (2h 12m 49s):
That was a good segment on 60 Minutes. I quit kind of watching them a long time ago, but this kind of piqued my interest. 'cause it's all about what they're doing. They're doing it right now. It's not like this just happened in the past. These these guys are like real life Indiana Jones. Let's go out and plunder and bring it back home. Some of it gets to the museum, some of it gets goes home. I've heard of people that say they've been in auto guy's house in Europe. He's got all kinds of stuff in his house that came out of our Boneyard area. Really? Out of Fairbanks. Yeah. Skulls. Short face bears, saber tooth. He, anyways, he ended up with a doctorate and the street's named after him up in Fairbanks.

3 (2h 13m 34s):
Hey, you find a, you find a guy that's willing to do anything for anything. That's what they found. They found him and Charles Frick had no problem. Look at his dad was a prick. That's dad.

4 (2h 13m 48s):
Yeah.

3 (2h 13m 48s):
And you know what they say about

4 (2h 13m 50s):
Yeah. Apple in the tree. Yeah. Yeah.

3 (2h 13m 54s):
So, but yeah. So you asked what I wanna do, I wanna make things right. At least on the bones that came out of Fairbanks. I want, I want the proof that men and animals lived together. It's there. Why? Why they haven't studied those bones in a hundred years. I don't know.

4 (2h 14m 13s):
Do they have human bones at the MNH?

3 (2h 14m 19s):
If they do, they don't talk about it. Well, Of course, they're not talking to me. Right. They might talk to our legislature though,

4 (2h 14m 28s):
Boy, if they found out they've been holding onto to human bones all this time too. Yep. They probably, the people that are there right now probably don't even go into those boxes.

3 (2h 14m 38s):
Hmm.

4 (2h 14m 40s):
So if you're dealing from, with stuff from more than 80 years ago, well, who the fuck knows what's in there? It's all just stored, huh?

3 (2h 14m 49s):
Well, there's a whole bunch of spear points they found out in Esther, which is one of my areas that just disappeared between Esther Alaska and New York City just disappeared for 15 fucking years. They found 'em in North Dakota. 'cause some guy was trying to track 'em down and they got some of 'em back. But I've asked for reports on those. They haven't done any. Wait a minute, you guys were supposed to report on everything you took. You haven't done any of it. And that's my leg that I'm standing on. I could litigate this if I want to. I'm not a, I'm not afraid of that. But I, I wanted this to be a good story when I started off.

3 (2h 15m 31s):
We're bringing the bones back. We're gonna make things right. We're gonna study it. We're gonna solve some issues. We're gonna solve some historical questions. Ah, let's all get together and do it the right way. Let's do it the right thing for once.

4 (2h 15m 44s):
Yeah.

3 (2h 15m 45s):
Now what do you have the signed contract with notarized copies from 1928? Well this how, that's not how business worked back then. You had the Boston men who financed it through the United States smelting room finding mining company went to A and HM and H. Yeah. Yeah. We'll do, we'd love to get those bones. We'll go get 'em. But here's what you gotta do. They didn't do it. So I'm saying give 'em back. Mm. And that's why the University of Alaska went with me to New York City and said we want 'em back. But they, they know they're in the business of fucking longevity. Ju they know how long people live.

3 (2h 16m 25s):
Just outlasts some bitch. We're an institution. Right. We don't ever die.

4 (2h 16m 30s):
Right.

3 (2h 16m 30s):
People, people come in, they raise hell, then they go away. Well that's probably true in my case. But Drew out there, go ahead. Deal with him. He plays hardballs.

4 (2h 16m 46s):
So your best case scenario is all this gets handled politically. You recover the bones and then we start putting the bigger pieces of the puzzle together.

3 (2h 16m 56s):
Exactly. You know, people want, oh send me, send me these bones so I can carbonate 'em for you. Carbonate 'em up here. Yeah. Get your ass in Alaska and set up a research. I already built it for you for Christ's sake. I spent a million dollars doing it. It's done. I built it last year. I'm anticipating this. They're all coming back. I might not know how it's gonna, how it's gonna go. But I know how this is gonna end. We're gonna get the bones back in Alaska. So just stop doing this bullshit. Let's get it. Let's just do the right thing here. Boys

4 (2h 17m 32s):
Is the hope. Maybe some of the younger scientists that are listening to this, realize the potential of these discoveries and start working with you.

3 (2h 17m 42s):
The problem is in organizations like that, the younger scientists don't wanna ruffle feathers because that's a career ender for those guys. Oh, he's, he, he raised hell with the uppity ups at Smithsonian or whatever museum stay away from this guy. And you know, they all want to be successful in their careers and I get it right. But maybe somebody out there goes, you know what? And there's a few of 'em out there. I've talked to a few of 'em. They're just, they can't go public. Right. and I don't blame 'em. They gotta put beans on the table too. Right. But some of the plunders plundering have gone on Mongolia, that area that has been plundered for their cultural artifacts.

3 (2h 18m 30s):
And the people that know about it are at the Museum of Natural History and they can't say anything about it 'cause they don't wanna lose their job.

4 (2h 18m 38s):
So these artifacts, do you think that there's just like these wealthy people that keep them in their homes and then just don't tell anybody about, 'cause that was always the case with Egyptian relics. Yeah. Right. That 'cause we don't even know how many tombs were rated over the, you know, several thousand years and where all those artifacts went and what happened. I mean. 'cause we know that like when they found King Tuts, when they found his, all of his remains in the sarcophagus and all the gold line this and gold line that. Imagine people found that 500, 600 years ago, a thousand years ago.

4 (2h 19m 19s):
Where'd all that stuff go? Like, did they melt it down? Was it more valuable as gold for them?

3 (2h 19m 24s):
What's the, what's the coin of the realm? It's gold, right? Yeah. It's been the coin of the realm since the beginning of time. What's the oldest profession?

4 (2h 19m 37s):
Prostitution.

3 (2h 19m 38s):
That's right. You got, you got the prostitution, you got the gold and you got people that are willing to die for, you know, one or both of those things. And so it's been the basis of conflict forever. You can melt all the gold down that's ever been mined on the planet. It's still here. It hasn't gone anywhere. You can't get rid of gold. You can't, you can't vaporize it. You can melt it, but it would fit in an Olympic sized pool. That'd be all of it That's ever been mine. Right?

4 (2h 20m 9s):
The whole

3 (2h 20m 9s):
World's. Yeah. and it, if you've been watching the Price of Gold in the last year, it's up 12% since you and I met last time. And it'll probably keep going. 'cause people are, they buy it to hedge against inflation. You know, Costco started selling gold bars.

4 (2h 20m 27s):
Really?

3 (2h 20m 28s):
Costco.

4 (2h 20m 29s):
You could buy gold bars from Costco,

3 (2h 20m 31s):
Gold bars from Costco and they sell out as soon as they put 'em up for sale. They sold a hundred million dollars worth 'em in the first quarter.

4 (2h 20m 41s):
What one gold bar Swiss Lady Fortuna Cean members. Only item 24 karat gold item is not refundable. Limit two per membership. Costco Gold bars@costco.com. What the fuck? Jamie? Would you ever imagine that?

9 (2h 21m 6s):
No. But do you remember the story from where am I at here? This guy had a private collection in Indiana. He was 91 years old.

4 (2h 21m 13s):
It says it was Unlike, anything we'd ever seen, collection of stolen artifacts to be

9 (2h 21m 18s):
Returned. It's somewhere in the range of 5,000 different things just in his house in a small town in Indiana.

4 (2h 21m 23s):
A delegation from China went to Indiana on Thursday to claim hundreds of artifacts that were seized from one man's private museum. He had items from all over the world. Everything from ancient jewelry to human bones. Those Chinese artifacts were part of the 5,000 seized from a home in from 90-year-old Don Miller, a man well known locally for his passion for collecting and global travels. He died in 2015. He

3 (2h 21m 48s):
Had, I remember seeing that story.

9 (2h 21m 50s):
Super old Chinese weapon. Wow.

4 (2h 21m 53s):
Look at that. Look at that ax. Wow. I'm trying to find

9 (2h 21m 57s):
More info on exact things that they pulled out of there, but I didn't find anything

4 (2h 22m 0s):
Really crazy. So there's probably dudes like this in Europe. It's probably dudes like this in Russia. Dudes like this in China.

3 (2h 22m 9s):
Dudes like this in the USA man. You

4 (2h 22m 11s):
Think so? Oh, for this guy. Yeah. This least one for sure. This guy. At least one. Yeah. Look at that hammer. The hammer and the ax. That's incredible.

3 (2h 22m 20s):
That hammer's for splitting a skull open.

4 (2h 22m 22s):
I'm sure it's not for making a house.

9 (2h 22m 24s):
2000 human bones.

4 (2h 22m 28s):
One dude. Yeah. Is not, he's not the only one. Yeah. How many of those dudes are connected somehow to the A MNH?

3 (2h 22m 40s):
Well there's just a story out recently where they have like 12,000 human bones. They gotta return to someplace.

9 (2h 22m 47s):
Yeah. On this letter that they wrote, I was gonna put this up. This is a letter from this year in October. We're gonna talk about what they're gonna do with their human remains in storage. Whew. They have a lot, but wow. Where it came from, how they got it. This is a long letter. It's not super worth reading, but it does say that they have them. Wow. They pulled them out of exhibits. Some of them were given to them through like science. People

4 (2h 23m 13s):
Donate the bodies. This is here. These remains removed from a burial ground in the Inwood neighborhood of Manhattan during a city road construction project in 1903 to 1904 and accepted into the collection. Enslavement was a violent, dehumanizing act. Removing these remains from the rightful burial place ensure the denial of basic human dignity would continue even in death. Identifying a restorative respectful action and consultation with local communities must be a part of our commitment. Wow. So for sure they've got some fucking human bones. I just wanna know if they have some human bones that they got from your spot. 'cause if they did, I just think there's gotta be some in there.

4 (2h 23m 58s):
If you've got spear points and you've got arrowheads, God damnit, you gotta have some fucking humans in there.

9 (2h 24m 6s):
I also, when looking up the American lion, I, in the Wikipedia, it says that the A MNH got something from Alaska in the early 19 hundreds. Mm.

4 (2h 24m 16s):
A few additional discoveries came until 1907. The American Museum of National History and College Alaska collected several Pantera Aroc skulls in a local locality originally found in 1803 gold miners. How do you say that word? Ee kasab

3 (2h 24m 34s):
Kasab kasab

4 (2h 24m 35s):
Zebu zebu Alaska. The skulls were referred to a new subspecies of fellas, Panera Aroc. In 1930. Fellas Aroc Alaskan assist Alaska Isis, despite this species didn't get a proper description and is now seen as a nomen Newham synonymous with Pantera Aroc further south in Rancho LaBrea. California is a large field skull. Is that what No. Fell fli. Fe feline. I guess F skull was excavated in later described in 1909 by John c Merrim, Miriam, who referred it to a new subspecies of Felice Aroc.

4 (2h 25m 22s):
Felice Aroc Bebe. The subspecies is synonymous with Panera Aroc. Wow. Amazing. That's what they pulled out of. Whoa, look at that thing. Holy shit. Look at that thing. So that's the North American lion. Wow. And bigger than the African lion, which is wild.

3 (2h 25m 47s):
We got a skull of that. Nice.

4 (2h 25m 52s):
I bet you got a lot more of 'em under that ground too. Yeah.

3 (2h 25m 56s):
We might have stuff we don't always post. I

4 (2h 25m 58s):
Bet

3 (2h 25m 58s):
You do. Hypothetically speaking

4 (2h 25m 60s):
Hypothetically. I bet you do.

3 (2h 26m 3s):
It'd be a good bet.

4 (2h 26m 4s):
You're allowed to. It seems like they should play ball.

3 (2h 26m 9s):
They

4 (2h 26m 9s):
Should I mean. It just seems like if you guys wanna know some stuff, how about there's this one extraordinary area in Alaska that's produced an insane amount of artifacts.

3 (2h 26m 19s):
Well, the bone rush you started.

4 (2h 26m 22s):
You started

3 (2h 26m 23s):
It. No, you started it.

4 (2h 26m 24s):
I couldn't do it without you.

3 (2h 26m 25s):
Hey, you know what? We're tied inextricably at the hip about this. I've had ample opportunity to be interviewed. I don't do it. I'm here with the greatest communicator on the face of the planet. and don don't know if I mentioned this last time, but I got a Ms and Bs. So you put me in here with you. If I don't know it, I'll make some shit up. But for the most part, I'm not kidding. Your ability to communicate is letting people throughout your listening world, there's something wrong here. And these people need to step up after our broadcast, after our podcast last time, within two days, m and h put out a press release denying this ever happened.

4 (2h 27m 12s):
Well that seems silly if you've actually visited the bones themselves. Yeah.

3 (2h 27m 17s):
They de denied the existence of that report that I read from. So I posted that cover today in case Jimmy wanted to look at it. That report was written co-written by one of their own employees at a and h. Now come on boys. You can bullshit everybody. You can't bullshit everybody.

4 (2h 27m 36s):
Thi this is a problem with archeologists. This is a problem that they've found with trying to establish an earlier date for some of these Egyptian artifacts and the temple, the Sphinx, and some of these other things that people do not want to give up any of the power they have in controlling narrative. Early man in Eastern Burin Baringa Bia

3 (2h 28m 1s):
Bia. Yeah.

4 (2h 28m 2s):
Bia Late lysine and early Holocene artifacts and associated fauna recovered from the Fairbanks Mining District in Alaska. Wow.

3 (2h 28m 13s):
Yeah. Look at that rip

4 (2h 28m 15s):
Underneath that says Early Man

3 (2h 28m 17s):
Robert l Evander.

4 (2h 28m 19s):
So let's read.

3 (2h 28m 21s):
Yeah. Pale Entire American Museum. Natural history. Yeah. They wrote the report. I read

4 (2h 28m 24s):
They wrote it. And what you said here is on on your thing. It says the, this is the document A MNH said they have no record of. I read it on Joe Rogan podcast a year ago and identified the spot in the East River where the A MNH dumped approximately 50 tons of the, my company fossils back in 1949. It started a bone rush though it only took two days for a MNH to issue a press release denying it existed. Note that one of the authors, an employee of A MNH co-wrote it. My goal is to get the remainder of the collection still stored in their basement, sent back to Alaska so the scientific research can be conducted on them. I'd like to see these elitist snobs hauled in front of Congress and testify under oath about their misdeeds that processes underway.

4 (2h 29m 9s):
Alaska is not the only state nation, the A MNH plundered, archeological paleontological, anthropological and cultural resources and artifacts from, they're doing a disservice. Yeah. For the people that wanna understand things I mean. They are a blockade to understanding how there is this area that you own that has this insane amount of bones. It's, it's insane. And it's a massive mystery. And it's one thing that is so compelling to human beings that want to know like what is going on with the history of, of animals and the human race.

4 (2h 29m 52s):
And also with this theory, this younger Dries impact theory, if they can just do a core sample on that area that you have uncovered that's 80 feet down, that shows all this carbon that seems to indicate massive amounts of fire. And something big as you said, something that came in hot and that there's evidence of this all over the world now because of the research that's been done on this younger driest impact theory. They know that there's a layer of iridium that exists that indicates that something from space iridium, which is very common in space and very rare on earth. Yep. There's a a layer of this shit that indicates we got hit.

4 (2h 30m 35s):
And if you add that to what you have this layer that shows some fucking insane event took place in your area that led to all that burning and all these fucking bones. Man, how is this not something that they are actively collaborating with you and working together with the scientific community to get an understanding of how this took place.

3 (2h 31m 3s):
Because I think it gets back to the, the whack-a-mole game. You know, some guy steps up and goes, I'll do it. And they go, well you're not gonna have work in the industry anymore. Right? Well you, you know, we're gonna blackball you. You know, they're afraid to, it just, it goes against, goes against the grain. They don't wanna stick up for some dirt tramp in Alaska saying, come on, let's study this stuff. I already built a building for you. I did it already.

4 (2h 31m 34s):
That is what's really crazy. You really did spend over a million dollars to build a scientific

3 (2h 31m 38s):
Research. Yeah. You saw the pictures of it. Yeah. I got all the receipts in there. I mean I got everything they need. Just bring the bones back and I'll build another building just like it. You know, what do you want me to do? People go, well, have you carbonated all your, no, it's not my job. Well, have you done this and have you done that? What are you asking me for? Why don't you call a MH and ask them? They're the ones that are supposed to do this shit. Not me. I, I don't have the skillset. I'm not a paleontologist. I'm just a simple fucking boner making my way through life. Well, super boner actually, Joe.

4 (2h 32m 17s):
Yeah. All you have to do is get one piece out and you're a boner. Yeah. I'd like to be a boner.

3 (2h 32m 22s):
You're gonna be a boner.

4 (2h 32m 23s):
I need to be

3 (2h 32m 24s):
You need to come up, bring your friends with you. Yeah. We'll go out there and have a boner party.

4 (2h 32m 28s):
We need to make a YouTube video. Oh

3 (2h 32m 30s):
Yeah. Fuck

4 (2h 32m 30s):
Yeah.

3 (2h 32m 32s):
Yeah. Put you on the manual. Giant. There's a work out there.

4 (2h 32m 36s):
Is it hard to hold onto? Not really.

3 (2h 32m 37s):
No. You make it look like it is. Ooh. and it really is. You know, just move it around a little bit. Mm. My kids do it I mean my kids are a great support. My wife, we're all in on this.

4 (2h 32m 52s):
It's just, to me, it's so strange that they continue to resist what it seems to be inevitable. And the more we talk about it and the more millions of people hear about this, the more it will become inevitable. Exactly. This is a massive mystery and it's not like a little bit of evidence. You have the most insane amount of evidence I think I've ever come across. Yeah. And the fact that we're all finding out about this because of social media. What a weird time to be alive.

3 (2h 33m 21s):
Not just social media. The, Joe, Rogan, Experience. Yeah.

4 (2h 33m 24s):
But I found out about it through Instagram. I just don don't even remember how I found your page.

3 (2h 33m 29s):
Well, I'm glad you did. and I, I told you last time, it took me three years of saying I only talked to Joe Rogan about it. Ha. Having, knowing that's not ever gonna happen because I didn't wanna talk to nobody about it. But when we talked about it, I gotta tell you that my Instagram blew up and went from like 40 something thousand people following my page and I think to, it's at 370,000. Now.

4 (2h 33m 56s):
Let's see what happens by this time next year when you come back again.

3 (2h 33m 59s):
Sweet Jesus. I might build, build a political base. I might, I might have enough people that can talk, contact their legislators.

4 (2h 34m 8s):
Well, that's the hope. The hope is that if we can continue to highlight this and could just continue to show people this is really important stuff. And there's a reason why people are so fascinated by it. And we, we have all been fascinated by the history of the human race and the history of animals and the history of whatever caused these extinction events we're, we're all fascinated by this. And they're doing a disservice to humanity by not exploring this further and by not playing ball. Yep. They should play ball. They should, they should get involved in this. And they should do so in an honorable way where you don't have to bring in politicians. This should be something that as educators and as the, these are the curators of this information.

4 (2h 34m 56s):
These are the people we turn to. This is one of the most prestigious institutions in the world when it comes to natural history.

3 (2h 35m 2s):
Supposed to be. Yeah. And they're, they're not doing themselves a service doing this. That's a big disservice. And did, did you just invite me back for next year?

4 (2h 35m 11s):
Yes. Let's

3 (2h 35m 12s):
Do it again. I gladly accept.

4 (2h 35m 15s):
Let's have this an annual thing to see how much progress we make.

3 (2h 35m 18s):
As long as I'm the last podcast of the year. Yes.

4 (2h 35m 21s):
I'm down. That's our tradition. You are the last podcast of 2023. You'll be the last podcast of 2024. Thank

3 (2h 35m 27s):
You, sir. We're

4 (2h 35m 28s):
Gonna, and I, my sincere hope is that they come to their senses and they do this in, in an amicable way where everybody realizes like this is important. It's bigger than everybody. This is good for the A MNH. This is good for the, the scientific community. It's good for the curious people like myself. It's good, good for the world. It's, it's, we really should find out what the fuck is going on and what happened. Yeah. and I think you have a massive piece of the puzzle, sir. And it's extraordinary. and I just, I'm very happy that you are the guy that you got some hardnosed motherfucker who doesn't give a shit, who is willing to stick his neck out and, and tell the truth. And, and also to show the world like just the, just the evidence that you have on your page.

4 (2h 36m 13s):
Just that bone with the human face carved in. Shut the fuck up. You know, somebody carved that. Yep. Stop playing games. What is it? Just the fact that you've got saw bones. Saw bones, like who did that? Just the fact that you've got an insane amount of wooly mammoth tusks and bones and all these animals that they said aren't even supposed to have been in Alaska and they clearly were. Yep. Like there's a mystery there folks. And

3 (2h 36m 36s):
There is a mystery and it's being played out not only on my Instagram page where it's the only place, but with you. This is, if you wanna know about it, you gotta come here. You gotta listen to The Joe, Rogan Experience. Because I ain't talking to the so-called mainstream media. I'm not interested in being a, a story one night for by some guy sitting in a studio that's never even gotten dirt under his fingernails. You come out here and you walk around in this shit motherfucker and you listen and you smell what we're dealing with here. This is the ice age baby. We live in the ice age. People say think outside the box. We live outside that some bitch, if you're in the ice age All day, it changes you.

3 (2h 37m 22s):
Maybe it makes you fucking crazy. don don't know. But

4 (2h 37m 26s):
I think you might have been a little crazy to start with.

3 (2h 37m 28s):
I think so.

4 (2h 37m 29s):
I think that's why the universe chose you to own that land. I I really do.

3 (2h 37m 34s):
Either that or the universe says we need some prick out there that's Yeah. Yeah. That's our, that's our guy.

4 (2h 37m 39s):
I think that makes sense. Yeah. Because I think a lot of people just wouldn't have gone through the lengths that you've gone through. They wouldn't have been so stubborn and determined. And also just the fact that a guy like you is exactly the type of person that you need to do all this work. It's, it's gotta be a guy like you, a regular person is not gonna be so dedicated to this.

3 (2h 38m 3s):
You know, this is, like I said, this is my cause last year I said, okay, everybody takes a mammal 21 seconds to take a leak. That was a great contribution to mankind's knowledge. 'cause I got a lot of people going, you're right.

4 (2h 38m 18s):
I time myself the other day. I pissed for 35 seconds though.

3 (2h 38m 20s):
Did you? And somebody else said, Hey, I, I piss for 55 seconds

4 (2h 38m 24s):
If guys who drink beer, I get, I guarantee you they could, they could do.

3 (2h 38m 28s):
But see, I like to, I like to think that people can still think. Yeah. So I also like to think that there's a certain degree of what you do goes into the presentation of what you do. It's in the presentation. Can I give you an example? Sure. Three guys go fishing in Valdez. They leave Fairbanks, they drive down to Valdez. They get in there late and they need a hotel room. So the clerk says, I only got one room left. It's kind of nasty. It's got two, two cots and a couch. How much is it? 30 bucks. So each guy pulls out 10 bucks out of his wallet and gives it to 'em, give 'em the key. And they go to their room.

3 (2h 39m 9s):
The night clerk comes in a little bit later, the night manager. He says, Hey boss, we rented that last room out. He says, all right, what'd you get for it? He goes, 30 bucks. He goes, you over, you overcharge him by five bucks. And he gave him five ones. And he says, take it back to the room and give it to 'em. So he goes back to their room, knocks on their door and he gives each bro, each guy a dollar. Right. Okay. And he kept two bucks in his pocket. He said, ah, fuck. They don't know they overpaid. So let's do the math on this one. Let's h spent nine bucks now. Right.

4 (2h 39m 46s):
Okay.

3 (2h 39m 46s):
What's three times

4 (2h 39m 47s):
9 27.

3 (2h 39m 50s):
Yeah. And he kept two bucks. Right? Right. 27 plus two is 29. Where the fuck did that other dollar go? I

4 (2h 40m 0s):
Don don't know. Why are we worrying about a dollar? I'm, I'm not sure where you're going with this.

3 (2h 40m 6s):
It's a presentation. Where did it go? They paid 30, they got you a dollar back and the right clerk kept two. Where I'm going is it's the presentation, it's the story. It's the way you tell it. 29 bucks is not 30 bucks. They spent 30 when they walked in. Right. But where'd that other $1 go?

4 (2h 40m 34s):
I don't give a fuck about that dog. don don't understand where you're going with

3 (2h 40m 36s):
This. Where I'm going with it is I'm making, I'm throwing this out there for the people that listen to this show going, that don't make sense. Right. It doesn't make sense Joe. They go, what the fuck? Maybe you're thinking that right now. What the fuck? Where'd that dollar go?

4 (2h 40m 56s):
I'm definitely not thinking that I know you're not. I'm thinking, where are you going with this?

3 (2h 41m 0s):
I'm not anywhere. I'm talking about the presentation. I understand. You know, and sometimes things get lost at the presentation. You know, am and h can say, well we did this, we did that. We did the other thing.

4 (2h 41m 15s):
There's no evidence of this letter.

3 (2h 41m 16s):
Yeah. Nothing happened. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter where that other dollar went.

4 (2h 41m 22s):
Well, I think for the longest time they have become accustomed to being the ones who are the gatekeepers of information. And when it comes to this kind of information, a little press release here, a little statement here has been adequate. They've been able to cover their tracks. But in this age of information, that's not good enough anymore. No,

3 (2h 41m 45s):
It's not. And it's like I said, it's the, it's the way it's laid out. I'm laying it out as clearly as I can to these guys. You have the opportunity to do the right thing

4 (2h 41m 56s):
And it's the right thing for all the curious human beings that deserve access to that information. 'cause it's a part of the human story. It's part of the story of the earth. It's part of the story of the animals. It's part of the story of your land. Yeah. It's a part of the story of probably the impact theory that wiped out massive amounts of animals and human beings and I. Think you've got a piece of the puzzle.

3 (2h 42m 23s):
We have 20 pieces of the puzzle. It's a thousand pieces. I want, I won't get 'em all 'cause I know a bunch of 'em were stolen. Well

4 (2h 42m 32s):
Let's hope that by this time next year things have progressed. And when we talk about it in December of 2024 for the last podcast of 2024.

3 (2h 42m 42s):
Yeah.

4 (2h 42m 42s):
Let's hope we've got some good news for people.

3 (2h 42m 44s):
Yeah. And when I got ahold of you and I said, don, don't know if I have anything, you know, I was trying to give you an out like just in case he's got nothing for me. I was trying to manage expectations is what I was trying to do. I just, a lot of people liked my podcast with you last time. They

4 (2h 43m 3s):
Don't like this one too.

3 (2h 43m 5s):
And I, I just don't want to disappoint you or disappoint the people that follow you or listen to these stories. Because frankly, some of 'em might not be interested in it.

4 (2h 43m 14s):
A lot of 'em are. and I think a lot of now are invested in this. And specifically since the, when the bone rush yielded results and now people know it's true. Yeah. Undeniably. Yeah. Undeniably step bison. Jawbones don't, they're not supposed to be at the bottom of the East River. Exactly where you said to look for them and that. What are the odds of that?

3 (2h 43m 37s):
And don't forget what I told you about, there's other people out in the river. Yeah.

3 (12s):
We're up. What's going on, man? How are you?

4 (14s):
I'm good. I'm welcome

3 (15s):
Aboard. Thank you for being here.

4 (16s):
No, thanks for having me.

3 (18s):
My pleasure. You, you made two of my all time favorite movies, right? The Watchmen. Okay. Which I fucking love. Okay, awesome. And 300.

4 (26s):
Okay. Awesome.

3 (27s):
Those are, I have like a top 20 list. I've never like, formally put together a top 20 list, but those are in there. Oh,

4 (32s):
That's cool. For sure. Well, First of all, I appreciate that. 'cause, you know, 300 was a complete labor of love and an insane, like, you know, 300 was, I wa I I was a Frank Miller fan for a long time. Right. and I, I thought the, I thought I would do another, I thought I would do Dark Night Returns. Frankly, that was the movie I wanted. I still wanted to do it. I, I always tell everyone like, dark Night Returns. If I could do Dark Night Returns, I'd be done with comic book movies. Really? Well, because like, if you've done Watchmen, oh, sorry, I'm banging the mic. That's okay. If, if, if you do watchmen and Dark Night Returns, like for me, you're good. You're good. Your legacy is set. Mm. So like, Batman versus Superman literally steals a lot of dark night returns.

4 (1m 18s):
I'm not going to say it didn't. It did, but it's still not Dark Night returns. So I think that's still out there. But I always, you know, for a long time I had that, I had 300 like on my coffee table at my house when I was making TV commercials, you know, and I'd have my friends over, I'd be like, I'm gonna make this one day. It's gonna look exactly like this comic book. And they'd be like, yeah, yeah, sure it is. And yeah, I was having a general meeting with Gianni Nari, who was one of the producers, and he was asking me about what I like, and he had that graphic novel in his office. Oh, wow. Like on his table. and I went, well, okay, you know what, if I could do anything, that book right there, I would make that.

4 (1m 59s):
And he goes, well, what do you mean? How would you make it? And I literally just opened it up and I go, we'd make, we'd film this, we'd film these pictures, it would look like this. And he goes, okay, that's cool. Like, so you're saying you would just shoot the movie and it would look like this graphic novel? I go, that's what I'm saying. and I think, and that's what, but, but at the time, we couldn't sell it. We tried, we went around town with it. We tried. I literally, we went to all the studios. I, you know, they were all kind of, kind of like Yeah. Sword and sandals. Yeah.

3 (2m 34s):
Wasn't it the same time that Troy was being made?

4 (2m 37s):
It was exactly the same time as Troy. And when we went to Warner Brothers originally with it, they, they literally were like, we have, we have Troy, so why would we want this? We have Brad Pitt, like, literally, Brad Pitt is in our movie. What are you? I go, we're gonna do something crazy. We're not even gonna shoot it outside. And they were like, what? Okay, you're nuts. and I go. Yeah, we're not gonna go for one shot outside. We ended up going for one shot outside for this, when the Persian meers are coming, that super high speed shot where the horses are kind of coming over the hill. We shot that outside because we just couldn't get the horses going fast enough in the, it's the shot right before this, I think. Oh, I'm missing the shot. Oh no, it's this one. That's it.

4 (3m 17s):
It's that shot. So that shot was the, the horses. That was a high speed shot we did with Photo Sos outside. But that was it. That's like the only shot outside everything else on stage, because couldn't the horses to run faster because they couldn't get the horses fast enough inside. Yeah. Yeah. And we, and it was too expensive. That was a low budget movie, you know, and we couldn't get

3 (3m 32s):
300 was a low budget movie. Yeah.

4 (3m 34s):
'cause we I mean we shot it all on stage 60 days. Like, that's like why there's no director's cut of, of watch of 300 is because we, every frame of film, we shot us in the shot.

3 (3m 46s):
You shot that movie in 60 days.

4 (3m 47s):
60 days. Yeah. Wow. It was crazy. Yeah. That's insane. It was. We were just, we, it almost killed us. but it was, it was, it was fun. But yeah, so when we took it to Warner Brothers, they were like, you know, finally, well, what happened was, I did Dawn of the Dead and then from Dawn of the Dead, I ca I was supposed to do I Am Legend. Right. and I Am Legend was this movie that was at Warner Brothers that they were like, what do you think? And then for some, there was some kind of crazy mix up and they ended up giving that movie to someone else. And then I think they felt bad or whatever. And they said, well, what, what do you wanna do? and I said, well, I really still wanna do 300.

4 (4m 27s):
And so we set, we shot that test shot. There's a, I think it's on the dvd, there's a test shot we did. And they said, okay, if you can make the movie look like that, go, go, go, go do it.

3 (4m 36s):
Was that one of the first movies that was ever shot in front of a green screen? Like basically most of the movie Except that one scene.

4 (4m 43s):
Sorry. Yeah. I don't think it was like, look, green screen photography was like a well-known way to make a movie. Visual Effects and all that. A whole movie. Yeah. don don't know about a whole movie that, that, that was weird. I always say like, they go like, well what innovations? Like what? and I always go like, it's basically the same technology that the Weatherman uses. You know, like when, you know, when he stands in front of the green screen and says like, oh, the front's coming in from the north. You know, it's literally, yeah. It's literally the same, it's literally the same technology, you know, as a, as a, because look, that could easily, you could put like the weather behind that guy right there. And it'd be the same. That's Well, that's Eli, that's my son. Oh, wow. He's now making movies. He was the second unit director on Rebel Moon.

4 (5m 25s):
Oh,

3 (5m 25s):
That's so cool.

4 (5m 26s):
He's, he also plays the Young Rorschach in, in Watchman. Really? Watchman. Yeah. Wow. Like the ba the Baby Rorschach. Yeah. Because like, you put your kid in the movie and I always was like, oh, let, let's have Eli do that. 'cause it's easier. You know, like, he has to like, beat the other kid up. Just Eli's better. 'cause like, don don't have to talk to like some, you know, other 'cause like, actually there's a scene to watch when, you know, where he bites the kid's face and he pulls the flesh off the face and I go, I, you know what? Let's just get E to E to do it. 'cause then I could just be like, okay, e bite this now pull it. Like rip it off. Right. The only troubling part of that is that there was a scene that we did in that movie where the, you know, because Rorschach's mom was a prostitute, right?

4 (6m 9s):
So there's that scene where Rorschach's mom in the flashbacks, like, I should have had that abortion. Right. And she slaps him in the face. Right. Because, 'cause he hears mom, is he hurting you? Like, 'cause she's having sex with some, some John in there. And then she opens the door and she's like, you know, he's like, is he hurting you? I should have had that abortion slapped him. and I had wanted the mother to be topless in that scene. And they were like, nah. Like, you can't have, and it wass cool because his mother was visiting set that day and his mom was there and she was like, oh, you're putting our son in a movie. Like, we weren't together at the time, his mom and I, but she we're really close friends.

4 (6m 52s):
But like, she was an actress. and I said, and they went, the only way that the woman could be topless is if it was actually his mom. And I was like, I go Denise. And she was like, you're no chance.

3 (7m 7s):
Imagine, ask your ex-wife to play a terrible prostitute who slaps their son and says, I wish I had an abortion. Holy shit.

4 (7m 16s):
I go, come on. It's for the drama. It's not like,

3 (7m 18s):
Oh my God,

4 (7m 19s):
I know. And she was like, you were insane. And I was like, come on. It would've been awesome. But it's

3 (7m 23s):
At least slightly insane. It would've been, but that would be the only way to do it. Yeah. Could you CG because pubs on her.

4 (7m 28s):
Yeah. That that's cool. At the time, probably now, I think we could. Yeah. Now I think we could have. Yeah, I think we could have, if I, if I had wanted to do it now, I think that's how you would do it. You'd do it like with like, some sort of chest rig and they would paint 'em out and then re redo the boobs. That'd be, that's a good idea actually.

3 (7m 44s):
How

4 (7m 44s):
Much I'll go back in.

3 (7m 46s):
How much of any CGI was used on their bodies in 300

4 (7m 50s):
Zero CGI in the body. Really, really zero. We didn't have the money, honestly, because

3 (7m 53s):
So many people talk I know, it's so much shit.

4 (7m 56s):
I know it's shit. I swear to God. I'm like, you know, you get, you need Mark Twight on this show. And then Mark will tell you, you know, mark is Mark trained the guys, Mark's like this amazing. He's like, he, I, I've known Mark for years. And he, he's an incredible alpine climber. He's like this, he's just like this insane, he can shoot, he can fucking, he could do anything that anyone can do. And like when I asked him to train the guys, he is like, this sounds like Hollywood bullshit. Like train actors for a movie. Like, they're all fakers. They're all liars. And I was like, look, you, you'll make them honest. And so he is like, all right. So he started training everybody. Yeah. There's Mark right there. And his gym was called Jim Jones.

4 (8m 36s):
Right. Like, just as an example of like how hard he is. But yeah. And so like, you know, he had trained all these seals and, you know, basically it was basically the same thing that he was doing with the seals he did with these actors. And

3 (8m 54s):
So a prerequisite had to, you

4 (8m 56s):
Can imagine

3 (8m 57s):
You had to be in some form of shape. You shape

4 (8m 58s):
You had to be in some shape. Yeah. Some teeny bit of shape. A couple guys came to us that were, you know, pure actors. But 90%, you know, had had some, had some shape. Yeah.

3 (9m 12s):
How much time did you have to work with them?

4 (9m 14s):
I'm trying to remember. Normally what I like is at least five weeks. I, I like five weeks and I'll take more if you'll give it to me.

3 (9m 24s):
Sure. For a film. For film. But I mean to prepare physically.

4 (9m 27s):
I, I'm talking about before the film starts at two months or three months. I like, before the film starts of, of training,

3 (9m 35s):
That's enough time to get them into that 300

4 (9m 37s):
Shape. It's not, it, it never is. These guys trained doubly as hard. And they knew a lot of them were athletes anyway. So they came in with like, and Jerry had had more time and Jerry trained with his own guy. Jerry didn't train with Mark. But like, yeah. So, you know, it depends. Like, you know, when Henry Cabell, mark trained Henry for, for Superman, and that was a ve that was a real, that was longer. I think that was three months or four months or, but yeah, it's not, it's never enough time. 'cause you just can't get it. Right. And on a, like actors, you know, they just ideally, you know, you'd have a, you know, half a year, six months would be perfect.

4 (10m 20s):
Really. At least. Yeah. I mean, just to get you, you know, visibly, you know, I always say the one thing is, like, I always say the one thing about movies is that, and the thing about Mark that I love was that he, he went to psychological war with the actors in the best possible way. You know, like he, what he was looking for, he would always say, I'm gonna put you in your pain cave and you're gonna find out a lot about yourself when you're in there. Right. And then when you come outta the workout, you know, you're gonna, you're gonna grow. You know, I'm gonna grow you here. And some people, some people just don't, they don't like that.

4 (11m 1s):
You know, especially people who haven't, like, you know, fitness isn't like a lifestyle that they've chosen, you know?

3 (11m 7s):
No. That's a journey that you have to be really dedicated to go down. If you're just a kind of a casual and someone comes along and says, I wanna put you in the pain cave. Like, I'm not interested in that. I, I think

4 (11m 19s):
It works with actors because he makes it part of the crucible of the performance. Mm. You know, and I think if you can connect it to the performance. Yeah. It makes the training mean something. You know, I was always, I've always been like a sort of bodybuilding fan. Like in the eighties, I trained with this guy in the eighties who was just like a teacher that lived, you know, this guy Jim Martin, who lived in Greenwich, Connecticut where I grew up, he was a teacher at this school called Greenwich Country Day, which was near the boarding school that I went to. And I was like, you know, everyone expected me to be like a, I I I played soccer. I was like an athlete. I was a really, but then I sort of got into like, weight training.

4 (11m 59s):
I was like, that's what I want to do. Everyone thought it was insane, but like, you know, it, and I think it was, it was my meeting Jim and Jim being like, 'cause Jim had this in the basement of Grinch Country Day. There was like this weirdo gym and like, you know, Chris Dickerson and like, you know, Mike Katz, all these like, crazy eighties bodybuilders would show up and train with him. and it was like this weird, I'd be like, this is awesome. And like, we went to the Olympia. Like he took us to the Olympia in New York City. don don't, what year was that? Like 82 or three. I forget what year. But anyway, it was just really cool. and I was just in the, and then Of course I was like, you know, Schwarzenegger, I read his like, book Education of a bodybuilder. You know, it's a weirdo book. I didn't So

3 (12m 40s):
Did you get involved in bodybuilding yourself?

4 (12m 42s):
I mean, I trained with Jim. 'cause I thought like, okay, yeah, maybe I'll be a bodybuilder one day. That'd be cool. Like, you know, but Of course, like, I was also painting and I. I remember when I, when I was a senior in high school, after I graduated, I went to London for a year to art school, to paint. and I lost like 40 pounds of muscle in that, in that year. Just like, literally I was in like, the best shape of my life. Went to England to be a painter, and like literally just ate baked beans on toast for a year and like starved to death up. Oh wow. But I was like, this is amazing. You know, like, I'm an artist, you know. but it was, it was definitely, it definitely put a put a but I always had the like, but I always had that aesthetic, you know, bug in my head.

4 (13m 23s):
And now I have, my trainer now is this guy Alessandro. He trained everyone for a Rebel Moon. And he's like this, he's like six in his early sixties. Italian was a bodybuilder, was a powerlifter, became a bodybuilder. And he's like, you know, he's just like this. He's a hard Italian no bullshit. Like, you know, it was cool because on the, during the, during the training for Moon, one of the actors was like, I have an idea for a workout. Do you wanna hear it? He's like, I have an idea for a movie.

3 (13m 54s):
Stay in your lane. Exactly.

4 (13m 56s):
He is like, or like the guys at the gym, like, 'cause you know, he used to like judge bodybuilding competitions and, you know, has his pro card and everything was like a real bodybuilder. And they'd say like, Hey, can you come and look at me? You know, I, I have a contest coming up in the bathroom. And he, they'd go in there and the guy take his shirt off and he'd be like, how long till the competition, I was like, oh. He'd be like, I got two months till the competition and all a hard to be like, I think next year for you is gonna be better. Wow. You know, it's like, oh, you know, and he has no problem saying, you know, like, I think I need to lose like 40 pounds more like 80.

3 (14m 27s):
Jesus. He's like,

4 (14m 29s):
He's hard. But he's, but he's awesome. He's like, no bullshit. Like he's, I, I, I, I think he's, and like, you know, he trained the guys for all Moon and he's like a pure aesthetic trainer. Right. Pure aesthetic. You know, he, he's just going for a look. He's seen everything, you know, and he just like, okay, you know, your abs could be sharper, you know? Yeah.

3 (14m 47s):
That's a weird thing.

4 (14m 48s):
Yeah. It's like a whole thing, you know, it's like, just like it is a whole thing. It's like a whole thing. Yeah.

3 (14m 51s):
Yeah. I had Ronnie Coleman on. Oh yeah. And exactly, you know, Ronnie Coleman at one point in time was the freak of all freaks. Oh, he

4 (14m 58s):
Is hands down. Like no one's ever gonna be better. Like,

3 (15m 1s):
He's the freak of all freaks. Yeah.

4 (15m 2s):
Like, it just like the way his muscles attach Yeah. Is like crazy. Like you can't, well he

3 (15m 7s):
Was probably one of the strongest bodybuilders ever. Unbelievably strong. And that's part of the, the reason why he looked the way he looked. He didn't look just big. He looked super powerful. Just

4 (15m 18s):
Pro. Well also the thing about Ronnie Coleman, like, you know, he, you see like guys that are just incredibly swollen where they can't, like, they're muscle bound. Like they can't, and he could like always just like, he could just like touch his, like back of his head. Look at him backwards. Prime dude. Unbelievable.

3 (15m 32s):
Look at that picture. That is so insane.

4 (15m 34s):
Yes. Alessandro was in a competition with him, night of the Champions, I think in San Francisco. And he said, like, he goes, I come from Italy. I like, I, I'm in my first competition. I like pull a card and I'm like, realize like I'm next to Ronnie Coleman and me. I'm like, he's like, great, this is fucking perfect. And he goes like the guy, you know, like how bodybuilders like the whole thing is about your skin being super thin. So everything like shows. Yeah. He goes and he, he goes, I saw him backstage and I thought, you know what? The skin's like, not there. It's not gonna happen. He goes, but then like, you know, he like so much muscle. He's like, pulls. And he's just like, he's like, oh my God. Like where, how is it possible that the skin just can't, the muscle's so thick just like pushes all the, it

3 (16m 20s):
Stretches all the skin.

4 (16m 20s):
You see all the striations and everything that You didn with him just relaxing you. Like at backstage you thought, ah, you know, I'm more ripped than him. But then like, he's like, no way.

3 (16m 28s):
It's such a weird sport because they're literally on death's door.

4 (16m 32s):
Oh. Literally.

3 (16m 32s):
Literally. They dehydrate themselves to the point where they have kidney failure almost. Oh

4 (16m 37s):
Yeah. Yeah. The only thing that's the thing that we can all learn from the bodybuilders is like, I think that just now in sort of everything that's happening, like with longevity and like all this, like, the bodybuilders will do stuff to their bodies that nobody else would dare do. They'll do dosages that no one will do. And so, like, it's cool to, to say like, okay, if you wanna know what quadruple the dose of anything does, right, just ask those guys. They'll tell you. 'cause they think, like, you'd be like, okay, you could, this is the most you could take. And then it's toxic. Oh cool. I'll take triple that and see what happens. You know? 'cause they just, they're all searching for like the magic bullet, you know?

3 (17m 15s):
It's kind of amazing how few of them have died.

4 (17m 17s):
Well and also they do die all the time. So it's not,

3 (17m 20s):
They do die. It's, yeah. But it's not like you'd expect it kills

4 (17m 23s):
All of them. No. So you'd think every single one of them, Dorian

3 (17m 26s):
You, is in great shape.

4 (17m 27s):
Yeah. And how can you have been on the edge of it for so long? Yeah.

3 (17m 30s):
How could you be? Yeah. Well he's,

4 (17m 31s):
The body's incredible. That's what you learned.

3 (17m 33s):
He's really suffered. Unfortunately, Ronnie, but I think he's suffered from surgery. Yeah. I think the surgery got him. You know, there's so many guys who get back surgery and back then stem cells weren't available. And people weren't aware that there's other ways to fix your back. The doctors just wanna go in there and start fusing discs and it scares the shit outta me now. No, no. Yeah. Everybody that I know that's had that done has had real problems afterwards. It puts extra pressure on the above and below discs as well. 'cause it's an, it's an unnatural sort of unit now. Instead of having three pieces, you now have one. Sure. You know? No, it's crazy. It's, it can be a real problem. It can be a real problem.

4 (18m 9s):
Yeah. and I and I and I think that healing the science behind healing is, you know, it's changing so much. Leaps and bounds. Leaps and bounds. and I think that that really, that's where the future is for in my, my opinion. Like how, how we learn to heal is really how we learn to like really stay, you know, active and like yeah. Getting stuff done for longer. Because like, you know, recovery is the whole thing. You

3 (18m 31s):
Know? Oh, 100% recovery is the, and also being cognizant of what your little issues are and not letting them get chronic. When I was young, I was just too much of a meathead. No,

4 (18m 42s):
Ignore, ignore it. Work

3 (18m 43s):
Through pain. And also when you're doing jujitsu, you're always in pain. So I was just like, just work through the pain. But then I started developing some like, real chronic problems. And it wasn't until I started doing stem cells and then starting to understand like, you can't, you can, but it's not wise to just go and only do juujitsu. You really Correct. You should be doing maintenance weightlifting that's designed to strengthen your joints. And so, a hundred percent I really started doing that. And that made a giant difference too. and it, instead of just thinking of it as a workout, it's always like, okay, is your car ready to get on the track? No, it's not. You need to change your tires. No, it's not. Your suspension's off. Sure. It's not.

3 (19m 23s):
You need more gas. Whatever the fuck it is. Sure. Absolutely. Treat your body like that. Don't just say, oh, fucking tough. I'm gonna show up with the flu and I'm gonna go seven rounds. No, don't do that. That's stupid. That's stupid. Every time I've ever done that, it's set me way back. It's never helped me. Never. One time that I was like, push through the pain. Has it ever been good? Not a single fucking time. So now at 56, now I'm smart enough to go, okay, don't do chin ups. You're getting tendonitis in your left elbow. Stop. You know where this goes. It's right here. You get at the same spot every time. Every time. Let's start doing some wrist curls. Every, let's start do, let's work the legs. Let's do a bunch of other shit. Yeah. Let's do heavy bag rounds. Stop, stop doing the show.

4 (20m 3s):
You do a pull down too, by the way. It's

3 (20m 4s):
Fine. Yeah. There's different stuff you could do that doesn't pull on that very specific tendon. But, you know, overuse injuries, those kind of things. So when you're doing a film like 300 and you're getting these guys prepped for this, you are you telling them what to eat? Are you, do you have a

4 (20m 23s):
Yeah, yeah. I mean it's a nutritionist's. It's awesome if I ever put you in a movie. The cool thing is, is you sh you show up, you work out, they hand you food, they like massage you. It's like the greatest.

3 (20m 35s):
Oh, that's great. It's great. They treat 'em like pro

4 (20m 37s):
Athletes. Yeah. Like pro athletes. Oh, that's awesome. You're just a pro athlete and you're like in training camp. You know,

3 (20m 41s):
Dude, I just watched 300 again this summer. 'cause my family and I went to, went to Greece. Oh, cool. And so we, let's watch 300. Yeah. And my 13-year-old had never seen Greek 300 before. And she was like, holy shit. I was like, yeah, that's a fucking movie.

4 (20m 56s):
We were just in Greece this summer too. and it was cool. 'cause we were like in Athens and we were walking up to the Parthenon and I noticed like all the gift shops, they had like Spartan shit in mouth. Yeah. And I go, I said to the guy and I, go, I'm sorry about that. And she goes, what? Talking about? and I go, I apologize for all this Spartan stuff in here. And she goes, yeah. I said, fucking movie 300. and I said, did she know that you made it? and I said, I go, yeah, that's why I said, I'm sorry I made that movie. And she goes, what do you mean you made it? And I was like, yeah, I I,

3 (21m 30s):
That's my

4 (21m 30s):
Movie. That's my movie. And she goes, no. and I go. Yeah. And then she was like, that's awesome.

3 (21m 39s):
Now she likes you. Yeah.

4 (21m 40s):
It was cool. It funny. It was a cool swing, but it was, well,

3 (21m 43s):
It's a fucking awesome movie. That

4 (21m 44s):
Cool. I appreci if You don like,

3 (21m 45s):
Like 300, you can go eat shit. Anybody who didn't enjoy that, what do you hate? Fun. Yeah. Do do

4 (21m 51s):
You hate? Well, the thing is like, also I met a lot of, like, a lot of seals, a lot of like first responders as you can imagine. Really? Really? You know, I've seen a lot of Spartan tattoos. Oh yeah. You know, 'cause of that, you know, and I and I Am and I'm proud that, you know, that they find some sort of like, inspiration, dude,

3 (22m 10s):
Leonis come that Yeah. What every man wants to be.

4 (22m 13s):
That's true. Yeah. You know, it's, it's, it's a, it is. He

3 (22m 16s):
Was perfect.

4 (22m 17s):
He, he, he knew where like, look, you know, he knew where his, he knew who to look to Yeah. To, to find out whether to burn the whole thing down. Yeah. And, you know, she gave him the, okay. and

3 (22m 29s):
It was also, the movie was brutally representative of all of both. It was, it was both like mythical and beautiful and magical, but also very tied into the ethics of the Spartans and how absolutely brutal their world was, and how they just accepted things in a way that just like, wow.

4 (22m 54s):
Yeah. That's the thing that people are always like, you know, with me, I mean, they ask me like, what about the morality of the movie? What do you think of it? and I go like, Sparta is also another planet. Yeah. Like if you, like we can't, we would not make it. Right. Right. Like to say like, oh yeah, I'm cool. Like with the Spartan I mean they would've chucked me off the cliff like day one. You know, it's not like a, it's

3 (23m 13s):
Hard for us.

4 (23m 14s):
It's a cool thing to imagine, imagine like, you wanna like say, yeah, I'm, I'm with the Spartans in this. Yeah. But like, you know, they, they were, they were brutal people. Like

3 (23m 23s):
From the jump they

4 (23m 24s):
Were a tool. Yes. They were a tool. Yes. Like we have democracy, maybe because they existed, but they weren't necessarily democratic. They didn't, there was no voting on whether or not we would like go in and die. Like that was just like what they wanted, you know, that was in their, You know, in their basic genetic makeup or in their philoso philosophical makeup was like, okay, a beautiful death. If I can get one of those, I'm good. Yeah. I'm good. and I won't give it to you. You gotta take it. Right. But yeah, that's, that, that, that's a, I love that like fast bender when he's like looking down and he says that whole thing about like, you know, what's awesome is that with all the world's armies, you know, there's gotta be one guy down that fucking place that can kill me and, and do it.

4 (24m 10s):
Right. You know? Yeah. And they're like, are you serious? Like, that's what's turning you on. You're excited about the fact that the guy that kills me might be down there. Like, that's crazy.

3 (24m 18s):
It's, I think when we look at things like that and we put ourselves in the mindset of someone who lived so many years ago, like that, there's this, there's this understanding that human beings are capable of fitting into a bunch of different Bazar groups, bunch of different strange cultures can rise. And when you have a particularly barbaric time in history, and you have this group of people in Athens that are literally changing the world through democracy and through the illian mysteries and all the shit that they were doing, people are traveling from all over the globe to come to this one spot.

3 (25m 0s):
And then you got these fucking savages. These people are the savages of savages. Yeah. The Spartans. Yeah. They're the, like, if you think about it, if, if someone says like, what kind of a warrior would you want to be? Right. If you're a little kid, I want to be a Spartan.

4 (25m 15s):
Yeah. Of course. It's why all these craziest, these sports teams have Spartans as their like mascots, you

3 (25m 19s):
Know? Yeah. And to imagine that there was a group of people that existed, a culture that existed that was completely warlike and had these tenants that were just unbendable. Yeah. And from the time you were a child, they tested you. Yeah. That's it. And if you, if you fucked up, if you failed, if you fell apart, if you quit, you were chucked out.

4 (25m 39s):
Yeah. The crypta, like they, they, you know, the, that whole thing, like where they, they would send you, like around seven, you'd go in the agi, you'd go like into the wilderness, and you were basically living among other kids that were between like seven and 13. And you just were like wild. And they, and, and the, and the, the, the sort of elite of those groups were called the Crypta. And the Crypta would come down and just kill hell lots whenever they wanted. Like, they were encouraged. The hell. Lots were that slave the slave class that the, that the Spartans sort of, that maintained Spartan society. And these guys, these kids imagine like if you lived, you know, and like in the hills, you knew there was just like this 13-year-old gang of 13 year olds that were gonna just come down and murder you at any moment.

4 (26m 22s):
And they were encouraged to murder you. And they were encouraged to do it because they like, and also the hell outs were fine. If the hell outs killed them, that was fine, because that meant they, that they weren't good enough anyway. And then they would have this, like, they did this ritual with this like table of cheese where like all these Spartan warriors would stand around the table. And all the 13 year olds who were ready to like transition into becoming true Spartans, you'd have to like, try and get and pull a piece of cheese off this stone table. And the, and the Spartan warriors who guarded the table could do anything to stop you. Oh my God. and it was just like, just beating the crap outta these 13 year olds. And they, and finally like, you know, if you got it, then you were, you were given to a Spartan soldier who raised you.

4 (27m 3s):
And basically the idea was that you, he was your lover. He was your teacher. He was everything to you because the Spartans believed that, you know, really, they believed that you, you, you would die for your, your brother if you were also lovers. You know, they thought, they thought that, like, if you were confused about why we're fighting, fight for that guy who's not only your best buddy, but like, there's like a story I guess, where they were like, the spart, when the Persians first came, they sent a scout over and the, and they looked down at the Spartans Right. The night before the big battle. And he goes, he went back and he goes, they were all like having sex with each other. It was like a weird, like, they're, they're like, it's, we're we're gonna be good.

4 (27m 44s):
And the, and there was this, one of the Spartans kings was the old, Spartan King was now working with the Persians and said like, oh no, we're fucked. They're saying goodbye to each other. Do you know, like, do you know what that means? Like, we're completely screwed. Like they're going to, like, we're gonna get murdered tomorrow. You know, like, and, and they were like, you're, you're nuts. You don know what you're talking about. Like, they're a bunch of softies. Like let's go get 'em. What

3 (28m 7s):
If that's the key to the, to being the, the absolute greatest Army. You have to be gay.

4 (28m 12s):
Yeah.

3 (28m 12s):
I you have to be gay. Well,

4 (28m 13s):
There's precedent. So don don't know there

3 (28m 15s):
Is precedent. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Like imagine if that was applied today.

4 (28m 20s):
Yeah. It could be amazing.

3 (28m 21s):
Yeah. But well, that would be a real problem. We'll see, we'll see with the family structure.

4 (28m 25s):
We'll see what they say. Yeah. Well, by the way, in the end, the Spartans had a real problem because they couldn't, we talk, there's this really crazy thing, like where on their wedding night, they would have to shave the head of your bride and dress her like a man. And she would fight you because there was no,

3 (28m 40s):
That was the only way they got hard.

4 (28m 41s):
That was the only way they could get it. Yeah. Get her ass. Because like, they needed like, oh my

3 (28m 45s):
God. That's

4 (28m 45s):
Like, unless they got like, unless they got like a bloody lip, you know, they were like, not, it wasn't gonna happen. That's so insane. Isn't that crazy? That's

3 (28m 52s):
So insane.

4 (28m 53s):
So like, you can imagine that it was hard to like keep the, you know, generate enough offspring, you know, with that. Like, you had an awesome Army, right. They were fucking the best. But like you, you're, as far as your procreation was going, it wasn't gossip.

3 (29m 7s):
I imagine being a woman back then too. Well

4 (29m 10s):
They had to run the whole show because basically the guys were just training. Right. So they, all the commerce and like the deals they were making to like, you know, okay, we're gonna make a trade deal with this. That was all done by the women because like the, the guys were like, no, we're gotta, we gotta fucking work out. It's kinda awesome. In some ways it's

3 (29m 30s):
Kinda awesome, but it's kind of crazy. Yeah. And it's kind of crazy that it requires you to be gay to be the greatest Army, because that's the one element. How much do you love this person beside you? Yeah. You

4 (29m 41s):
Gotta love him with everything. Yeah. You

3 (29m 43s):
Gotta love him with everything. I mean. Imagines the difference between you being with some random stranger on the street and a bunch of thugs attack the random stranger how you would treat it versus if they attacked your

4 (29m 53s):
Wife, you love. Yeah. Yeah. Do any you'd fight. It's different. It's totally different. I did that in, in Rebel. Moon. There's a bit where I put that there's a part where Sophia's character says like that they basically say, they encouraged me to find a lover in the military academy because when the politics of war became too abstract, like, okay, take that beach or like climb that mountain. A lot of times, you know, soldiers like, why, why? Like, there's no why, but like, if you're, but if you have a lover who's next to you, who's your life, and if they get killed or they're in danger, you're, you get, you know, yeah.

4 (30m 35s):
You're gonna be back on it. It's different. You're back on it. Yeah. and I think that it's an interesting, we don't Of course in our modern society, we don't play with that aspect of, you know, in war we try not to anyway. We seem not to. But you know, like with using the relationship to create a bond. So it, it's an inter I mean like, you know, there's, there's, there's comradery brotherhood. Sure. Of course.

3 (30m 59s):
But they've replaced that aspect of it with technology. Yeah.

4 (31m 2s):
A little bit.

3 (31m 3s):
Yeah. Which is interesting.

4 (31m 4s):
And maybe that's, maybe that's good, but maybe

3 (31m 6s):
It is good. But I mean I could imagine a world in the future where things go totally sideways. Where we go back to that. Yeah,

4 (31m 12s):
Absolutely. We'll make a movie about it.

3 (31m 15s):
I mean that's, that is a possible future dystopian movie. Yeah. Like a, a new spartas. The spartas of the, you know, 2059.

4 (31m 23s):
Well, as soon as like, you know what, what is that Einstein thing? You know, world War II is fought with nuclear weapons. War four. We fought with rocks. Yeah. It sticks, sticks in rocks, you know, so it's like a

3 (31m 31s):
Yeah. Well if it's world war that does it, it's probably gonna wipe out the whole race. But if it's something else there, there could be a, like everyone thinks of dystopia as being something man created, which is real possible. But it's also possible we get hit by an asteroid. Oh yeah. Absolutely. That's more possible. I think that's, that's more likely I think, I think we could fuck up and nuke each other. But it's probably not gonna happen. 'cause people have been really good about it since 1947. Yeah. Yeah.

4 (31m 56s):
Yes. They've

3 (31m 57s):
Been, it's nice. Congrat. Thank you everybody. Yeah.

4 (31m 59s):
Good work.

3 (31m 59s):
45, I guess. Yeah. Good work. But there's a, there's a giant difference between things that you can control and things you can't control. It's through diplomacy and people aging out. It's possible that we could never have a nuclear war. It's not possible. We're not gonna get hit.

4 (32m 14s):
Oh yeah. I know. That's why I mean. Like, I, I'm very, I I very much encourage any NASA programs that are, you know, with their, they got their telescopes pointed into the stars. They're like, oh, here comes one. Yeah. Let's see if we can go get it. You know? Yeah. Not yet. Not yet.

3 (32m 29s):
They're close. They're close to being able to do that. Neil deGrasse Tyson. So they're about a decade away from being able to deflect asteroids. Yeah. This

4 (32m 36s):
That'll be a big deal.

3 (32m 37s):
Yeah. But the hope is in that decade that we don't

4 (32m 40s):
Miss one. We don't get it.

3 (32m 41s):
Or we don't miss one. 'cause some of them come in from behind the sun.

4 (32m 44s):
Oh yeah, yeah. No. They're like, oh yeah, we don't, oh, whoop. Yeah. Yeah. That's not cool.

3 (32m 48s):
Well, is like, there's so much weirdness and space anyway. There's solar flares that could take out our whole grid and kill all our communication systems. And they just random.

4 (32m 57s):
And also the thing is like, we don't know, like say you had say we had one of those like 300 years ago, which in cosmic time is not that long ago. It's nothing. It's nothing. And we didn't have the infrastructure to know that it would happen. Like we were just a bunch of guys hanging out. Right. So like, we were just like, whoa. That's a weird, like the Aurora boreal is pretty strong today. Yeah. Yeah. That's cool. Yeah. But now we're like, oh shit, our computers are fried. So it's like a a whole different Yeah. It's

3 (33m 20s):
A whole different, it's also now

4 (33m 21s):
The stakes are different. Yeah.

3 (33m 22s):
We have the ability to go and look at the data that they had from a couple hundred years ago and say, it appears that there was an event. And the event, if it happened today, we would be fucked. Right. And we did not Same prepare, prepare for this event when we were constructing all this equipment. Yeah. We didn't.

4 (33m 39s):
Well, because we, we, because also the equipment got built. It didn't get, it got built over time. It was like a slow, you know, this made this and this made that, and we relied on this. So now we met this. Yeah. Like, we don't, we built like our house of cards like pretty, pretty, pretty quickly too. And like,

3 (33m 56s):
And the foundation's the weakest part.

4 (33m 58s):
It doesn't exist. don don't think there is a foundation because

3 (34m 1s):
It's all dependent upon the grid. I don there.

4 (34m 3s):
I really don't think there is a foundation.

3 (34m 4s):
Well, the but it, the foundation is what powers it. And it's all dependent upon a grid. Yeah. And the grid's very vulnerable, physically vulnerable. It's vulnerable to cyber attacks.

4 (34m 14s):
I like that. Also. We were like, we thought we were geniuses by putting all that online. Yeah. You know, like, oh yeah, we'll make the grid automated. Yeah. No, don't do that. It's much better when there was just a guy throwing switches, you know, like he Yeah. Way better. He's not gonna, you can't do anything to him. Just

3 (34m 27s):
Guard that guy. Yeah.

4 (34m 27s):
Guard that guy. Yeah. Give him a lot of money.

3 (34m 30s):
I love that expression in the cloud. Bitch. Where's this cloud? That cloud is in fucking Cleveland. What are you talking about? That's not cool. There's no cloud.

4 (34m 37s):
The cloud is not cool.

3 (34m 38s):
That's such a lie. Stop calling it the cloud. That's a dirty lie. Oh, it's in the cloud. I just go get it. How do you say that? Why don't you say it's in the stars? Why don't you just lie to me and say it's in heaven. Tell me it's in

4 (34m 49s):
Heaven. Say it died. Yeah.

3 (34m 50s):
All my photos of my baby. We

4 (34m 51s):
Can resurrect it. Yeah. We can

3 (34m 53s):
Resurrect it. My family, my dog, they're all unhappy.

4 (34m 55s):
Print everything I say. Print everything. That's my philosophy.

3 (34m 57s):
Well, even the print everything thing, the, the real problem with us is all of our data is in on hard drives. All of it. Yeah. And there's just paper, books, hard drives and that's it. So if something big happens, everything's useless and we start from scratch. Yeah.

4 (35m 13s):
Paper books are still kind of work. But yeah, a lot of the modern like innovations aren't probably even in paper books. They're

3 (35m 20s):
Like a lot of them. Yeah. A lot of

4 (35m 21s):
Them. Well, it's funny because like the movies, for instance, one of the things is I always archive a film print of all my movies. Because the digital storage of movies, if you ask anybody in, even in the the business, they don't know whether in 10 years you'll be able to play a movie that you have now. Like whether wow. You physically or what, or how it degrades all those things. They don't know. That's crazy. And so I'm like, I, that's why I make film prints because I'm like, I know that. Like we keep it, that we keep the film prints in the, in the, in this, you know, locker. And you can at least pry 'em out. Yeah. And, and always have it.

4 (36m 1s):
But like, I just think it's crazy that you, we don't know. We don't know whether the movies will exist. It's a crazy thing. I

3 (36m 8s):
Don. Worry about it, Zach. It's in the cloud.

4 (36m 9s):
Yeah. It's fucking in the cloud.

3 (36m 11s):
Cheers. Cheers brother. Thanks for doing this, man. Yeah.

4 (36m 13s):
I know. It's my pleasure. Appreciate it. That's hilarious. It's in the cloud. Why are you worried?

3 (36m 17s):
Yeah. That's a dirty expression that they should, they should ban that expression.

4 (36m 20s):
They love that expression though. It's one

3 (36m 21s):
Of their favorites. I know, it's a dirty lie. There's no cloud, but

4 (36m 23s):
It, it makes people feel safe. 'cause it's like, it does, it makes 'em feel good. 'cause it's like the cloud is so reliable and so like, and also a thing You don't need to worry about or understand. It's

3 (36m 32s):
Also beautiful. It's fluffy. It's in a blue sky

4 (36m 34s):
And all your info's safe in there. Yay. And nothing can hurt it. Yeah. Except for everything. It's

3 (36m 39s):
Just horseshit. It's so, it's total horseshit. It's

4 (36m 42s):
So

3 (36m 42s):
Crazy. It's on hard drives.

4 (36m 43s):
It's so crazy.

3 (36m 44s):
And if you had to start from scratch, if, you know, imagine stumbling upon some ancient Egyptian hard drives and go, okay, where do we even begin? You

4 (36m 52s):
Can't play it. Yeah.

3 (36m 53s):
You can't play it. What's, what is this?

4 (36m 54s):
We might, you might be looking at it and you don't know. Yeah,

3 (36m 56s):
Yeah. How is it encoded? What is the equipment I need to, to connect it to in order to it? Does it play out loud? Do I see it? What is this? It's, do I experience it in my head? It's

4 (37m 7s):
Like when you show your kid a vinyl record. Right? Right. I'm showing my kids a vinyl record and they're like, this is incredible. How does it work? I'm like, well, the needle kind of bounces up and down on that, on those grooves and makes sound, sounds like, sounds like a song. And they're like, that's how, that's an insane technology. I'm like, no, that's not insane technology. Your iPod or your fucking phone. That's insane technology. Yeah. That's, that's a thing. You can't, that doesn't even, you can't explain this to me. Okay. Yeah, I can, I just explained that to you.

3 (37m 37s):
I love the fact that I'm in my car and like, like my daughter loves Melanie Martinez. So she'll, I'll, I have no idea what the song is. Tell me what the song is and she'll tell me what the song is. and I can say, play Melanie Martinez, whatever the song is. and it just, it

4 (37m 53s):
Plays, it

3 (37m 54s):
Instantly plays it

4 (37m 55s):
Unbelievable.

3 (37m 56s):
Instantly. Unbelievable. And it's coming through the speakers and it sounds amazing. There's all this sound

4 (38m 2s):
That is incredible. It's incredible. It's bananas, banana, or you could say like, play Johnny Cash.

3 (38m 7s):
Instantly, instantly, instantly play hurt.

4 (38m 9s):
Yeah. Play hurt right now. Instantly. Instantly.

3 (38m 12s):
And it just starts playing

4 (38m 13s):
It. And you're like, oh God, why'd I say that?

3 (38m 15s):
Yeah.

4 (38m 16s):
Why did I say play hurt?

3 (38m 18s):
Play. God's gonna cut you down. What a world that we live in instantly.

4 (38m 31s):
By the way, I was just incredible. I was just listening to that the other day.

3 (38m 35s):
Is this is gonna get us in trouble with YouTube.

4 (38m 37s):
Is it? Oh, sorry. Fucking I did wanna show you this picture of a's legs m if you hum it too. Well,

3 (38m 41s):
It'll, we were so much better off when we were trapped in our world walled garden. Oh

4 (38m 47s):
Yeah. Oh yeah. We, we got out and now it's, now it's over.

3 (38m 52s):
It's fucking nuts, man. It's nuts. I, I think it's beautiful because I love the fact that you can tell me about something and I can get it instantly. Like someone could say, oh my God, you have to see.

4 (39m 3s):
That's Sandra's legs.

3 (39m 4s):
Oh my God. That's insane. He looks like he's gonna die. Yeah. And

4 (39m 8s):
He loves that.

3 (39m 9s):
That's, that's particularly ridiculous. Isn't that

4 (39m 11s):
Crazy? Yeah. That's awesome.

3 (39m 13s):
The guy has no body fat. Zero

4 (39m 14s):
Body fat. What is his body fat? The guy said to him, the guy at the gym said, are you 8% body fat? He goes, if I was 8% body fat, I'd kill myself.

3 (39m 24s):
That's so ridiculous.

4 (39m 26s):
But that's his thing though. Like, he literally is like, I, I am in space. I'm like a spa. You know, like we get stuff from the space program, you know, like they, like, we figure out how a razor works or like Right. Get shaving cream that keeps the hairs from flying. That's what he is to me. Like, he's like, I'm, I'm up here on the ragged edge so I can come, I could give you this information back. Like, oh, that's

3 (39m 45s):
An interesting way of looking at it. Right. Like, you do learn health and wellness things from people that are on the fringes in the bodybuilding world.

4 (39m 52s):
Yeah. And he's in his sixties, so it's like, you know, you're like, okay, this guy can have legs like that in his sixties. So gimme some, gimme, gimme a little, gimme a little, you know, of the, gimme a little of the knowledge. Yeah. And he is funny too, because he is like, look, don don't have a family. don don't have kids. This is what I do. Jesus. You know, this is what I do. Sixties just getting jacked. I get jacked and I like research. I test my body constantly. He's like on the ragged edge with every single, like, you know, like, he's always making these small adjustments. He goes, I ate a sesame seed and I saw that I was a little less ripped. You know what? You know? So ridiculous. You know what I, because it's like, oh, he's constantly like, you know, like, it's like he's on a razor's edge and I, which I love.

4 (40m 36s):
You know, people

3 (40m 36s):
Like that

4 (40m 37s):
Are extreme,

3 (40m 37s):
Super beneficial to any sort of sport. Well,

4 (40m 40s):
That's what I mean, extreme sport. That's what I'm saying is that like you can, the little that that those little pieces of information they tell you about, like, oh, you know, like whatever, I'm taking this. Or like, I, I thought about this and I experimented with that. And you're like, oh, okay. Like thanks. Yeah. Thanks for that. Thanks. Thanks for being out there. Right. You know, thanks for being the oxygen mask. Like up in on the stratosphere.

3 (41m 0s):
Yeah. The possessed Mad Genius. Yeah.

4 (41m 2s):
It's, it's they, by the way, the world's made of that.

3 (41m 5s):
Oh yeah. There's a guy out here in Austin, Texas. His name is John Donaher. He's widely considered to be the greatest jiujitsu coach ever. Oh

4 (41m 14s):
Really? He's here

3 (41m 15s):
And he's a professor. He was a professor of philosophy at Columbia. That's cool. And was spending time as a bouncer and wanted to learn martial arts. Got into Juujitsu and became a juujitsu fanatic to the point where he was teaching it and sleeping on the floors.

4 (41m 31s):
Did he have natural classes? Gift for it anyway. Like, it was like a Well,

3 (41m 34s):
He is a very strong

4 (41m 34s):
Guy. A double double.

3 (41m 35s):
Okay. He's very strong. He played rugby, but rugby destroyed his knee, fucked his body up, but which kept him from event ultimately competing. But he's just a, a crazy mad Genius. It doesn't give a fuck about anything but fighting. So all he's doing is like teaching people how to strangle people during the day and then watching tape and review, reviewing techniques and creating the next, the next workout schedule. And they work out 365 days a year. That's awesome. 365 days a year. Yeah. And his number one student is Gordon Ryan, who's widely considered to be the greatest juujitsu athlete of all time. Without question. That's his belt up there. The Abu Dhabi.

3 (42m 15s):
Oh, that's when he went Abu Dhabi. But he's his number one student and they just train 365 days a year. They take no days off Christmas. Fuck Christmas. You your birthday. Fuck you. That's

4 (42m 26s):
Cool.

3 (42m 26s):
And it's just, that's cool. You've got days where You don't train as hard. Yeah. Are you worn out? Well, you're not gonna train as hard today. Yeah.

4 (42m 33s):
And then tomorrow. Well it's like you were saying, like, yeah, like you understand the, but like at that point you're in the rhythm. You understand your body, you know, like, well, okay, I'm hurt today. I know how to do this. But we're always learning. We're always gonna, we're not gonna stop learning. We're not gonna stop understanding. That's the one thing that's crazy about YouTube too, is that this idea that there's a resource, you know, like it used to be to find a technique or to learn something, you have to go to the guy's house fucking sleep on his porch. Yeah. He, he's not gonna fucking train you. Right. He's gonna slap you around. Like, whatever. We're now like these kids today, they could like a lot of their shit, the basic shit. They, they, they can, they're like, I'm learning this. I can learn something that I had no access to.

4 (43m 13s):
Absolutely zero access, which I think is incredible.

3 (43m 15s):
That's, I have a folder on my phone that's all Juujitsu moves that I didn't know existed. and I just watched the Juujitsu moves. How is he, how is he doing that left leg in? Oh, he went with the right arm. Wow. And then I'll, I'll send it to my friend Eddie Bravo, who's a jujitsu instructor. I go, is this legit? And he goes, I'm gonna try this tonight. See? Yeah. And then we'll, we'll text each other back and forth. So we're like, it's a constant new thing. Sure. That's cool. There's the basics. Put

4 (43m 40s):
It in the workshop and let's see what happens. Yeah.

3 (43m 42s):
A kid could be just, all you need is a computer that connects to the internet and a friend. And you can get good at Juujitsu. Yeah. It's better to have private instruction. Of. course. It is better to have a, a co a coach who, you know, when you're teaching your classes, you've gotta make sure this arm is protected and keep this here. And you have to have the defense. You have to put your hand on the hip. If you don't have something like that, it's gonna take you longer to figure it out. But if you are diligent and you're really dedicated and you have a fucking YouTube connection, you can get good at Juujitsu. Yeah. No, I,

4 (44m 12s):
I think

3 (44m 12s):
That's true. I used to have to go to the mountains'.

4 (44m 14s):
That's true. Well, that's what I mean. Like, and that's true of a lot. That's true of a lot of things now. Like I, look, I just, I had this, like recently I had this crazy Fortnite addiction. Right. And I was like, oh no. Yeah. I started playing. I could get it. I started playing Fortnite with my son who's 10. And he was like, nah. He tapped out immediately. And I was like, well, you should come back. 'cause I'm just, this is kind of cool. So I'm playing and then like, I, you know, three months later I'm like, what the fuck does the matter with me? Yeah. Like, I bought, my wife is like, you got to stop. I'm done with this. I'm done. Right. You and

3 (44m 42s):
I are the same thing.

4 (44m 44s):
I go, I'm so, she's like, I'm so done. You need another fucking hobby. Right. Like, and so she's like, I bought you some clay. Right. Oh. And so I started doing some pottery. Right. And that's where I was like, oh, YouTube is insane. Like, 'cause I just, in like three weeks I had done like all, so now she's like, every, every search engine is like hand build pottery, like glazing firing kilns. Oh, that's cool. So yeah. So I have like much more productive, it's much, well, by the way, I get something at the end like, and you feel better. I feel so much better

3 (45m 16s):
Feeling that you get, when you play video games, it's for 12 hours in a row. You feel terrible when it,

4 (45m 20s):
It's over. You feel sick to your stomach. It's literally too like, and you have something good happen. You're like, yeah. Like, I'm like, fuck yes. And my wi I look over and my wife is like in the doorway going like,

3 (45m 30s):
What's wrong with you?

4 (45m 31s):
Are you serious? You're

3 (45m 32s):
A grown ass man. Should

4 (45m 33s):
You not be making a movie right now? Or like, writing something or doing something

3 (45m 37s):
Serious. Well, it's important for people to know that even people who are successful movie makers are still gonna get addicted to those goddamn things. They're heroin. They're too good. They're so good.

4 (45m 47s):
They're so well made.

3 (45m 48s):
We had a giant quake problem and I had a giant quake problem for years. and I quit and I quit cold Turkey. and I realized it was like just I was playing eight, 10 hours a day.

4 (45m 58s):
You can't see the hours. That's what does it, when you see the hours, when you see like a total number of hours that you've played. You're like, okay, I'm, I, yeah. Well, I could've written a novel. Literally.

3 (46m 8s):
I could done learned so much. I could've done so much. So I stopped. But then when we had a new studio in Los Angeles, we had a big warehouse and we said, let's put a fucking land in here. So we put a local area network and bought some gaming computers and set it up for Quake. And instantly I was a junkie. Again, back scratching my face. I was fucking, every day we were playing three, four hours a day. It was nuts. It was nuts. It's,

4 (46m 33s):
See,

3 (46m 33s):
It just gets right into your, it's too good. It's

4 (46m 36s):
Too good. They're good at, well, I saw that you're better, man. Like, you're, you're

3 (46m 39s):
Racing

4 (46m 39s):
Simulator. Racing Simulator.

3 (46m 41s):
I haven't even hopped on that yet. but it, we've had it for over a week.

4 (46m 43s):
The with it is, it's too, it's like Racing. Yeah. It's like, the one thing I did, like, I I, I saw this the other day where they had the, one of the F1 guys went against like some, some kid, and he beat him. And I was like, that makes me happy. On

3 (46m 59s):
The Racing simulator.

4 (47m 0s):
On the Racing Simulator. Yeah. Of course. And I was like, that made me happy. Well, only just because, you know, you want that skillset, you want in your mind, that skillset set to translate. Yes. Like you're like, see,

3 (47m 11s):
I was watching this thing on 41 drivers, like all the different things that they have to be able to do. Their response time is so much faster than anybody else's. They had this thing where they had the lights and the lights go off. You have to touch the light when it goes off. Sure. And the Formula One race car drivers were like off the charts. Oh, really? And they all, they just wired different. They have crazy thick necks. Oh yeah. From the, because it's just,

4 (47m 31s):
And also the helmet's not light, you know, it's like a serious Yeah,

3 (47m 33s):
Yeah. It's a fucking serious piece of weight up there. Yeah. Bouncing your head around. No,

4 (47m 37s):
It's fucking

3 (47m 37s):
Crazy. And you're whipping around and I'm sure you've seen the, the comparison between a GT three car and then a Formula One car on the same track. No.

4 (47m 44s):
No. It it

3 (47m 45s):
Wild. What what the GT three car looks amazing. And then the Formula One car, like no way. That's not real. Is this real time?

4 (47m 52s):
Oh. As far as like, it being able to stick to the track where like, it's

3 (47m 55s):
So much faster.

4 (47m 55s):
It's so much faster.

3 (47m 56s):
Yeah. It's so much faster. And you're, the time that you have, watch this. So on the left side you have the GT three cars. These are Oh, so these are just GT three cars? No,

4 (48m 5s):
That's, that's the,

3 (48m 6s):
Oh, the, the right is the GT three car. The left is the Formula One car. Look how much

4 (48m 10s):
Faster we go. Oh yeah. It's gone. Yeah.

3 (48m 12s):
They're fucking insane. I mean they're so fast. And the way they hug. I went to the Coda, the Formula one. That's crazy. Race out here. Here. Yeah. Yeah. It's insane to see it live. Yeah. To see it. Lot of you really appreciate it. She's just like, oh my

4 (48m 27s):
God. My daughter Willow's addicted to Formula One. She's like, I sent her down two years ago to it. and it was like, like, you know, look at that. See it,

3 (48m 36s):
That sound too is amazing.

4 (48m 39s):
Woo. Yeah. Like the GT Q, they look like they're not even moving in comparison. Yeah. It's not even close. Yeah. And she, I sent it out. 'cause I, at the time, formula One was wanting me to, we were gonna do a film. I was gonna do like a commercial for them, you know, that. and I, I was in the middle of pitching them and they were like, oh, can we send you down to Austin to the race? and I said, you know, I can't, 'cause I'm in the middle of this thing, but you can send my daughter. And Willow was like, she had like, pit access. She was like losing her mind. She's calling me every five minutes going like, are you insane? Look at, there's, there's like, you know, Hamilton, I can't believe it's right there. And I was like, okay, calm down. Don't be a groupie. I like, I want you to like, she has like a tattoo of like Formula One. Like a, like a Oh wow. A car. Yeah. She's really into it. But,

3 (49m 16s):
Well, I know that Netflix series out here in America made it way more popular in

4 (49m 21s):
America. Blew, blew it out. Blew it. Yeah. Blew

3 (49m 22s):
Out. 'cause it didn't make any sense that it was so popular worldwide. Yeah. But not popular in a place that's most obsessed with cars. Yeah. Like, makes no sense. You

4 (49m 30s):
Feel like we would just be like drinking the Kool-Aid of that so hard?

3 (49m 32s):
Well, all our thing is just going around a circle real quick. Like, our thing's so silly in comparison. Like nascar. Yeah.

4 (49m 39s):
No,

3 (49m 40s):
NASCAR is so silly.

4 (49m 41s):
It's crazy. And you'd think that like, we would dig like this kind of all the turns and like the insane technology, it's like, feels like it's right on our wheelhouse. And maybe it and and I think it can be,

3 (49m 51s):
Well, it turns out it is. It's just got to takes a, it's something like, it has something like a Netflix special has to happen for it. It's like what happened with the UFC with the Ultimate Fighter. The UFC was always like crazy exciting. But then the Ultimate Fighter put it on television. Everybody's like, wow, this

4 (50m 7s):
Is nuts. Yeah. And you get to like, invest in a personality. Yes. You know, that's, I think that's in the end. Americans love that. That they want, that they wanna hook onto someone and ride 'em, you know, through the whole thing. Yeah.

3 (50m 19s):
Yes. Yes. Yeah.

4 (50m 20s):
That's the, that's the

3 (50m 21s):
Fun. They, they want to get connected to that person and root for them and feel the journey, especially the Ultimate Fighter was such a brilliant idea because you get these guys to live in a house together, and then they're gonna beat the fuck out of each other. and it really, they know they're gonna have to fight's. Great. So there's all the psychological warfare going on. There's like chest pump puffing and there's so much weird shit happening. Yeah.

4 (50m 41s):
It, it's, by the way, it's a great, it's a great show. And also because like, the drama, if you have fighting and drama together. Yeah. It's kind of a, it's kind of like a amazing combination. Right. You can't, you can't look away really.

3 (50m 52s):
And it's real fighting I mean,

4 (50m 54s):
And it's absolutely real fighting. Yeah. Yeah. Like, you know, it's not like fucking around. And these guys are fighters. You know what I mean? Like, that's the thing. It's not like they, you got a bunch of schmucks and said, okay, you guys get in a ring and sort of see what you can see what happens. Yeah. Like these guys suddenly are like c

3 (51m 7s):
And guys have gone from that show to become world champions. Absolutely. Which is wild.

4 (51m 10s):
That's cool. Yeah. That's why it's very cool. And you, and you're like, oh yeah, I saw them when they were, when they were just like, scrapping around the house. You know, it's, it's cool to see 'em like Rise like that. It's a, it's, it's, it's, it is, it's an amazing show. It's, it's cool.

3 (51m 25s):
Well, there's a few things like that, like Formula One Racing and, and fighting that. It just has to get in front of enough eyes. It's just, we have these things that we've always, like baseball, that's always been around. If you brought baseball out today, no chance. It doesn't have a chance. Chance

4 (51m 38s):
In hell no chance. It's zero chance Golf. No chance.

3 (51m 41s):
I think golf would still make it.

4 (51m 43s):
Well also because it's a ludicrous concept. Golf. That's what I love about it. It's like I and I, you know, I'm an okay golfer. I've done a lot of golf commercials. My dad's a scratch golfer. He's an amazing golfer. You've

3 (51m 52s):
Done a lot of golf commercials

4 (51m 53s):
Too. Yeah. Back in the day. You know, like, 'cause when I got outta college, I did like 10 years of, of TV commercials, you know, and every day, like all, and I did all I, I've done every, all the brands, every, like, I've done a bunch of Super Bowl spots. I did the, the like Clydesdale nine 11 tribute spot. Like, there's a lot of all these kind of, for me that were all these like, kind of touchstones. But along the way I did like, you know, PGAI did Titleist, I did like all these, like, you know, I have a tour bag like in storage that says like, Zach Daddy Snyder on it, like on my tour bag. Yeah. So, but, but like, the guys, like, you see these like I mean, they are like, Phil Mickelson is like an insane, like, he, he does this trick where you stand with your hands like this, you know, and then he's behind you with this pitching wedge and he takes a full swing and cuts it.

4 (52m 49s):
If he skulls it, it's going to crack you in the back of the skull. but it goes over your head and lands in your hands. Right. What? That's

7 (52m 55s):
Wasn't standing right in front of you. I haven't seen The Landing and Hands one, but this kind

4 (52m 59s):
Of video goes around. Yeah. It's literally this watch, right. This he do it right. He's gonna do it like,

3 (53m 6s):
Oh my God.

4 (53m 7s):
See like where, see that? Yeah. It's like, that's the, I did a spot with Phil. Fuck

3 (53m 12s):
That. I

4 (53m 13s):
Did a spot with him where he, I did a spot for Hi, I think it was, it was for, it was with David Robinson for the PGA tour. And he, he was sick. He had like a hundred degree temperature. And like, what it was, was basically we did these things. These guys are good. It was, was the name of the campaign. and it was like all these football players. And like golf would be, it was, it was a ludicrous idea. Golf would be in these scenarios. And this was basketball. It was like one second left. You know, up, Phil Mickelson comes in to play this basketball game. They're gonna play with a golf ball. And they throw him the ball, the ref throws the golf ball to him. And he's, he catches the ball on his, on his, on the, on the, on the, on the blade of his pitching wedge.

4 (53m 60s):
Traps it on the ground and then hits, picks it off the, the, the, the, the gym floor, you know, and the ball flies up. And then David Robinson dunks it. That was the commercial. So he's sick and he's like, Zach, don don't know man. Oh. Also we did a version of it where we had made the floor about a balsa wood so he could take a divot. Oh wow. And then the PGA was like, well, we don't wanna look like it's, they, they were kind of mad 'cause they were like, we don't wanna look like we're destroying property. I was like, come on guys. It's like, cool. Like, it's cool that he digs the floor up. Right, right.

3 (54m 32s):
They can fix wood.

4 (54m 33s):
Yeah. And it's also not real. You know, like, he can't, you can't actually do that. That's funny. They that sense. but it was cool. They were, that's funny. They were that sensitive. But yeah, it was cool. They were that sensitive. But like, Phil comes out and he's like, Zach, sorry man, I'm sick. Like don don't know. Like, I go, well, let's just try, you know, do what you can. and it like, it'll only be a couple shots. And so he is like, I'll do the best I can. So like, you know, he throw him the ball and he, he just like cuts it in the air and it, you know, like he, he like cuts it in the air and he traps it with his club. I'm like, holy shit. And he's like, cosh, how's that? I'm like, how's that? It's like, fucking unbelievable. He was like, I'm sorry. I'm like, don don't know what you would do different. Like, it's, it is so crazy. So it's,

3 (55m 10s):
It's interesting when you see wizardry at that level. Yeah. Like the technique and the perfection of it at that level.

4 (55m 15s):
It's so incredible. You're like, fuck,

3 (55m 17s):
I didn't even play golf. and I could appreciate

4 (55m 18s):
It. Yeah. Like John Daley too. Like, we had, I did a spot with John Daley too, and he was like, he's ama he's like, comes out, you know, and I guess the, the tournament before the one we had done before the shoot that we did, we, we, we were doing it in, in Kaminsky Park in Chicago. Right. And he was, the idea on that one was like he's, you know, top of the ninth, two outs down by three bases loaded, whatever, whatever, you know, and pitcher, here comes John Daley. Right. And so what we did was, so the idea was like, we had this like minor League pitcher was supposed to throw a pitch and he's, you know, we did with visual effects, he takes the ball of the air. So what we did was we got this super long tee right. And we put the ball on it, and I was like, John, do you think you can, can you hit a drive with a two foot tee?

4 (56m 3s):
Like, that sounds crazy. He's like, ah, fucking no problem. But, but like, when he came out, he was mad because he had picked up his ball. Like, you know, he got fined by the PGA. If you pick up your ball halfway through the tournament, you can't just leave. They don't like that. and I guess he was having a bad round. And so he just said, fuck it. And he just picked up his ball and walked off. And they were like, like, so they fined him and he was super mad that he got fined. And so he goes, he goes, I'm gonna fuck up that jumbotron. And I was like, I was like, John, don't I go, it, that's me. I'll have to pay for it. It's not the PGA. And then he was like, so he's like, oh man, I'm so sorry. Like, okay, I won't hit it. I didn't know. Like, I thought, you know, he's like the sweetest guy.

4 (56m 43s):
And then he just like, he just cranks this. You, he, he's like our Babe Ruth. Like, he literally, I've done a bunch of spots with him, you know, like on his wine, like on his back wing, the club head is pointing down at the ground 'cause he's so twisted. And then he just uncoils and it's just unbelievable the amount of power that the guy, and he hits the ball outta the stadium and it goes literally, we had PAs in the parking lot and they're like, the ball just goes over their heads and it's like into the freeway. You know, he's just a freaking jaylee.

3 (57m 19s):
Do you have that video that I sent? It's just a monster sent you recently of that guy. This, there's this fucking guy who does this step in mode before.

4 (57m 28s):
Oh, right, sure. Like the, the, the, the, the Happy Gilroy. It's, well, not quite that,

3 (57m 32s):
Not quite, not quite that. But with technique. And it's perfect. And the drive is insane. And the torque is insane. Again, this is coming from someone who doesn't know jack shit about golf. Look at this kid.

4 (57m 46s):
Jesus, Jesus

3 (57m 49s):
I mean that is fucking insane.

4 (57m 55s):
The fact that he can actually, with that amount of backswing, the fact that he can actually hit the ball cleanly is unbelievable.

3 (58m 1s):
Is he from, is that Chinese? don Don't know about I,

4 (58m 5s):
I don't know. It looks like Japanese to me. Is it Japanese? His writing is Japanese,

3 (58m 9s):
Isn't it? So he's Japanese, isn't it? There's a lot of I mean it's very popular in Japan. Or is it? Yeah, his name is Japanese. Korea.

4 (58m 15s):
Korea, yeah. Korea. That's unbelievable. That

3 (58m 17s):
Fucking technique is mad.

4 (58m 19s):
That's so cool. Let

3 (58m 20s):
Me hear that again because the

4 (58m 21s):
Sound, the sound is awesome. That's where there, that could be, there's balls that do that,

3 (58m 27s):
Bro. I don't give a fuck. What does that,

4 (58m 32s):
I also like where

3 (58m 32s):
It ends. The club ends in front of his face.

4 (58m 35s):
Yeah. Past

3 (58m 35s):
His face near his

4 (58m 37s):
Left shoulder. There's so much whip on the, on

3 (58m 39s):
The, it's amazing. That's crazy.

4 (58m 40s):
But yeah, it's fun. That's wild. But yeah, that, it was fun actually that time in my life, traveling around and doing all those TV commercials all over the world. Like I had a crew of guys, it was like me and my boys. And we would just like, literally go one job, Papua New Guinea, one job Germany, one job Mexico, one job Iceland, like over. And we were just on the road completely out of our minds. and it was just, you know, and like whatever product, we'd be like, okay, I'd be pitching, the guys would be like, what are we doing next? I'd be like, I, I gotta get on a call. We, like, I have an agency and I'd get on the call in the hotel room and I'd pitch 'em and I'd be like, be outta my mind I don know what I'm saying? And I'd come out and they'd be like, how'd it going?

4 (59m 20s):
And I, I think I got it. And they were like, how'd you, did you nail it? I was like, yeah, I told 'em it's gonna be like low angles and slow motion and it's fucking cool. And they were like, okay, cool. Let's go. and I. and it was just this, we were just in this machine and, and, and frankly I learned everything. Like I spent 10 years, you know, like the 10,000 hours thing. It literally, I spent 10 years with every production problem. 'cause I was a director of photography. I was the DP and the director. And you know, we were a pretty small show, you know, but we had giant clients. Anything you can think of. So then when I went to make a movie, it wasn't like, there was no, there was no thing I hadn't seen, you know?

4 (1h 0m 3s):
Right. It wasn't like I stepped on a set, like, oh, I'm a first time director. Everyone's like, oh, this guy's a first time director. Like, what's his, you know, what's he gonna say? And I'd be like, there, there was like, the tools were my tools. You know what I mean? Like, I was very comfortable with the tool set that I had in front of me. Like more so than I probably should have been. You know, I remember Matt Leonetti, who was the DP of Dawn of the Dead, that was my first movie, was like halfway through the thing. He's like, you know, you know you're doing like, you know, you know what I mean? Like, you know what you're doing. Like, he goes, they can't fire you now because like, we were halfway through. 'cause like I was so diligent, like on my first move I was so scared.

4 (1h 0m 45s):
You know, Scott Stuber, who was the executive at Netflix, who was my executive on Army of the Dead, he was the one that hired me to do Dawn and I was so I wanted to do such a, like, I wanted to be so conscientious and I was so scared of like going over budget and not nailing it and making sure it was cool and all that, that like, Matt and Eddie at one point was like, look man, like you gotta just fuck it. You know, you're, it's your make it cool now. Don't give a fuck. Just make it do what you think. and it was such great advice because I think the movie's edge and all the coolness in the movie and the man comes around and all the like, weirdness.

4 (1h 1m 28s):
The whole like montage with the richer cheese song in the middle. That was all just me going, all right, good, thanks Matt. I'm gonna just go. And he goes, good. 'cause like, you know, he goes, otherwise, he goes, you're just gonna make a movie that this zombie movie's gonna disappear. You know, unless you fucking add your sauce. Yeah. Go. You gotta add your sauce. 'cause he goes, otherwise it's like, look another zombie movie. Like, who cares? Right? Like he goes, you, he goes, I know, you know what's cool? Well, you made it fun. and I think that that was the whole thing for me. It was like, how do you make a b movie that's self-aware that it's a B movie? Right? Mm. And in that self-awareness, it lets you off the hook to enjoy it because you can still be smart.

4 (1h 2m 9s):
Like you deconstructed the genre you, 'cause like, I've always been fascinated with genre and the deconstruction of genre. Like I'm a genre filmmaker. I always say to everybody, like, people like what kinda kind of film I'm a genre filmmaker. Like, and that is to say that like in genre though, you can explore like philosophy, you can explore mythology especially, which is like, myth is like my main, like we make myth, modern myth movies are modern myth superhero movies or modern myth. Like, is it not the same when you say like, we have Superman, right. And Batman or whatever. Are they not the mythic answer to the modern, a lot of modern questions about like, how we should live, you know, like you say, Superman, is he not an, like an invention, a 20th century invention that says to us like, all the fucking shit that we run up against, whether it be war or like class struggle, or whether it be, you know, you know, inter relationships between different countries is, does Superman not appear an answer to us primitive brains trying to figure out what the f where we are?

4 (1h 3m 24s):
Like you make a guy like Superman so he can answer some of those questions. He can represent a point of view that is not helpless in the face of the insanity. That is like, you know, the, the problems of the 20th century. and I think, and Batman in the same way, he's an answer to like urban, what is urban? The urban jungle needs a myth. You know, just like the ancient jungle needed a myth or the ancient, you know, those all, like in those days we'd say like, why is the volcano erupting? Right? But now we say, 'cause we didn't know, you know, we were just like, I guess it's the gods are mad, you know? Right. And but now we have, now the problem is like, why am I, why do I feel helpless in the face of technology or whatever.

4 (1h 4m 10s):
Right. You know? So we need an answer. We need an additional answer. and I think that's what, and that's what I've always and I feel like genre has allowed me to make those comments. You know? and I think, and it, you know, look, the funny thing about, you know what I always find interesting? You know, the, the, the thing that I always find fascinating about sort of the movies I've made and and how they've landed on pop culture is that like, I remember like in the last article, it was like the, the, it said Zack Snyder love him or hate him. Right? Like, and I'm like, hate him. Like what? I don't understand. Like what it's just, it's a movie. You know? Like it's not I mean you look at Rebel Moon, you're like, okay, well there's not a lot.

4 (1h 4m 50s):
It's not, it's not, it's not weird. It's not weird enough. It's not offensive enough to hate him for Right. In my opinion, people

3 (1h 4m 60s):
Find a reason to hate today.

4 (1h 5m 2s):
Oh yeah.

3 (1h 5m 3s):
Yeah. And 99% of those people also hate themselves. That's exactly what's going on. And when people are very hateful over art, you can like it. You don't like it. I don't, there's a lot of stuff don don't like

4 (1h 5m 16s):
I have no issue with you not liking the movie. That's not, that's not the that'ss, not the question that who cares. Yeah. The thing is, like, you, you would personalize you'd hate me because of like, I don't understand that. Like, I, I, I don't I mean

3 (1h 5m 29s):
Like, because you're un unreasonably successful. Well that's, that's what that how they feel and that's what what happens with people. You've, you've done so many hit movies like, fuck this guy. Like, people compare themselves to someone like yourself that's been so successful. And they get angry. That's why you can't read comments.

4 (1h 5m 44s):
Yeah. I get No, that's why you promise you cannot read comments, never read comments.

3 (1h 5m 47s):
Comments are, you know, they're essentially long form comments are what a lot of articles are. Yeah. It's the same thing. That's exactly

4 (1h 5m 53s):
What they are.

3 (1h 5m 54s):
It's, it's these people that are film snobs that get, you know, very pretentious about certain aspects of movie making and decide that their way is the only way. Like, listen, I like the Barbie movie. Okay. I found it. Sure. Enjoyable. Awesome. I went with my daughters and I had a good mindset. I said, lemme just enjoy this movie. Sure. Just not be like, what the fuck is this man didn't fuck this You don fucking, I just said, this is a fun movie. Yeah. It didn't offend me. It, it, I, I laughed a bunch of times. I thought it was fun. and I went online and saw so many people angry about that fucking movie and it was all men. Yeah. and I as it would be I was like, listen, you first you're outta your fucking mind.

3 (1h 6m 38s):
If you go to a Taylor Swift concert and you expect to see ac CDC, you're outta your fucking mind. You're going to a Taylor Swift concert. You know what it is. So if you go to see the Barbie movie, you know what it is? Why you mad?

4 (1h 6m 51s):
Yeah. You no one. Like were you, were you shocked? Like it's literally about, it's called Barbie Girl's Doll. Yeah. What did you think was gonna happen in it? Also? and I, by the way, I love the movie and I'm actually lampoon in that film. There's a line in the movie that says, I feel like I am, like, I feel like I was in a dream where all I cared about was the Zack Snyder cut of Justice League. That is a line in that movie. That's hilarious. I'm literally, and I'm like, that's awesome. Like, I have no, I think that that I was like, okay. My wife was like, she goes, that's cool, right? Like that's cool. They ca that that that they came after you I was like, that's a hundred percent cool.

3 (1h 7m 29s):
Yeah, it's fun. Yeah. It's, it was, it was inter But it's interesting to see when there's like such a strong reaction to certain things, and especially amongst like really wild, hardcore fans. 'cause there's hardcore, like, it's particularly

4 (1h 7m 46s):
Trust me, I know. Yeah.

3 (1h 7m 47s):
You, you face well you also face it because you, you cover these genres. You cover these subjects that are, that are iconic Superman, Batman, I mean just those alone. No,

4 (1h 8m 2s):
No. And by the way, that's a lifestyle choice for a lot of people. It's not a movie. Right. Right. It's not a movie. It's like, it's not like if I made a romantic comedy, you'd be like, okay, that was fun. Right. Like, I, the people who love, and, and by the way, I love that they feel this passionately, I'm, I'm not, in no way would I criticize that because I feel I live the same life. Right. Because like, it's, yeah. For me it's morning, noon and night. But so for those guys, it's not just a movie. And so you have to, on some, on some level, you have to acknowledge that the, they, this is their religion, you know? And they feel strongly about it.

4 (1h 8m 42s):
and it, by the way, the truth is it's my religion too. You know? So it's a, it's a, it's a, I I tend to get in trouble because of my, I I do take a deconstructivists point of view because of Dark Night Returns, 'cause of Watchmen. Those, if you've read those two comics, it's hard to go back. Mm. You know, to like, yeah. It, you, you wanna, and it, it's because I care that I wanna take him apart. Like, I want Batman. Like, people are always like, well, Batman, I Batman can't kill. Right. So Batman Can't Kill is Canon. And I'm like, okay, well the first thing I wanna do when you say that Is I wanna see what happens.

4 (1h 9m 23s):
And they go like, well, don't put him in a situation where he has to kill someone. I'm like, well, that's just like you're protecting your God in a weird way. Right. Right. You're making your God irrelevant. If he can't be in that situation, he has to now deal with that. Yeah. You know, if he does do that, what does that mean? What does it, what does it, what does it tell you about, does he stand up to it? Can he survive that? Right. As a, as a God as your God. Can Batman survive that?

3 (1h 9m 47s):
I never thought that that was Canon that Batman can't kill. but

4 (1h 9m 51s):
It, well, for a lot of people it is,

3 (1h 9m 52s):
It seems ridiculous given the circumstances in which he operates.

4 (1h 9m 56s):
Well

3 (1h 9m 58s):
And all the weapons

4 (1h 9m 59s):
To the ass. Don't read the comments right now. Don't read the comments. Yeah. There's, this

3 (1h 10m 2s):
Seems ridiculous.

4 (1h 10m 3s):
It's well, I mean, and you know, there's this huge, like, there's so in Dark Night Returns, there's a scene where, and I copied it kind of in Batman versus Superman, where he grabs the M 60, he busted the wall and he grabs the M 60 and he's like, the guy's like in the comic book, he's like, got this kid, the, the Mutant has this kid with a gun to his head. And he's like, I'll kill him. I swear I'll do it. And Batman says, I believe you. And he shoots him straight in the head because it's like a no win scenario. It's like the Khi Maru of, you know, the Khi Maru is that in Star Trek? It's that test they put Kirk through where there's a no win.

4 (1h 10m 44s):
Right. Because they wanna see how you'll react. Mm. Right. So they say, okay, we're gonna make a, we're gonna make a scenario, a test scenario where you don't win, where there's no way to win. And in that situation, we find out what you would do in a no win situation. Because if you're gonna be the commander of this spaceship, you have to, you're gonna be in situations where you know it's life or death. And especially when there's no tricking it. Right. There's no tricking death in this case. And the famous thing with Captain Kirk is he, he went and hacked the machine and made it so there was a, a solution. Yeah. And so that was his response to the no win situation was create a scenario where he wins, which is cool, which is a cool character.

4 (1h 11m 27s):
You know, that's a cool character move. But like, that's kind of how I felt. That's what they would say. Don't do that to Batman. Don't put him in a no win situation because we don't wanna see him lose. Like, we can't see him lose, he has to maintain this God-like status. And that's what the cool thing about Frank Miller. Frank Miller said, fuck it, I'm gonna like, I'm gonna, I wanna see who this guy really like. If, if a guy, so you're saying to me that I've got a gun to this kid's head. You're Batman, I'm gonna, there's no move, there's no trick, there's no throwing the battering, there's no dust ball to distract me. Like I've, I've just gotta pull the trigger and I kill this kid.

4 (1h 12m 10s):
So you're saying in that scenario, Batman, what Batman's supposed to do. Right? Right. Yeah. He's gonna lay down his gun. What, what's he gonna do? Like it, it's the guy says to him, I'll do it. I swear it,

3 (1h 12m 24s):
I believe he was perfect. Yeah.

4 (1h 12m 25s):
I believe you and I believe you. Yeah. You know, so I'm just like, that's where like Frank Deacons takes Batman and just tears him in half. Yeah. And you've gotta now come out the other side of that. And Batman is still the hero. Batman still does the right thing. He maintains his code, his eth he doesn't change, but like, our perception of him changes and I think that's like a, that's the, i I and I have run afoul of, but, but a lot of the fandom who have, I feel like, who have like, gotten to the same place I have with the characters where they need to test them to like, and I feel like the characters, it's been my experience that the characters have not let us down.

4 (1h 13m 9s):
Like these myths have not let us down. They have, they've main, they they, you put them to the ragged Edge into that scenario and they come out the other side and you're like, fuck Yeah. There's a reason why Superman is Superman. Mm. You know what I mean? Yeah. There's a re like, he can handle it. He can fucking take it because he's so iconic. Like, you see like the red s you go anywhere in the world with that Superman t-shirt on anywhere, and you say to any kid, like, what's this? Oh, that's Superman. Yeah, exactly. Like, you know, that means something that's like fucking cool.

3 (1h 13m 40s):
Well, not only that, it's one of our first ever superheroes. Literally. Yeah. I mean, just think of the name. It's so unoriginal Superman.

4 (1h 13m 49s):
It's the most, you couldn't think of that today. That not, it's so ridiculous. You, you can't do that

3 (1h 13m 53s):
Today. I know. If you tried to come up with a Superman today, but it shut the fuck Superman.

4 (1h 13m 57s):
That's

3 (1h 13m 58s):
Horrible. That's your guy. Yeah.

4 (1h 13m 59s):
You know,

3 (1h 13m 60s):
Come on man. We've got so many different interesting

4 (1h 14m 2s):
Characters out there. But that's what, that's why the Trinity, Superman, Batman Wonder Woman are so powerful because they're literally obviously the origin concept. Right. Wonder Woman.

3 (1h 14m 12s):
Literally. Yeah,

4 (1h 14m 13s):
Batman. Batman is the only anomaly because he is like a Batman. Like what does that mean?

3 (1h 14m 17s):
Right. What does, he doesn't even have powers.

4 (1h 14m 19s):
Yeah. He is just like a, he's half bat, like, what is that? He

3 (1h 14m 21s):
Just got a lot of money.

4 (1h 14m 22s):
Yeah. He's got a lot of money. Yeah. That was like my favorite thing we did in in, in Justice League where Bruce says that line about like, when, when Flash says like, what's your power? And he is like, I'm rich. I always thought that was cool. It's

3 (1h 14m 36s):
Kind of crazy that no one decided to genetically experiment on a Batman. Like make, make

4 (1h 14m 43s):
A Batman. Yeah.

3 (1h 14m 43s):
For another, another version of Batman. Like take a guy and hit him with some Wolverine juice or whatever the fuck. And just, oh, other

4 (1h 14m 51s):
Animals

3 (1h 14m 52s):
Just turn him into a superhero. Yeah. Instead of have him just be a rich guy, give him some crazy genetic mutation. Something that they do to him that turns him into something. But I

4 (1h 15m 2s):
Think that, and that, that is the thing I I mean, not to that extent, but that's the thing that Frank does. And that's the reason why I wanted Affleck. Because like to me, Batman's a big dude, right? Affleck's six four, you know, he's like a legit big dude. And you know, like in the shoes, the shoes, the boots are like two inches. So like, he's literally almost like, you know, six six in the, in the costume. Like when he comes out in the costume with that little bit of I mean, we put some muscle on him and then there's a muscle suit under the suit. And he's like, it's a, he's like legitimately a scary looking thing, you know, he's just like standing there and you're like, holy shit. Like, dude, the chin is so insane in that cowl, you know, he Yeah.

4 (1h 15m 45s):
I mean, look at him. He's like, you know, he's, I took that picture by the way. You know, he's like, legitimately, like, that's Batman to me. Yeah. I mean don don't, I don't know like what, you know, because

3 (1h 15m 56s):
Christian Bale is a great Batman. He's

4 (1h 15m 58s):
A great Batman, but he's still like, you know, you know, five 10, you know, it's, it's, it's cool. I mean not to be, I'm not Yeah.

3 (1h 16m 6s):
Does mean something

4 (1h 16m 6s):
I'm not being rude about like, was

3 (1h 16m 7s):
Batman giant in the comic

4 (1h 16m 8s):
Books? In, in, in, in some of the, like in in Dark Knight Returns and in, in Frank's comics and like, you know, in the classics, he's pretty big dude. You know, he's always been pretty thugg and Dark Knight Returns, if you look at Dark Knight Returns, you know, like he's, there's a line like where he is trying to hold someone's gun and his finger can't get in the trigger guard. 'cause he's so big. You know, like, like where he is, like, you know, I, I like things like that. Like where you're just like, he's like, he has this, this genetic like, gift of just being this big fucking dude. And other than that, you know, his parents were murdered in front of him and he's also like a billionaire. Yeah. So like that, that weird, like, you, you want it to not be just one of those things.

4 (1h 16m 52s):
Right. Right. You, it needs to be all of them in order for him to really, to do what he can do.

3 (1h 16m 58s):
But if somebody really wanted to fuck around with a genre today, if he had all that money, wouldn't he invest in some wild genetic engineering that turns him into an actual superhero?

4 (1h 17m 7s):
Yeah. It's, it's, well, I, I think think that, that that's the real, that's the fun

3 (1h 17m 12s):
Of it that Batman fans are pulling a hair on. Yeah.

4 (1h 17m 13s):
Like, they don't like saying fans on steroids.

3 (1h 17m 17s):
Not just

4 (1h 17m 17s):
Steroids. Not just steroids. You wish it was steroids.

3 (1h 17m 19s):
Yeah. I'm talking something way crazier.

4 (1h 17m 21s):
Well, it's funny because like, I did that scene, like, there's that scene I think it's in, I don't think it's in the, it might be in the theatrical, but it's definitely in the director's cut where like, he's wakes up and there's some chick in the bed with him that from the night before. 'cause like I always say like, you know, Batman fucks to forget for sure. You know, Batman's a drunk for sure. You know, 'cause like he has huge trauma. Right, right. Like, and I think that like, you know, you wonder why he's a playboy. 'cause like, you know, like anybody, like that's a common, you know, fucking forget is a common, that's a real thing. That's a way to deal with trauma, you know? and I think that, like, I have that there's that bit. He like wakes up and there's like just painkillers on his bedside table and he just like pops him and drinks some wine. I'm just like, you know, to me that's, that's like, that's like, that's Batman.

4 (1h 18m 4s):
You know, like he's, you know, he's got his, he's got a Mapplethorpe above the bed. He's got his glass house. Mm. And he's just like, he, he has a, he has an aesthetic that's like clean, but like, that's all he does. That's like his life. You know? Like he,

3 (1h 18m 19s):
The thing about Batman, the modern versions of Batman, the Miller Batman, your Batman's, the this what what what's interesting is that now superheroes are these flawed, like very, very distressed characters. Sure,

4 (1h 18m 34s):
Sure, sure.

3 (1h 18m 35s):
Like the Watchmen's the best example.

4 (1h 18m 37s):
They're all Watchmen is all trauma.

3 (1h 18m 39s):
It's all, it's all trauma. and it's cr they're all crazy. They're

4 (1h 18m 42s):
Completely crazy.

3 (1h 18m 43s):
And it's, it's such a good mood. Why, why the fuck was there never a watchman too?

4 (1h 18m 47s):
Well, because, you know, frankly, the comic book doesn't exist for me. That's why there wasn't, I I I just was like, the thing that's awesome about also that the, it it's one of those things like when you start to really, you know, look at like, night Owl not being able to get it up because he's not, he's not in his costume. Like, that's just a cool, to me, that's just like a, that's like pure, that's like, that's boiling down superhero to its fucking purest thing. Yeah. I don't get turned on unless I like, I gotta go out fucking save some people, do some crime fighting and now I'm fucking ready to go. Yeah. You know, like that, that to me was like, that's, that's, that was like that that, that as a superhero movie as a concept took a long time to like, like land with the boys or like these other kind of superheroes where now it's cool to deconstruct superheroes.

4 (1h 19m 40s):
It's kind of fun. Everyone's having a good time with it. Right. and I was doing it, whatever, almost, you know, 15 years ago. And, you know, it, it just, I I just don't think superheroes were as deep in the culture as they are now, where like all those things would land. You know, like all that deconstructive kind of work that we were doing at the time was really in reference to comic books. Not comic book movies because Watchman was written, you know, in response to the comic book industry. Not necessarily comic book movies didn't exist when the, when the book was written. Right, right. You know, so it's a very much, you know, Alan Moore was very much obsessed with the morality of comic book heroes within comic books.

4 (1h 20m 24s):
And so, and he, he just took an adult look at it. You know, he's a smart Genius. He's a fucking pure Genius.

3 (1h 20m 30s):
So, well that was the thing that people figured out along the way with graphic novels as well, was that comic books aren't just a thing that children like, you know, I, I was a giant comic book fanatic when I was a kid and I wanted to be a comic book illustrator. That's what I wanted him to

4 (1h 20m 45s):
Do. Oh, cool. Oh, that's awesome.

3 (1h 20m 46s):
And I had one bad high school art teacher and it ruined it for me.

4 (1h 20m 49s):
Fucking guy.

3 (1h 20m 50s):
Fucking guy. He, he ruined it for my friend John Devore, who was the most talented guy in the class. When I found out that he gave him an F I was like, are you outta your fucking mind? This guy was so talented. Wow. And he was like, I was pretty good. And he was sure quite a bit better than me. And then there was this other guy named Kevin who was in our class who was also like really good. And all of us wanted to be comic book artists. And I was really into the more adult versions of it. Like there was some there amazing like horror genre comic books back in the day, like Creepy and Eerie that had these incredible like TTA covers Oh yeah. On the, have you ever seen Creepy and Eerie Sure.

3 (1h 21m 30s):
Of

4 (1h 21m 30s):
Course.

3 (1h 21m 31s):
Yeah. God, I love those

4 (1h 21m 32s):
Things. Well, I, I'll I'll tell you my Sorry, go ahead. Finish your

3 (1h 21m 36s):
No, no, go ahead.

4 (1h 21m 36s):
But you wanted, oh, so what I was gonna say was that like, I was obsessed with growing up this comic book called Heavy Metal. Yes. Love It. Which, and Heavy Metal is like, my thing. Basically what happened was my mom, I had bought I was like 13 or whatever, and I had bought maybe 12 even. I had bought a copy of Heavy Metal, whoever sold it to me. 'cause you know, it says Adult Illustrated Fantasy Magazine right underneath, like in kind of small letters, but it's there. Right. I would cover it with My Thumb when my mom was around. But she, one Christmas like got me a subscription to Heavy Metal.

3 (1h 22m 12s):
Did she know? She didn't

4 (1h 22m 13s):
Know. She just thought it was a cool comic book. Right. and I didn't say anything. Of course. And that really, that comic book and I, and when you see the R-rated version of Rebel Moon when it comes out, because basically the deal I made with Netflix was they said, I wrote this script and I said, this is the script I wanna make. And they said, that is insane. and I said, yeah, but it's like, it's a heavy, it's like heavy metal, but like a, but like in, you know, live action. Yeah. And they were like, yeah, is there any way it could be PG 13? And I was like, well, if it's PG 13, it kind of misses the whole point a little bit. But I can imagine that, you know, for a mass audience and for like, you know, viewership, that seems like the smart way to go.

4 (1h 22m 58s):
I go, what about this? What if we make, if I make take this script, I make you a PG 13 version that you can just blast into the world and hopefully as many people see it as possible. And then you let me, as a bonus, you just let me make this version exactly as I think. And they were like, okay, that sounds cool. So coming at the end of the summer, you'll see my two three hour versions of Rebel Moon that are like hard R rated the hardest, which you wanted to do, which I exactly wanted to do. So they said, yeah, go do that. And so they, they were able, 'cause normally when I do this, director's cuts, you know, which is a thing now I'm weirdly famous for the director's cuts.

4 (1h 23m 44s):
Were always an answer to a thing that the studio made me do. Right? Like, here's my movie. They're like, yeah, we really want you to cut these parts out 'cause they're not cool. They're like, the movie's too long, or the movie's too violent or whatever. and I would be like, wow, really? Because I really think that's kind of the why of the movie. And they'd be like, no, it's really important. The focus groups told us that they don't like that, so take it out. So I'd take it out, but then I'd go like, you know, I'd go over to home video right across the street and I'd be like, Hey guys, you want another movie to release? 'cause I got the shit. And they'd be like, absolutely whatever you say. Because you know, at that time there was a huge market for directors. It gave 'em a second kick at the Can in home video.

4 (1h 24m 27s):
So they would be like, that's so cool. We get a whole other movie to market that like never before seen footage. Right. You know, it just feels like a cool thing. And so that was how I've always done my directors s always as a response to what the studio was telling me couldn't be in the movie. Hmm. Because I, I never planned, I would always go into it like bright eyed, like, oh, everyone's gonna love this. It's clearly, you know, the studio when when you see my cut, you're gonna think it's amazing. And they would like look at it and go like, bro, like that's no. Like, this is too much. And so that's what, that's where my director's cuts kind of as a, just as a practice were born. You know, it was, it was born out of that me needing to show the world what I intended.

4 (1h 25m 10s):
Mm. Originally. And so, you know, by the time now that I've got to Netflix with this Rebel Moon movie and my sort of the mythology around my director's cuts was kind of a thing, especially with Justice League, as you can imagine. They were like, you know what, why don't we do a director's cut as part of the process rather than as a response to it. Mm. And I was like, that's really smart. Like, that's really cool because in a lot of ways I totally get the economics of making a pg 13 version of this insane genre movie. Because what I'm asking, you know, from a budgetary standpoint is high for like a boutiquey space movie that's a like, you know, a heavy metal comic.

4 (1h 25m 57s):
You know, that's like a people who love that will love it more than anything else. Right. If, if I, if I can land that, they'll think it's the coolest thing ever. But like for a mass audience, it might not be exactly what you would imagine. So I'm like, I can do both. And that's kind of what, and that's kind of where I, and that's why when you see the R-rated version of of Rebel Moon, you're gonna be like, fuck, this is, this is heavy metal I come to life is really what it is. Mm. And that's kind of what I really wanted to do. That's, that was the thesis of my whole, like me get being turned on by the sci-fi. Because like, the thing you can do, I feel like the thing that you can do with, with that format was you could really deconstruct sci-fi.

4 (1h 26m 39s):
Like we always talk about, like I said this at the director's gig, I was like, when Luke Skywalker walks into the Cantina and like is confronted by walrus man, like, is that sexual? Like, is that, is he like, he's fucking with Luke Luke's like some farm boy in this bar, in this rough bar. Like, what's gonna happen to Luke? Right. Like that's a conversation you cannot have Right. In star in the context of Star Wars. Right. Right, right. There's no chance. Right. Like that's not gonna but like in, in heavy metal, that's real. Yeah. That, that threat is real. Yeah. You know, and it's not, and it's not anything other than like a naive farm boy walking into like a gritty city bar that he doesn't know what the fuck he has.

4 (1h 27m 27s):
No, he's out of his element. Other than that he's our hero. Right. And he's gotta go through a crucible and he's gotta learn, you know, he's gotta like, these are the like Joseph Ian parts of his journey. So anyway, but that, and that's kind of what it's cool because, you know, I I've always been like the hugest fan of Heavy Metal. I think it's like the fucking cool, it was the coolest thing. Heavy

3 (1h 27m 49s):
Metal was amazing. It's

4 (1h 27m 50s):
Like, it always like made me, it kind of broke me for comics a little bit because, you know, it was always like super sexy and super violent. And so you'd get a normal comic and be like, when are they gonna start fucking because Yeah. You know, it's,

3 (1h 28m 2s):
Yeah. It was always sexual. And there, there was one that I remember that I remember it was like very stunning to me. Very shocking when I was a kid. and it was a, a pretty sure it was heavy metal, but it was a, it was one of those genres where it was a guy and his wife started a relationship with a robot.

4 (1h 28m 20s):
Oh yeah. Cool.

3 (1h 28m 21s):
And he tried to like, fight off the robot and the robot broke his arm with his big dick hanging out. Like the robot had like this big giant flacid dick and he broke the guy's arm and was like smiling at him. and it was just like so

4 (1h 28m 33s):
Crazy. Yeah. Jesus Christ sounds amazing.

3 (1h 28m 35s):
It was amazing. but it was also like indicative of that, that genre that those days, like this is the seventies, right? The seventies when they first started publishing that. Right.

4 (1h 28m 45s):
Yeah. All, all that was on the ragged edge, which was so, and it was so underground and so cult and so weird. That's what I loved about it and that's what I wanted to do with the movie. It's like, say, what is the cult underground raw sci-fi movie look like? You know? So is

3 (1h 28m 59s):
It hard to do the PG 13 version?

4 (1h 29m 1s):
It was very, it was very hard. It was really, it was really,

3 (1h 29m 2s):
Is it conflicted? Like what does

4 (1h 29m 4s):
It feel like? It was super conflicted. Although the only thing I will say is that I was liberated by the fact that I knew the R-rated version exists. So there was in the other versions of, of this work in the other director's cuts, there was a version where that director's cut never was seen. Mm. There's a very good chance that that movie never got saw the light of day because where would you show it? Right. In the old world, in the movie days, right. All you had was DVD as your option. And if DVD said, yeah, we're good with like, just the normal version, then that would've been it. Yeah. and it would just die of death. And you would, whatever you intended for the movie would just never be seen.

4 (1h 29m 44s):
And that's just how it was. And so this, in this scenario, I was like super grateful to Netflix because I was like, you guys have like done a thing that I've never been able to do my entire career. And that is like, know that this version of the movie exists and it's gonna be seen. So I'm happy to do whatever we, whatever you guys think is right for the PG 13. I'm like, I'm a good soldier and I, I'm proud of it and I love it. But yes, it is different from like what I, you know, was

3 (1h 30m 15s):
What if the R version, is it NC 17 or r Did they do NC 17 anymore?

4 (1h 30m 20s):
It, it, it's, I won't say the exact rating. We're waiting to see, we're still like up against it, but we're trying to get it, it it, it, it, it's TBMA right now. What

3 (1h 30m 30s):
Does that mean? don

4 (1h 30m 31s):
Don't know. No one does mature

3 (1h 30m 33s):
Audiences. Yeah.

4 (1h 30m 33s):
You know, like any TV show that's not 'cause like in tv the cool thing about TV is they have TV 14 and then it goes tot VMA TV. VMA literally has no top on it. Mm. You know, like even gonna, I think it's like, almost like porn is tv. VMA is I don don don't know what I I I look no one understands the ratings. No one does. It's an alchemy that is impossible to know.

3 (1h 30m 58s):
It's all subjective.

4 (1h 30m 59s):
Right. It's all subjective and Bazar. And so, you know, and they also, it's genre related, right? So like, say for instance, the ratings board might say something like, well this is a sci-fi movie. So it's, it's, it's too much. But if it was a horror movie, it'd be fine. But it's a sci-fi movie, so it's not fine. Or it's a superhero movie. That was the whole thing with Batman versus Superman. I remember the ratings board said, we just don't like the idea of Batman fighting Superman. I was like, what is that? Like? But what, how is that your opinion? Like how is that, that has nothing to do with the rating. The

3 (1h 31m 35s):
Ratings

4 (1h 31m 35s):
Didn't like that. Yeah. Yeah. They kept saying like, we want, they kept making it an r they kept coming back with an R for us and we were like, we really, what do you want us to cut out? And they were like, well, we just don't like the idea of Batmans fighting Superman. and I'm like, I can't take that out. That's the,

3 (1h 31m 47s):
That's so ridiculous. They would have that kind of power.

4 (1h 31m 49s):
So it was crazy. So we really had to trim it. Super. It, it, it's,

3 (1h 31m 54s):
It's, do you think that affected the final version?

4 (1h 31m 56s):
I mean if you see the director's cut of Batman versus Superman, it's much better. It's a much better movie. I, in my opinion, it's a much better movie. Well,

3 (1h 32m 3s):
It's representative of what you actually wanted to create.

4 (1h 32m 5s):
Yeah. and I think that, that, that's, that's true of all the director's cuts that I've done is that I, it's just a glimpse into the why that you get to see better the why of the movie. The why of its origin. Yeah. What it, how it, 'cause like obviously something kept me awake for two years writing. Right. Something kept me jazzed about like, fuck yeah, I can't wait to do this. I'm drawing, I draw for Rebel Moon. Like I drew 3000 storyboards for that movie. Like, that is like a lot of work. You know? That's a lot of work to like, you know, to, you gotta care. That's five months of drawing after I've written the script. Wow. So I've written the script for a year and a half and then I draw the movie for like another five months.

4 (1h 32m 46s):
Wow. It's fucking insane. Oh

3 (1h 32m 48s):
My God. You must have been going nuts. Yeah. It's must've been missing Fortnite. Yeah.

4 (1h 32m 51s):
Yeah. That was before Fortnite. If I had, by the way, it's a good thing I didn't have Fortnite. 'cause I would've like, would've

3 (1h 32m 57s):
Ruined everything.

4 (1h 32m 58s):
The problem with writing and with for me drawing is if I have one procrastination I can do. Yes. One, yeah. I'll take it. Yeah. Because like if I look at that blank pad and I look at the video controller, video game controller, I'm like, oh yeah, this is way more satisfying. Yeah. That, that thing was wants to fuck me up. That pad is trying to fuck me up.

3 (1h 33m 20s):
The thing about the delayed satisfaction though is that if you could force yourself to get to the pad when you're done, you'll feel good. And if you play the video game you'll feel. Last night I started fucking around in my office. I was just watching YouTube videos and looking at pool cues. And then I said, all right, go to work. and I snapped and I went to work. and I worked for a couple hours. And when it was done, when I went to bed, I felt great.

4 (1h 33m 46s):
Awesome. No, I

3 (1h 33m 47s):
Agree. I felt like I did it. I did something. I agree. The feeling of doing something is so much better than the feeling that you have to carry for hours of fucking off when you knew you were supposed to do something.

4 (1h 33m 59s):
No, a hundred percent. I, I couldn't agree more. And then, by the way, and, and in the end, I did it. I did that work. and I show, like when, you know, it, it, when we went to film the movie, and I've always drawn the storyboards for my movies. It's like a, it's, it's, it's a problem. But it's, it's, it's a thing that I do it, it's my only process. It's funny 'cause when I made soccer punch, I remember we were talking about it, and I think it was my script supervisor. She said, one day, you're gonna like, not need to draw these drawings, and you're just gonna, you know, you're not gonna need to spend that time. and it, it's just funny that like, in retrospect, it's like, obviously I have to draw the drawings. Like, it, it's like, let, like that's my process now. I realize there's no way around it.

4 (1h 34m 40s):
There's no, like, you want a cheat, you know, like, I wish I had a cheat where I didn't have to draw the drawings where I'd be like, oh no, it's gonna be fine. I, I think I can make it up on the day and it'll be good. and I do make it up on the day. But the truth is, that process of drawing is the process that I, I vet a lot of the ideas in that drawing. It's not just drawing, it's writing as well. I'll change the script. I'll do whatever. I'll like, no, no. 'cause that doesn't make sense. Look, when I see it physically, I'm like, no, you can't. That doesn't work. So I have to re sort of construct it in the drawings a little bit sometimes. When

3 (1h 35m 14s):
Did you start doing that?

4 (1h 35m 16s):
I started doing it. I did it throughout, I did it 300.

3 (1h 35m 21s):
Did you learn it from someone?

4 (1h 35m 23s):
I know, I'd always drawn, like, I, I draw and like, you know, I'd gone to school for fine arts, so I was always drawing shots. And so it's also a thing like in film school or when you're trying to think of something, movies take so much resource, right? You need like, to make a movie. You're like basically an architect and you have to convince someone to build a building. Right. And it's so much work to convince people like to invest, to dig the, get all the cranes and the steel. It's like impossible. So drawing is like a little taste of it, right? So like, I can make, these are the shots I wanna make.

4 (1h 36m 4s):
Right. Right. So in a weird way, it's like, it's, it's, it's, it's drawing that beautiful sketch of the building. It in a lot of ways that's what it's gonna be. You know, so you can get a feeling for it. Right. and I think that's what it does for me. It, it satisfies the, the impossible group activity that's gonna require me to like, convince people. Maybe that's why love Fountainhead. You know, like it's a, it's like that, it's that process of like getting people to like believe in this thing. That it's gonna take resources and like so much crew and building and designing and all that other work that's down the road.

4 (1h 36m 46s):
It's the, it's the drawing that I think is a little bit of a, it's, it satiates that desire a little bit for

3 (1h 36m 54s):
Me. It gives them a framework too. There's like, there's

4 (1h 36m 56s):
Something, oh, it's hugely beneficial in the production process. Once they have that, they, everyone knows exactly what to do. Mm. You know, it's incredible tool. Once I have it.

3 (1h 37m 7s):
Did you do it for Watchmen?

4 (1h 37m 8s):
A hundred percent. My Watchman books are insane.

3 (1h 37m 11s):
Did you draw Dr. Manhattan's Dick Of

4 (1h 37m 13s):
Course?

3 (1h 37m 14s):
That's the question. Yeah. Here's the question. You could you make that movie today, don

4 (1h 37m 18s):
Don't know. Would they allow I mean that? Like, that's what's

3 (1h 37m 21s):
Interesting, right?

4 (1h 37m 21s):
Someone once gave me a statistic of how much time Dr. Manhattan's cock is in the movie. Like just full frontally in the film. and I think it's a fair amount. Like he, it's, I think it's the, I think it's the only studio film. It holds the record for most frontal nudity, male frontal nudity of any, you know, and it's kind

3 (1h 37m 42s):
Of important.

4 (1h 37m 43s):
It's super important because he doesn't give

3 (1h 37m 45s):
A fuck. He doesn't give a fuck, obviously.

4 (1h 37m 46s):
Yeah. Like, he walks around like

3 (1h 37m 48s):
That. He's a god. He's

4 (1h 37m 49s):
A God. Like, what the fuck? You can't deal with it. Get the fuck. Like, I'll fucking vaporize you. Or I don't even care what you think. You're a, you're a, you're a cockroach. Yeah. It's like, what does he say? He goes, he goes, the world's smartest man is no more dangerous to me than its smartest termite. Like, it's like such a cool thing to say. Like, you know, like he's, he doesn't like, you know what I mean? It's like you really realize in the face of a God, like he's does I've walked across the surface of the sun. Yeah. You know, he's like, I don't, no, he was the coolest. He's the best.

3 (1h 38m 16s):
He's the coolest. And the transformation scene is fucking amazing,

4 (1h 38m 19s):
By the way, that one of my, we were just talking about it the other day, like, one of my favorite sequences in any movie I've made is his, the, the birth sequence of Dr. Mennet. The whole thing with the Philip. 'cause we, it's Philip Glass did the music. Right? We borrowed the music. 'cause I had heard that music and I was like, it's gotta be this music. And then we tried to, like Tyler Bates, who's an amazing composer, he tried, we tried, I, I go write me something that's better than this. And we just couldn't do it. So we just had to license it from, and I had to send Philip Glass's sequence and he watched it and he said, okay, it's cool. You can have the music. That's

3 (1h 38m 53s):
So cool. Yeah.

4 (1h 38m 54s):
Because it's like, you know, it's just so, it's just so Yeah. Play this, play this. It's just so rad. I

3 (1h 39m 1s):
Love this fucking scene

4 (1h 39m 2s):
Here, here this, that's Phil Glass, this music,

3 (1h 39m 5s):
When he knows he's fucked.

4 (1h 39m 9s):
We built this giant oversized watch for those shots. That's good. Yeah. That's that Philip Glass. So good. That music is

3 (1h 39m 20s):
Crazy. That fucking birth scene is insane.

4 (1h 39m 22s):
It's so good.

3 (1h 39m 22s):
It's, it's so insane. It's so good. The skeleton in the hallway with the muzzles screaming. Oh my God.

4 (1h 39m 28s):
I remember shooting that exactly like, as if it was yesterday. Yeah. We had this air can of, we had a fire at that guy with the mop, you know, because he, when he, he like gets hit with it and he was like, overacting. I think we did like three takes. I was like, guy, just, just the first time he like flew on the ground, I was like, okay, it's too much. It's good fun. Yeah. That's really cool. It's interesting because like, you know, we, I think one of the things that we, after Justice League, I think one of the things that we, we really as a, as a group, as a family anyway, you know, 'cause I lost my daughter over that, you know, she, once my, well, you know, on the, at the post side of Justice League, my, I lost my daughter to suicide.

4 (1h 40m 12s):
And, you know, I left the movie famously. And then the movie went on, and then later we were able to like, you know, finish the movie sort of in, in the way that we, we, we had always hoped and I think the thing is that, like, the thing that I kind of sort of come back to when I look at that and when I look at the, the movies is like, you know, we, there are these markers, you know, the movies are really these markers of time that we, even though they sort of transcend time weirdly, you know, they, they exist beyond the time they were recorded. You know, at these weird, like they, they're in the computer as sort of these singular, like little, you press it, but then it runs and it's real and it's time.

4 (1h 40m 56s):
and it takes time to enjoy it and time to, like, you can't just say it. You have to watch it and feel it again. You know? Right. It's like a cool, it's a weird thing in that way. And, and I and I think that like, it just, the thing that you hope is that in the end, you know, the markers meant something to people. You know. and I think that that's, we've really fought around because a lot of these mental health has been a big thing for my wife and I, you know, since losing my daughter. And we've always tried, we've tried the best we can to like, support. The fans have done incredible, like the fans of raves, like millions mil over a million dollars just to support, you know, A FSP, which is a, you know, suicide, you know, against suicide in, in America Foundation.

4 (1h 41m 43s):
And we've been like, just, it, it's been cool that the movies these moments have, like now in retrospect have like a purpose, you know? And that they have like, that the fans have gotten this opportunity to kind of like, you know, join with us and kind of like, be with us to like, you know, and, and you know, this 'cause it's a huge stigma, you know, like people, nobody wants to talk about like, that they're having trouble, you know? Right. That, that they're, you know, that they're not okay. Right. and I think that what we've been trying to do lately as much as we can is like, say like, no, it's good. Like, you know, it just, it's okay. You know?

4 (1h 42m 23s):
Like, it's not a sign of weakness. It's nothing. It's just, it's real, you know, it's, it's part of being human. It's kind of a hundred percent part of being human. and I think that it was a, you know, we've all, it's an easy thing to kind of say that, you know, it's just stressed or it's, I just like, I'm, you know, I'm good. I'm not depressed, I'm fine. You know, and it's an easy thing to just try and muscle through. Right. Where like, you know, I, I think that, you know, it's my hope anyway that like, as a family that, you know, the movies and our connection to the fans and our connection to like that cause has been really, really deep.

4 (1h 43m 5s):
and I and just watching this actually just, it started me thinking about like, what the movies mean. You know, like how they're, what is their legacy? You know, what, what are they? And if they can do on one on one hand, they are the moments you see for me, Dr. Manhattan, Leonis, whatever it is, you know. But then on the other hand, there they can be, they, there's this other narrative outside of the stories. You know, like the what was what I was experiencing and what made me think of it is like, what, what I was going through at that on that day when we filmed it, like what I was struggling with, what I was trying to deal with, you know, is, is real.

4 (1h 43m 48s):
That's hard stuff. You know? That's just, that was just life being lumpy for us. Us you know, just trying to make a movie, living in Canada, being away from the kids, just all that, all that struggle. And, and then it's cool when, you know, it's been cool for me that when the fandom and the movie, like in the case of Justice League, they lined up, you know, where these, these, these people were like, no, we're not gonna, we, we want, we, there's a movie out there that we wanna see. And it's, it's, it's around a struggle that we had as a family. And all of it sort of came together. I always say like, you know, people are like, you know, the fandom was toxic or whatever. They were like, they were so angry to get the cut that they were like, I go Also, also, they literally, people's lives were saved by the money that those kids raised.

4 (1h 44m 38s):
Like literal, like lives real, tangible lives. Were saved by that money. That, that those kids that you called that you would say are these toxic fans, they're also responsible for the saving of lives. And that's just real. You have to acknowledge it because if you don't like you, you, you, in some ways, the legacy that they were able to create is like dismissed and I just, I, I won't, I, I I can't. Well,

3 (1h 45m 4s):
That's just a reductionist view of things that people always like to apply the things that are controversial, especially when they're talking about your fans and saying something like, they're toxic. That's such a dismissive thing. No, there's gonna be some elements of any passionate, rabid fans Of course that are gonna be toxic because it means so much to them. And that's what you have to understand the reason why they're behaving the way they're behaving. The reason why they're screaming is First of all, they don't think they're being heard. And second of all, it means everything to them. These people that are like deeply invested in your films and, and particularly like things that have like this sort of iconic history, like the Watchmen or like Batman, I mean these are very important things to people.

4 (1h 45m 47s):
A hundred percent.

3 (1h 45m 48s):
A hundred percent. It's like the same way people are fanatical about sports teams the same way they're fanatical about, you know, music.

4 (1h 45m 54s):
It's tribal, you know, it's tribal.

3 (1h 45m 56s):
A hundred percent. It's very, very tribal. So for you, when you have vision and you have these storyboards, and you have all this stuff that you, and then you see something like, in my opinion, that birth scene is one of the great masterpieces of that genre. It's a masterpiece. It's like watching him be born and become Dr. Manhattan. It's fucking amazing. It's just, I remember being in the movie theater watching, going, oh shit. It was the perfect feeling. It's like what you want from these fantasy, escapism, graphic novel turned films. It was perfect.

4 (1h 46m 33s):
Yeah. And it's cool. And even just like watching it and like, you know, the comment, like, I never said that, that, that, that the Superman was real and he's American. Yeah. I said that God was real and he's American. And if that doesn't give you like, religious like fear Yeah. Then like, you're not, then you're just not human. Like you gotta like, it's okay. Yeah. It's okay to be scared, right? 'cause it's fucking scary. Yeah.

3 (1h 46m 52s):
He's real.

4 (1h 46m 53s):
Yeah. It's a scary thing's. It's

3 (1h 46m 55s):
A very scary thing. But it's, it's all, but it's cool. Yeah. But when you have these ideas and you have all this work and then it comes together, I mean, that's gotta be insanely satisfying to watching a scene like that. It is,

4 (1h 47m 5s):
It, it's a cool, like, I guess for me, you know, like that the process of like putting it together and then like, when you, when it literally lands and you, and it's what you drew and it's what you thought and the music and everything like lands, it really, it is, there is a, like I mean, I'm sure it's like anything, it's probably like the same thing, like doing standup or whatever. Like when you, when like it all, when you're grooving, when you're in the groove with it and it's just happening, you're kind of surfing it and you're like, God, this is the, this is the feeling right here. Right? Like, yeah. You can't acknowledge it in the moment, but you could feel it, it could push you, you know, like, it's like a wave, you know? And you can feel it. It's the, that's how it is. You know, for me it's, it's such a long process, you know?

4 (1h 47m 48s):
It's, it's not instant gratification, you know, it's a very, it's like you really have to have like a head down mentality to get it to that position. Right. 'cause, you know, but I, I do, when I watch it that first time and it comes back and I'm like, yeah, that's, that's like fucking, that's, that's what we, that's the why of it right there, you know? and I think that, that keeps me going. Frankly. You know, that little, that little high is, is really, it's really fun. Well, that's

3 (1h 48m 14s):
The goal, right? The goal is to create that high and that high people leave a film like that. That's like, there's, you'll do things that you wouldn't have ordinarily do. Like, you'll, you'll maybe you'll, you'll be inspired. Maybe you'll start working on something. Maybe there's certain things and I that I think that's the, the beauty of creation in a lot of ways. It's not just escapism, but it gives you, it's like a drug. It gives you this like, boost of excitement that often leads to inspiration, to inspires you to action things.

4 (1h 48m 49s):
100%. People do things. 100%. I, I feel like that, that if you can do that, then your movie's like, yeah, it's a huge success. If one guy comes up to me, like, the thing about Man of Steel that I, that I've always, that I've felt like is that Man of Steel is the movie that the people will come up to me and say like, that movie changed my life. Like that movie. Like, you know, like, I thought it was about me. You know, like I'm an immigrant. Like, I just saw myself in, in Superman. It's like really like, you know, I was struggling at the time and when I saw it, I was like, and I. And I'd just be like, man, that's so cool. Like, I'm, I'm so grateful that like, you know, you felt that way about the movie, right? 'cause like, I don't, you know, like for me it's like I send it off into the world.

4 (1h 49m 31s):
You think about like Netflix for instance, where like you push a button and like, you know, Rebel Moon, right? The zeitgeist is crazy because like Rebel Moon, so say right now there's like, it's like almost 90 million views, right? 80, 90 million people. 90 million starts. So, or 90 million accounts said, turned it on. Okay. Right. Give or take, they assume two viewers per screening. Right? That's the kind of right math. So you think if that movie was in the theater as a distribution model, so that's 160 million account or people supposedly watching based on that math.

4 (1h 50m 19s):
So 160 million people at $10 a ticket would be what? I, I, what is that math? don don't know. 160. 160 million times 10. That's 1.6 billion. You know? So like, you look at the view numbers, you sort of, you can use that rough, you know, so more people probably saw Rebel Moon than saw Barbie in the theater. Right. That's how crazy Netflix, that's how, that's how, that's the distribution model that they've set up. You know, I was like, I was at this thing the other day and we were talking about Rebel Moon two and I said, and they were like, well talk about Rebel Moon one. I'm like, no. Like go fucking watch it.

4 (1h 50m 60s):
I know you have it at your house. Like, don't, like, it's not like a theater situation. You could like turn it on your phone right now and watch it like right here if you wanted. Like, that's how crazy it is. I'm like, you know, like that. It's so this model that this machine they built is really something else. Yeah. It's really crazy. If you think about, just like we were saying about the Formula One, like they're able to like insert something into popular culture that's so like a deep cut, like a documentary about Formula One. Yeah. How else do you get that to the people? Right. No way. No way. No way. You, you release that in a theater, five people go Yeah. You know? Right. Literally five people go, yeah.

4 (1h 51m 40s):
But

3 (1h 51m 40s):
Like, we put it on TV

4 (1h 51m 41s):
And like a hundred million people see it. Yeah. That's crazy. It's strange. That's crazy.

3 (1h 51m 46s):
It's ing It's because it shows that there was an audience there. It's just like, to get someone to go out of their house and buy a ticket that's too much of a tough sell.

4 (1h 51m 55s):
It's a different model. Yeah. It's a different model. and it, it's weird how they think about it when you think about it in those terms that you give the audience a, a, an alternative. Like you give them a chance to like, go on this. You know, like Rebel moons, like, okay, that's new ip. Right? No one knows what the fuck that is. Right. What's a Rebel Moon some space thing. I guess. Like, okay, well let's watch it. You know, it's that the barrier for entry is so low, right. That it allows, I think what's cool is it allows a lot more original and weirdo stuff to exist. Yeah. Because you know, especially like, you think about the director's cut of rubble Moon, which will be, if it was in theaters, a very boutiquey concept.

4 (1h 52m 41s):
Right. A very singular, it's like the animated version of, of heavy metal. Like, you know, I I, the movie I'm like, you know, I'm a huge fan, but like, not a lot of people have seen it where I feel like this is a chance where like, when this movie's released, the amount of people that can lay eyes on it is crazy compared to what it would be, you know, in another, if I was releasing it, say theatrically or whatever, you know, it's a three hour movie. Both of them are three hours. So it's much different. Like both the, the pg thirteens are two hours. Right. That was one of the things that we talked about also. Like, I want the movie short, like pg. Right. That's the, that's kind of the prerequisite where I'm like, on the, on the RA diversion, it's like, well, there's no rules.

4 (1h 53m 27s):
Like it's, it's like, no, no, there's no, there's no expectations, no rules, no nothing. Like, you get, that's, that experience is a completely different experience. And when does that one come out? It comes at the end of summer. the end of summer. I want end of August. I want enough time. Yeah. Probably right in there. I want, we don't have an exact date, but like some, somewhere I wanted enough time so that I didn't wanna be, I don't want them to be too attached to the PG version. 'cause I love the, by the way, like I said, I'm proud of the PG version. I think it's fun. I think when you see Rebel Moon two on April 19th, you'll see a very, a war movie. It's a fucking war movie is what it is. Like. 'cause like the first thing is like gather the team.

4 (1h 54m 7s):
Second movie's a war movie. The, the rated version's just a different journey. Like, you just get there in a different way. And it's just more, like I said, it's just more weird. It's more boutiquey and more Bazar and more like the original, more like heavy metal. Heavy metal. Yeah. Yeah. The original genre. Yeah. Yeah. More like a genre. You could, you can't really pitch a studio, a live action heavy metal movie right now. It's just not a, I don't know how to do that. don don't know how you'd make that, you know, unless you are willing to do some sort of song and dance, you know? Mm. Which is which I'm, I, I, I think that as a product, like I said, I'm proud of it and I think it works for what they've generated because like basically for the same price as two movies, right.

4 (1h 54m 57s):
They get four movies, which is a pretty, that's pretty crazy, you know? Yeah. Because the director's cuts for what? For the hour, additional hour and extra stuff that we did inside of each of those movies. Each of the movies is an hour longer. What we did inside those movies with Tone and with Gore and Sex and all that stuff. Within the same framework, you are getting two entirely different movies. It's not like extended version, you know, like that I, that I'd be like, okay, whatever. You know, like, oh, you did an extra, like weird little, here's the thing you cut out that you thought was too long. It's not like that at all. Like, you know, it's just a lot more I know.

4 (1h 55m 38s):
It's just true to the vision. Yeah. It's got balls. It's got a lot of balls. And is that

3 (1h 55m 43s):
I mean? That's gotta be this thing where you're waiting like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I want you to see the real thing.

4 (1h 55m 49s):
I don't think, you know, it's a weird thing. 'cause I, I don't think I mean, look, it's a, it's a, it's an, it's up to the viewers, you know, in a lot of ways don don't wanna like it. By no means am I saying that you can't watch both. For sure. You can. It's a, it's really, it's really how you do it. I feel like if you've seen PG 13, Rebel, Moon, Part One, you should see PG 13 Part Two because it, they're really closely related. I mean, they're like, it's a direct, you know, like you, it's, it could be one movie. You could cut 'em together literally and just keep going. Where, where it's chapter two, it's Part Two. It's like a, where I feel like that in the r-rated experience, it's just like a different, they're both gonna release on the same day.

4 (1h 56m 31s):
So you can just binge it. Fucking binge it. Yeah. That's

3 (1h 56m 35s):
The way to do it too, with Netflix. Yeah. One of the things I love about Netflix, what don don't find out about something until like two or three seasons in. I'm like, yes,

4 (1h 56m 41s):
Yes, a hundred percent. Let's go. I can, yes. It's

3 (1h 56m 45s):
S 17

4 (1h 56m 46s):
Episodes. It's the same muscle that made me play Fortnite for like six months. Yeah, exactly.

3 (1h 56m 51s):
Well it's if you, if you have the time and a good series is bingeable God

4 (1h 56m 55s):
So sad. That's, it's so satisfying. Yeah. I think we could do another, that's what I always say to my wife. I'm like, how do you feel? And she's like, I feel good. Are you sleepy? No, let's go.

3 (1h 57m 3s):
Have you ever thought about doing like a Netflix series? Like something that's so big that you couldn't do in one or two films? Yeah. Yeah.

4 (1h 57m 10s):
We've talked about it a lot. Like I mean Nobody wants Fountainhead, but that's what I wanted to do. You know, I pitched him Fountainhead. 'cause like, I'm a, you know, I'm a, I've written this super adaptation of the, of that book, and I just think it's, I I think it would be amazing. But, you know, no one wants to make it 'cause they think it's like, you know, it's, it's taboo. E rand is taboo. Well,

3 (1h 57m 33s):
Why is she taboo? don

4 (1h 57m 35s):
Don't know. She's taboo among the intelligentsia because like, they think she's a fascist and they think the book's a fascist propaganda piece of fa fascist propaganda. I, I, that's not why I like the book. I, I'm like, look, you know, I I happen to just like it because it, it's, to me, it's a direct comment on making a movie. Right? It's a movie about an architect who won't make the buildings that everyone wants him to make. And like, what the struggle he goes through to get the buildings made the way he wants to make them. It it, of course, I like that. You know, like no movie director. I I, I, I'm sure there's plenty of movie directors that don't like Fountainhead, but I just think that it, it, it just has it, it says so much a Rand wrote Fountainhead in direct response to being noted on a script that she had written.

4 (1h 58m 27s):
And she, she had been studying this movie about skyscrapers and they told her, she kept submitting versions of the script and they kept noting her, noting her until it, it was unrecognizable. And then she was like, this is what happens to a p to like, you know, to work. You know, it gets noted to, into like, till it's disintegrates. Until it disappears. Right. And so, yeah. So that was, that's one thing I had that I, that I've always wanted to do, but don don't know that I'm ever don don't know that the the world will allow that. I

3 (1h 58m 58s):
Don't know why. It's, it's one of those weird things where Iron Brandand is, she's connected to like incel or, you know, like angry white guys or like finance people that are cruel. Yeah. It's this very strange

4 (1h 59m 13s):
Steve Jobs's favorite book by

3 (1h 59m 15s):
The way. Interesting. Yeah. Interesting. Yeah. That is interesting. But it's one of those things where it's like, if you hear that, like I'm, I'm an an Iron Rand fan, you're like, oh, okay. Yeah. You're

4 (1h 59m 25s):
One of those guys. I'm one of those guys. Yeah. You

3 (1h 59m 27s):
Bitcoin too, buddy.

4 (1h 59m 28s):
Yeah, exactly.

3 (1h 59m 29s):
You know,

4 (1h 59m 30s):
It's true. Right? But it's funny because look and I get, by the way, Alice Shrugged. Fair. You know, you can play with that. That's a game that I I mean. I I'm pretty exclusively a Fountainhead fanatic. And for that also because it's the, it's melodrama too. Like it's the most melodramatic thing ever. I mean as far as just like,

3 (1h 59m 50s):
Why won't Netflix let you do that I don? I feel like

4 (1h 59m 52s):
They should. I just, I feel like, I think it would have a, a huge, well, again, I bet it would work. Like I said, I think I know it would work. I know. It would work.

3 (1h 59m 58s):
I know it would work too. I know it would work. Yeah. Why don't, fuck, come on Netflix,

4 (2h 0m 1s):
Let's go, let's go.

3 (2h 0m 3s):
Well, I'm a fan of letting artists like yourself do what is their vision, you know? and I I think people are often wrong about whether or not something is gonna be successful commercially or whether or not it's gonna resonate with a lot of other people.

4 (2h 0m 17s):
But that's the thing that no one knows. Like, that's the awesome thing about movies is like, and, and why, you know, I'm not that worried about the AI influence over motion picture because there's obviously no formula. No one can predict what's gonna be successful or they would've gotten rid of the directors and writers a long time ago. You know, like it's still, there's alchemy. There's still magic. There's still like an impossible, like, you know, all these elements come together and you're like, you feel something and you're like, what? That was cool. Fuck. You know? And it's the thing like, who knows? You know? Yeah. It's like, you know, any, anything, you know, that, that you see that maybe if someone described it to you in an abstract, you'd be like, that sounds dumb.

4 (2h 1m 2s):
Like I I know. And then you sit and you watch it and you experience it moment by moment and you go and and you feel it. Yeah. It's fucking cool.

3 (2h 1m 10s):
Well, it's also, I think there's always going to be a thing that people resonate with where they know it's made by a person. They know that. Correct. An artist's thoughts were correct involved in the creation of this thing. This is the vision. They work tirelessly to produce this and they put it out and they're proud of it. Here it is. And there's something about that, that you're, you're getting to take in another human being's, a group of human beings creation. And that, that means something to us. and I think it's always gonna mean something to us. I think there's gonna be ai songs and AI movies and AI art, and it's gonna be cool, but it's not gonna be as cool 'cause it's not gonna be from a human. Correct.

4 (2h 1m 49s):
And I from human beings. and I do feel like the, the, the fingerprints, the squishy fingerprints on the thing are the thing that make it like unbelievably

3 (2h 2m 1s):
Cool chisel marks on

4 (2h 2m 2s):
The statue. Yeah. I want the chisel marks. I love em. I live for 'em. Like, to me that's the bit like the best movies, my favorite movies, the best movies are where you can feel the hand of the filmmaker. Yes. Like, I want that. Yeah. I didn't want, I do not want the movie made by committee. Right. Like, you know. Exactly. You vote, you when, when you, when you go to a movie that that is, that feels like it was made in the boardroom. Like Right. I feel dirty when I watch that. I don't like it. Yeah. I'm like, Don don't want the cold hand of marketing on me like that. You know? I wanna, like, that's why I love the, you know, like the weirdness, you know, like, I feel like in the end, all my movies are just a little bit weird in, in, in, in a good way.

4 (2h 2m 45s):
Like, you know, 300 for whatever. It's like all the like, you know, kind of like coolness of it as far as like, yeah, let's Go Fight. It's still a weirdo movie, you know, like the way it's made. Did you ever think of

3 (2h 2m 58s):
Putting a bunch of gay stuff in there?

4 (2h 2m 60s):
Well, you know, I just, it's Frank's book, you know, I wrote it Right. I wrote, I, I made what Frank wrote right now, now in Retrospect. And that we, we've been talking about doing a series where I really wanted to like, introduce those concepts a lot more because I just feel like it's important in, in, if we go forward and do like more in the 300 universe, I would wanna bring that part in and let people, which I think just shakes it up again. Like you're like what? Like right when you thought, yeah. Right. When you thought you knew like how to feel like I'm gonna make you feel like another way. People have always said like, you know, 300, you know, people have accused me of being like homophobic or whatever. Why? And I'm like, I, I don't know. They just somehow they feel like that the movie

3 (2h 3m 41s):
'cause the Spartans weren't doing gay stuff.

4 (2h 3m 43s):
Yeah. Or because they, you know, there's that one line where he says, you know, philosophers and boy lovers. But like, I, I think that, that he's clearly being cheeky leonis because like, I I Of course am was hyper aware at the time that the reality of Spartan culture was the, was the, he's obviously out. He, he means philosophies and boy lovers not like he, he's using that maybe as a derogatory comment, but when in reality he's a, a lover of men probably, you know? Absolutely. Absolutely. And so like, I just think that like, as, and we talked about like, as, as we go forward, I would love to like just kind of stress and, and just like I, I said like, look, 300, you know, in some ways is like one of the gayest movies ever made.

4 (2h 4m 36s):
You know, like it's, it, it it is incredibly male centric, male obsessed, you know, like, you really feel like very strong male energy from the movie, even though there's a strong, you know, Gogo's, incredibly strong female character. And we wrote her and made her like, he doesn't decide to kick the person messenger into the well without getting approval from, from Gorgo. 'cause you know, he's like, I'm gonna burn it down. Is that cool? And she's like, go do it. You know? And he's like, all right, here we go. And you know, he, he, this is Sparta is that guy. And that's like, that was that, that and I and I just think, but I just think that like, you know, and maybe that was just me understanding, doing the research and understanding the reality of Spartan culture, that I really, that energy was in there because I just felt like it was important, you know, to, to make sure that it was, you know, that there was this kind of visceral sexuality to the way the men actually interacted, you know, that was there I mean, regardless of whether you acknowledge it, it's there, you know,

3 (2h 5m 41s):
That would be, but but it wasn't acknowledged really in the film. Like, if anybody didn't know the history of the Spartans, they wouldn't know. No,

4 (2h 5m 49s):
No. I, I, but I just feel, I, I just mean from sort of an iconic standpoint as far as like the, the, the, this just sort of indulgence in the male form, you know, is very, is very, it's not, it's not casual.

3 (2h 6m 4s):
Right. If you to be fascinating to see if you did do a series and you had them behave the way Spartans actually did the reaction.

4 (2h 6m 13s):
Yeah. It'd be interesting. I I think that hopefully we'll find out one day and that'd be fun. Yeah,

3 (2h 6m 17s):
That would be fun. Yeah.

4 (2h 6m 18s):
It's just I mean like, look in the end it's a, it's a weirdo, it's a weirdo show. You know, like, it just, it's fun to enjoy it. It's fun to fuck with it. You know, like that's what we do. Like that's, you gotta tear it apart a little bit to like, take a look at it. You gotta know, you know,

3 (2h 6m 33s):
When you choose things to do today, how do you go about doing it? Do you, do you just sit with an idea and bring it to studios? Do they come to you? Do you, how do you choose what you

4 (2h 6m 44s):
I, I don't develop, I kind of have a bunch of, I've always had a bunch of stuff that I work on and I just go, I wanna do this. And then whoever wants to do it, then they, they redo it. And I

3 (2h 6m 53s):
Mean that's a nice position to be in.

4 (2h 6m 54s):
It is a, it's an awesome position and I appreciate it. and I don't, I don't take it for granted. You know, there's a few things, like, I've always been obsessed with Richard Bach. don don't know if you know, like there's a, he has this book called Illusions that I've owned for a long time that I've always wanted to do. You know, I grew up as a Christian Zionist and I, you know, I,

3 (2h 7m 17s):
Isn't that a book about like channeling? Well,

4 (2h 7m 20s):
Illusions is about this. It's a, a book about this guy flying on his biplane around in the 1970s. And he lands in a, in a, in a pasture. 'cause like in the seventies, you, well he was part of this sort of, he would fly his biplane around land in a pasture and then sell rides for $3, like for 10 minutes. And that's how he lived, right? He's just a gypsy pilot flying around the Midwest. And he happens to come across this guy who also is flying a biplane who happens to be like a messiah who happens to be like this super spiritually advanced dude who's on the run from, he doesn't wanna be the Messiah. He's like, he's like, it's a, it's called illusions, the Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah.

4 (2h 8m 4s):
And it's about the two of them spending a summer together. Just the one guy teaching him about like, it's a shit job being the Messiah. Like don't, don't, don't do it because you know what happens to the Messiahs in the end, right? Yeah. He goes, do you always have to die a violent death? And he goes, yeah, no, don don't think always. And he's like, really? He goes, yeah, you know what, it's, it's cool for like, he goes, what about just a quiet little ascension, you know, just on the side? And he is like, yeah, I don't think that, I don't think the universe will let that happen, you know? So it's a cool, so it's this really cool, again, it's like this sort of, it's again like a spiritual deconstructivists like Messiah story and I just like I've always, it was like this book when I was growing up, I just, when in a lot of ways it's, it's religious philosophy.

4 (2h 8m 51s):
Is this similar to Christian science? So I superimposed my religious beliefs onto this book and I felt like it kind of spoke to my doubts and my questions about my religious upbringing and like what I thought for real. Like my brother, so my brother passed away when I was 13. He got in a car accident and he was like this incredibly spiritual dude. Everyone, like anyone who knew my brother was like, that guy was the guy, he was the man. Like, you know, Sam Snyder was like, among his peer group was like, he was like, you know, in retrospect, like he was into Tai Chi and like just like super cool seventies dude, right?

Imagine that guy like, but just like the coolest guy, you know, smoking dope, just being cool as hell.

But then like when you see, when you're 13 and you see like what it, that event though does to your family, your mother and father, you know, your sister, your, all of their friends, like the devastation that they feel. And these are people that I believed, believed in the religion that I believed in and the pain, like it made me really go like, what the fuck?

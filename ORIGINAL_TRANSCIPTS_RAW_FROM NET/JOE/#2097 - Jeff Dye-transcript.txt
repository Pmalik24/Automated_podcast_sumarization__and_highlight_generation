3 (28s):
Yeah. That club's weird.

4 (29s):
And so when I, when I came out there, I was like, yeah, this is a big deal. You know, like, I, I don't, it's been a while since I've had some nerves and I was coming out there going, oh, it took me like about 30, 40 long seconds to really dial in and go. All right. I was kind of having an outta my head going, Joe's watching and hope this goes well. You know, because it's such a beautiful club. Yeah. The bar's high. Yeah. All that whole crowd's going on.

4 (1m 4s):
Torch. Oh, that's a torch too. Look at you. You got all the gadgets, huh?

3 (1m 7s):
Yeah. We're, we shout out to Foundation Cigars. They, they actually made us some comedy mothership logoed cigars. They're really good. Is it out? Yeah. Here, try this one. Shake it up. Sorry. It might be almost outta juice.

4 (1m 25s):
Got

3 (1m 25s):
It. But yeah, I get it. I was nervous when I first did stand up there too.

4 (1m 30s):
Yeah. It's like that. It was my

3 (1m 32s):
First set there. It was weird. I was like, are we really doing this?

4 (1m 36s):
Yeah. It's, and your dad, your

3 (1m 37s):
Daddy there we're talking about this for two years. Yeah. And then all of a sudden we're doing it. Like we were all shitting our pants. Every one of us backstage was like, fuck

4 (1m 44s):
Yeah. We are all, it's such a cool place. But the

3 (1m 47s):
Thing is like, we had been doing so much standup. Yeah,

4 (1m 49s):
Yeah. Your whole life

3 (1m 50s):
Weirded out by this one set for some reason. It's special. Yeah. but it felt like the audience was like that too. They felt a little weirded out too. They were like, wow, this is real. Like, they got to be there at the very first show.

4 (2m 2s):
I used to feel like that at the store a bit like, you know, I would literally crush at the Laugh Factory 25 minutes before I walked over to the Comedy Store. And then I was like, oh, I hope Adam sees this. You know, like for whatever reason, like the store has, I think every comic has some sort of weird issues with the Comedy Store for sure. All different things. But like, I don't know

3 (2m 22s):
How, dude, when I was a kid, when I was 21, when I first started doing standup, people would talk about the Comedy Store. Like, it was Mecca. Like you had to make your pilgrimage. This was where Richard Pryor came from. Right. This is where Sam Kinison came from. It was Mecca. Yeah. And you, you only heard about, you know, like that This is the spot. There was no other one place you had to go. Sure. Like, you could go to catch, you could go to, you know, catch Rising Star. Yeah. Which is in New York. You could go, which is a great club. You could go to the Improv and Melrose. That was a great club. It's all great. The store. The store was Mecca. Yeah. And when you got past there, see, I was already on a television show when I got past and when getting on the television show was cool, it was cool to be on tv.

3 (3m 10s):
Like, wow, I can't believe I'm on tv. This is nuts. But the real thing for me was when Mitzi passed me. Yeah. I was like, oh my God. Like, I think I'm a real comedian. Yeah. Like, I'm a real professional. Like, 'cause you know, in the beginning, the few years you feel like such a fraud. You feel like you, you

4 (3m 28s):
Like any stage time.

3 (3m 30s):
Yeah. You're learning it as you go. You're not really sure if you're gonna make it. Some of your jokes suck. Yeah. Oh

4 (3m 37s):
Yeah. Yeah.

3 (3m 38s):
Everyone now and then though, you get one that pops. Yeah. You're like, God, I need more of those. Like, I need more like that one.

4 (3m 43s):
That's why so many comics go edgy or like Dirty Soon Of course, because they're like, at least their reactions better than bombing, you know? Exactly. Something. I'd rather that than silence, you know?

3 (3m 51s):
And there's always some subjects that just have built in laughs. You know, there's some subjects, like, you pretty much can't fuck it up if you, you gotta, it's a, it's a topic that people like to laugh just at the top. They're like, BA

4 (4m 3s):
Ha ha. I feel like every comic, when you start, tell me if you found this to be true Of course, they all start with the I know what I look like or I look like. Right. Or that you hear that version of that combination of a Yeah. Right. Or they, they come up with a, or they, they like some sort of song lyrics. That's all 'cause songs are poems. Yeah. And they're metaphors. So for whatever reason, every comic, like I was listening to this song the other day. Yeah. And the lyrics, you're like, yeah. 'cause it's a metaphor. Like, and you're gonna take the most literal route on this writing Yeah. To make yourself sound smarter than the artist. But it's like, it's kind of a, like, trying to get to you in that monkey. And you're like, he's trying to get to a monkey and you're like, nah, dude, that's the radio edit of booty.

4 (4m 43s):
You know, they can't say trying to get to you in that pussy or booty or whatever the real lyric is. It's Yeah. A thing.

3 (4m 49s):
Well, it's just pop culture too, right. So you, you really, you're terrified to talk about something that people don't know about. You don't want to have to explain something while you're, 'cause then you have to get their full attention. It's not an immediate, like, if you wanted to bring up LeBron James, you say the name LeBron James. Everybody knows who LeBron James is. It's an instantaneous reference. Absolutely. But if you wanna talk about some weird sect of the Christian Church that you grew up in, you're like, what?

4 (5m 16s):
Yeah. What,

3 (5m 17s):
What? Like that's a fucking black belt joke. Yeah. You know, like, you have to, you're

4 (5m 21s):
Not there yet.

3 (5m 22s):
Yeah. You're not ready for like a esoteric subject. You're not ready for any weirdness. I

4 (5m 27s):
Had a comic tell me the other night we did this corporate event. I don't wanna say his name 'cause you know, but he's just new. That's all. Yeah. He's not guilty of being unfunny. He's not guilty of being a bad guy. He's just guilty of being new. Yeah. That's

3 (5m 37s):
All. It's like

4 (5m 38s):
We all were, and he goes, what do you think about this joke? And it's this wildly insensitive joke about, about the Bible and Mary. and it's, it's a gross oversimplification, but it's also just blatantly disrespectful. Like, and that's okay. You know, Louis wants to do that joke. You wanna do that joke? Some people want to limp in on that subject. You can do it. Yeah. and I go, you can't,

3 (5m 59s):
You

4 (5m 59s):
Know what I'm saying? Like, he be like, what do you mean I can't? I go, no, it's just not, is

3 (6m 2s):
He ready for

4 (6m 3s):
Two months in? You're trying to tackle that. Like,

3 (6m 5s):
It's not gonna work. Doing an abortion joke in your first five minutes. Like, settle down. Yeah.

4 (6m 9s):
These people have no idea who you are. And you're like, yeah. It's just like, it is not gonna work.

3 (6m 12s):
Leave that to Bill Burr. Yeah. Leave the abortion joke to Bill Burr.

4 (6m 16s):
Maybe not month one, bud.

3 (6m 17s):
Yeah. You are not, you don't have any idea what you sound like You don have any idea how other clue people are perceiving you? It's chaos up there. It doesn't seem like it should be. It's, I, I feel like we understand it more than most people. Which is why so many people think they can do it. But even we kind of barely understand it. Like, I understand how I do it, but I, there's a lot of guys, like, I see him like, I know. I'm like, I don't know what you're doing, but it's hilarious. Harlan Williams. I love

4 (6m 43s):
Harlan. Har just did his podcast. Har Williams. He's so silly. He

3 (6m 46s):
Was just, he's so silly. Yeah. When you watch him on stage, you're like, if you wrote that out,

4 (6m 50s):
Oh yeah.

3 (6m 51s):
It would not make any sense. Sir, can you please

4 (6m 53s):
Look away? I'm trying to perform up here.

3 (6m 55s):
I'm fucking dying.

4 (6m 56s):
Right

3 (6m 56s):
There. He was on Kill Tony, and he brought a checkbook and started just writing checks to people for like a million dollars. and it just became this running gag. It's really funny. It was hilarious.

4 (7m 7s):
He had Jeff Ross roast a roast. He pulled out a roast and he, he put two little googly eyes on it and he goes, I want you to roast this roast. And that's only Harlan can do that. Only

3 (7m 18s):
Harlan only, only

4 (7m 19s):
Harland. If anyone else did, that'd be like, get this dog shit outta here. But like Harlan wins. It's perfectly his voice. Like,

3 (7m 24s):
I have known that guy for probably like 25, 26 years. He's always been super cool. No one hates Harlan Williams. No one, you'll never meet anybody who doesn't like Harlan

4 (7m 34s):
Williams. He isn't like, but is is exactly like, nor McDonald, where the, where he's got his own thing. It's his own thing. And they're both Canadian and they're not similar, but they're both these unique, one of a kind men. Yeah.

3 (7m 47s):
He doesn't vary. Yeah. He's always that guy. And he's always like this super sweet guy. That's guy, that guy off stage, on stage. Hey fella. Oh yeah, what a great club. You

4 (7m 57s):
Know, he's, yep. Pumpkin pie, haircut cut freak. He improv that on the movie. Dumb and Dumber to Jim Carrey. and it stays in the script. Like that's how, yeah.

3 (8m 6s):
No, that's Harlan.

4 (8m 7s):
He's such a fun guy. But

3 (8m 8s):
Like don don't know how he does it. Imagine if being Harlan's comedy coach, God, don don't know what to tell you. Yeah.

4 (8m 13s):
Just do you dude.

3 (8m 14s):
Yeah. I don't know how to tell you. William Montgomery's another one. Have you seen William? He's a young kid. Young guy from Austin. He was in LA for a while, then he came out here. His comedy is so I wish I could like do one of his bits, but don don't want to give up some of his material.

4 (8m 26s):
Oh, you got a kid that works at Mothership who I'm obsessed with, and Don don't know if he'll be a star. I don't know. I've never been able to predict any of this shit. Which one? If you'd have asked me if I'd have thought a lot of these people that became stars are stars. I'm, I'm not a good read of this. Mm. But I do know a brilliant comic when I see one in Casey Rocket that Oh

3 (8m 41s):
Yeah. He's very funny. And it's,

4 (8m 42s):
Well, here's the difference. Yeah. So for me, here's the difference is when I, when you watch me, you go, oh, I know who Jeff's inspired by. You know, he likes Patrice, he likes Norm. He likes these truth tellers. And he, and he loves The Simpsons. And if you know that formula, when you watch me go, that's what this guy liked. Yeah. That's what he watched. You know, no one's doing what Casey Rocket's doing.

3 (9m 4s):
No.

4 (9m 5s):
So at least it's different enough Yeah. That you like, whether you love it or hate it, you go, I've never seen it before.

3 (9m 10s):
Well, even if you, well, First of all, you should appreciate that. But then also appreciate that whatever he is doing, it's funny right now. And he's gonna get better. Yeah.

4 (9m 19s):
He's gonna, I love it. It's

3 (9m 20s):
Gonna get even more better.

4 (9m 21s):
I watched him and Don don't know if he'll like me saying this. He didn't do too great on the show that I watched and I'm in the back going, whatever that is. Sign me up. I'll watch that. It,

3 (9m 29s):
He varies, but he does well a lot. He does well a lot. He's got real potential. He's a funny dude. He

4 (9m 36s):
Did like six minutes on Jimmy Carter kids in his twenties. He, he's doing Jimmy Carter jokes and I'm in the back going, no one's gonna, because you know, I was, it was like a bar show in Manhattan Beach. And they, they want some race, race hustling

3 (9m 49s):
Jokes or Oh yeah. If you're doing a bar show in Manhattan Beach, that's, yeah. Well, that's hit or miss.

4 (9m 55s):
It is hit or Yeah, for sure. But

3 (9m 56s):
Those are good for like, just stress testing the vehicle though.

4 (9m 60s):
And who cares. Yeah. If, if the joke doesn't work, the, it's, you can, you know, I, I watched you last night for probably 30 minutes of the hour that you did. It seems like you're having a lot of fun.

3 (10m 11s):
I'm having a lot

4 (10m 12s):
Of fun. Is this a new, or is this a I mean? I, I've seen you a bunch of times, but I mean like, it's been a, been a few years, I think since I've got to see you on stage and you seem like you were having so much fun.

3 (10m 22s):
I'm having a good time. Yeah. That's

4 (10m 24s):
Inspiring to watch. Yeah.

3 (10m 25s):
Well, First of all, you know, I'm at a place where I could do whatever I want. So I'm doing as much standup as I want and I'm doing it specifically just to make the standup better. Like, that's how I think about it. I'm, all I'm doing is like, I treat it like, well, what is the most important thing of it? The most important thing is the show. Like try in some way to like, always tweak it. Yeah. Always make it better. Figure out what you're doing,

4 (10m 51s):
Add a

3 (10m 52s):
Thing. And to have all this opportunity for stage time at the club. I basically set up a residency in my home city. Yeah.

4 (10m 58s):
It's perfect. It's pretty sweet. It was fun to watch because I, it's fun, dude.

3 (11m 1s):
It's fun.

4 (11m 2s):
I, I like seeing that more than I like seeing a lot of things in our business. I just, I love it. I like comedy so much. I do too. That I want to see some. So I, I went on the road with this guy named Kermit Depi from Washington State. And he's a, yeah, a road dog and a really talented guy. He won Seattle International Competi comedy competition, which when I first started comedy, that was a huge deal to us up in Seattle. And he brought me on the road and I was terrible. I was a terrible, like, open Micr that got some laugh. I was a king of the open Micers in Seattle, you know. And so he brings me on the road open for him and he goes, you know, the only reason I'm bringing you on the road is you make me like, like standup comedy again. You're so excited about it. And the way You don't shut up about it. And you wanna tell jokes and you want to write jokes or you tell me like, Hey, last night after that bit, you should, you should, if you thought about adding this and like, you make me remember that.

4 (11m 50s):
I like it. and I do feel like, and I've been doing comedy since 2005. I do feel a little bit of that where I'm looking for someone to, I just, I like, I loved being in that green room and hanging. I love this, I love the, the standup part. But like, that's really fun. It doesn't, and I don't want to just perform and go home. I want it to be like in the comedy. Yeah. don don't know. I like that part of it. but it seemed like you had

3 (12m 12s):
Fun off each. Yeah. We feed each other. That's one of, that's the the reason why I created the club. We were already performing out here. We started performing out here in November of 2020 indoors. and it was, it was sketchy and everyone was like, there was a feeling of sketchiness. I was like, I remember we got really high one time and I went on stage. I was like, this is so not safe. It's like the

4 (12m 36s):
Middle of the, what are we doing?

3 (12m 37s):
The middle of Covid. And they have indoor shows packed. There's no, the social distancing had sucked my dick.

4 (12m 43s):
Yeah,

3 (12m 43s):
Yeah. Well there was no social distancing. It was just packed. Everybody was just going out. Like they were going out. I love that. And we were at, how many of you guys have had Covid? Like, fucking half the crowd already

4 (12m 52s):
We're already

3 (12m 52s):
Had it. And we're Yeah, it was, it was wild times. But what we needed was a home base. And I was like this place that we're at the Vulcan, which is a really fun place to play and a really fun place to see stand up. It's a real fun room. But I wanted to do it where we had full control of it, where it was just comics. Like it was a, like we have like, you know, a group of humans that are really good at an art form. and I say, what do you, what do you think we should do? And we all just talk. And everybody's suggestion got in there the reason why the ceiling's, the height that it is. 'cause I took Louie and Louie went and looked around. He goes, can you lower the ceiling? and I said, I think we can, can we lower the ceiling?

3 (13m 33s):
And I brought over the construction guys. I'm like, what can we do? And like, yeah, we can get it down three more feet. And he's like, get it down as low as you can get it. Love that. We just wanted to make sure that we could see from the balcony that was the critical thing. Like make sure the, the, the ceiling didn't impede the view from the balcony. So we got to right where it doesn't, and then it really tightened the room up. But he also told me, he goes, comics like to hear that sound of echo, but that sucks. It's like, sucks for the sound. Like that's like it, you, you want the sound to be as clean as possible. You should like, make everything almost like a sound studio. Like if you've done the old ice house. Yeah. Love

4 (14m 5s):
The old no one bombs there. All

3 (14m 6s):
That hardwood that pop, the comedy pops there. It like, it has, but it's also great crowds out there too. Yeah. but it, it's the, the structure of the building adds to the sound. But you don't really necessarily want that. You really want the actual laughs and like everybody to hear everything you're saying. Yeah, clearly.

4 (14m 26s):
Wait, do you think there was a problem with the ice house in the old way? Like the way it was too easy it popped.

3 (14m 31s):
It wasn't a problem 'cause it was really small room, but it would've been a problem in a a, a slightly larger room. It gets slightly larger and those echoes get weird. They get weird in corners. Like, that's one of the things about the Vulcan. I've had friends come to the show and they would go, we couldn't hear right where we were. We had to move. Oh, that's not good. I go, what, what was the matter? They're like, everything is echoing. I was like, oh no, really? So like, I guess there was like, you know how sound works and hard surfaces and corners, if you're in like the back of, you know, a little corner area and sound's coming from a speaker point in a specific direction, it's probably not set up for comedies what I'm trying to say. So we decided to just set it up from the jump. It's great. Like the best way we could, you know, the whole tunnel system, the whole, there's an elevator.

4 (15m 17s):
It's perfect. It's literally you've made, it's a masterpiece. So

3 (15m 21s):
When we opened it, it was, it was nerve wracking. It was like, what are we doing?

4 (15m 24s):
Me and my buddy Brant, this was literally last weekend, I think it was last weekend, we're playing a club. And the club's great. and I don't wanna name it because I'm about to say something that's not great about the acoustics, but he gets on stage, he's crushing and he is doing all these little bullshit savers, you know, like, well that did better last week. You know, there's little things you say Yeah. After a joke does. And the crowd's looking around going, what was he talking about? So then he does another joke. And then he is like, all right, you guys don't like, and, and he keeps narrating. But like, Brent, you're crushing. But I, I can't talk to him. He's on stage. And so then I get on stage and, and I'm like, fucking tough crowd, man. What's going on here? Like these, oh,

3 (16m 2s):
You can't hear them. Couldn't

4 (16m 3s):
Hear. I cou I thought I was doing bad. And Brant's like, you're, that was amazing. And then Brat was doing amazing and he thought he was doing bad up there. So we came up with like a symbol for the next shows. Like, if, if you're doing, how, how

3 (16m 17s):
Far was the audience for from you that you couldn't hear? Well, we

4 (16m 19s):
Heard laughs. We heard laughs. Right. But we just don't, we're, we were used to a sound as a comedian. Volume of what killing is. So, you know, you get in, we get laughs on every sentence. Doesn't mean you're killing. And so we were just saying, so me and brand came with like a code. We're like, all right, this means don't worry about it. You're doing good. And if it is that the joke sucks or the bit sucks, we'll give, we'll do this. Like, Hey, it's you, it's you. That is, you know, but like, you need to know. That's good. Is it me or is it the crowd? You

3 (16m 46s):
Got like a line coach. Yeah.

4 (16m 48s):
You like going, you know, signal. But we, it's because that sound is so important. Yeah. If you think you're doing bad. Oh yeah. You know, and the crowd doesn't think you are. Or vice versa. That's, that's a

3 (16m 58s):
Problem. You watching any of the Zoom comedy people tried to do?

4 (17m 0s):
Joe? I was one of the Zoom people. No, did You don? I had to, dude. No, I had

3 (17m 6s):
To, Hey, I would've done it. I

4 (17m 8s):
Would've done it. The, I had one corporate event that was like $10,000 corporate that was supposed to be in a theater. And then they're like, well we can't now 'cause Covid something and I just don't give that money, or they're gonna have to reschedule for another time. And they go, but we can do it on Zoom. And I was like, well it's 10 grand. and I would do it. It was terrible.

3 (17m 24s):
So you did a corporate gig on Zoom? Yes.

4 (17m 26s):
Oh God. and I couldn't hear them. 'cause their, their things aren't on. It's a bunch of

3 (17m 30s):
People. Oh my

4 (17m 31s):
God, dude. It was a nightmare. Joe. Also, I gotta say that's really nice for me to be here because During Covid, I was like enemy number one in Los Angeles in a lot of ways. Really? I'd have people at my house. I was like, I'm not doing this shit. I was like the only guy who was like actually putting on his story. Like, I'm not doing this. I'd like go to coffee shops. You know, I know I'd wear a mask when they, you know, when I'd be one of those guys, you know, I'd wear the mask in the store, but then, you know, whatever, I'm gonna drink my coffee. You wanna drink it through a mask, you know? Right. So there were comics who are now cool with me again, but at the time were like, can you believe Jeff Dye is just not taking this serious? And I was like that. I was, I wish I lived in a place like this.

4 (18m 12s):
Or Florida or, or something during that lockdown.

3 (18m 15s):
Well, I kind of saw what was going on in the beginning, but I was hoping that we would come out of it and it really would just be a couple weeks and everything would be back to normal. But when it got to a month, ugh. And there was no talk at all about reopening. And then there was talk about, it might be six months. It was, it got real weird. And then there was the George Floyd riots and then there was the lines outside the guns. Doors. And I was like, okay. So it brought, I see where this is going. I'm getting the fuck outta here. So I came out here in May of 2020. That's when I first started looking. Yeah. Found a house moved in August. So that quick in August of 2020, I'm like, see ya.

3 (18m 57s):
and it was in the middle of my Spotify deal. The beginning. Excuse me. Not even the middle. Yeah. But Spotify deal hadn't even started. It started from out here. It was weird. Weird.

4 (19m 5s):
They

3 (19m 5s):
Were like, they were like, what the fuck you

4 (19m 7s):
Doing? Yeah. As from us going, what do you mean he's moving to, he's gonna cha also, you're a weed guy. We're going Texas. He's gonna go to Texas with the weed.

3 (19m 14s):
Well, apparently it's decriminalized here in Austin. Oh, okay. Praise Jesus. Yeah. But then I heard that Ken Paxton is trying to sue the city of Austin who I've met. He is a very nice gentleman. Ken, how dare you?

4 (19m 29s):
What's he suing it for?

3 (19m 30s):
I don't, what's, I think it has something to do with the marijuana laws. Listen, maybe it has something to do with something other pol politically. Like they sue you for this so you refund the police. I don't know how all that shit works. But there's a lot of like weirdness when it comes to that. Ken Pax and Sue's Texas cities, including Austin for decriminalizing weed. Dude. But

4 (19m 52s):
Ken,

3 (19m 52s):
This is stupid. Ken, don't get involved in this. This is a dumb perspective. It's the whole law is dumb. and it was based on fraud from the very beginning. If you look at the history of why marijuana's illegal, it goes back to William Randolph Hurst and Harry Anslinger. They, they conspired. That's, that's the reason why they made movies like Reefer Madness. They wrote all these stories in the newspaper about marijuana and how marijuana was causing blacks and Mexicans to rape white ladies. And they did it. Which

4 (20m 25s):
Turned out not to be true.

3 (20m 26s):
It was, they made this shit up. Well, you know, you could find instances. There's a lot of people. But the point is that they made all this shit up just so they could stop hemp. Because the, they had come up with a new method of processing hemp fiber. There was a new machine that was invented called a decorticator. And the decorticator allowed them to economically effectively process hemp without using slave labor. See, when they stopped using slaves, and then when they p start picking cotton, people moved from hemp to cotton. But cotton sucks compared to hemp. Hemp is a way better cloth. It's way more durable. It's like my friend Todd says, it's like an alien plant because it is like an alien plant.

3 (21m 9s):
It doesn't, there's nothing like it. You could use its fiber to make clothes. It's the best clothes on earth. Like the most durable. Like I've a hemp jiujitsu. Gee, that fucking thing never rips when I get cotton geese. These motherfuckers like, after like a few months of hard rolling this, this thing start getting loose. Yeah. And they start ripping and you know, you've had a gee for a year or two years. It's probably got a rip or two in it already. The the hemp keys don't rip. Hmm. You could hemp hemp paper. You can take hemp paper. You could barely tear it. Really? It's weird,

4 (21m 42s):
Man. I've never known less about a subject than hemp or any of this stuff.

3 (21m 46s):
I got fascinated because my friend Todd McCormick had a hemp stalk on his table. His desk table. And he goes, pick this up and I pick it up. and it feels like there's nothing there. It's like styrofoam, but it's hard. Yeah. Like Oak.

4 (22m 1s):
Yeah. It's interesting.

3 (22m 2s):
It's, it's a fucking weird plant. You can make houses with it. They use something called Hemp Creek and it's hemp and it's mixed together with some sort of a solvent or something that solidifies it. And it's way more durable than wood. A living house. It's stronger than concrete. It's, it's crazy. It's wild. It's a crazy plant, dude. Yeah. And the fact that it's illegal because it makes people happy and makes food taste better. Shut the fuck

4 (22m 28s):
Up. Yeah.

3 (22m 29s):
Just shut the

4 (22m 29s):
Fuck up. Other silly argument.

3 (22m 30s):
It's stupid. It doesn't kill anybody. Alcohol's killing people every day of the week. Yeah, dude. They're dying of liver poisoning. Everyone's dying of opiates. Yep. Fentanyl's killing everybody. Fast food's killing people. We kill nobody. I've always said the best way to get killed by weed is you take a 35 pound bag of it and drop it on your head from a CIA drug plane. That's,

4 (22m 52s):
That's, that's how people die. That's

3 (22m 53s):
How you die from weed. Shut the fuck

4 (22m 56s):
Up. I had a buddy who was flying, he was driving from Boston, Randy Valerio. He was driving from Boston with marijuana products, but it was medicine in Boston, you know, and he's drive, he's moving to LA to live and as he is driving through Texas, he gets pulled over. So it's legal in Boston and it's legal in LA and it's considered medicine in these two places. But if he takes his medicine through Texas

3 (23m 18s):
Yeah. You can't

4 (23m 19s):
Felony charges.

3 (23m 19s):
Yeah. It's, it's schedule one. It's a real drug. It's crazy. Well, it's a dumb thing, man. Look, this is not a dumb country. We're super educated now. We have amazing access to information. This is not 1930. This is not a confusing time. This is a time where we know exactly what things do. Now this is also important to say, some people should not smoke weed. Some people should not eat weed. Some people should not do any psychedelics at all. Some people have mental health problems already. Some people are prone to schizophrenia. Sure. And I've seen people fucking snap from weed. Really? and I think. Yes. Yeah. I've not seen that.

3 (23m 60s):
I think it's important to talk about. Yeah. Look, it's just not me. But I've seen people like Alex Berenson wrote this book called Tell Your Children. And it's all about, there's like a certain percentage of people that take high dose THC, that experience psychotic states. There's this lady in LA who stabbed her boyfriend. Jesus, 108 times of one hit. He gave her some crazy super potent weed. She went wacky, stabbed him 108 times. And the the fucked up part is she only got two years probation.

4 (24m 31s):
Yeah, that's wild. Two years probation. That's a whole different problem. Way they sent these. That's a crazy,

3 (24m 36s):
We were just like, imagine if it was a dude. Oh god. And his excuse was, I got high. Hey

4 (24m 41s):
Yo, are you getting weed?

3 (24m 42s):
I was high. I had to stab her 108 times. Like, what the fuck? You're in jail forever.

4 (24m 46s):
Women complain about all these social issues, but know where women crush us courts. Yeah. Dude, in the courtroom, there is no bigger privilege than being a woman. And by the

3 (24m 54s):
Way, no one, no one gives a fuck if your wife beats

4 (24m 58s):
You up at all. At all. A baseball player in the nineties, Chuck Finley got beat up by his wife and he's like, I don't wanna hit her back. I'm a big guy. You know? So he just, so he just called the cops? Yeah. He took it. He just called the cops. But then if you read all the people commenting, like, oh come on dude. You can't get Yeah. You just let her hit you, dude. Like, like just

3 (25m 16s):
Block. Yeah. Block. The problem is you should never be around anyone who wants to hit you. Whether it's a friend or whether it's a girlfriend. Should never be around a person that wants to strike you

4 (25m 27s):
At all. Yeah.

3 (25m 27s):
At all. At all. That's just the rules. The, it's like I, we all have, we all sometimes are angry, but you don't express yourself that way. Right. It's stupid.

4 (25m 37s):
It's, you know, my favorite Joe Rogan moment. One of what Yeah. Everybody references your podcast. People reference your, you know, the UFC, they reference your comedy. The on fear factor. When that guy and you go, no, no You don't get to hit people to, to that girl. Oh yeah. And then he tried to defend his wife's honor. He's, you go, no, no, no. If you guys wanna hit each other at home, you can do whatever you want. But you don't get to hit people just because you're upset. And then he tried to come to you. Yeah. And you grabbed him. Yeah. And everyone realized real quick, I mean maybe at that time it wasn't public knowledge how trained you were at, like fighting and stuff.

3 (26m 10s):
All I did was grab his neck. Yeah.

4 (26m 12s):
But it was, you shut it down quick. Yeah. No TV host has ever shut down a, a conflict of like that, that fast.

3 (26m 19s):
Well that guy, they'd warned me about. Oh really? He had a history of violence. Ah. And he had done some violent things on some other reality shows. Dude, it

4 (26m 25s):
Was you, you, it was amazing. They literally like fire the security on the show. Joe's got this.

3 (26m 29s):
There was no security. That was part of the problem. Right. That was around maniacs. That was a

4 (26m 34s):
Big

3 (26m 34s):
Show. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There was zero security. There was zero security. There was me and a bunch of random maniacs that were trying to eat bull dicks. Right. And jump off buildings

4 (26m 44s):
And we don't need

3 (26m 44s):
Security. And some of them were super sketchy. Yeah. And that guy was, that guy was, he maybe could have hit me. He was thinking about hitting me when he got in his face. His body was so tense and he got so close to me. Yeah. I was like, because some, the thing about people have to realize about getting punched, this is very important to know sucker punching works because your reaction time is far slower than action time. Action time is very fast. It's probably five to 10 times faster than reaction time. So if I go like that and I hit you by the time you register that I've turned my shoulders and that my fist is heading in your direction, you're hit right.

3 (27m 28s):
And you're gonna get knocked out. Yeah. You're gonna be unready for it. Your jaw's gonna slide back. Your head's gonna snap sideways. 'cause you're not resisting it. Yeah. Your brain's gonna wash around inside your head and you're going out. Unless you're a tank, you know you're a big fucking

4 (27m 42s):
Samoan dude. Psychos.

3 (27m 43s):
Yeah. Yeah. And then he's gonna look at you and I might what a fucking terrible thing you've done. He's gonna eat you.

4 (27m 48s):
That's why Joe Rogan says sucker punch. That's, that's what I got from that. I got a sucker punch if I'm gonna win.

3 (27m 55s):
Well, just sucker punching it's effective is, but something that people do. So if someone gets that close to you, even a trained fighter has to be prepared for a sucker punch.

4 (28m 3s):
Didn't it kill Houdini?

3 (28m 5s):
No, no. He got punched in the stomach. He, he had a guy but he

4 (28m 8s):
Wasn't ready. He

3 (28m 9s):
Would do, we would let people punch him and Yeah. This guy. But I think there was something else wrong with him too.

4 (28m 13s):
I also think

3 (28m 14s):
He was, he was doing a lot of weird shit.

4 (28m 16s):
Who, I know I'm jumping around a lot, but appendicitis.

3 (28m 19s):
Yeah. Oh, he had appendicitis. Oh

4 (28m 21s):
Yeah. So that was probably it. Well, but isn't that kind of funny that, you know, we just get up there and do jokes, but like a magician will do like a trick and then be like, also someone come punch me. Like, oh, that's not a magic trick. That sounds like something a frat guy was like, a big Samoan guy would say like, someone punched me.

3 (28m 38s):
But there's like no magic to it that will really work. Like if someone says, kick me, there is no magic that's gonna save you. That's so silly. There's no magic. You can't tighten up your abs and let me kick you.

4 (28m 50s):
This is my magic trick.

3 (28m 51s):
You're gonna get really injured. You

4 (28m 53s):
Think he punched good? I'm a magician. This stupid

3 (28m 58s):
Hammer cadaver. Yeah. Yeah. Francis sga liver punching you.

4 (29m 2s):
Well. Like David Hammer cadaver David bla will do that. He'll do seven things that you're like, this guy's a witch or a warlock or something. Yeah. But then he'll be like, and now I'm gonna live in a box above New York City for a month. And you're like, don't do that. That's not magic. He

3 (29m 13s):
Made me stab him with an ice pick. Yeah.

4 (29m 16s):
In his arm. and I

3 (29m 16s):
Stabbed his arm

4 (29m 17s):
With an ice

3 (29m 18s):
Pick. I went through his arm to the other side with an ice pick.

4 (29m 20s):
Yeah, I saw that. He did that to Ricky Vees or something. Or Ricky Ve is just like, why? That's the best answer to most magic. Why This

3 (29m 26s):
Is the answer to the Houdini thing. It's his, on Friday morning, October 22nd in his dressing room at the Princess Theater in Montreal, he was punched hard in the stomach by an excitable McGill student. Excitable j Gordon Whitehead, who wanted to test the theory that Houdini was capable of with standing hard blows to the abdomen. A week later, Houdini was dead

4 (29m 47s):
Excitable.

3 (29m 48s):
Is that really what killed him? Or was it appendicitis? Did you say it was appendicitis? Jamie, that you read that? Yeah. Yeah.

4 (29m 57s):
Great head

3 (29m 58s):
Shots. See, can you, maybe you can rupture someone's appendix with a punch.

4 (30m 2s):
Oh. So that's how

3 (30m 3s):
It happened. Which is the inflammation of the odometer wall. His appendix was removed, but the poison from the ruptured appendix was already in his bloodstream. Geez. Maybe I mean it's makes sense. I know guys lose their spleens from really bad accidents. You can, you know, if your body gets damaged, like they could, they could remove your spleen. It might be like, it fucks your appendix up too. I mean it makes sense if something's hitting it.

4 (30m 27s):
These UFC guys, I mean the the blows they take for this kinda stuff. Dude, dude,

3 (30m 33s):
It's, you get too accustomed to it. It's, you know, it's so normal for me to see guys fight. It's, it's weird. It's real weird. Like I'm super accustomed to it. but it really is shocking. It is. If you just step back and watch like a real high level fight. Yeah. And the impact, it's

4 (30m 50s):
Terrifying. Shocking. If it was dogs, it'd be illegal. Right? Like you watch UFC fight, you go, you know, we couldn't do this if this was dog. Like, like I can't believe, I can't believe what, and there's people gathered around people ga I'm gamblers, you know, going, ah, yeah, yeah. And, and you're just going, I don't think that this should be a allowed, but they do it.

3 (31m 9s):
I know. It's wild. It's wild. When every now and again, you, you I mean it always, I'm always aware of how dangerous it's for the fighters and how wild it is to see. And, but every now and then someone will get really injured and, and when I'm like, oh shit. Like when Chris Wyman broke his leg, I was like, oh

4 (31m 30s):
Yeah. Shit.

3 (31m 30s):
Or when Anderson Silva broke his

4 (31m 32s):
Leg, that's the one I'm thinking of. Yeah. That clean break on his shin.

3 (31m 34s):
They both had it both. This is the craziest thing. It's only happened four times in the UFC and two times it's been with Chris Weidman.

4 (31m 40s):
Oh really? Crazy. Yeah. I don know who that guy is. He, I don't watch a lot, but I saw the silver one and I go, Ooh. He was striking him and he broke his

3 (31m 48s):
Wideman was the Yeah,

4 (31m 49s):
That's the one I saw a lot.

3 (31m 50s):
I was like, oh, UFC midway Champion at the time. That's Weidman. And he was defending his title against Anderson, who he beat in the first fight. And then Ander just, Anderson just threw that

4 (31m 60s):
So gross.

3 (32m 0s):
Oh, so disgusting, dude. And he had heard it on a check earlier. Boom. Yeah, it just gave out. Chris said that he checked it earlier and he thinks that it had hurt. Like check means when Anderson throws a kick, you lift up your leg and you try to get it where his shin hits the top of your, like right below your knee. Because that's like indestructible. Oh, okay. So it's like, what's the weakest point? The middle of your shin, if it hits that top area of the knee, the top area is not, it's not giving. Yeah, because it's reinforced. It's, it's also, it's like you can take a shot like that or like, pretty hard. Yeah. But in the middle of the shin you got all that crazy leverage and down there where Anderson broke his, think of how thin that is compared to the bones at the top.

3 (32m 45s):
So something had to give coming

4 (32m 46s):
At that.

3 (32m 47s):
It happens all the time. Well, not all the time, but

4 (32m 49s):
You see it,

3 (32m 50s):
It, it hap it's happening a lot more now because so much stuff is filmed. I I've seen a dozen of them. At least it does happen.

4 (32m 57s):
I used to work at this moving company. It used to be super rare. And you know, when you work at a place like a moving company or like, you know, any of these kind of jobs where they'll just hire a criminals. Like people with criminal records, they're like, you wanna make 20 bucks an hour, just load up this big rig with frozen groceries. I've had a lot of those jobs when I was young 'cause didn didn't go to college. And so you could tell me if this is real or not. But there, you know, it's an unreliable source. But this guy's, a guy used to be in the Marine Corps and they used to tell us, you know, you're gonna get punched, you want to get hit in the face, you wanna get hit right here. And we always picked the face. Is that, does that make fight sense or is this guy just trying to be cool at the warehouse?

3 (33m 35s):
Don don't think he knows what the fuck he's talking about. Okay.

4 (33m 37s):
Fair enough. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. These guys were like, you know.

3 (33m 39s):
Yeah. I take it in the gut. All day long over the face. Really? Yeah. But the thing about the face is it puts you out if someone's gonna like, just hit you. If like, you know, you're gonna get hit and you get to choose where you get hit, you take it in the stomach and you prepare for it, it's still gonna suck. But you could take a few if you get punched in the face by the right guy.

4 (33m 57s):
He told us that. It like blew our mind. Like,

3 (33m 60s):
I don't think he knows what he's

4 (34m 1s):
Talking about. I think he was trying to be a tough guy because it's all depends. It

3 (34m 3s):
Depends if someone hits you in the liver, like if you get a, you know someone who's really good, you know, like Ryan Garcia, he's got this nasty liver punch. Yeah. Oh God. He hits people. They just blop. You know, like Canelo Alvarez is a wicked liver punch when you, when you have that shot, it's a like a left hook that's kind of almost partially an upper cut, you know, instead of coming, it's like a body left hook and it, they'll slam it right here, right here with a rib cages and the liver's right below it. Oh my goodness. Body. It's the worst feeling you get like electrocuted, like your whole body shuts off. It's crazy. Crazy.

4 (34m 40s):
It's like a kill

3 (34m 40s):
Switch. It is a kill switch. It really is. And some guys are masterful at hitting that kill switch.

4 (34m 46s):
You know what the sad part about this is, Joe, I've, you know what, it's been 30 years, probably 25 years I've been telling that story. I, I heard a, you know, I get punched. If you had to pick between the face and the thing, you'd take the face. 'cause this, this one idiot don

3 (34m 58s):
Don't let somebody punch in the face. Yeah. You're go unconscious. You lose your vision. Yeah. You want to be able to see, you'll recover from a body shot. You're not, you might not recover from getting punched in the face.

4 (35m 10s):
Yeah. There's a lot of

3 (35m 10s):
Buttons. Like you've seen slap fighting. Oh, they get slapped unconscious. Yeah. Just a slap. Yeah. And they're ready for it. And they were, they're like professional slappers.

4 (35m 18s):
Are you shocked? That's a sport. Yes. Yeah. That comes up on my Instagram things and I'm going, what are we doing? Yeah.

3 (35m 24s):
And the UFC owns it. So I was like, I'm like okay.

4 (35m 27s):
And there's like big guys that like I, you know, they look like my neighbor Rick, you know, who are just like, now they're pro athletes. I do have to admit

3 (35m 33s):
Though, doing this, I watched those fucking Clips. I'm one of those idiots, the

4 (35m 37s):
Pro athletes. He's putting chalk on his hand.

3 (35m 40s):
He's got like rubber bands still.

4 (35m 42s):
He looks terrible trading it. He looks like he's at my dive bar. The chimney sweep just gone. All right.

3 (35m 47s):
I got one. One of the dudes, they were like, what are you gonna do with the money? Oh, get my wife some dude titties.

4 (35m 51s):
Yeah. That's a good answer though. What's the best answer you've heard? That's

3 (35m 54s):
The best

4 (35m 55s):
Answer. You interview all these guys after that. What's the best one? What's

3 (35m 57s):
Your favorite? Why? I never ask what they're gonna do with their money.

4 (35m 60s):
I know, but like what's a thing you heard afterwards where you're like, oh, I like that kind of,

3 (36m 4s):
Oh, D Derrick Lewis. My balls was hot. It has to be number one. It has to be number one. Derrick Lewis just beats this dude and then takes his pants off. Okay. And he's standing in the octagon with no pants on and I'm interviewing, I'm like, Derek, congratulations. Why'd you take your pants off? He goes, my balls was hot.

4 (36m 22s):
Oh

3 (36m 22s):
Man. I go, I understand sir. The winner.

4 (36m 24s):
Derek Lewis.

3 (36m 25s):
Derek, why'd you take your pants off?

6 (36m 27s):
My balls was hot. I

4 (36m 29s):
Understand. We weren't ready for that one. Derek

3 (36m 34s):
Is the man. No, I was ready

4 (36m 35s):
For it. That's so funny.

3 (36m 37s):
I mean my job there is to just kind of, you know, I'm not in any way a comedian when I'm interviewing fighters. Oh. That's a completely different role. I never try to make anything funny ever. Good. My job is there is just to get out of them the best expression that they can give. They're the star. That's it. It's just me trying to get it out of them. Yeah. That's all it is. Always. So like I've never, like

4 (36m 58s):
Connors is pretty good too.

3 (36m 59s):
Yeah. Oh, Connor's is amazing. No, go for go for get

6 (37m 3s):
One. Look what's next for me Joe. I'm gonna get that second be, is

4 (37m 8s):
It? Oh yeah. I remember this belts ready. I remember this. Yeah. And he was right.

3 (37m 14s):
Oh,

6 (37m 14s):
It's never been done before. I'm

3 (37m 17s):
Sure you'll get your second

4 (37m 17s):
Belt. But listen,

6 (37m 20s):
I've spent a lot of time Joe slaying everybody in the company backstage. I'm starting fight of everybody. I've ridiculed everyone on the roster and I just wanna say, from the bottom of my heart, I'd like to take this chance to apologize to absolutely nobody

4 (37m 40s):
Legendary wants there. It's that's

3 (37m 50s):
Pretty solid. Yeah, because that was what he envisioned. He envisioned him standing there with those two belts

4 (37m 56s):
And

3 (37m 56s):
It and it God happen. Yeah. He really did it. Like there's something to that fucking Oprah horse. Shit. No, it works of like manifesting things universe. The secret. You know something to that. There's something to it, but it's not guaranteed.

4 (38m 10s):
Oh yeah, yeah.

3 (38m 10s):
It's, you know, you

4 (38m 12s):
To figure, but it works. Yeah.

3 (38m 13s):
Yeah. There's something to it. There's something weird to it.

4 (38m 16s):
You carry yourself in a different way. Yeah, for sure. I've noticed that just with getting off the bottle, just my comedy's gotten better, things like that. but it is just me knowing, oh, I'm in my right mind now. Yes. Yeah. This, I got something now to prove kind of thing. Not to make Conna Gregor about myself, but just about all you, there is a thing about

3 (38m 36s):
Yeah. Seeing it,

4 (38m 36s):
Getting your shit

3 (38m 37s):
Together. Making it happen. You know, like there's something to that. It's not, again, it's not guaranteed. Right. It's like it's a part of the equation. This is what I like to think about it. It's not like you live in a land of only fate. It's not like you can just make things happen with your mind and random things don't happen to people. It's all those things. Random things do happen to people. Some people are more fortunate to people. A lot of it is luck. Yeah. A lot of this whole thing is luck. The energy you put out there in the world probably has an effect on the life that you live. And if you really truly believe that you can do something and you go for it, people applaud it. Yeah. They love it. They love to watch it.

3 (39m 17s):
They love to see it. And when you make it, it gives everybody else hope. Yeah. That they can do it too.

4 (39m 22s):
A hundred percent. It's reason I Right. Like basketball, like Jordan. Yes. Or why we, we saw someone accomplish something, we go, hey, fucking they did that thing. Yeah. What could be my thing? You know?

3 (39m 33s):
Yeah. There's part of just seeing someone who is the best at anything or just extraordinary at anything. It makes you realize that people can do wild shit, man. and it might not be the people that you're around. It might not be the people that you surround yourself with, but just knowing that those other people are out there in the world know, you know that there's a higher bar to set. Yeah. You could do it like hundred percent something, whatever, in whatever field you're doing. You watch a Mike Tyson fight from the 1980s. Just the idea that someone could be that guy Yeah. Was so crazy. It made you think that you could get better at everything you

4 (40m 10s):
Do. Well and it's not like Tyson had some silver spoon the opposite. Yeah. So for you, go look at him. You know, this kid the opposite. Remember the, I don't, I'm sure you, you know everything about Tyson. I'm not gonna tell you anything you don't know, but just, I love they did that documentary where he is like, he's being so sweet about his coach and he's going, I'm nothing, I'm like a piece of shit, you know? Yeah. And, and they let me live in their house and he's teaching me boxing and, and they're being so nice to me and these white people. And they like, they're letting me sleep with them in the house and they're feeding me and I'm thinking I'm gonna rob these motherfuckers. Like his instinct was still like, they didn't lock Of course the house up. Like I'm on a, but like, I just love that his mentality, like they took like a straight kid.

4 (40m 50s):
Yeah. You know, as guarding pigeons from his, you know, buddies. And he could be that, you know. Yeah. He could be. That's it's makes, I'm never gonna be a boxer, but I could go, maybe I could do something great.

3 (41m 0s):
Do you ever see the movie The Color of Money? It's Tom Cruise and Mary Elizabeth, master Antonio and she plays his girlfriend. She's so fucking hot. She's so young and hot. It's with Paul Newman.

4 (41m 11s):
I hate watching movies that are older but with hot chicks.

3 (41m 13s):
Oh, she was so hot back then.

4 (41m 14s):
Because now I know that they're not alive no more.

3 (41m 17s):
I think she's still alive. Well, but, but, but anyway, but Point is she's an amazing actress too. And she played his girlfriend and she was talking to Paul Newman and she had this chain around her neck and, and, and the, the dad was like, or Paul Newman was like, where'd you get it? And she's like, oh, it came from Vincent. You know, it was Vincent's mom. It was Vincent's mom's. And then he goes, did he give it to you? She goes, no. When I was with my ex-boyfriend, we stole it from his house. So she was still wearing, I

4 (41m 51s):
Stole

3 (41m 52s):
Tom Cruise's mom's chain that she stole from his house while they were dating. It's insane. but it was, it was cool. It was like, whoa. Just to know there's Vipers like that out there. Yeah, there's,

4 (42m 4s):
We, we can all be the viper, you know, like

3 (42m 6s):
In that s like Tom Cruise plays his Genius pool player that's probably autistic. And this is the girlfriend And the girlfriend is just like, like a total hustler. Yeah. Crazy person. Like just controlling him, steering him, you know, completely in control of Vincent. And if she like leaves the room, he panics. It's really wild. Yeah. It's

4 (42m 29s):
I know some, I feel like I know some women like that. Oh

3 (42m 31s):
Yeah. They're the fun ones. This is Mary Elizabeth Maton.

4 (42m 38s):
It's a great fucking movie. She is, you know, I watched, I'm gonna slaughter the name, but I was at Terry Bradshaw's house on Christmas and he likes these old movies. So he puts in like, it's something like, I'll see you in St. Louis or meet me in St. Louis or something. It's an older movie and I'm there. I got like a, you know, some cigars and we're just watching. He falls asleep. I'm watching this movie. This kind of goes back to what I was saying. don don't like to watch old films with beautiful women like that. 'cause Judy Garland's on the screen and she's just so pretty and sweet and nice. I'm falling for Judy Garland in the movie. Wow. And then she's beautiful. I was like, I'm gonna look her up. You know, see what she's, and I was like, I'm about 40 years late and she, you know, and I just going, oh yeah. Yeah.

4 (43m 18s):
But that's how dumb I am. I'm getting a crush on a woman that's been gone for 30 years and, and, and also didn't age great.

3 (43m 24s):
Well don't you ever imagine living life back then. Oh, it's like living with children. Oh, for sure. Like people back then were like, culturally they were like, but it was kind of sweet children. Yeah. Kind of sweet

4 (43m 37s):
I know it's a mushrooms idea. I'm a big mushroom guy. But like, I always I don know how when, when you do new mushrooms. When I do mushrooms, I'm with my friends and it's a us we're not, we're usually in the woods camping or something. We, I don't like to go to concerts. I don't wanna be on mushrooms, you know,

3 (43m 53s):
Too much randomness.

4 (43m 54s):
Yeah. Can't do that noise. I don't want to heater a guy. I don't know. Well right. I wanna be around some people I love, you know, I wanna be around, but I was thinking about like, in the old days, you, you rode, we'd ride our horses, you know, and, and we'd have like a little picture of our lady back home and we'd clean up the horses and we'd make some food and we'd whatever. And we'd go, I wonder what's going on out there. You know, what do you think's going on out there? We may have, might talk about it a little, call it a night. You know, we, we had our responsibilities, we had our little things. Yeah. You knew your girl and you knew some girls in town, but you knew your woman that you loved and your and your family. And then it's like, now, now I don't wonder what anyone's doing. Yeah. Can't even escape my ex-girlfriend's breakfast posts. You know, like, like we know it's, there's gotta be some happy medium.

4 (44m 35s):
Those guys knew nothing. Kind of a sweet time.

3 (44m 38s):
Kind of a sweet time. But which one would you choose?

4 (44m 40s):
See I'm only time if you backing I want that because I got now.

3 (44m 43s):
Yeah. It's nonsense. It's like what do you wanna do? Go back to being a chimp and throw shit at each other. Maybe because that they were probably like, what are these people gonna live in houses? Yeah.

4 (44m 51s):
But

3 (44m 51s):
Maybe, you know, that was one of the things that Genis Kahan, you crush

4 (44m 55s):
It as a chimp. Joe I don know if you know that you get to be Joe Rogan of the chimps. I'm pretty sure

3 (44m 59s):
You, when Genis Kahan, like one of his titles was he who Rules in all. It's like something about felt houses. So the, the, they had such disdain for people who lived in houses.

4 (45m 14s):
Look at 'em. Fat cats with their houses.

3 (45m 16s):
Yeah. They all lived in tents. They lived in felt tents. So they never had houses. They thought you were a pussy. Yeah. If you lived in a house Yeah.

4 (45m 24s):
You, you protected.

3 (45m 26s):
Yeah. So like, and you think about how horrific the Mongol Empire was and what they, did the I mean? The Mongols killed Oh, yeah. Yeah. Somewhere around 50 to 70 million people during Genghis Khan's life. They reduced the population, population of the planet by 10%. Ugh. They changed the carbon footprint. Dude,

4 (45m 45s):
I think Hitler gets too much credit. That's the one everyone knows. Everyone wants to reference Hitler. Nobody's talking about Napoleon. Or what

3 (45m 51s):
About what Stalin did?

4 (45m 52s):
Mussolini or, or Stalin or even the Mongol. Like, you know what I'm saying? Like, yeah. Those ones don't get enough. Kind of like, you know, like,

3 (45m 59s):
Well, I, I had, I used to have a joke about it, like that you could be a pirate for Halloween. Like, like, you know how crazy it is? Like pirates of the, some of the most fucking evil creatures that ever

4 (46m 9s):
Existed. They're the most famous rapists. Yeah. That's what you go, what do pirates do? Yeah. Rape and pillage. Rape and murder. Rape is the first thing.

3 (46m 17s):
Yeah.

4 (46m 17s):
You can't be a p you shouldn't be able

3 (46m 18s):
To be. It's synonymous with the title. It's like priest cha molester. You think about it,

4 (46m 22s):
Don't cancel the white girl with the Indian headdress. It's at Halloween. Not, you should have, you should be canceling the pirates.

3 (46m 28s):
That was not a fair comparison. There's way more pirates raped than priests. Like, probably all pirates raped. Oh, for sure. Priests that are pedophiles. It's probably only you had to one out of a thousand. Whatcha

4 (46m 37s):
Gonna do

3 (46m 38s):
It? Can't

4 (46m 39s):
Romance them. You're only in town for a couple days, Joe. I gotta get this stuff. I gotta bang somebody and I gotta get on the boat.

3 (46m 46s):
Yeah.

4 (46m 47s):
I ca I don't have time to take her out to dinner.

3 (46m 48s):
Well, they just took over things and killed everybody. That's what they did.

4 (46m 51s):
So do you think it, you think you'd the

3 (46m 53s):
Fact that that's a prefer

4 (46m 54s):
Costume the old times, you know, like,

3 (46m 56s):
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm a realist. The old times were horrific. You've from everything. But

4 (47m 3s):
You would've been a man of that time.

3 (47m 4s):
Yeah. For as long as I lived, there's no way I'd be like this. At 56. I would be already murdered. Yeah, that's

4 (47m 10s):
True. Somebody would've,

3 (47m 11s):
Somebody would've got me. Yeah. I would've been zigging when I should've zagged and would've caught an arrow. Ve I've been

4 (47m 16s):
Fucked me up. You know why? Because I'm a talker. Yeah. I'd have been the, I wouldn't have been the fight challenge guy. I'd

3 (47m 22s):
Probably, that doesn't always work, man. Sometimes they just cut off one of your hands. Oh, for sure.

4 (47m 25s):
So

3 (47m 25s):
There'd be some props after you talk too much. They just cut off one of your hands. Not even kill you yet. Shut

4 (47m 30s):
That guy up. That's what they say.

3 (47m 31s):
Cut off your hand. They kill me. Just to let you know, like, bro, this is so serious.

4 (47m 35s):
Well, like when I watch the cowboy movies, right. I really love cowboy stuff. When I watch those, I don't identify with the lead cowboy. I don't identify with the gun slinger. You don't identify with. When they go into the saloon and the guy's like, boys, what do you have? And he is like, wiping down a glass. What do you guys at pour the whiskey for you guys? And then when you guys start fucking shooting on the counter, I just, yeah. I think I'd be that guy and they'd be like, I like Jeff's bar. You know that he's got, you wanna swing by see Jeff? He's always got a little joke for you. And he's got the whiskey and the glass. Yeah. I identify with that guy and that guy's life's not great. No. But I think I could do that. I think I'd survive that way.

3 (48m 9s):
That's a good way to be. That's the best job in Old West is the bartender guy. Yeah. As long as nobody breaks a bottle over

4 (48m 16s):
Your head. I got no problems with anybody. You guys start finding and go, Hey, I'll clean it up when you guys leave. Your

3 (48m 20s):
Problem. Being a bartender in the old west is your little too fucking handsome. That'd affect me. Be issue. Yeah. Guy. The girls would be talking to you and then the guys would want kill you.

4 (48m 29s):
How did you ever work? Road back, back Kill people road? I don't know much about your Yes. Your comedy crew, crew before you were very successful.

3 (48m 34s):
Yeah. Yeah. I did the road.

4 (48m 36s):
So I have a joke that I put in my act whenever I'm in a small town. It's just in Norfolk. and I was like, I'm looking for a Norfolk experience. You guys know what it's like. Beautiful girl will flirt with me. Her big boyfriend will beat the shit outta me. And then I'll get outta here. Like, that's, that's every small town. That's how it works, you know? Right. Some girl with a, she's hot, but she's got tattoos and a Annie problem. Yeah. And then, you know, some, like you were talking, I was like, she's talking to me. You know, like some, maybe that would happen.

3 (49m 1s):
Well, there's girls let, that likes it to sink their pit bulls on men. That's what it is.

4 (49m 6s):
One of those kids, they have

3 (49m 7s):
A boyfriend who's a pit bull one of, yeah. And they get excited. They like that their, their man fight for. Yeah. Dude, dude, that's real. Yeah. Yeah. Those, those, those girls get you into

4 (49m 15s):
Trouble. There was a girl that the best sexual chemistry I've ever had with a woman. and I, I hate cliches. I tell you this last night, I don't like anything I've heard before. So, you know, the old stupid, like the Zi ones are the best. Sexually I mean,

3 (49m 27s):
You know, that's cliche socks.

4 (49m 29s):
I know there's nice girls that are freaks. They're really good. Yeah, exactly. So, but this girl, I hate to say it, you know, she was easily the best sexual chemistry ever. But she broke into my house and she, you know, and she also would climb the gate in like a Vegas dress. You know, I mean she was the best sexually, but like, she was a psycho. Yeah. A crazy person.

3 (49m 48s):
My friend Tony says that exotic and neurotic are closely related or not, you know, or psychotic, rather psychotic. And Jesus Christ. What happened to my voice? Psychotic and erotic. Right? They're they're, they're completely interconnected. They flirt

4 (50m 4s):
With that line. Yeah. Yeah.

3 (50m 5s):
They're in there together. Tony Zara, shout out to Tony. Yeah. I'm like, he's dead. Right. Like, there's something about like, the energy that someone would have that's so unique. Yeah. And so aggressive sexually, like, you know, like some girl who's just behaving like a, a co complete nfo psycho. And you're like, oh my God, this is wild. And when you're a young

4 (50m 24s):
Girl, wild is sexy. Yeah. Yeah. Young

3 (50m 26s):
Guy. And you're free. and I can't believe this is how, but you not, you don't have good preservation instincts. 'cause you wouldn't be friends with a guy like that. Right. That's a crazy person.

4 (50m 33s):
Yeah. But we do, I'm a, we talked about it. We like crazy people. Yeah. They're fun.

3 (50m 37s):
They're fun. Yeah. Crazy people are fun problem. A lot of my friends, it's a problem. Are legitimately crazy. But

4 (50m 41s):
It's fun. Yeah.

3 (50m 42s):
Yeah. It makes things, it's like, how much can you control the crazy, it's like, do you have a Ferrari? Yeah. That Ferrari has 700 horsepower. Do you know how to drive that? Like, how much can you control that crazy? 'cause occasionally you're gonna fucking spin out around the, to the corners.

4 (50m 56s):
One of my best friends is a crazy person who, I love him, but he, you know, I can't tell you how often there's some situation where I go, Hey bud. Right. You know, we can't do that again at a comedy club, you know, but, but he is the guy that I promise you probably my only friend who if I went to his house and goes, Hey, something bad happened. We gotta get rid of this body. You know, he would, yeah. He

3 (51m 17s):
Gets, he would

4 (51m 17s):
Just be like, all right, let's do this. You know? and I mean he really would. And that's scary a little.

3 (51m 22s):
Yeah, it is. But that's the kind of humans you want. 'cause all these rules that we have are all just created by humans. We've agreed to 'em as if they're unbreakable doctrine. Listen to me and listen very carefully. If the power goes out for too long, all those rules are bullshit. And that guy who will bury a body for you is the kind of person you want on your team. A

4 (51m 45s):
Hundred percent. The

3 (51m 46s):
Reality

4 (51m 46s):
Is, if power goes out, I'm probably gonna show up to your place. I got a spot for you. Be in the gym. Yeah. Go. Can I just be in your gym?

3 (51m 53s):
I've thought about like literally setting up a ranch out here. Yeah. Just specifically for if things go sideways. Yeah.

4 (52m 0s):
Well, I mean you're, I think you're pretty set up. This place is safe.

3 (52m 3s):
It's not that safe. Right. Dude, if things go sideways, it's not safe anywhere. You, we have to understand that this society that we have that stays civil and, and beautiful and you know, and equitable, and we have all this change is happening in the world. This is only possible if you can get goods and services to people. And if people have access to information is not hard to shut that off. If the power went out in this country, if someone attacked the grid and just destroyed our power grid and destroyed our satellites. If there was a coordinated effort. Coordinated effort by multiple superpowers to just destroy our satellites. Yeah. Destroy our grid.

3 (52m 45s):
We would be in chaos. Quickly.

4 (52m 47s):
Pretty fast. Yeah. Yeah.

3 (52m 48s):
Quickly. Very quickly. And then if it lasts too long and there's some sort of a hostile military takeover of the country, you're living in a totally different world than the one you live in now. Now you live in China and you never thought that was possible. You thought that, you know, you would be able to just exist here and demand universal basic income. And you would have all these ideas in your head about the, the border walls, racist and this and that. And then all of a sudden you live in a world that's unrecognizable. And that's just an example of what could happen if someone acts, if a human being does something.

3 (53m 32s):
Which is very similar to what other human beings are doing right now, all over the world. What's happening right now in Ukraine? What's happening right now in Israel that is human beings launching bombs at people they've never met. Yeah. But that's happening For sure. The idea that that is not gonna happen here Yeah. Is just stupid. It's stupid. Yeah. If you're living in Gaza right now, think about that reality. Yeah. Think about the reality of where you used to sleep at night. Yeah. Is now rubble. Everything around it is rubble. If you are lucky and you can see that because you're alive.

4 (54m 8s):
Yeah. But some women have to deal with cat calling. Joe,

3 (54m 12s):
Listen, it's always good to move forward. Like, it's always good to call out bullshit, but at a certain point in time, you need perspective. You know, don't clean your bathroom while your fucking house is on fire. No shit. You know, figure out what the fuck we need to do. Yeah. To make sure we don't blow ourselves up. And that's just, if humans act, the real thing is stuff from somewhere else. Yeah. The real thing is asteroids. That's the real one. Kids, if you look at the Moon, that's us. The Moon is pelted, pelted by asteroids. There's craters everywhere. You look at every other planet that we could see, they all get hit.

3 (54m 54s):
You look at the surface of our planet, there's craters everywhere. Everywhere. This fucking place gets hit a lot.

4 (55m 2s):
I don't like to think about live that long space for those reasons.

3 (55m 6s):
Nobody likes to think about it.

4 (55m 8s):
Well, because I can't control anything but me. Right. And so if I can't even control the people in my ni you know, the, the, yeah. Governor can't even control that guy. The space. She seems so big going like, oh, an astro. What are you gonna do? What's the plan for an asteroid?

3 (55m 26s):
There's no plan right now. Yeah. I think they've got some theories of how to do something. But I, last time I spoke to someone who's an expert on the subject. He said it was about 10 years away from them being able to actually successfully divert asteroids. And then also you gotta spot 'em all. Yeah. Some of 'em are coming from behind the sun. And apparently the way the gravity of the sun works, 'cause it's so massive, it distorts the view of things that are coming from behind it. Yeah. The

4 (55m 52s):
Asteroid goes, how about a sucker punch? You know, just little sucker punch earth. They won't be ready. That's

3 (55m 56s):
What it is. Yeah. That's what it is. That's

4 (55m 58s):
Scary,

3 (55m 58s):
Bro. Have you ever looked at the size of our son in comparison to earth? Yeah. And then looked at other sons in comparison to our son, the biggest sons that are out there. I

4 (56m 8s):
Didn't know there's other sons. That's how that, that's where I'm at. Holy shit. Educationally. I didn't even know. There's other sons who

3 (56m 14s):
Stars Other stars. Stars are sons, basically. Okay. But the, the really big ones are bigger in proportion to like what you see, earth and the sun. Yeah. When they see the sun and it, yeah. They're bigger than that. Like, these things are so big.

4 (56m 29s):
I hate Neil deGrasse Tyson or Neil, whatever the, that guy's name is. I hate you. You suck in my opinion. I think you're a bozo. But he did say a really interesting thing once where he was talking about aliens. It, it might've been to you.

3 (56m 41s):
Why do you hate him?

4 (56m 44s):
Well, he said this thing, I'll get to that in a second. But he said, he goes, he was talking about life on other planets. And he goes saying that there isn't life, you know, other than us, is like taking a thimble of ocean water and going, look, there's no whales. There's no whales in here. And it's really like, that's a great analogy. Like Of course, there's life out there.

3 (57m 6s):
Yeah. Most likely there's life. So this is just showing somewhere. This is just showing the relative sizes. Oh my gosh. And then showing. So you go all the way from earth to the sun. And now serious. A and then look at this one, look at Pollux and look at this one arc. Urus. Now look how much bigger they are than the earth. Look at this one. Look at that one. Al Durra. Look at, where's this guy? No, no, no, no, no, no. Wait, just wait. Look at this motherfucker. What's

4 (57m 33s):
That? A, that

3 (57m 34s):
God's a blue hyper giant star called pistol star One

4 (57m 37s):
Just called Gus,

3 (57m 38s):
Bro. No. Look, he keeps going. Dude. What is this one? No, these are the stars. This is how crazy the universe is. Look at that one Stevenson now. No, no, no. We're not done. Look at the sides.

4 (57m 50s):
No, no, no, bro.

3 (57m 51s):
Look at the size. Black hole of a black hole. Super massive black hole there. Bigger one. Now look at the size of this one.

4 (58m 0s):
This is blowing my mind,

3 (58m 2s):
Bro. There's black holes out there that are the size of galaxies.

4 (58m 5s):
Joe, if we were on mushrooms right now, I would be quiet for about four minutes after this. Just go. Oh, yeah. Can you give me four minutes to just look at your roof first, second. For sure. That's insane,

3 (58m 16s):
Dude. Look at the size of these galaxies too. 220 light years across 1,862 light years across. Yeah. See, look at this one 54,000 light years across. Oh, then it, that's us. 105 Milky Way.

4 (58m 33s):
Oh.

3 (58m 34s):
Do you ever been to a place where you could really see the stars at night?

4 (58m 37s):
Yeah. That's one of my favorite things about being like camping. Camping and out in the, just how dark and beautiful it is. It's really beautiful.

3 (58m 45s):
It's wild. Right? When you go that's up there all the time. Do you think

4 (58m 48s):
Aliens, do you think aliens are looking at us going, this guy's, he's all losing his mind over a slam dunk. You know, he is going like these, they're all, everyone on this planet is going, that guy slam dunks the best. Mm. When it's, when you look at the world like, or the universe like that, and you go, all these earthlings are wearing the same shirt as that guy that dunks the best. Not the guy that survives the best, not the guy that Yeah. Can feed the most or is the most noble or is the, we're all losing our mind about the guy that, you know, made the most three pointers.

3 (59m 25s):
Well, I think it all has to do with war. That's what I think. How so? I think the desire to be good at competitive athletics is the, the roots of it are all in war. It all started in war. Okay. That's what I think. I'm listening and I think that that instinct to dominate and to, to get better at one-on-one competition or team competition all started from tactics and strategies in war. And that's that desire, that human reward system is still in our heads. And we know that we don't wanna do that anymore. So we have to find other ways of doing it. A little game. Yeah.

3 (1h 0m 5s):
So I think the aliens would realize like, oh, their human reward system got hijacked for something that doesn't even matter. Right. Who, like, I play pool. Right? I love pool, but, and when I play it, it's like, if you watch, it's like, why do you give a fuck if the ball goes in the hole? Well, it's the goal. It's so stupid. Right. But it's this coordinated mind effort thing that ignites that part of the brain that wants you to be good at war. Hmm. That's why we love competition. That's why we watch, like watching, it's like a built in reward system in our mind. And then also like, if we're a society that's constantly looking to innovate, we're, we're constantly looking for people that are pushing the boundaries of whatever they do.

3 (1h 0m 49s):
Whether it's music, whatever they do. Right. Comedy. Yeah. Pushing the boundary. Like someone who's at the front of the line just out there chasing it. Yeah. Because that sort of applies to society as a whole. So if someone's doing that in a very public sphere, like playing in the NFL, that's, that that ex it excites the energy of the people to do more things. and I think it's like a tribal Yeah. Like reward system That's

4 (1h 1m 14s):
In our head too. That's interest. Yeah. Like a little mini.

3 (1h 1m 16s):
Yeah. So I think the aliens would recognize that. I hope, I think they would say this is probably a normal progression of, you know, territorial apes, then territorial apes with nuclear weapons, and then territorial apes that eventually evolve and then go out into the stars. Yeah. That's probably, it's probably how it always has to

4 (1h 1m 34s):
Happen. They go, neither one of them died and that one's better.

3 (1h 1m 37s):
Yeah. Because I don't think competition, I don't think you ever get the kind of innovation that you have today, or that you probably had in the past. don. Don't think you build the pyramids without competition.

4 (1h 1m 47s):
Facts. Yeah.

3 (1h 1m 48s):
Yeah, yeah. There's, there's something about that aspect of the human spirit that we want to compete, we wanna win. Like that, that, that fuels us in a way that like people are embarrassed by. I think sometimes. It's one of the things they hate about Trump. We're winning. We're always gonna win. Yeah. We're winner. Yeah.

4 (1h 2m 6s):
They're losers. I like that about They're

3 (1h 2m 8s):
All losers. Yeah.

4 (1h 2m 9s):
You know, if you read his book, I don't read any books. I listen to books. Yeah. I listen to books mostly. I listen to about about 10,000 books a a year. That's what I'm doing, Joe. I'm reading 10 books a day.

3 (1h 2m 22s):
I, I heard there's another guy who does that too. Oh

4 (1h 2m 24s):
Yeah. Yeah. Kindred spirit to me. Yeah. No. So I listen to about, I listen to one book probably every week and a half, you know? Yeah. Because Audible, you can crank 'em. Yeah. I'll be like playing video games or driving or on an airplane or something. And so I just listen to a lot of books and I'm trying to think why I brought that up. What were we saying before the book

3 (1h 2m 41s):
Trump Trump's winning.

4 (1h 2m 42s):
Oh yeah. Trump's book. Thank you, Jim. The,

3 (1h 2m 45s):
The Art of the Deal.

4 (1h 2m 46s):
He's always talked like that. Yes. Even before he was a president. So if you know that, that's just kind of how he is. Yeah. You'd have totally understood that that's how real estate guys taught my building's the best. Yeah. And it's the biggest. And yeah, they go, it's not the biggest. And they go, it's the best hotel. That's like, that's how he is. So once you know that it's, it isn't like he's lying or anything, it's just that's what he, that's how the man

3 (1h 3m 6s):
Is also, he comes from a different era. Yeah. And by the way, he was celebrated forever. Forever

4 (1h 3m 11s):
Being

3 (1h 3m 12s):
That. And then they turned him into a monster for the presidential campaign. Yeah. Before that. Oh. They turned, he turned himself into a monster initially because he was claiming that Obama was from Kenya. Yeah. Yeah.

4 (1h 3m 22s):
That was a tough hill to die on too. Yeah. Like it would,

3 (1h 3m 26s):
Here's my take. Who gives a fuck what patch of dirt you're born on? Are we trying to pretend that he was like some embedded

4 (1h 3m 33s):
It was a strange one. That one. Yeah.

3 (1h 3m 34s):
Was he like an embedded enemy operative country?

4 (1h 3m 36s):
Because I'm not an Obama guy by any means, but I remember being like, I don't care where it is.

3 (1h 3m 40s):
It's a weird thing to care about. Yeah. Like why do you care? Like, especially Obama. I mean Trump was a lifelong Democrat. Like most of his life he was Democrat, which is what a weird thing to care that this one guy who's listen put policy aside. I've said this a thousand times. I'll say it again. That's the best president we've ever had. Most charming. This is the best re representation of what we would hope we would want the world to see of America. Yeah. Very highly educated, well likable, well spoken, even keeled, emotionally balanced. Yeah. Brilliant man. Not too black. Who was, who was cl but also pulled himself up Yes. From hard times and likable. Single mother. Very likable, very charismatic.

3 (1h 4m 20s):
So all those things, and you care what patch of dirty was born on. Right. Should you, you should really care. Like what are the's an America policies, what's, what's, what's good, what's bad? What's good for business? What's bad for business? What's good for the, the, the world order, the economy, what's good for, you know, international relations. That's what he should be. Why he care about what

4 (1h 4m 38s):
He's born. And, and that's the adverse problem with Trump, right. Is that nobody's looking at the policies, they're just going unlikable, you know, talks from the hip, you know? Yeah. And so, like, hits the reverse problem. We have a guy who I think I like, I like Trump for being America first and I like that. He's honest and unapologetic about the, the way he talks about other people. Like, if you don't like a guy, you don't like a guy and he'll tell you Yeah. But he's so un unlikeable. Well that, that's what works against him.

3 (1h 5m 1s):
The media also, you gotta realize that for all these years, all these years, they were pushing this bullshit about this Russia collusion. They were, they, they were talking about the Steele dossier, this fake thing that they, the Clinton campaign funded. They they were doing all these things to demonize him. Yeah. At the same time they were lying about the Hunter bidet laptop. Yeah. It, it's just, you got spoon fed some bullshit, unfortunately. And on top of that, he's an easy guy to hate. Yep. So it's both of those guys. He

4 (1h 5m 33s):
Doesn't try to be, he never played the game. And so then the Yeah. I

3 (1h 5m 36s):
Mean he's got, you know, he's definitely got some stretches of the

4 (1h 5m 40s):
Truth. You know, if I Joe, Rogan, you know, who I try to hang out with all the time? Is who? George W. Bush.

3 (1h 5m 45s):
Oh, right.

4 (1h 5m 46s):
I think he'd be a cool guy to hang out with. He might be

3 (1h 5m 48s):
Depressed.

4 (1h 5m 49s):
He

3 (1h 5m 49s):
Might be just painting, thinking about all those people that died. It's exactly,

4 (1h 5m 53s):
I like to think that he is doing, you know, playing, playing catch.

3 (1h 5m 55s):
Think about a million dead Iraqis.

4 (1h 5m 59s):
I

3 (1h 5m 59s):
Guess that's,

4 (1h 6m 0s):
But I mean as a guy. That's

3 (1h 6m 2s):
One of those ones, dude, that's that one. Like if I was president while the Iraq, you know, I was responsible for that and I was still alive heavy. I'd be like, check please. I don't want this fucking vibe on me. There's no way you're having good days. Yeah. If you're a a, a consc person. Yeah. Do you think, look, we know that weapons and mass destruction shit was bullshit. Right, right, right. We know it now. Yeah. It's universally accepted.

4 (1h 6m 26s):
Well,

3 (1h 6m 26s):
But that's why that war was started. For

4 (1h 6m 29s):
Sure. And Obama I mean he's got a lot of deaths on his,

3 (1h 6m 33s):
A lot of

4 (1h 6m 33s):
Drones. Yeah. A lot of drones. A different type of ramped up that fucking, he went for the number. He went for the record Sky robot. He went for the record.

3 (1h 6m 40s):
The sky robots with missiles are the scariest dude.

4 (1h 6m 42s):
I know. Imagine every Sam Tripoli tweet that I see is a of, you know, some robot chasing a soldier and then touching the soldier and blowing you're

3 (1h 6m 50s):
Imagin Yemen like

4 (1h 6m 52s):
A video game.

3 (1h 6m 52s):
Imagine being in Yemen and you're on your way to a wedding and there's a, a whole line of you driving towards this wedding and you're like, what are the odds? We get nuked from the sky.

4 (1h 7m 3s):
Pretty good.

3 (1h 7m 5s):
That's pretty good. Odd scary to be in a, a line of cars headed somewhere in Yemen.

4 (1h 7m 13s):
I just meant George w seems cool, you know, with the baseball and your cousin and the cigars and the beers.

3 (1h 7m 17s):
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

4 (1h 7m 18s):
I don't wanna think about that part of

3 (1h 7m 19s):
It. Your cousin's a terrorist and he happens to be in the third car back. Can't do that. He's just here for the wedding. Yeah.

4 (1h 7m 24s):
Oh, he is our friend. Don't let

3 (1h 7m 25s):
The cousin come. He's got metadata.

4 (1h 7m 28s):
You should stay home, Andre. You know,

3 (1h 7m 30s):
'cause that's what they did with some of those drone attacks. They attacked metadata I know. So if they I mean, if you

4 (1h 7m 35s):
Are texting, I dunno what metadata is.

3 (1h 7m 37s):
This is what it is. So if you are texting from a cell phone, if you're calling from a cell phone, yeah. They can locate that cell phone. They can triangulate the, the area where that cell phone is. There's been times where they just send a missile

4 (1h 7m 50s):
To that, to that cell phone. To that phone. Oh my God. He's in a cafe.

3 (1h 7m 53s):
You could be that cell phone. Your baby could be sitting in the crib playing a game on your phone.

4 (1h 7m 58s):
Yeah. I

3 (1h 7m 58s):
Can't, like legitimately. Yeah. And the number of people that are just innocent civilians versus the number of targets that get killed by drones is off the charts.

4 (1h 8m 9s):
You don't even know what your dad does for a living. You, you don't even know. Yeah. What he's, what he's, how he's making money or

3 (1h 8m 14s):
Anything. You're a baby. Yeah. Like watching a YouTube video.

4 (1h 8m 17s):
Oh my

3 (1h 8m 17s):
Gosh. You get hit with a missile. Yeah.

4 (1h 8m 19s):
See that. This is why America's great is that I don't, you know, you don't, we have the luxury of I mean. At least I do. Yeah. I have the luxury of not thinking about that All

3 (1h 8m 29s):
Day. Yeah. It's crazy. You know, the people that think about it, the drone operators. Yeah. They go through a very Bazar state of PTSD apparently.

4 (1h 8m 37s):
I

3 (1h 8m 38s):
See. If you can find anything on that, because I was reading something about that, like, that's a weird PTSD that a drone operators have

4 (1h 8m 43s):
To be separated from it. Well, dude, it's like playing Call of Duty All day. But you're really killing people. Yeah.

3 (1h 8m 48s):
You're people are really dying.

4 (1h 8m 49s):
I had a guy

3 (1h 8m 50s):
Watching it on a screen. don

4 (1h 8m 51s):
Don't think he would want me to say his name. Yeah. I won't say, I won't say so, but he was like, I, I'm Joe. I met this guy for, I'm pretty good at making friends pretty quick. I'm just chatting him up at the bar in San Diego. Military guy. He's all jacked. He just seems like a, like a cool guy. And he's like, oh, I know you're comedy man. You're friends with Josh and blah, blah, blah. So I just chop it up with him. I'm probably talking to this guy for minimum five minutes. and I go, what do you do, man? He's like, oh, I'm in the military. And I was like, you know, San Diego. So I go all night, well, thanks for your service. I do the whole thing. and I goes, you wanna see I? was like, yeah. Yeah. I didn't think anything of it. He pulls up on his phone a drone attack that he, that he did. And, and it's a, it looks like a video game to the, that's the only context I have is of, of what a video game would look like.

4 (1h 9m 36s):
And there's a guy here, a guy here, a guy here, and he gets the one guy, the two guys run away. And then a dog was like right next to that guy. The dog's fine too. And he was gone see that got that guy and the even the dog lived and those two guys next to him, I got him. And in my, but I've never seen anything like this in my life. and I, look at this guy. and I go, wait, wait, that guy's dead now. He goes, yeah, that was, I, I did that like literally like last week. And he's showing it to me on his phone. He's got like a saved file to a stranger that he met five minutes ago. I

3 (1h 10m 5s):
Don't think that's legal. Really? I bet that footage is like highly classified. Really? Yeah. I bet you can get really fucked

4 (1h 10m 12s):
Up. Well, it's good. I didn't say his name. Huh?

7 (1h 10m 14s):
The conclusion of a study on it done in 2021. And right here it says, because if they admit psychological issues, they're gonna prob they could lose their job. Oh. So there's not a lot of known,

4 (1h 10m 26s):
It's like the concussion thing in the NFL. Yeah.

7 (1h 10m 28s):
Like they're saying in this whole study, like they know there is something here, but because it's really hard to study and it's all secret

3 (1h 10m 35s):
I mean, I think it has to be a thing. Yeah. There's no way you could be able to launch missiles out of a robot in the sky and accidentally kill 80% civilians and

4 (1h 10m 44s):
Feel nothing. Yeah.

3 (1h 10m 45s):
Yeah. What is, what is the actual numbers of civilians killed in drone strikes? I know we've done this before, but I can never remember. But it's kind of nuts. It's not like it's 50 50. Yeah, yeah,

4 (1h 10m 57s):
Yeah. Yeah. That'd be great. I mean

3 (1h 10m 58s):
50 50 is like negotiable a half. You know, you know the guy's a really bad guy's gonna kill a million people with a nuclear bomb. We could bomb his apartment building. Yeah. Kill a few unfortunate folks that happen to be in the vicinity. But we have to get him. That's

4 (1h 11m 11s):
Why it's good to be a comedian.

3 (1h 11m 12s):
Oh my God.

4 (1h 11m 14s):
The decisions I have to make

3 (1h 11m 15s):
So much better. Yeah. It's so much better.

4 (1h 11m 18s):
Yeah. Like, but also just the thinking about, you know, 'cause the, the guy that I'm referencing, he didn't make those decisions. He's been Right. Trained to do that. Yeah. Someone else has to make that decision. I just don't

3 (1h 11m 29s):
Think he's supposed to show people that video. Don't

4 (1h 11m 31s):
Do it. It was, I don't

3 (1h 11m 32s):
Think you're even supposed to have that

4 (1h 11m 33s):
Video. I haven't shut the fuck up about it since it happened. That was like four years ago. Five years ago I was gone. I just couldn't believe it. It's

3 (1h 11m 39s):
What? It's fucking nuts. Yeah. There's so many of those videos now. You could see so much war footage now because

4 (1h 11m 45s):
How do you see all this stuff? I remember a long time ago they showed you two girls one cup and, and you're, and

3 (1h 11m 50s):
It was red bad. Yeah.

4 (1h 11m 51s):
But your reaction was like, man, this is nothing I've seen. You know? And then the what you referenced, we all as fans go, what is he talking about? And then we find that stuff we're going, holy shit. Like Yeah. But like how, like what is the don don't even know what the dark web is.

3 (1h 12m 5s):
Well, You don't have to go don don't do that. But just on Instagram alone now every day. Yeah. Now Instagram's bananas

4 (1h 12m 12s):
Now, but back then you were, you knew where stuff was and Oh,

3 (1h 12m 15s):
You on the air airstrike. Okay, hold on a second. US airstrikes killed at least 22,000 civilians since nine 11. So what is the, that's the number of people that were killed. But like, what's the percentage? 'cause there was a crazy percentage of casualties that were not, you know, they're just civilians. It is just

4 (1h 12m 36s):
Civilians. Oh, no.

3 (1h 12m 36s):
Right, right. But I'm saying, what is the percentage? There was a, a percentage number something nuts, like over 80% civilian deaths. You think

4 (1h 12m 44s):
It'd be like 400. Right? You go, oops, 400. Not oops. 22,000. The death

3 (1h 12m 49s):
This year was during Trump 2017 when at least 4,931 civilians were likely killed. The vast majority in coalition bombings of Iraq and Syria. However, the going by maximum estimates 2017 emerges as the worst year for civilians with up to 19,623 killed almost all in the bombing campaign against Isis. Death toll from us airstrikes, 387,000 civilians who are believed to have been killed by all parties during the war on terror. Wow.

4 (1h 13m 27s):
I take it back. I get, I get why the aliens go, oh, I get why he likes the guy that dunks.

3 (1h 13m 32s):
Yeah.

4 (1h 13m 33s):
That guy didn't, it's way better than doing that. It's way better than this. Yeah, yeah.

3 (1h 13m 36s):
Yeah. Unfortunately, no one can imagine a world without that stuff. That's what's crazy. Because if you, if you said to people like, what are the odds? There'll be no war in five years, everyone's gonna say fucking zero. Yeah. Okay. Here it is. Suggest that civilians make up between 7.27% and 15.47% of the deaths in US drone strikes in Pakistan. Hmm.

7 (1h 13m 57s):
This doesn't include, it's just those three places. It doesn't include like Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran.

3 (1h 14m 2s):
Hmm. I've heard it like way skewed in the other direction. Sure.

7 (1h 14m 6s):
I I'm also under the assumption that this data isn't gonna be most prevalent in a search.

3 (1h 14m 12s):
Right. but it seems like there's gotta be somebody who compiled that. I,

7 (1h 14m 17s):
I'm looking, but it still, like I get getting lost in different websites that are old from 2014 when people were talking about this a lot more. And there's nothing just like saying the number right up front. Mm.

3 (1h 14m 33s):
It's a, it is a, it's a crazy way to kill people. It really is. It's just I mean. And ultimately, we're probably gonna look at this, the way we look at cannonballs, you know, like cannonballs now are ridiculous because we have missiles. Why would we use a cannonball when I could just

4 (1h 14m 51s):
Ball wrecking through them?

3 (1h 14m 52s):
We have hypersonic missiles. Hypersonic missiles are a real thing that human beings are created. They can change direction in the air. That's amazing. You can't figure out where the fuck they're going. And by the time you do, they've already hit Yeah. They go faster than the speed of sound. Imagine

4 (1h 15m 5s):
A cannonball coming at you. Go, you go, he still using this. What is

3 (1h 15m 9s):
This? Yeah. So Murphy Misfired claimed that eight out of 10 US drones missed their target. Eight

4 (1h 15m 14s):
Out

7 (1h 15m 14s):
Of 10. They're saying that this is not the correct quote. I mean he fucked up by saying that.

3 (1h 15m 19s):
Oh, that's not accurate. Good. Oh, he just made a

4 (1h 15m 21s):
Mistake. Well, I'm glad they made it the headline. You know,

3 (1h 15m 22s):
That's,

4 (1h 15m 24s):
That's, that's good for guys like me.

3 (1h 15m 27s):
Yeah. Either way. Yeah. Civilian death toll is calculated between, so here's the other problem too that I, that I've been told. The, the problem is a lot of times when they get their death numbers, they're getting them from the ground. They're getting 'em from people on the ground. And the, whether it's ISIS or whoever will exaggerate the amount of civilian deaths. Oh, okay. And so to make it look terrible, that I mean, this is one of the reasons why, you know, like Hamas does things in hospitals. Yeah. You know, they just killed those guys in hospitals the other day.

4 (1h 15m 58s):
Don, they live under the hospitals and stuff. Or like, that's where the base is.

3 (1h 16m 1s):
That's supposedly don don't know enough to comment on that me, but I do know that that's what they've always said. These these guys operate in places where you can't bomb. Right. Like hospitals. Yeah. and it turns out that was true in this case, they killed these three guys at a hospital.

7 (1h 16m 13s):
That was true over a five month period in Afghanistan over a decade ago. Wow. That eight outta 10. So

3 (1h 16m 19s):
Eight outta 10 time period. That

7 (1h 16m 20s):
Was accurate.

4 (1h 16m 21s):
So what do you get in trouble for saying it for?

7 (1h 16m 23s):
Because he was telling, I don't know, this

3 (1h 16m 24s):
Is, oh, so what were you mad at Neil deGrasse Tyson for?

4 (1h 16m 27s):
I'm not mad at him. I'm annoyed that a man of science would say things like, you know, I like to get my information from smart people. I like to think that a guy like him who's very smart, would say a smart thing that has no emotions linked to it. You know, like, you like to think like Right. Gimme the facts, you know, gimme some stuff.

3 (1h 16m 46s):
Which he does with a lot of things. Yeah. Well,

4 (1h 16m 48s):
I've, I've, yeah. Used to really like him a lot. And then you'll say something like, you know, someone will say, well, like biologically, we have a male and a female has chromosomes, different chromosomes than a man. You can look at the bones of a man and the bones of a female. And despite what's going on in your emotions and in your soul or spirit or whatever we wanna label it. If we're just talking about the biological makeup of something, we can put them into two categories. Yes. Forget what your spirit is, or your essence, or how you feel. If we're just looking at the meat and bones and cells and chromosomes of something, we can make biological arguments that there is a male and a female. And then his argument goes, why do you care?

4 (1h 17m 29s):
What do you mean? Why do I care? Like you're the man of science. You should tell me that that should be your argument. Is that if we're just looking at biology and not the spirit of someone or whatever the feelings. And instead his argument is, why do you care? I care. You know, I want you to tell people facts about things scientifically, not just go, what does it matter? You go, well, when you go on about the cosmos, what people don't go, why do you care? We care. Like, like that's not a good scientific argument for things. And he's really jumped ship on science as a science guy.

3 (1h 18m 4s):
Yeah. It's Bazar, but it strange. It's a mind virus and it's a, a mind virus that demands compliance. You have to comply to this ridiculous new ideology. And a part of that, and this is where it really annoyed me about his argument was that that should apply somehow to sports.

4 (1h 18m 23s):
Oh yeah.

3 (1h 18m 24s):
And this, this is where this is going. This is why it's so crazy. Yeah. That that is absolutely insane. Yeah. That's absolutely insane. This is not saying that people shouldn't be allowed to be transgender Of course they should Yeah. Be allowed

4 (1h 18m 34s):
To do whatever you want to do. We can treat 'em nice. Yes. But then also have facts. But

3 (1h 18m 37s):
You cannot just say you're a woman and compete with women in sports. And if you support that scientifically, that is untenable like that just scientifically with the amount of data that we have about the difference between differences between males and females in sports. Yeah. The gap is so wide that you're gonna have your outliers, your extraordinary females, and your weak men, and they're gonna kind of cross over. They

4 (1h 18m 60s):
Love to use those examples.

3 (1h 19m 1s):
Yeah. But those examples aren't valid. Right. 'cause if you take a, a biological male of normal athletic ability competing against a biological, the best female who is elite of elite, the biological male has massive advantages. Yeah. Especially in things like combat sports. So they just passed a thing allowing biological males to identify as females and box females. Yeah.

4 (1h 19m 25s):
It's crazy to me.

3 (1h 19m 26s):
And I don't know what parameters they have. You can't just be making weight. 'cause if it's just making weight, like holy shit, are you testing testosterone levels? Are you like, are you making sure? 'cause if it, what are you doing? Yeah. Like, what are you doing?

4 (1h 19m 41s):
There's a reason it's separated.

3 (1h 19m 43s):
It's so crazy to let them do this because there are people that are legitimately transgender and they, again, should be able to do whatever they want to do. But there's also people that are out of their fucking mind.

4 (1h 19m 55s):
Be reasonable. That's all it

3 (1h 19m 56s):
Is. And, and there's people that literally, if you allow them to pretend to be a woman and beat women up, they will do it.

4 (1h 20m 2s):
Yep. Well, it's, it's funny. I use Brendan Shab in the bit. I'm doing it on my special, the last cowboy in la I have a bit where I talk about Fallon Fox. Right. And I'm, because I used to be one of these guys, I don I. don I'm a comedian. I want everyone to laugh. Right. I want, I wanna be the clown. I, people go, they say, I saw the clown, he made me happy. Yeah. Gonna work tomorrow happy. You know, so I used to be one of these guys that goes, don, don't you know, don don't know. Ask someone else. You know, that used to be me from Seattle going, Hey, I don't don don't know. Yeah. I don't know. and I say, can you believe they're letting a woman fight in UFC? She's a, she, she's a biological male who

3 (1h 20m 36s):
Wasn't UFC. It was

4 (1h 20m 37s):
In a small Oh, it wasn't smaller Organization. and I saw. Then I say to myself, ah, You don. Hey don. Don't have no opinions. But then you watch it and it's like, it's like the one girl in the corner. I'm Tamika, you know, and then, then this, then they go versus Fallon Fox. Like, ah. And I was like, oh, maybe I have some opinions. Like, wait, they're gonna let them fight. Yeah. Like, that's when you start going, maybe I do have some. And you saw the fight, blah, blah, blah. and I go, all right. I formed a few opinions about this subject.

3 (1h 21m 2s):
It looked like domestic violence.

4 (1h 21m 3s):
It was cra and I go, you like that? We go, we don't like it. We didn't.

3 (1h 21m 6s):
And then you hear the voice and you're like, what the fuck?

4 (1h 21m 8s):
But you can't watch that and then still be like a tepid guy who's like, oh, you know, I don't really have an opinion on this. Let let them do what they want. It's like,

3 (1h 21m 16s):
Well back then, Neil deGrasse Tyson wasn't chiming in like this ever. No. Yeah. So this is, this is, he's, he got caught up in that same silly mind virus. Look. It, it doesn't mean you're not a compassionate person that recognizes that there's a whole wide variety of human beings that feel different than you. Sure. And we should be open-minded to that. For sure. But you should also protect women. You should protect women's sports and protect women that are forced to, in high school, in college, and even in some professional sports, forced to compete against people that have significant physical advantages. Yeah. and I bet a lot of those people are outta their fucking minds. How about, how about tell, tell me what percentage of them have mental issues?

3 (1h 21m 58s):
Right. What percentage of these people that are doing this have mental issues? It's probably a lot. Yep. And you're allowing them to get all this credit and all this extra love. Yeah. Because it's like, people lean in. You've seen comics lean into their audience. Oh yeah. And become a different person. 'cause they like, they, they develop a certain audience and they kind of like, oh, this is, I'm gonna lean into that. Yeah. And people lean into everything. Right. They'll lean in to being a woman. You know, they just decide that. Like, look at all, look at all my love I get from being a woman. You put the lipstick on. Oh girl, you look so good. Thank you

4 (1h 22m 29s):
Baby yas queen.

3 (1h 22m 30s):
And, and then you're all cosplay. Yeah. And they lean into it. Well, but, but there's also legit trans people. Right. There's legit people That really should be a woman. Nature just fucked you. Yeah. You got a shit hand of cards or got all jumbled up or whatever it was.

4 (1h 22m 44s):
And you, why do you care? Oh my God. Well, I'll tell you what, if I had a daughter that's trying to get a swimming scholarship, like, then you care.

3 (1h 22m 52s):
Then you care. Yeah.

4 (1h 22m 53s):
You, you start to say, well, I'd like for someone smart and famous and someone who could be on a thing like this. Yeah. To maybe say these things instead of just going, well, why would you care? Some people care. There's, there's people that care about these subjects.

3 (1h 23m 6s):
Ari sent me this karate fight the other day

4 (1h 23m 9s):
I'm

3 (1h 23m 9s):
Already in, which means this guy and a girl. And it's so quick and so violent. It's so disturbing. It's so disturbing that someone let this happen. Yeah. In the first place. and I think they're both black belts.

4 (1h 23m 20s):
Okay.

3 (1h 23m 21s):
And this guy manhandled this lady so quickly and so awfully, if you can't find it, I'll find it. You want me to send it to you? I'm making sure this is it. Let me show. Lemme see. They're, they're both wearing white karate geese and they're standing apart from each other. This is, oh, here

4 (1h 23m 35s):
It is.

3 (1h 23m 35s):
Look at this.

4 (1h 23m 36s):
Oh, that first one was, bro,

3 (1h 23m 38s):
This is like, and they What's that last one? He's a dick. He's a dick. What was the

4 (1h 23m 43s):
Leg thing she's doing here? She

3 (1h 23m 44s):
Taps. Just

4 (1h 23m 45s):
Tapping. Yeah. But that last

3 (1h 23m 46s):
Part just bitch slaps her to the ground. That that's the difference between males and females when it comes especially to combat sports. It's not fair. It's, there's not a world where That's fair. Yeah. And if you

4 (1h 23m 57s):
Not a world do, and if you do think that this is fine, you know, let make a men versus women. NFL Let's just do that. Yeah. Let's do it. If you really think, you know, the men would win 60 years in a row. We'd be like, we won the championship again. Yeah. The field would just be covered. A broken women, like, I broke my fame.

3 (1h 24m 16s):
I'm waiting for trans men or trans women in the WNBA. Like when,

4 (1h 24m 21s):
When that starts. Yeah. Bro.

3 (1h 24m 22s):
That all of a sudden would be an exciting game

4 (1h 24m 25s):
I'd watch. Yeah. We got dunks now.

3 (1h 24m 27s):
Not just that, but you got freaks. Yeah. Like it's, it's a wild freak

4 (1h 24m 31s):
Show. Well, and you know what it is, is like seven

3 (1h 24m 33s):
Foot dudes with lipstick on.

4 (1h 24m 35s):
Even, even if there was a woman who was so good at women's basketball that she could compete in the NBA, I would say don't let her do it because,

3 (1h 24m 44s):
Well, you gotta get knocked around and

4 (1h 24m 46s):
Yeah. Because it's also like, well, that's not what we're doing here. Right. Otherwise, then the men could go play with you because they're good enough.

3 (1h 24m 52s):
Did you see this? I think he's a professor somewhere in Canada. He's a 50-year-old man who identifies as a teenage girl. And so he is competing with teenage girls and swimming.

4 (1h 25m 2s):
I've not seen this.

3 (1h 25m 2s):
And they let him change in the same changing room. Yeah.

4 (1h 25m 6s):
Those see teenage, these are that matter.

3 (1h 25m 8s):
So they let this 50-year-old man whip his cock out. Yeah. And be naked.

4 (1h 25m 14s):
That's wild.

3 (1h 25m 15s):
In the presence of teenage girls. So they had, apparently they like put curtains up to try to shield it. 50-year-old trans swimmer, shared locker room while competing against teens. The girls were terrified. And look at that crazy. Fuck

4 (1h 25m 28s):
Yeah. This is,

3 (1h 25m 29s):
This is so nuts that anybody would allow that.

4 (1h 25m 32s):
Someone might be listening to this and go, oh, come on, this is like an isol. Yeah. But even if it happens once, don't you think that's too much? If it happens

3 (1h 25m 40s):
One time, this is just like the found fox thing. When that happened, I, I was outraged and I was like, this is ridiculous. That's a guy. And people got so mad at me and I was like, this is a wild thing to get mad at. I'm not getting mad at someone for being trans. Right. I'm getting mad at someone for lying. Yeah. And not saying they were trans for two fights. Yeah. Two fights. And look, if you're a trans woman and a biological female agrees to fight you. Yeah. I feel the same way that I feel when someone's gonna ride a bull. Like I wouldn't recommend it. Oh yeah. Yeah. But if you wanna do it, sure. I support your right to do whatever the fuck you wanna do. There's, there's a woman who fought in the UFC, Ashley Evan Smith. And she actually beat Fon Fox.

3 (1h 26m 20s):
Oh, okay. She beat her. She mounted her and pounded on her. But she's a really good fighter and she made it to the UFC where she lost to Raquel Pennington, who is the current UFC Bantam Way champion. So she's a legit fighter. Yeah. but it starts with that. And if it keeps going, if you can really, if there's enough people that promote this term minor attracted person. Oh yeah. That term is so crazy to me that it almost feels like a four chan troll that just went amok and just like, like free bleeding. You know, free bleeding was a four chan troll. Yeah. I think it was right. Didn't it start off as a four chan? Yeah. So they, they decided to pretend that real feminism is just letting your vagina just leak blood into your pants and it's proudly showing

4 (1h 27m 7s):
Off your unsanitary. It's ridiculous. Yeah. And some women started doing it. It's crazy.

3 (1h 27m 11s):
And so women started doing

4 (1h 27m 12s):
It. But now imagine me going, why do you care, Joe? Yeah. Oh. So a 50 year old's changing in front of a 16-year-old in this Why you care? Why do you care? Why do you care? Why do you care? I I think we should care.

3 (1h 27m 22s):
Yeah.

4 (1h 27m 22s):
If it happens even one time. Yeah. Let's, let's let who, let's say it doesn't become this bigger social issue. It shouldn't happen once.

3 (1h 27m 29s):
Well, this is the question. Do pedophiles exist? A hundred percent Yes. Do perverts and sex offenders exist? Yes. They exist. These are real things that we know are in the human race. Yeah. If the possibility of someone, that is one of those things. Yeah. And all they have to do is say they're a woman. They have access.

4 (1h 27m 57s):
Go access to dishonesty. They,

3 (1h 27m 59s):
That's it's, you had a Willy Wonka golden ticket to go wherever you want. You just have to say you're a woman. You don't think that a serial pedophile Yeah. Would do that. He's, if you have, all the sudden all I gotta do

4 (1h 28m 11s):
Is lie. He

3 (1h 28m 11s):
Can say it. He can just say, I'm a woman. Yeah. Do you see the guy who won the P-L-P-G-A tournament? Stop? Well,

7 (1h 28m 18s):
It's not A-L-P-G-A,

3 (1h 28m 20s):
Whatever it is. Yeah. I mean it's Oh, oh, sorry. Women's golf. Yeah.

7 (1h 28m 22s):
It sort of matters. But that's also, it was, I was just reading about

3 (1h 28m 25s):
It. So this dude just decides he's a woman, puts his skirt on. It's happening

4 (1h 28m 30s):
A lot. Doesn't change

3 (1h 28m 31s):
His appearance at all. And just murders this woman's woman's You don't change

4 (1h 28m 36s):
Anything? No,

7 (1h 28m 36s):
No, no. I said a dad reassignment surgery

3 (1h 28m 38s):
Here. He had it. Yeah. Oh, okay.

4 (1h 28m 43s):
Well at least, at least she's hot. You know

7 (1h 28m 45s):
Hailey Davidson?

3 (1h 28m 46s):
So you have to go through the surgery that's, wait a minute, is that the same one? Yeah. Lemme see the, look at the, the

7 (1h 28m 52s):
Story went back to 2022. I didn't know that. It has been going on for a little while.

3 (1h 28m 55s):
I thought one just happened.

7 (1h 28m 56s):
This one just happened.

3 (1h 28m 57s):
Oh, this one just happened. It's

7 (1h 28m 58s):
The LPGA qualifying event. Okay. That's when you, when they add the LPGA into the headline, it makes more news than you say NNXT

3 (1h 29m 5s):
Or that's why you shouldn't believe everything you see on Instagram reels.

4 (1h 29m 9s):
Yeah. Yeah. That's where I'm guilty. I, so I hear a guy tell me a thing in a warehouse 20 years ago and I'm going, is that true? That

3 (1h 29m 17s):
That's where I'm at. It always happens. So this is a, is this the first transgender woman to win golf tour?

7 (1h 29m 24s):
I believe so. To win an event. Yeah. And then what happens though, by winning this event, she earns a opportunity to play more, which could lead to LPGA qualifying spot.

3 (1h 29m 36s):
Yeah.

7 (1h 29m 37s):
That she did win

3 (1h 29m 38s):
Money. Lemme see. Yeah. That's the person.

4 (1h 29m 40s):
Yeah. There she is, man. There she is. Huh. Wild. Let's see her next. Let's see her next to some other gals.

7 (1h 29m 48s):
There's

4 (1h 29m 49s):
One there. There you go. Yeah.

7 (1h 29m 50s):
Declaimed also, is that by after having all of the surgeries and stuff, lost 15 miles an hour on club head speed. Which is

4 (1h 30m 0s):
A lot.

7 (1h 30m 0s):
You could gain that back I guess. But don

3 (1h 30m 2s):
Don't know. Yeah. Well that sounds like a lot. But also I bet Jamie,

4 (1h 30m 4s):
Why do you

3 (1h 30m 5s):
Care? But don't you think it's still probably faster than the women's?

7 (1h 30m 8s):
Yeah. So the average for a man, it was saying is about 115 on the PGA two or the average LPG is about 95. and it doesn't say where they were before or

3 (1h 30m 18s):
After also, is that what he said or that was that what was

7 (1h 30m 21s):
Measured? This This is just average in general. It's not. Yeah, it's

3 (1h 30m 24s):
Right here. Yeah. You, you definitely lose something if you're on estrogen and you have your testes removed. He, he claims she lost

4 (1h 30m 34s):
15 months. Yeah. Yeah. Her own, you could also just start math.

3 (1h 30m 37s):
But you're not gonna say, you're not gonna say, I have a fucking huge advantage. Right. I've been a dude my whole life. Yeah. Yeah. You're not gonna say that. They love to. Oh my God, I lost 15 miles an hour. I'm basically a woman now. Don't

4 (1h 30m 46s):
Worry about it. I bet they love to say

3 (1h 30m 47s):
I won the tournament just 'cause I'm awesome. Yeah,

4 (1h 30m 49s):
Yeah. Courage. What I lack in head, head club speed. I, I gained in bravery. Yeah.

3 (1h 30m 56s):
And not having wide hips there. There's a lot of things with hips, like the shape of hips. You don, you don't generate the same amount of power like women kickers. There's such a vast difference between a woman kicker and a man kicker. It's kind of stunning. and I don't I don. I wonder if like, a lot of that has to do with the shape of the hips. Because if you get a woman who is like 135 pounds and have her hit a bag and then you have a man who's 135 pounds and hit the bag, the difference is so stark. Oh yeah. You're like, this is crazy because your legs are carrying around All day long. Right. But there's a lot of other shit going on. There's tendon strength, there's bone density, there's, there's the shape of the hips, I'm sure too.

3 (1h 31m 38s):
But it's also like there's a also something that happens to the human body when it evolves or it develops rather with testosterone. Like you're gonna be stronger forever. Yeah. Like you're ne you're never gonna go back to what it would be like if you had been born a woman. Yeah. Like it's, it's like taking steroids for 20 years hardcore. Yeah. Like they literally turn you into a guy then and be

4 (1h 32m 1s):
Like, I have no

3 (1h 32m 2s):
Advantage. I'm done. I'm like you, I'm not taking steroids anymore. We're the same. It's crazy. Like that's crazy. You were cheating your whole life. Right? Like if you got caught doing that in the UFC, you're fucking banned. You're banned for two years. And if you get caught again, I think you're banned for six years. It's something wild like that. So if you're just like taking testosterone your whole life, your whole life, it's trying balance. All these other women are, you know, just fucking being normal and cheerleading and going to parties.

4 (1h 32m 27s):
You're

3 (1h 32m 28s):
Competing against them. Yeah. That's

4 (1h 32m 29s):
Insane. I know a girl who's a professional foosball player. Kelsey Cook, the comedian. Oh yeah. Chad Daniels girlfriend. I know why I said that. But anyways, I love them and I, she, she's, I, she's talking to me about foosball. I find it interesting 'cause don don't know anything about foosball and I go, oh, this is probably one of those sports where the men can play with the women because it's, it's foosball. And she goes, I hate that I'm admitting this to you. 'cause she knows I'm, you know, a guy, a man's guy. And she goes, men have an advantage in foosball and I go even foosball. And she goes, yes. Because it's like that torque of the ri like of a man's arm versus a woman's arm. Even the arm of like a, she goes, the men can hit it harder. The spin. Right.

4 (1h 33m 9s):
So even something as what we might think is a frivolous kind of thing, like foosball, even that there is just so much of a difference.

3 (1h 33m 17s):
How about chess? Men have an advantage in chess. Really?

4 (1h 33m 22s):
I did not know that. Yeah. How?

3 (1h 33m 24s):
I don't know. Yeah.

4 (1h 33m 25s):
That's

3 (1h 33m 26s):
Interesting. I know. But for whatever reason, maybe it's more men do it. I don't know what it is. Maybe it's the mind, the way the mind works, it's different. The competitive mind. Yeah.

8 (1h 33m 35s):
I don't know if it actually showing, it's

3 (1h 33m 36s):
Coming from a tweet. Men have a large and consistent advantage over women in spatial ability of which chess relies to a large extent. That's wild. And this is a difference in average. Not just at the high end. The male advantage is present. Pre puberty is present across cultures and time. Another one is pool. The, the best professional female pool players never win male tour events.

4 (1h 34m 1s):
Interesting.

3 (1h 34m 1s):
They're allowed to enter them. Men can't enter women's events. Yeah. But women enter, like, there's certain like, major events that women enter all the time, but they never win them.

4 (1h 34m 10s):
Well, a smart man would say, why do you care? Why do you care who's better?

3 (1h 34m 15s):
'cause it's a statistic and it's a sport I care about. It's important. I think it's interesting. Look, there's a lot of women are saying are really good and they can beat a lot of men. They beat a lot of men. But when they get to the very top, like when you, you're playing through a pool bracket, you know, say if there's a a hundred or so professionals that are in this tournament, they're playing in this double elimination bracket. So you lose, once you go to the one lost side, you lose there. You're outta the tournament. So you running against killer after killer. 'cause there's a hundred professionals there. Right. And it's, there's a high likelihood that someone gets a bunch of good roles. You scratch on the break, a bunch of things happen. A person runs out a lot and you lose, you know, seven nothing to some person. And that person happens to be a chick.

3 (1h 34m 55s):
That's totally possible you could lose to a woman. But over the course of the tournament that luck will wear out and the elite male players will beat the elite female player's. Weird

4 (1h 35m 6s):
I know you're so into pool. Where do you play pool play here? Like you personally play here. Oh, you play pool That

3 (1h 35m 10s):
Table's here. But also, you know, I'll go places where I could play. I play at Amsterdam, billiards when I'm in New York City. Hmm. Yeah. I'll go to pool halls.

4 (1h 35m 18s):
Yeah. I don't, I That's such a bar game.

3 (1h 35m 21s):
It is a bar game. But the type I play is like tournament professional style pool. It's different kind of pool. It's not like eight ball. I play mostly nine ball and 10 ball. And it's a

4 (1h 35m 34s):
Rotation snooker game.

3 (1h 35m 35s):
I have not, but it looks very difficult. Hard. Yeah. It's fucking huge. That table's gigantic. And the balls are little and the holes are little

4 (1h 35m 41s):
And it's confusing and

3 (1h 35m 42s):
Yeah. I don't understand it. We

4 (1h 35m 43s):
Were in Thailand, we're like, let's play pool. We walked over there. We're like, this is a different table here.

3 (1h 35m 47s):
Yeah. don don't even know what to do. Yeah. I don't even know how it works. I, I like watching it though. It's cool when they're really good at it. 'cause I know how hard it must be to be doing that. They used to make a shit ton of money. But there was one guy over there that was a big top guy that got busted fixing a game. How they caught him on camera. They got a, like a hidden camera. See if you can find that story. 'cause he was like, you like a top dog? Just

4 (1h 36m 10s):
Put the ball in with his hand.

3 (1h 36m 11s):
Well, you just miss.

4 (1h 36m 12s):
Oh, I see.

3 (1h 36m 13s):
Yeah. It's not hard to do at

4 (1h 36m 14s):
All. Wait, what do you mean? So that doesn't, you

3 (1h 36m 15s):
Could fix a pool match. So say if I'm a, I'm a gangster and you're a a killer pool player. Yeah. And you're gonna play some guy And I was like, Jeff Dye, I got a proposition for you. I am gonna give you a hundred thousand dollars to blow this game. So you're the favorite in the game. Oh yeah. So maybe there's a lot of could lose people gambling.

4 (1h 36m 33s):
Yeah, I'd be good at losing. Yeah.

3 (1h 36m 35s):
You lose on purpose. Yeah. Yeah. But that's, that's how it works. You can lose on purpose. So is this the story or is this the

4 (1h 36m 39s):
Last I thought it way he was fixing it to win.

3 (1h 36m 42s):
Dennis Taylor's caught cheating. No, it's not him. What did he do? don don't know.

7 (1h 36m 47s):
Don don't understand the game. I don't know how, like, don don't know how

3 (1h 36m 49s):
You

4 (1h 36m 49s):
Couldn't do this sharp guy. Look at these guys.

3 (1h 36m 52s):
I wonder how he got caught cheating. Game gentleman

7 (1h 36m 53s):
Game. A million views. I figured it was it. Putting an extra red says putting an extra red ball on the table.

4 (1h 36m 59s):
He just literally added a ball. That's hilarious.

7 (1h 37m 1s):
Climb on the table and still misses

4 (1h 37m 3s):
You could

3 (1h 37m 3s):
Do. You were allowed to climb on the table. Look at this guy.

4 (1h 37m 6s):
And he touched the mess.

7 (1h 37m 8s):
His goofy glasses. Are you,

3 (1h 37m 9s):
You allowed to climb on the table?

7 (1h 37m 10s):
This might have been a celebrity match. I feel like, because

3 (1h 37m 12s):
The way they're all laughing. Oh, it looks like they're all laughing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, it's not that it was a, like a bribery scheme. He was caught fixing snooker games and it became a criminal investigation because there's so many people that gamble on snooker.

7 (1h 37m 26s):
Sure. 10 people charged that kind of thing. Do you think?

3 (1h 37m 28s):
Yeah, that's probably it. Match

7 (1h 37m 30s):
Scandal. Yeah.

3 (1h 37m 32s):
How long ago was this?

7 (1h 37m 33s):
This last year?

3 (1h 37m 34s):
Oh no, this is a new one.

4 (1h 37m 36s):
10 Chinese players. 10 Chinese players. Oh

3 (1h 37m 38s):
Wow. Listen, pool players are dirty. They're dirty people. Not all of

4 (1h 37m 42s):
Them. It's about a game. A lot of 'em,

3 (1h 37m 44s):
It's, it's a game where dudes will dump you if you, you, you have to have a really good relationship with your backers. And you gotta, you gotta spread money around if you win, you gotta make sure that people don't dump on you. Because if there's a lot of gambling involved, like say if you and I are in a match and we're, we're two top players and you've got a bunch of people that are coming from fucking Cincinnati and Kansas City and Chicago. They're coming to watch this match. And there might be a half a million dollars on the side. Sure. It might be more. Yeah. Like it happens all the time with Top Place John Higgins. That's the guy. This is banned for six months, but cleared of match fixing not guilty.

4 (1h 38m 21s):
Tough to prove. Maybe. Isn't it weird that gambling is so prevalent in sports now?

3 (1h 38m 26s):
What did he say though? He said something like they were talking to him about fixing the game. There was a recording. Right.

7 (1h 38m 33s):
I just, I'll I'll look into this.

3 (1h 38m 35s):
Yeah. He was also like a very beloved player.

4 (1h 38m 39s):
Interesting.

3 (1h 38m 39s):
But the point is that like, you know, that can, a cover

7 (1h 38m 42s):
Reporter discussed the possibility of throwing frames.

3 (1h 38m 46s):
Yeah. Okay. Mooney discussed the possibility of throwing frames, which is like fixing a game, like missing with the undercover reporter. The news of the world's mazzer Ud ma Maud For weeks before the trip to Kyiv, unbeknownst to Higgins, Mooney had taken him to Kyiv specifically to discuss the matter of throwing frames, but had not raised the possibility of the subject might come up until minutes before the meeting started. Mills said he was unimpressed by Mooney as a witness and found much of his account highly implausible. Hmm hmm. Ruling that he should be banned from the sport for life. Woo. His lawyer said in a statement, Mr. Mooney bitterly regrets being caught up in the news of the world's entrapment.

3 (1h 39m 30s):
And is unreservedly sorry for the impact this sting that sting had on snooker and Mr. Higgins in particular. Interesting.

4 (1h 39m 40s):
It is Fascinat.

3 (1h 39m 42s):
There were some lies. How

4 (1h 39m 44s):
Latent gambling is now where it's like, I, I'm not that I'm, I'm not like an old man or anything, but I, you know, they used to act like nobody was gambling on football or ba and now they'll just have the spreads right up on the screen. Yeah. They're just like, here's the betting lines draft. Like it's I mean. Damn. It's pretty like, it's like weed I guess. Like the way the government's like, we're just gonna get in on this. Yeah.

3 (1h 40m 6s):
Well that's the right way to do it. And especially in America. Yeah. Look, gambling's dangerous. It's dangerous. I've seen people go fucking crazy gambling I know people who are gambling addicts. It scares the shit outta me. Yeah. But I think it should be legal. Just like I think weed should be legal and I think alcohol should be legal. I think you should be able to be responsible with your own decisions and make your own choices and get your fucking shit together. The problem is not gambling. The problem is gambling addicts. because I can go and gamble. And I'm smart about knowing that this is very addictive and I do it and I go, I get the fuck outta here. Right. and it was kind of fun. And then I live my life.

4 (1h 40m 42s):
You're not gonna lose your house. Right.

3 (1h 40m 43s):
Yeah. But I know people that gamble

4 (1h 40m 45s):
Con I know some guys. Yeah. Con

3 (1h 40m 48s):
Dana White's a maniac.

4 (1h 40m 50s):
Really? He's a man. But Dana's not gonna lose his house either. So it's like he can, Hey man,

3 (1h 40m 53s):
He, he

4 (1h 40m 54s):
Voted really

3 (1h 40m 56s):
Gambles.

4 (1h 40m 57s):
I like guys like that. We

3 (1h 40m 58s):
Went to visit him at the Red Rocks Casino. Yeah. And at one point in time he was down $600,000 playing blackjack. That's insane. And he wasn't even nervous. Really

4 (1h 41m 7s):
Wasn't even a, when he was gambling on blackjack. Jack, that's a weird, that shows you might have a problem. My buddy Josh, I go, I think you have a gambling problem. He goes, no, I don't dude. I like you just bet four grand on women's, you know, Utah State College best just 'cause it's on. And he's like, yeah, I think you got a point. Maybe I do have a problem. It's like, that's like if you're betting on this You don't even know if these girls are good. But that

3 (1h 41m 28s):
Makes watching a game so much better too. Oh

4 (1h 41m 31s):
Yeah. Yeah. For sure.

3 (1h 41m 32s):
If you could just be reasonable about it. You know, if you bet on a game and just bet, you know, whatever you can afford. If it's a hundred bucks, bet a hundred bucks. If it's gonna make it more exciting For

4 (1h 41m 41s):
Sure. Yeah. And it's,

3 (1h 41m 42s):
Come on you fuckers. Yeah. Come on you fuckers. I'll pay a little.

4 (1h 41m 45s):
I'll pay a little to care. Yeah.

3 (1h 41m 47s):
Who cares So much more at this. If you have a stake in it, you're down to a nail son.

4 (1h 41m 52s):
I suck them another one, dude. Yeah. I'll have another one. Yeah, have another one. I crush

3 (1h 41m 55s):
You. Freshy. That's a little too too down to the wire.

4 (1h 41m 57s):
Little too close to my nose. Thanks brother.

3 (1h 41m 59s):
The trimmers are on the back of that sucker.

4 (1h 42m 2s):
You ever, I tried to buy Terry Bradshaw, like I was like, you know, he is a guy like you. I brought you cigars because I don't, I figure you know, just a man to man. I wanna get you something nice. Thank you. Appreciate that. It's not like I thought you'd see the cigars and go, wow, what is that? You know? Just bring you something, you know. It's nice. What gentlemen do. Yes. Thank you. So for I go to Terry Bradshaw's house, one of these things. and I I was like, I wanted to give him something for Father's Day. So I got him like these nice cutters, you know, a few hundred bucks for these cutters. You know, it's like, what's the nicest cutters for cigars and I. I, he's like, thanks man. He reads the card. Thanks Bub. Love you. And then like I go to, you know, later on I'm at the ranch. He's got this huge humidor, 40 of those cutters like laying

3 (1h 42m 42s):
Around.

4 (1h 42m 43s):
He's got the nicest of like everything Of course. I've seen nothing like this. This is wild.

3 (1h 42m 48s):
Yeah. That's a calibri. It has a little cutter on the back. It's nice.

4 (1h 42m 51s):
Multi-purpose. You can't fly with this though.

3 (1h 42m 54s):
No you can't. Right. Yeah. They probably wouldn't let you

4 (1h 42m 56s):
Flossed a lot of torches at airports.

3 (1h 42m 58s):
Oh, you can't fly with a regular torch.

4 (1h 42m 60s):
Yeah's hilarious. Yeah. Just that you can't, that's

3 (1h 43m 3s):
What the difference is that a regular lighter?

4 (1h 43m 5s):
No idea. Maybe you

3 (1h 43m 6s):
Get the

4 (1h 43m 6s):
Wrong side. Can you fly with No, I got it. Oh,

3 (1h 43m 9s):
You were about to light the side. You cut. You're right. I was. That's right. I just

4 (1h 43m 12s):
Cut it too deep.

3 (1h 43m 15s):
Yeah. Why can you fly with a regular lighter and you can't fly with a torch?

4 (1h 43m 18s):
Can you fly with a regular lighter?

3 (1h 43m 19s):
Can you?

4 (1h 43m 20s):
Yeah,

3 (1h 43m 21s):
I think so. Sure. Yeah. Jamie says yes. I don. I don't know. I don't think Jamie knows don don't work at

9 (1h 43m 25s):
The tsa. But I'm I know I don. I've never heard of anyone

4 (1h 43m 28s):
Get

3 (1h 43m 28s):
Stopped for it. You know, you used to drive me crazy.

4 (1h 43m 29s):
You're information guy. You know, you're

3 (1h 43m 30s):
The, you know, used to drive me crazy. What? You can't bring a pool queue as it out here. It might be outta gas. Yeah. Check this

4 (1h 43m 36s):
Out. Thanks.

3 (1h 43m 37s):
You can't bring a pool queue on a flight. But you can bring a skateboard.

4 (1h 43m 41s):
I didn't know you couldn't bring a pool cue.

3 (1h 43m 43s):
No, no. It's a weapon. Did not know that. I was like, did you know how easy you could kill someone with a skateboard? Skateboard's heavier. You could fuck somebody up with a skateboard. You can bring two lighters. Aha. But you zippo lighters without fuel. Don't check them. Disposable and zippo. Lighters without fuel are allowed in checked bags.

4 (1h 44m 3s):
Oh, checked

3 (1h 44m 4s):
Bags. Yeah. Lighters with fuel are prohibited in check bags unless they adhere to Department of Transportation's exemption, which allows up to two fueled lighters if properly enclosed in a DOT approved case. You have to put your fucking lighters in a bomb case doing that. How often are lighters throwing off? Randomly. It's like a

4 (1h 44m 22s):
Dollar.

3 (1h 44m 23s):
When have, when was the last time a bick lighter just randomly lit on fire? Fucking never even

4 (1h 44m 28s):
Heard it. More Teslas blow up on fire than, than Yeah. I've never

3 (1h 44m 31s):
Lighters heard a single instance.

4 (1h 44m 34s):
Well, but I didn't know. I like, I think and I don't think you can carry it on. Maybe that's all I know. Really? I don't check bags.

3 (1h 44m 40s):
I think you, I remember it used to be the case. I just thought they relaxed that the fucking shoe thing is so stupid. I

4 (1h 44m 47s):
Can't believe they're still doing that.

3 (1h 44m 48s):
One dickhead tries to blow his shoes up. One guy

4 (1h 44m 52s):
I was, I was laughing about, this is an old current event, but when it was a new thing that we had to take our shoes off for tsa, like after nine 11, George Bush is like, even I will be going through TSA checkpoints for Air Force one I was like, no, not you

3 (1h 45m 7s):
Fucking liar. Wish be

4 (1h 45m 8s):
Able to trust you.

3 (1h 45m 9s):
That's a lie.

4 (1h 45m 9s):
Yeah. He was going. Even me. No you won't.

3 (1h 45m 11s):
That's so crazy.

4 (1h 45m 12s):
If I can't trust the president.

3 (1h 45m 14s):
Imagine on Air Force one. Yeah. Imagine that. You have to have the president checked. 'cause he might be a terrorist secretly heading down George. That's just the visual of ridiculous. Yeah. Yeah. Do you see the ones that they, they scan your whole body where you see your hog and everything? No. Yeah. There's some that the TSA people can literally see the size of your dick don. Don't think they use them

4 (1h 45m 34s):
Anymore. How do I get the job of just being there? You know, watch

3 (1h 45m 36s):
Being watch. I wanna

4 (1h 45m 37s):
See the view. Yeah. See all these,

3 (1h 45m 38s):
If you go to see if you could find that, because they show the images of what it looks like for a human. So you don't see their face, but you see their dick. Oh wow. How crazy is that?

4 (1h 45m 47s):
I got to see a Bill bpe in real life. Look at that. Oh yeah. That is weird.

3 (1h 45m 52s):
See the man's

4 (1h 45m 52s):
Dick? Yeah. That's me actually. Crazy.

3 (1h 45m 54s):
Yeah,

4 (1h 45m 54s):
That's weird.

3 (1h 45m 55s):
Crazy.

4 (1h 45m 56s):
So I was at LAX, this is years ago and it's when the big scan, the whoop thing went around your body. And I see Bill and he's, he's at CSA and I. I've known him for, I've known of him and he is known of me since like 2008. 'cause he played giggles comic club in Seattle when I was like a young comic. I go, Hey Bill. And he is like, Hey Jeff. And he's like, clearly Irrit irritable. And he's like, he's just waiting at the side. And I'm going through the thing and a guy comes over to him. He goes, Hey, if I could just get you to stand over here next to the machine. 'cause he was refusing the big scan around thing. Yeah. And he's like, he's like, yeah, no. I know you don't wanna do the machine but just stand. He goes, what kind of defeats the purpose to go stand by the fucking machine. You know, like, he's like, that's the machine. don don't wanna be Now you want me to stand by it, but I got to watch the whole thing happen.

4 (1h 46m 39s):
I'm kinda like, this is like a bill bur bit in real life getting to watch it happen. I'm sure he is gonna talk about this like on stage. Yeah. and it was kind of fun to like just kind of see a, a bit formulate. Yeah.

3 (1h 46m 50s):
Ari used to do that too. He he made them all check 'em down. He refused

4 (1h 46m 54s):
It.

3 (1h 46m 54s):
Yeah. He would not go through the

4 (1h 46m 57s):
Machine. Smart I mean I I don't think it's great for you.

3 (1h 46m 59s):
It's not. Yeah. It can't

4 (1h 47m 0s):
Be. And we fly all the time. It cant

3 (1h 47m 2s):
Be good for you. Right.

4 (1h 47m 3s):
If you're doing it three or four times a week.

3 (1h 47m 6s):
I think the radio one is different. The one they do now is not an X-ray. I don't know what don don't know what it used to be. What did it used to be like? What was the original ones?

4 (1h 47m 16s):
Metal,

3 (1h 47m 17s):
The thing about those kind of things is they really don't know how bad they are for you until it's too late. True.

4 (1h 47m 23s):
Yeah. We won't know

3 (1h 47m 23s):
10 years down the line you realize like, oh that stuff kills

4 (1h 47m 26s):
You. Well cigarettes was like a, you know, doctors would be like, oh, it calms your nerves. What's a

3 (1h 47m 30s):
Millimeter wave? I've never really heard millimeter wave unit heard. Millimeter wave body scanner was developed. The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory ba So what's the dangers? Privacy concerns. That's 'cause it could see your painer possible health effects. Here we go. Millimeter wavelength radiation is the subject to a subset of the microwave radio frequency spectrum. Even at its high energy end, it is still more than three orders of magnitude lower in energy that it's nearest radio toxic neighbor ultraviolet in the electromagnetic spectrum as such millimeter wave radiation is non ionizing and incapable of causing cancers by radio litic, DNA bound cleavage due to the shallow penetration depth of millimeter waves into tissue.

3 (1h 48m 23s):
Typically less than one millimeter. Acute biological effects of irradiation are localized in the epidermal and dermal layers and manifest primarily as thermal effects. There's no clear evidence to date of harmful effects of the vaccine. I'm sorry, I mean other than those caused by local

4 (1h 48m 42s):
Localized

3 (1h 48m 43s):
Heating and ensuing chemical changes. Yeah. Mm.

4 (1h 48m 47s):
Maybe ain that a funny one. Maybe by

3 (1h 48m 49s):
The way. Yeah, maybe. Hopefully. Hopefully it doesn't hurt you. Yeah. Sounds like they think it doesn't. Yeah, but what did, they used to use a lot of words. What was the original one? What were the original TSA radiation machines?

4 (1h 49m 3s):
I mean? I think it was just a metal detector. Right. I mean they're just like scatter

3 (1h 49m 6s):
Xray, bro. Have you ever seen the hands of the x-ray technicians from back in the day?

4 (1h 49m 11s):
Oh yeah, man. Just from operating it. No,

3 (1h 49m 13s):
They, yeah. The, the, the women who used to run it. So, so back then when you were an X-ray technician, you would have to test the x-ray to make sure it's calibrated, make sure it's working right. So the way they would do, they would X-ray their own hand.

4 (1h 49m 27s):
Oh my gosh. Yeah. With no. And then time over time they did it a lot. Yeah, they did it a lot. They got little,

3 (1h 49m 33s):
Their fingernails were falling off. Like, look at that.

4 (1h 49m 36s):
Oh my gosh.

3 (1h 49m 37s):
Yeah. Hand of an x-ray tech technician at the Royal London Hospital showing damage of radiation exposure. So this is from 1900.

4 (1h 49m 45s):
Why does it say, oh, I see

3 (1h 49m 46s):
Bro, they didn't know any better. Right.

4 (1h 49m 48s):
That'll be us someday with something. Cell phones or

3 (1h 49m 52s):
Have you ever seen those something, those ladies that used to put loom on watches? No. You know, when you, when you, you know,

4 (1h 50m 2s):
Cyanide is used for that, right?

3 (1h 50m 4s):
No, no, no, no. It's, it's radioactive. Oh, I think it's radium. Right? Radium. Now they're called the radium girls. Yeah. So

4 (1h 50m 12s):
They sound hot.

3 (1h 50m 13s):
They use it in tubes. So what happened was these women, they would lick their paintbrush, you know, 'cause you lick your paintbrush sometimes. And they would lick their paintbrush to try to form a, a better tip so they could do it better. And every time they did it, they got radium. Oh my. In their

4 (1h 50m 30s):
Mouth. My

3 (1h 50m 30s):
God. And they would get horrible cancers and their fucking, you know, a lot of them died. Like, see that image, that lady where her jaw was rotted off? Oh

4 (1h 50m 38s):
Yeah.

3 (1h 50m 39s):
Yeah. That's from radium.

4 (1h 50m 40s):
This reminds girls

3 (1h 50m 41s):
Who licked radioactive paint.

4 (1h 50m 43s):
You just remind me of the funniest thing I've ever seen on morning television. What? Yeah. So, you know, when you have to play a common club, sometimes they, that's spider this, remind me of it.

3 (1h 50m 52s):
Okay.

4 (1h 50m 53s):
Try you. I'm like, you know, in the mornings they make you do these morning television sometimes to go promote No. Never brings anyone to the club. Right. And morning TV's so corny. Everything they say is like, you know, you'll be, they'll be like, we got funny guy Jeff Dye here. And then you say something really vanilla and they're like, whoa. Like they're always so, so easy to offend the morning. Oh yeah. Show people. So you're, it, it sucks. It's a terrible thing we have to do. And so they, I'm waiting, I'm a hungover. I've got like sunglasses. I'm just like, I can't believe I have to do this stupid show. You know? And they cut to a thing. So I'm watching on the tv What? The morning thing. It's in San Francisco. And they cut to like these art vendors that are out on the side of the, the thing. And she's like, I'm here with a local San Francisco artist, blah, blah, blah. He's glass blower.

4 (1h 51m 34s):
And he's got all of his like glass blowing things behind him. It's the funniest thing I've ever seen on morning television. Lady goes, she goes, isn't it true that glass blowing iss like really hard on your lungs and it's hard on your vision and it's very dangerous. It takes years off of your life. And this guy, without missing a beat, he goes, yeah, but to die a little sooner to put my ard into the world is worth it. I was like, wow, that's beautiful. Right. That's like really beautiful. And then she goes, what do you make? He's like mostly bongs and dildos. And she's like, back to you in the studio. It was the funniest, like he went from being profound to just dropping

3 (1h 52m 9s):
His hard form is bongs and dildos. But just the, the idea of saying that to die sooner. That's hilarious. Yeah. It

4 (1h 52m 17s):
Was a beautiful one-two punch of like, yeah, just have my art in the world. Bongs and dildos.

3 (1h 52m 22s):
Yeah. That's like a, a dude from a movie. Like, it was amazing. So you probably heard something like that in a movie. It's like super profound. I

4 (1h 52m 30s):
Was thinking, these poor girls, they're going, yeah. But you know, I painted a lot of clocks.

3 (1h 52m 34s):
Yeah. No one told them either. The l in the thing, I think that radium that that loom on on clocks and watches. It was like nobody had ever done that before. Was

4 (1h 52m 42s):
It like glow in the dark or something? Or was it some

3 (1h 52m 44s):
Sort of Yeah, glow in the dark. They, they do it now in glass tubes. So like, if you get a tactical watch that's like, a good example is marathon. Marathon makes these like military grade tactical watches that are like super durable and they have radium tubes in it. So no matter what time of night it is pitch blackness, you look down at that watch and it doesn't have to be glowing in the dark. It just glows. Cool. It's it's lit up. Yeah. So like, like loom on a regular watch, like when it has loom painted into it, what happens is when you're in the sunlight and in the, you know, flashlights and you know, and studio lighting and whatever fluorescent lighting, it charges that paint.

3 (1h 53m 24s):
And so then when you go in the dark, then it glows and it'll glow for like a little while. Like a few hours maybe. Yeah. This shit never goes out. Hmm. But it's these little glass tubes so you can find like's what

4 (1h 53m 35s):
That called

3 (1h 53m 35s):
Marathon watch. I think it's radium. Radium. I think it's that same radioactive shit. It's just in a gas form that's encased in a tube. and I think it has a half-life of 20 years. So I think it glows for 20 years on your wrist. It's

4 (1h 53m 49s):
Pretty sweet. No wonder it's jacking up their chins and noses and

3 (1h 53m 53s):
Stuff. Oh dude, it has to, it has to wreck havoc if you're licking that thing every day. Like that is just some fucking nuclear space dust. One of the

7 (1h 54m 1s):
Articles I was just reading about it said that they liked it so much they were also painting it on their face fingernails.

4 (1h 54m 5s):
Oh. Oh gosh. God damnit. Yeah. They're like, I get free radium at work. Oh

3 (1h 54m 10s):
Don, don't I makeup anymore? And their fucking eyes run.

4 (1h 54m 12s):
Yeah. They go look at my, isn't it funny? I have so much radium, I made it eyeliner.

3 (1h 54m 16s):
Show me a marathon watch. That's

7 (1h 54m 18s):
Just trying to find it. I know.

3 (1h 54m 19s):
I couldn't find that class. Marathon divers Watch Loom

4 (1h 54m 24s):
Marathon

3 (1h 54m 24s):
Watch. Just write divers watch.

4 (1h 54m 27s):
You have a big watch. I noticed last night

3 (1h 54m 29s):
This, this is just a, this is a digital watch, so that's what it looks like. And then we see it at nighttime. That's what it looks like. Oh yeah. So it's always lit. It's pretty fucking dope. Think I've actually,

4 (1h 54m 40s):
I've, I don't think I've owned one, but I I've seen that for sure.

3 (1h 54m 44s):
It's just, I love those things. I love watches. And there's another company called Ball, BALL and all they make way cooler looking watches like that. This like, the marathon watch is like tactical military style watch. But ball watches, they make these killer dress watches. Huh. But that's all got the loom too. So that looks like that night. That looks great. Oh yeah. And it's a dope watch. Yeah. Like look how cool that looks. Ooh. It's, and it's also radioactive. Do, do, do. But apparently it's completely, it's encased. You have no fear of it hurting you. Yeah. Yeah. And then if it, if it breaks, it just dissipates in the atmosphere. If it breaks,

4 (1h 55m 21s):
You lick it a bunch.

3 (1h 55m 21s):
You sniff it, just sniff it and get superpowers.

4 (1h 55m 24s):
Hey, my tongue's glowing.

3 (1h 55m 24s):
Yeah. I could see through walls. I know things now. Free

4 (1h 55m 27s):
Radio.

3 (1h 55m 28s):
You were telling me you were a big fuck guy. Big bigfoot guy. Tell me about this. Here's the problem. When you grew up in an area Yeah. You're in the Pacific Northwest. Yeah. That's Bigfoot country.

4 (1h 55m 38s):
That is, I think that's the only reason I'm so into it. Yeah. Also, here's the thing you gotta know about talking about me. It's not ever funny. And it's not, it's just, it's something I like so much that it ends up me giving you the same arguments you've heard a billion times. Yes. Oh, it's gigantic. Epithetic came over the Asian plane. Right. It's a bipedal hominid. It's just, you know, and then at the end and everyone, my friends have experienced it. Harlan Williams just experienced it when I was on his podcast. Anytime I talk about Bigfoot, it ends up with me just going, please Joe, can you just say it's maybe a possibility. Like that's what it always ends up being. Yeah. You said it's, I, I remember you one time going, there's nothing out there. Yeah. Didn't you say that about Bigfoot?

4 (1h 56m 18s):
I

3 (1h 56m 18s):
Just don't see it. That's why don don't believe in it.

4 (1h 56m 21s):
Some hunters do.

3 (1h 56m 22s):
No, not many people

4 (1h 56m 23s):
That see it are usually loggers, hunters, natives, people that are out with loggers.

3 (1h 56m 27s):
There's another problem. Another problem is dusk. You see things at dusk or at dawn it's very confusing. Bears walk on two legs all the time. I have personally watched bears walk on two legs. And if I didn't know any better and if it was a, a dark environment, like it was dusk, you know, like you barely can see. I would think it's Bigfoot, right? Yeah. But I do think Bigfoot existed. Yeah. There's, there's some insane number of Native American words for Bigfoot. Oh yeah. Sasquatch is just one of them. There's a bunch of them. There's a bunch of Native American words for this one animal that's fake.

3 (1h 57m 7s):
But all the other words they have are for real animals. They don't have a bunch of dragons. They don't have like mythical creatures in Native American mythology. But they do have this one giant man thing that definitely existed

4 (1h 57m 22s):
At some point. At

3 (1h 57m 23s):
100%. Opus was a real animal. It was eight to 10 feet tall. Bipedal hominid. Yeah. It was a huge gorilla looking primate that died off somewhere around a hundred thousand years ago. But they don't know really For sure. A hundred

4 (1h 57m 38s):
Thousand.

3 (1h 57m 38s):
Yeah. But they don't know for sure. The thing about it is, it's like if you only find fossils from a hundred thousand years ago, you could assume that that's it. It that this animal, it least lived then. But You don't know when it went extinct. Right. You might find some new fossil like 10 years from now. They might from find some new site and wait a minute, these these are 20,000 years old. Yeah. Or these are 30,000 years old or these are 50,000 years old. But we either way, Enam anatomically identical human beings have been around for 500,000 plus years. maybe even more so. Or similar human beings. So then we definitely interacted with them. Yeah. Or they were around when we were around.

4 (1h 58m 16s):
I think they're still around. I think there's hundreds, maybe thousands of them. That's what I believe. I think they're in caves or something. Or maybe it's Right.

3 (1h 58m 25s):
You know what the problem with that is? What? They're too big. The amount of food that they would need to eat.

4 (1h 58m 31s):
Yeah.

3 (1h 58m 31s):
You'd have to be grazing All day long. See if you're Bigfoot posted

7 (1h 58m 37s):
In the zoo, the Journal of Zoology this

3 (1h 58m 39s):
Month. If it's there, could it be a bear? They're

4 (1h 58m 42s):
Saying it's black bear American

3 (1h 58m 43s):
Black bear. Yeah. American black bear. That stands up. But

4 (1h 58m 45s):
He's even little kids. Yeah. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. Would know the difference between a monkey and a bear.

3 (1h 58m 49s):
No, no, no, no, no, no. First of all, lemme tell you something. If you're in the woods and you're on in a heightened state, 'cause you're looking around You don't know what's out there. It's all thick woods. It's weird. Woods are weird. Yeah. And you see something you could trick your brain. I saw a squirrel and for like two or three seconds I thought it was a wolf.

4 (1h 59m 6s):
Really? Yeah. Yeah. That's real. That's a wolf That's real. Between here

3 (1h 59m 9s):
I'm seeing something moving in between thick trees and I see gray fur. I'm like, oh my God. It's that a wolf. Yeah. Because there's wolves out there. Right? It was, I'm in Canada. I'm like, oh, it's a fucking squirrel. What the fuck is wrong with me? What the fuck is wrong with me? Shoot it. Yeah. It's like people see what they want to see. Yeah. And the problem is you get something into someone's head, A mythological thing, whether it's a UFO or whether it's Bigfoot or think it's, I think the world is way more slippery than we like to think. and I think there's states of consciousness that people can achieve during high anxiety levels. Definitely during the use of psychedelic drugs. Yes. Sometime during weird states in their life.

3 (1h 59m 50s):
Like near death experiences, loss of a loved one. Extreme emotion. Yeah. A lot going on. A lot of anxiety and fear like you would have if you were in the woods. Sure. And then on edge, see you see a light across the sky. and it might have been just a meteorite. Right. But you're in the wrong head space. Yeah. To see that meteorite and you just fucking, you just freak. You just freak. Yeah. And maybe for a brief moment you can see something that's been there all along.

4 (2h 0m 16s):
Oh, you're how defeated I am right now. I just want you to tell me Bigfoot like, dude, there's some crazy, I wanna believe in Bigfoot. Some crazy stuff out

3 (2h 0m 22s):
There. I've interviewed a lot of Bigfoot people. Yeah. I had one big joke I used to do about Bigfoot. Here's what you don't find when you go looking for Bigfoot black people. You're more likely to find Bigfoot than you are black people looking for Bigfoot. I'm not out there. It's a bunch of unfuckable white guys out camping. That's like,

4 (2h 0m 39s):
That is the thing. It's

3 (2h 0m 40s):
A community of people that wanna believe something that there's zero evidence for. And they're fucking locked in.

4 (2h 0m 45s):
Yeah. They're hitting a tree with a stick going. Like, we're gonna wait for a knock back. And it's different Bigfoot researchers hitting a different tree, talking back to him.

3 (2h 0m 52s):
Yeah. It's like if you go to public land elk hunting, there's a bunch of people elk calling. You think elk. It's a dude with

4 (2h 0m 57s):
A two. It's another guy elk. Two men doing elk calls

3 (2h 1m 1s):
Exactly. To each other. Crossed a, it literally happens. I bet it does. 100%. It's one of those things where I wish it was real. Me too. Me too. If it was Bobcat Goldway believes.

4 (2h 1m 11s):
Yeah. He loves it.

3 (2h 1m 12s):
He's all in. Did you ever watch Willow Creek?

4 (2h 1m 14s):
I didn and it piss me off because at the end it just, it turns out to be I'm gonna spoil a Willow Creek. But at the end it's just a bunch of like hillbillies out there killing and blaming it on Bigfoot. Basically. That's like the end. the end is, wait a minute,

3 (2h 1m 24s):
Which one are you talking about? You

4 (2h 1m 25s):
Don movie. I think that's what the end is that like, it is just some crazy people that live in the woods. It's not really a Bigfoot.

3 (2h 1m 32s):
Is that true?

4 (2h 1m 33s):
I think that's the end of Willow Creek.

3 (2h 1m 35s):
I don't remember how it ends

4 (2h 1m 36s):
Because they kind of have this one kind of like Blair Witch like shot. Yeah. And it's just a bunch of hi, you know, mountain people, which is the scariest thing you'll find in the woods. People.

3 (2h 1m 45s):
Well that's

4 (2h 1m 46s):
That. People that wanna be off that grid. People that

3 (2h 1m 48s):
It's that documentary. Sasquatch. Did you ever see that? It's like a documentary series.

4 (2h 1m 51s):
Yeah. and it turns out just to be the cartel. Yeah. Blame. Oh, not the cartel, but like weed people. Weed

3 (2h 1m 56s):
People killing other,

4 (2h 1m 57s):
Blaming it on a bigfoot, framing it to look like a bigfoot's out there. Yeah.

3 (2h 2m 1s):
Yeah. Yeah. They killed somebody. And apparently when marijuana was, you know, when they were growing it up there, these hippies started arming themselves. Yeah. You know, and then they had rival gang wars with people that would come in and try to steal their crop and take Sure. So they start shooting at each other and killing each other. Yeah. That's what that's all about.

4 (2h 2m 21s):
Or also like, you know, some cute girl that's like, oh, I'm gonna clip weed all summer and make five grand and hang out with other potheads who likely you don't realize how terrible that job is. Well you're,

3 (2h 2m 31s):
You're involved in illegal business. Yeah. And the cartels in that business. Like, I had a friend who found a cartel grow operation on a ranch. Yeah. They were scary. They were, he works on a ranch in California and he was doing his thing out in the ranch, and he found some water piping and he followed the water piping and, you know, it was pretty considerable distance. And they found this grow op. So this guy had diverted water or many guys, they didn't see the humans that did it. They took their shit. And then they never caught the guys, I don't think. But the, they would set up these camps in like, they would go to like national forests.

3 (2h 3m 12s):
Apparently it's big in Northern California where they go deep, deep, deep in the woods. They backpack in and then they have a massive grow op in on public land. Yeah. And they just get it till the time it's, you know, ready to harvest. And then they get out of there. But if someone interrupts that, if they get in the middle of that, they'll, they'll kill them. Right. Like these are cartel guys. Yeah. So my friend John Norris, who's been on the podcast before, he was a game warden and he found a creek that had been redirected and he thought like maybe a farmer had did this. Like, what's going on? Maybe someone put an illegal dam on this. They follow it and they find this crazy grow up with the cartel and guns.

3 (2h 3m 53s):
And so he winds up, instead of just being a game warden, now all of a sudden he's got a tactical team with the tack dogs. Crazy. And and they're, they're running in fully armed to flack jackets on having gunfights with the cartel in the woods over weed.

4 (2h 4m 9s):
Yeah. I will say that that's like the most frustrating part about the Bigfoot subject is you got guys like, who really like, oh, I think an ape could, like a fam, a pot of apes could like live out here and this thing. And so you'll start to guys like me, it'll be like, yeah, this makes good sense is, and then they'll get like a Native American to talk about it and he'll be like, it's the magic man of the woods. He like, no. And like if he disappears, he flies. He can stop the rain and you're go, nah, this is, gosh dang it. We were making real good ground here, making arguments for it to be an ape.

3 (2h 4m 41s):
I think the Native Americans are right. I think that's what it is. Big. Some

4 (2h 4m 45s):
Sort of paranormal woods thing.

3 (2h 4m 47s):
Yeah, I do. Yeah. I think it's like, listen, if uf listen, let's imagine that states of consciousness can interface with other things that are around us all the time that we don't necessarily see now we know that's true. If you take psychedelics and we know that psychedelics are produced in the brain, I can imagine a moment where you are in such a state that you could see something that you would not be able to see under normal conditions. It doesn't, it's not outside the realm of possibility. Sure. I'm not married to it, but it's not outside the realm of possibility. Now if that is what we're seeing with UFOs, if what we're seeing is our future is if what we're seeing with those beings is the eventual shape that human beings will take as evolution, progress as we become these genderless little spindly things.

3 (2h 5m 40s):
Big brains with giant heads. Yeah. Yeah. Flying spaceships with our minds. That kind of makes sense to me. If that makes sense. Why wouldn't I be able to also see what we used to be or what we could have been. Oh yeah. Or what, what other things used to live with us. And maybe it's almost like a ghost, almost like a memory that you can access or access of a different timeline, a different dimension. Where this thing does exist. And that's why it's so elusive. and it comes and goes because it's not a real material thing. It's a construct of the human psyche. But these people that are seeing it, like they might even literally be seeing footprints. It might literally leave footprint.

3 (2h 6m 21s):
It might exist for brief moments.

4 (2h 6m 24s):
Makes sense. Passing in and out of this dimension kind of thing. There's so

3 (2h 6m 27s):
Many wacky stories about it. So then you have to apply the wacky stories to human psychology and say, okay, people are in a heightened state. They're in the woods, they're alone, they're nervous. Yeah. Yeah. There's cats out there and fucking bears. Ah, so you're kind of freaking out already. Right. So the, you're in this like weird mindset state already where it seems like more things are possible out there because there's no one to help you. Right. There's no city, there's no hospital.

4 (2h 6m 51s):
Can't call the cops on a bigfoot. You

3 (2h 6m 52s):
Got no fucking cell phone signal and you're out there alone. Like, there's so many possi possibilities. It's terrifying. Yeah. Yeah. And that to me makes sense. Like if there's a mindset that could be achieved, it's a mind state to be achieved where you interact with things that aren't there all the time. Like UFOs. Right. That would be when it would happen. Right.

4 (2h 7m 13s):
Well they, there's tons of like interesting stories that you'll just read about. Like a thing just walking behind the tree and then it's, but if it was a massive Yeah. 10 foot thing, you know, you'd probably be able to see it come out on the other side of that tree and you see a lot of those kind of, yeah. Or you read, I read a lot of those kind of stories and I'm like, I don't know what the heck that.

3 (2h 7m 32s):
Yeah. It could be that. but it could also be black bears. It could be that you're just seeing things 'cause they're freaking out. Yeah. Bears freak you out, man. You see a bear in the wild. It freaks you out. And if you see a bear in between trees, oh yeah. You can just convince yourself that it's something. And then your brain plays tricks on you. The memory is a slippery bitch.

4 (2h 7m 49s):
Yeah. I know,

3 (2h 7m 50s):
Especially under heightened circumstances like that, like in the woods, your memory's weird.

4 (2h 7m 55s):
And it's more exciting to believe that it's real. So that's what you wanna, you know, that's my biggest part. I think what I'm holding onto so much is that like, I think it's so boring if we just know all the stuff on our planet.

3 (2h 8m 6s):
I don't think

4 (2h 8m 6s):
We do. But that's my point. It's way more exciting to think. Yeah. There's Bigfoots and there's, yeah.

3 (2h 8m 11s):
Dactyl is one of my favorites. J

4 (2h 8m 13s):
Wolf Wolfman or Dog Man or Moth man or any of these kind of like exciting things. I am, I'm, I want to believe that.

3 (2h 8m 21s):
Well, you know about that Hobbit man that they found on that island of Flores. No, no.

4 (2h 8m 26s):
Ho Hobbit man. Yeah.

3 (2h 8m 27s):
This is a good one for you. This is a thing that absolutely lived, lived alongside people and I think they, they don't know the, the timeline of this fucker either, but they think it might have been as recently as like 50,000, 30,000 years ago. And they were little tiny people. Three foot tall, like almost like apelike creatures. That's what they

4 (2h 8m 46s):
Looked like. Like Oh yeah. See like a little baby bigfoot. Yeah,

3 (2h 8m 49s):
Well like, like little hobbits man. And they lived on this island and they were like a different branch of the human chain. Look at that. That lived alongside homo sapiens.

4 (2h 8m 59s):
Yes. You see that. You just think you see a juvenile bigfoot or something.

3 (2h 9m 2s):
Yeah. Well there's people that have cited these things in other parts of the world still to this day. They still claim that they exist. You

4 (2h 9m 9s):
Seen that video recently where it's like, these guys, like, I'm gonna make up a place, but it's someplace like, but not necessarily Thailand. And they're on these motorcycles and this little man's comes out with like a spear and then they chase it into the high grass. but

3 (2h 9m 23s):
It runs across the road. Right. Doesn't it like run

4 (2h 9m 25s):
Across the, well it has a spear 'cause it's kind of startled by their motorcycles. And then they're going Wow. Wow. They kind of chase you down this little trail. But then this is this. Yeah. This little guy. Yeah. Like a tiny person. Yeah. And then it runs into the grass and they lose it. But it's tiny little guy. Yeah. And he's got like some sort of spear.

3 (2h 9m 44s):
Do you see a spear?

4 (2h 9m 46s):
You'll see it in the very beginning before. 'cause one guy gets off his bike in the very beginning when it first comes out. It has like a little spear maybe even before this.

3 (2h 9m 57s):
So they're riding the bike. I just

7 (2h 9m 58s):
Remember this video replaces itself a lot. Oh

4 (2h 9m 60s):
Sorry. Like on loop.

3 (2h 10m 1s):
Oh, okay.

4 (2h 10m 2s):
Oh, okay. Yeah. So this, when they chase him into the grass, this is when they lose him. They pop around looking for it,

3 (2h 10m 8s):
But it So they see him again.

4 (2h 10m 10s):
No, no. This is where they, when they first stumble upon him, he has like a right here. There you go. He's holding something.

7 (2h 10m 15s):
There was something I mean. Whether I get, if this is a real video, it definitely looks like there's something in the end right here.

4 (2h 10m 21s):
Yeah. He's like dragging something.

3 (2h 10m 23s):
Jamie, does that look real to you? I you're good at this. Lemme see it. Let it, let it play again. No, I

7 (2h 10m 30s):
First, first let it play again. Cy cynicism goes, no, that's not real. But,

10 (2h 10m 37s):
Hmm.

4 (2h 10m 41s):
And that guy dumps 'cause he's like, what the hell?

7 (2h 10m 44s):
First instinct says this is someone in that side of the world playing around with computer graphics and that's just a, they just shrunk a person. Hmm. But that's just being cynical.

3 (2h 10m 53s):
Right. And that seems the most likely scenario. I would like to hear their voices. Are they speaking in English?

7 (2h 11m 1s):
There's no sound. Doesn't seem like, nah,

4 (2h 11m 3s):
On this one probably. But like I

7 (2h 11m 4s):
Feel like they have heard it before, but

4 (2h 11m 6s):
It just sounds like a lot of motorcycles. Yeah. It's like, because they're all, it must be a go on motorcycles.

7 (2h 11m 10s):
It's like a 12-year-old GoPro video.

4 (2h 11m 12s):
So it's not the

3 (2h 11m 13s):
Best. See the thing about that is fascinating is you're dealing with insane ju jungle, like insane dense terrain. There's a, where the Orin pen deck is, where do they think that thing exists? It was like Vietnam and some other area. but it just, if the island of Flores had these creatures on them, like the idea that there would be just a small population of them that still existed, that seems to me to be more likely than Bigfoot. Yeah. Because that one gets seen a, a

7 (2h 11m 43s):
Lots, a video of it. And that looks the lighting on it. It's so strange to me. Yeah, it looks weird that it looks, it looks unnatural.

3 (2h 11m 49s):
It definitely looks weird. But

4 (2h 11m 50s):
Also could everything is a thumbnail. Sure,

7 (2h 11m 52s):
Sure, sure, sure. Yeah. Yeah.

4 (2h 11m 53s):
Definitely. Because I watch these sirs spooks

7 (2h 11m 55s):
That looks a group. It looks like a version of group. Right.

3 (2h 11m 57s):
But everything looks blurry there. The motorcycle looks like shit. Everything looks

4 (2h 12m 0s):
Fucked up. and I on all these, like videos like this, when you try to get you to click on it, they doctor the thumbnail up so that you'll click on it. Right?

3 (2h 12m 7s):
Yeah. Yeah. They jazz up. That looks jazzed up. Right,

4 (2h 12m 10s):
Right. But that's the,

3 (2h 12m 12s):
So it was Indonesia. Yeah. So that's, that's where they claim to have cited this thing. But most likely it's bullshit. You know, so many people have cell phones. It's bullshit. Yeah. So many people have cell phones. The idea that no one's filmed one yet, but for sure we know it did exist. And how long ago did the homo fluoresce, how long ago did that one live? They used to think it was like much more recent. I think they were thinking at one point in time. It was only 10,000 years ago, but I think they think it's quite a bit older than that now. 50,000. So here it goes.

3 (2h 12m 52s):
Okay. So initially thought to be only 12,000 years ago, however more extensive stratographic and chronological work has been pushed, pushed dating of the most recent evidence of its existence back to 50,000 years ago. So that's the most recent evidence. Mm. 50,000 years ago. And Flo Homo Flores skeletal materials now dated from 60,000 to a hundred thousand years ago. Stone tools recovered alongside the skeletal remains were from archeological horizons, ranging from 50,000 to 190,000 years ago. That's for the stone tools. Found it

7 (2h 13m 26s):
In this little cave.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Why would I do that?

4 (2h 13m 49s):
Because then you're you're proved that it's, 'cause now if you try to tell the story, people like, Joe, you saw a bear.

So what? So what? So

4 (2h 13m 56s):
Your your sanity. Nah,

No fucking way. No fucking way. Why would you shoot? Yeah. Would you kill it?

4 (2h 14m 5s):
Oh yeah, I'll kill it quick dude. I would just, what if you only wounded it? That's the problem. I think the more likely it's gonna go you piece of and break it off. And if it is a

3 (2h 14m 16s):
No, it'd have to be a mythical creature to take a good shot with

4 (2h 14m 19s):
An arrow. I'd try to kill it.

3 (2h 14m 21s):
You shoot that sucker

4 (2h 14m 22s):
With it and then tell everybody like, you guys all set. I was wrong.

This is the head of Mike Moan. That's not the first federal employee of over 20 years. And my father

3 (2h 15m 30s):
Yikes.

11 (2h 15m 31s):
For eternity as a traitor to his, I

3 (2h 15m 33s):
Don't wanna listen. No, no, no. I wanna listen to that. That's why I wanted to tell you.

11 (2h 15m 36s):
Treason and betray others. Occupy the lowest pits of hell for all time. The federal government of America has declared war on America's citizens and the American states.

3 (2h 15m 45s):
This is a guy who just beheaded his dad inside

11 (2h 15m 48s):
Out. As far left woke mobs rampage are once prosperous cities.

3 (2h 15m 52s):
Okay. Kill it. That guy I mean. That might be like a Manchurian candidate tank thing. China might have like hypnotized that dude. Like that guy looks out of his fucking mind.

4 (2h 16m 2s):
Yeah. And he wrote out a little thing.

3 (2h 16m 3s):
He might be on like a new trial medication. He

4 (2h 16m 6s):
Typed up his little speech. What he's gonna say, all right, what, what, what? I'll use all these buzz words and then I'll, I'll show the head like that's the fourth take or something. His

3 (2h 16m 15s):
Doctor prescribed a new medication called murderous militia. He killed his

4 (2h 16m 21s):
Like the way cat. He held it up. Like I'm holding one of these little, like a fish like fish. Look at see this? This is Gary.

3 (2h 16m 27s):
It's like this is the brisket we're gonna cook. Here's before I trim it.

4 (2h 16m 30s):
That's wild.

3 (2h 16m 31s):
It's his dad's head in a plastic bag.

4 (2h 16m 34s):
That's so crazy.

3 (2h 16m 36s):
The thing is like how calm he is. Right? When he is reading his manifesto and talking about, this is my dad. He was a traitor. Puts it down then just goes right back to work. Like what the fuck? Yeah. That

4 (2h 16m 45s):
Is insane. That was tough. Interesting to 'cause you like you, I'll read a thing like this soccer player came out and beheaded a referee or something like that. It's always in some sort of place. You know, you don't think that it's in like Ohio.

3 (2h 16m 59s):
Like Yeah,

4 (2h 16m 60s):
That was, and it was like a normal bedroom. Like you see people's zoom call from, what

3 (2h 17m 4s):
Is that guy's background? Did they ca they got him right. He's alive, right?

7 (2h 17m 8s):
Yeah. That was the mugshot we were looking

3 (2h 17m 9s):
At. That was the mugshot. Jesus Christ. So he didn't even fight the cops try to go down with the ship. What

4 (2h 17m 15s):
A crazy, what A

3 (2h 17m 16s):
Charged

7 (2h 17m 17s):
With least abusive a corpse amongst other crimes.

3 (2h 17m 21s):
At least abusive of a corpse amongst

4 (2h 17m 23s):
Other crimes. Yeah, I think

3 (2h 17m 24s):
So. Maybe. No, my dad was already dead. He just cut his head off. Imagine if that turns out to be the case. Dad died and said, you know what, I'm gonna get some street cred. I'm

4 (2h 17m 32s):
Gonna hack his head off. Off

3 (2h 17m 33s):
And said I killed him. And he's a traitor. Like I mean that's possible.

4 (2h 17m 36s):
Weirdest stolen valor ever. It's the strangest. One time I saw a fist fight in Seattle, Washington at this bar and this kid just jumped up, got this big guy, sucker punch, you know, but knocks him out and then f flee. 'cause he realized, oh, I'm gonna get in trouble or maybe someone's gonna beat me up. And he ran from the cops. But we all saw the fight. So the police were like, would you recognize him if you saw him? I go, yeah, I'd recognize him. So they put me in the back of the cop car. They were gonna drive me around to see if I could spot him, but I figured, 'cause I'm in the back of the cop car, you know, I look like I'm a badass. You know, like, so I put, I kept like, whenever we'd drive by girls, like in, I put my hands like this and it, I'd be like kissing at the window. Like, you know like, like, and they're like, oh that guy's nuts.

3 (2h 18m 16s):
You know? Handsome outlaw stole

4 (2h 18m 17s):
The valor of, of the fight kid. but it That's a good move. What a weird, that shook me a little bit.

3 (2h 18m 23s):
What is that guy's background, Jamie?

7 (2h 18m 25s):
I'm looking. He also, so they found, the wife called it in. He then drove a hundred miles and broke into a Fort Indiantown gap base and stole a gun. National Pennsylvania National Guard Headquarters. As he was found with a gun, but he didn't resist arrest.

3 (2h 18m 40s):
Holy shit.

4 (2h 18m 41s):
I wonder if this guy, like, do you think he, he didn't before that there was just like, he's a guy and then he is like, well cut the head off. Now it's time to, right. Do you think there was things leading up to that or is that just, that's the,

3 (2h 18m 52s):
I would imagine there were signs. Right?

7 (2h 18m 54s):
2016 as college roommate said he thought the government was out to get him.

3 (2h 18m 58s):
Oh, paranoid schizophrenia.

4 (2h 18m 60s):
What do you think the rule is on? Or maybe

3 (2h 19m 1s):
They were out to get him or maybe they, maybe they did manary in Canada. They

7 (2h 19m 5s):
Were looking at him for a while. When I heard, first heard the story, the FBI was looking

3 (2h 19m 8s):
At him. They were looking at 'em. Yeah, we're looking at 'em. Yeah.

4 (2h 19m 9s):
We're just taking, we're observing them. Maybe

3 (2h 19m 12s):
It's like some new MK Ultra project.

4 (2h 19m 14s):
I will say the signs thing. So like, let's say this kid does this, right? And then people go, oh, we looked at his, they always do that with serial killers, right? They'll say, look, we looked at his Facebook and there were signs and no one did anything about it. Right. It's because people don't want to believe that that's possible.

3 (2h 19m 30s):
Well, also you don't wanna look for it everywhere. Maybe the guy's just having a rough week, right?

4 (2h 19m 34s):
Yeah. Maybe.

3 (2h 19m 35s):
Maybe he's not gonna climb on top of a fucking church tower with a rifle.

4 (2h 19m 38s):
There's a guy who I got banned from the improv in Hollywood and it's because while he was sitting there, he's, he's a lower level comic. So he is not like past, it's not like he would be working at the improv, but he goes, hangs out at the improv. 'cause he wants to be a successful comedian. Excuse me. I don't know. We could, I could chalk it up to alcohol. I could chalk it up to like whatever these excuses are. But what he was saying was so problematic the way he was like, you know what? It's coming. The day's coming. Oh boy. And I'll tell you what I've killed before. And oh, and one of these, you know, military guys used to be a military guy. And he goes, he's like kind of taunting me a little bit. 'cause I, you know, I went and I was just on the lineup, you know?

4 (2h 20m 20s):
So I'm one of the comedians that he thinks whatever. And he goes, he goes, you know, and guys like you are worth extra points. And I was like, what does that mean? and I said that my manager was sitting there listening to it. I go, what are you, are you like threatening me? Or like, so like, I don't understand what you're doing. Like, because I just wanna be friends with everyone. Yeah. You know, just trying to break bread. And he's like, he's like, no, you guys will all see, he guys will all see it, dude. It's all he's doing this kind of like cryptic. I took it as like, this is a sign. Yeah. That's a, so I told the Hollywood the next day, I called and I said, Hey, you know, maybe don't have a guy that's bragging about how he's gonna shoot up everybody eventually. Yeah. Because you always hear these signs and go, why didn't I do anything? Well

3 (2h 20m 56s):
The thing about comedy is mental ill people. Yes. Sign up for open mics. Yep. All the time.

4 (2h 21m 1s):
So I got him banned. And then the girl bartender who works there, who's a great woman, she's really great. She's like, I can't believe you did that. He would never hurt a fly I know him really well. I go, yeah, but you might be enabling a guy like this until he pops. Yeah. Like we always say like, why didn't you say anything? You know, like there's signs there. Yeah. I saw the signs and I told, whereas like she's, she to this day, she's like, I just can't believe you got it. Like, he might not have any other place to go. And he comes here. Oh

3 (2h 21m 29s):
God. And he comes and ruins this place. Get the

4 (2h 21m 30s):
Don't fuck outta here. Him doing that I was like, I was fine with telling on him. And you can't talk like that even if you're never gonna do anything.

3 (2h 21m 36s):
Was he funny?

4 (2h 21m 37s):
No.

3 (2h 21m 37s):
Oh, well there you go.

4 (2h 21m 38s):
Doesn't bother me.

3 (2h 21m 40s):
He's outta here. Probably wasn't gonna work out anyway. Right. That's probably what, why he was upset with you. That, that

4 (2h 21m 45s):
Actually, he said that to me. He goes, I bet you made everybody laugh and I go. Yeah. That's kind of the idea. Yeah. That's the job. He goes, don don't even care if they laugh. don don't give a shit about any of that. And I was like, that's the whole point. Like he was romanticizing about being the guy who doesn't Well

3 (2h 22m 0s):
Those are those people who can't do it.

4 (2h 22m 1s):
Need the crowd to like him. And I was like, well, but that is the job. Yeah. I want them to laugh.

3 (2h 22m 6s):
Yeah. It's, you're in the entertainment business,

4 (2h 22m 8s):
It makes no s like he thinks he's better, like more cerebral. 'cause he doesn't get laughs

3 (2h 22m 14s):
What people do when they don't have an option. You know? That's the only way they can find, you know, any kind of status. Their status is that they don't give a fuck. Don't

4 (2h 22m 23s):
Give a fuck. Yeah. So it's so tired,

3 (2h 22m 24s):
So stupid. Yeah. Of course you give a fuck, you

4 (2h 22m 26s):
Liar. Right. And also, we don't need people that don't give fucks. No. It's also we want you to give some fucks.

3 (2h 22m 31s):
It's also, it's not powerful to not give a fuck. It's stupid. It's

4 (2h 22m 35s):
Lazy. Yeah.

3 (2h 22m 36s):
Yeah. It, it's stupid.

4 (2h 22m 37s):
It's image. It's like what babies do. Yeah.

3 (2h 22m 39s):
Yeah. You're trying to do something. You're involved, you're at the place of where it gets performed. You're involved. Yeah. You're involved. You just suck at it. Right. And so you're trying to find some way to sort of make you the more, you know, whatever virtuous more someone who's like cooler.

4 (2h 22m 58s):
Yeah. Yeah. But, and that's all in a need to be like, we talked about a guy last night that's like, you know, he would treat people terribly, but then when you'd hear him talk about people that he liked, he would say like, he was a real jerk to me. You're like, yeah. You see how that made you feel? That's what you do to people. Like, you think that that, you know, it makes no sense. Wow.

3 (2h 23m 19s):
People are just trapped in their own head. It's

4 (2h 23m 21s):
Silly.

3 (2h 23m 22s):
So many people are not aware of how other people are perceiving them. They're trapped in their own head and they just know what they want and they get upset if other people are getting things that's, it's, it's just so toxic, so bad for you.

4 (2h 23m 34s):
But it's, I think like you can learn that at a pretty low, like a pretty young age to go. Yeah. You should learn that. Do you know how? Yeah. Do you know how you feel when people are nice to you? That's how they're gonna feel. Yeah. If you're nice to, it's such a child, like kindergarten lesson and these are grown people that you have to go, you should treat people good. Yeah. That's kind of the idea. Hey

3 (2h 23m 52s):
Man, they're artists. Ugh. They're artists so

4 (2h 23m 54s):
Smart.

3 (2h 23m 54s):
They're artists mad.

4 (2h 23m 58s):
That's like a,

3 (2h 23m 60s):
You can't be an artist. You're too handsome.

4 (2h 24m 1s):
Yeah. You should. You should want them at all to not like

3 (2h 24m 4s):
You. You should be depressed. Yeah. How do you mean not depressed? Because

4 (2h 24m 7s):
No way to, it's no way to live.

3 (2h 24m 9s):
It's no way to live. It isn't any way to live. Yeah.

4 (2h 24m 12s):
That is a powerful statement. To just be like, people go, how you doing? Go. I'm happy. Yeah. They go, what? Yeah. What do you mean you're

3 (2h 24m 17s):
Happy? Well that's the really annoying thing about this perception of comedians that we're not supposed to be happy. So dumb. Like says who. Right. We literally make people happy for a living. You shouldn't be enjoying yourself. Like, like last night hanging around the green room. That to me is like ultimate playground. Right. It's everyone's just having fun and laughing. Yeah. And we're just talking shit and having a good time. And the idea that that wouldn't make you happy. Right. And then you go on stage and then people laugh. That

4 (2h 24m 43s):
Doesn't make that a good Yeah. Yeah. Don you happy, you know what's better Or it's a lot better than pouring concrete for 10 hours. Yeah. Like you're at work. Yeah. That's

3 (2h 24m 51s):
Real.

4 (2h 24m 51s):
And we're having fun and talking and, and like, yeah. Yeah. I think that's why podcasts are so huge by the way. Sure. Because it's the green room hang.

3 (2h 24m 60s):
Yes. And

4 (2h 25m 0s):
People holding court telling stories

3 (2h 25m 2s):
Get in on it. They listen to it. Yeah. And then they get inspired to kind of have those kind of conversations with their friends. Sure. If you're not around anybody. Interesting. It's sucks. It sucks a hundred percent. It's like a kind of, it's like a social starvation. Yeah. Part of you just fucking withers. Yeah. Part of you that likes to have a good time and have fun with cool people.

4 (2h 25m 24s):
Yeah. And it's also like I, I love the idea that if I say something to my comedy buddies, they know me well enough to go he's a comedian. Yeah. He's trying to be funny. Yeah. Dude, I say a lot of stinkers. There's gonna be in the comments. You see Jeff try to make Joe laugh right there. Yeah. But Joe knows. I'm just trying to make you laugh. Listen,

3 (2h 25m 43s):
We don't, we had no conversation at all about what we're gonna talk about. Right. Every podcast is like this. We just sit down and have a good time. Yeah. Some of them are gonna,

4 (2h 25m 51s):
You take some swings. Yeah. Yeah. That's kind of how it goes. Foul ball also, I might say something horrific. Yeah. And you go, yeah, that's what Jeff was just talking. That's what talking is. Yeah. Yeah.

3 (2h 25m 60s):
Especially talking and thinking in public out loud. Yeah. Yeah.

4 (2h 26m 4s):
You bounce it off each other. That's what you doing. Right. I did, I remember one time I, I said something terrible at a woman that was just walking by the car, you know, to my guy friends who aren't comics. We were pretty like junior college age. And my friends were like, what the fuck dude? And I was like, I don't know, I thought it'd be funny. And they just totally didn't get it. and it was really horrific.

3 (2h 26m 23s):
You

4 (2h 26m 23s):
Tried. Yeah. I tried and, but that's, I think about that moment a lot now that I'm with comics and I'm in these circles because they would just go, yeah. I know exactly what he's trying to do. I did one of those jokes five minutes ago. It's

3 (2h 26m 35s):
Like the open mic or trying the abortion joke. Yep. Like, hey, yeah. You don't get enough for this yet. Swing. Yeah. You gotta learn. And one of the ways you learn is by swinging and missing.

4 (2h 26m 44s):
That's why a lot of comics will say, and I don't, again won't name names, but they'll be like, I just went in there, I did my set and I got the fuck outta there. Barry Ka used to tell comics to do that. Don't hang around. You don't wanna be in these circles. You know what? And it's like, well one, that's how you make friends. Yeah. When I love friends

3 (2h 27m 2s):
And they're the friends that are gonna most relate to your life. Yeah.

4 (2h 27m 5s):
We're doing the same stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. And we're the same. We're cut from the same cloth. It's our only group. Yeah. Right. And and that's why you, those comics, if I worked to name their names, they don't do podcasts and they don't go because they've never done the hang part. Right. They've only done the jokes. And the Judy Carter, your comedy bible of like, you write the thing and the, so it's like this job isn't about going up there and then leave. It's about the community of standup comedy.

3 (2h 27m 29s):
It's about both. And part of the enjoyment is the comradery. Yeah. That's part of the enjoyment. Why would you want less enjoyment?

4 (2h 27m 37s):
Yeah. It makes no sense.

3 (2h 27m 38s):
And also like that socially they're the most fun people to hang out with for me. Yeah. So like why would you wanna deny yourself of the most fun people to hang out with socially?

4 (2h 27m 46s):
That's why it's like I have to keep going to these like meetings and stuff for like for boo for booze. Yeah. For the drinking and I just sitting there going, I gotta listen to these hacks. I know some of the funniest people in the world. This guy's telling me some stupid story. Like I'm just listening to the stories. I'm so judgmental of people's stories because I'm going, geez, of course get ain't get out. There's no punchline here. Yeah. What's the point of this story? Yeah. And he is like, the guy's just got a disease, you know? Yeah. Like he's, you know, he's just trying to, he has to share or whatever.

3 (2h 28m 15s):
But then a lot of people go up in front of those things and they learn how to do standup because they tell funny stories. Yeah.

4 (2h 28m 22s):
You know, who doesn't tell funny stories? Joe? Who the mothers against drunk driving talking about a buzz kill, you know? Yeah. That's these gal a buzz. Yeah. I'm just watching 'em going, oh

3 (2h 28m 31s):
Jesus. Yeah. You don't want to You don't wanna be on those conversations.

4 (2h 28m 34s):
It is bad storytelling. Those are bad

3 (2h 28m 35s):
Stories.

4 (2h 28m 36s):
Yeah. but it is, those are stories. It's just like, I've become such a snob about the company 'cause I get to be around such funny people.

3 (2h 28m 43s):
Yeah.

4 (2h 28m 44s):
You know, that it's like, now I'm having to listen to, you know, a girl I likes friend talk about, you know, shopping that day or something. I mean I'm, I'm, I'm being irritable about it. Like,

3 (2h 28m 54s):
Ugh. Oh, it's brutal. Assault on your attention span. Yeah. I'm just gonna, I

4 (2h 28m 57s):
Can't hear this.

3 (2h 28m 57s):
Well you just gotta filter those people outta your life. Yeah. I try. Yeah. As much as you can. Yeah. Yeah. Keep yourself, keep circle tight. Just

4 (2h 29m 3s):
Sometimes you have to circle be around them.

3 (2h 29m 6s):
Yeah. Well listen man, it's been very fun getting to know you. Yeah. Hanging out with you. Thanks. You last night was really fun. You were very funny on stage. It was a cool hang in the green room. Yeah, it was great. I, I enjoyed talking to you man. So tell everybody social media where they could find you Website. Yeah.

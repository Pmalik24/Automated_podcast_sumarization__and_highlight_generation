Bring it back. When

2 (9m 12s):
You find, oh, I think I need smelling salt. Okay.

4 (9m 14s):
But I wanted to ask you to pause. You've had, like, I remember you had Jack Dorsey.

2 (9m 20s):
Stop tap, stop

4 (9m 20s):
Taping. I need

2 (9m 22s):
A drink. I need a cigar. I need something

4 (9m 28s):
Oh fuck

2 (9m 29s):
No, no, no more. Come on buddy. Come on. He's done. Pressing the shit outta me. That's someone's baby boy. Someone's playing catch with kid in the park.

4 (9m 37s):
Wait, hold on. So when you've had, like, back in the day you had Jack Dorsey on Yeah. You've had Zuckerberg on and you've talked about, you know, censorship. Like, you know what gets police? 'cause it always feels like these big companies have kind of, you know, inconsistent loose rules about what they do. Oh. If it's this, and this could be misinformation or we don't know if we can verify I know. It never feels like, oh, that's the clear answer. But on Instagram there's this thing where like, you know, somebody could say something about whatever political candidate, maybe Covid V or, and then people go like, that account is gone. Right? Or it's like, yeah, but you and I have a text thread that is pretty horrific.

4 (10m 20s):
That is fueled only by Instagram. Yeah. And you're like, wait, why is all this okay,

2 (10m 26s):
Tom and I every day. What's up? Tom and I every day send each other the most horrific shit we find on Instagram. Right.

4 (10m 32s):
That's

2 (10m 32s):
Bad every day. It's bad. It's people getting run over by trains every day. It's people getting moed by animals. What

3 (10m 39s):
Do they say? What's reason

4 (10m 40s):
Fucking

2 (10m 41s):
Electrocuted hit by lightning's dump trucks fall on top of them. It's, so

4 (10m 47s):
I asked, so I actually ran into an engineer at Meta two days ago and he was talking to me and, and I, I, I kind of like, was like, what's up with this? And he's like, yeah, there's just so many accounts, it's hard to, and I'm like, no. Yeah. I go, these are accounts that have been up forever and they just have murders.

2 (11m 3s):
Well here, not only that, they just show up in my feed and I'm not following them.

4 (11m 8s):
Oh yeah. Of course. That's

2 (11m 9s):
The algorithm's. It's like the algorithm. I watch that shit.

4 (11m 12s):
He said, if you look at something for two, two seconds, that means he knows you like it, they will start sending you

2 (11m 17s):
More. Oh. So does the algorithm recognize that you like car accidents? For

4 (11m 20s):
Sure. Or that you're watching them? It's just saying this guy Right. Will watch the car.

3 (11m 24s):
It's not enough to like, don't click on that. 'cause it'll lead to more. It's,

2 (11m 27s):
But my point, my point is that that means that the, a algorithm recognizes what that video is. Right? So if the algorithm recognizes what that video is and it doesn't flag

4 (11m 36s):
It, then it can, it could take it off if it Right.

2 (11m 39s):
If they want. But if they wanted to just like, not only like let the algorithm encourage you to watch it. Yeah. But leave the videos up because

4 (11m 48s):
The baseline goal of all those is keep you on the platform. Right. We

2 (11m 52s):
Should go back in our text thread like six months and see if any of those videos are still up. Oh,

4 (11m 58s):
I bet you a lot are.

2 (11m 59s):
That would be wild. Yeah. 'cause some of the ones, there's, there's so many war ones. Oh yeah. There's so many ones of like drones dropping down on people and you're watching their legs blow off. I watched a dudes suicide drone

5 (12m 10s):
Sucked into a sinkhole. Oh

2 (12m 11s):
Gosh. I saw that.

5 (12m 12s):
I saw four black chick fall into a sink hole. I,

3 (12m 14s):
I saw a guy call.

2 (12m 15s):
Shit. That's Florida Sinkholes are crazy. Like one day your house can just fall into a bottomless pit. Yeah. Outta nowhere. The earth collapses underneath where your structure is. A

4 (12m 26s):
Car in an intersection. Yeah. Just swallowed up. Swallowed up. And you realize that, like, who do you call?

2 (12m 31s):
Do you,

4 (12m 31s):
Do you think you're like, Hey, I'm mad at the mayor. Like the there's nothing you the earth, earth just did it.

2 (12m 37s):
Well, the, the, the reality is asphalt is preposterous. It's a ridiculous idea. It fucks up erosion. It does so many things. Like it fucks up absorption of the water naturally into the ground. They're gonna call you. You're covering everything with rock.

4 (12m 54s):
Yeah.

3 (12m 54s):
They're gonna call you anti falter.

2 (12m 55s):
And then underneath that, what's happening? What's happening underneath all that rock? I would imagine a lot of that water's moving around in there. And if it creates a nice little pocket and then you get the weight of all these buildings. And then one day just

4 (13m 10s):
Just does,

2 (13m 10s):
They just go under dude. and it happens

4 (13m 11s):
Everywhere. They've lost blocks.

5 (13m 29s):
That might be after,

3 (13m 30s):
After they've imploded it.

2 (13m 31s):
No, man, it might be real.

3 (13m 33s):
It's so deep though. We double

2 (13m 34s):
Check for another source. Yeah. Let, it does look real. Let Jamie double check. but it does. I think that does, I think that one was real. They did

3 (13m 40s):
A good job with the overhang. If it's fake. Look,

2 (13m 42s):
If you're looking at the ground, you, you're, you're thinking the ground. If you're looking down right, you're thinking the ground. Wow. Wow. That's real. Those are real. I think it's real. Dude,

3 (13m 52s):
That was the original nine 11

2 (13m 53s):

5 (14m 38s):
Arrogance. When the big waves were coming in to California like a month ago about, I drove the girls out to go look at the big waves. They were fucking massive 20 feet. You know, it's really impressive. It sounds like thunder. Wow. And Isla got swept out by a wave. She got, there's a video of it. Not bad. She she's fine.

Is your cell phone in your pocket? And so, but what's crazy is the moment of clarity after that where you go, hold on, we're not safe here. Like this is, oh hang on. This is actually really dangerous. Yeah. This is Isla. And she just like, she was just fucking around and then oh boy. And it's like aggressive Of course. We're all laughing

2 (15m 41s):
And she's far enough away where I'm not scared.

5 (15m 44s):
Yeah. Sort of. But if

2 (15m 45s):
She slipped for the back, that's all coming back. But what I'm saying is that like, that's one of those, you know, 50, 50 feet here, 50 feet there. Things like if you fuck up and you're 50 feet in front of that and you think you can get away.

4 (15m 58s):
I've had multiple ocean scares now. Like the one, the ones where you're like crying

5 (16m 3s):
On the beach.

4 (16m 4s):
Well, no, just that like in the moment. Yeah. I keep telling myself, don't panic. Don't panic, don't panic, you know. Oh. And one I, one I remember was in Hawaii where we rented a, a jeep and we were like, what? We wanna go see something, you know? So they tell you, oh, take this road and it, and it takes you to this single road that goes up where there used to be volcanoes. And we come up on this beach and they had mentioned the beach, but not really too much about it. And so when we parked, I was like, I I love the ocean water. I'm gonna get in the ocean. You know? So I get in the ocean and I remember that going in the beach into the water was a decline. Right. So like, you go down and I was just like knee deep in there about to, and, and I was like, man, this current is pulling back hard.

4 (16m 48s):
Like really hard. and I kind of take like a step back. and I, I feel myself going further down a decline. Oh, into the ocean. Oh, right. And when I, I, I decide to get out. I have to really push hard. Like all legs like boom, boom, like run like you're running up a hill to get out. And I was like, whew. That was fucking

5 (17m 9s):
The wave hit

4 (17m 9s):
You there. Kind of fucking scary. There was

2 (17m 11s):
That guy that was a WWE wrestler.

4 (17m 13s):
They tell me though, when I get back to the hotel, they go, I go, yeah, we took it. I go, that, that, that beach was, that was a little scary. They go, did you get in the water? and I go? Yeah. And they go, oh, you can't get in that water. Like, you'll drown in that water. No one go. Did you notice there was nobody swimming there? and I go. Yeah, I noticed. Thought it was, I thought it was, but I thought I found a fucking o You know, they like, they don't tell you. They didn't tell me. They're like, like, do not swim in that water. They're like, you can't swim out that if you had like, they're like, if you had swam 10 feet in, they're like, you're just gone.

2 (17m 43s):
Oh my God.

4 (17m 44s):
And like the panic you feel, especially in retrospect. 'cause you remember the feeling of being like, I think I'm stuck here. You know? I think I'm stuck right

2 (17m 51s):
Now. Fitzsimmons saved a lady in Thailand. Really? What? Yeah. Someone was drowning and Fitzsimmons swam out and saved them. Really? Yeah. I'm pretty sure it was Thailand somewhere crazy like that. Yeah. It was on vacation. I might have made up Thailand.

5 (18m 8s):
T it doesn't sound like a place fit. Simmons

2 (18m 10s):
Would go. I said Thailand. No, he would go, he's a world travel.

5 (18m 13s):
He's a Hawaii guy. I feel like he surfs in Hawaii where

2 (18m 15s):
Wherever it was. What fit? Simmons went in the ocean and saved a lady. No shit.

4 (18m 18s):
Yeah. Wow. I saw my dad save a lady.

2 (18m 20s):
That's a scary

4 (18m 21s):
Thing in a resort. It was at the bottom of the pool. Just, just laying at the bottom of the what?

2 (18m 26s):
Oh my God.

4 (18m 27s):
When I was like nine years old, it was like father son, he took me to this resort and there's a slide. You ever go on a slide where the water that comes off the slide that like, so in other words like when you hit the water, it's like high impact. You're like, holy shit. and it pushes you down. I'm nine years old, so this is many years ago. and I remember like I could swim. I was on swim team, like as a little kid. But I remember being like, fuck, that is powerful. Wow. Like it pushes you down. Right. And you just swim up and we're all people are, you know, at the resort. And then look down and my dad swims to the bottom of the oat to of the pool and pulls up this lifeless body.

4 (19m 7s):
And then they do CPR and she came back. Holy shut up. Shit. And they would write letters to our house for years. Holy shit. Really? She was 19. Oh my God. She wasn't a little kid.

3 (19m 16s):
Did you see the guy? Oh

2 (19m 17s):
My god. The

3 (19m 18s):
Snowboarder upside down when the random skier comes by. Yes. Just sees a snowboard sticking this far out of the snow. Yeah.

4 (19m 24s):
Is this the one where with two feet

2 (19m 26s):
And the guy was buried under the snow.

3 (19m 28s):
He goes, what the fuck? He stops. They goes up there.

2 (19m 30s):
He saved the guy's life randomly.

4 (19m 31s):
Is this, is this separate? Have you seen the footage where the guy's wearing the GoPro? I've seen that. Right. And then he's like, falls. Falls into the ditch into like a hole. Yeah. That you can is visceral that feeling. You're like, oh my God.

3 (19m 43s):
And then he's just like, we'll see what happens.

2 (19m 45s):
Obviously he got out because there's footage. Yeah. But when you're watching that, you're like, oh my God, you could just fall in there forever. And apparently that's something that happens.

3 (19m 53s):
Tree

2 (19m 53s):
Wells. That's something that happens. So this guy just falls and then watch this bro.

3 (20m 0s):
What

4 (20m 1s):
I know Bert's feeling. This.

5 (20m 2s):
No, I I've had a couple experiences like this.

2 (20m 4s):
He manages to stop himself.

3 (20m 6s):
Yeah. What the fuck? How the fuck do you get outta that?

2 (20m 9s):
How the fuck do you get out of

3 (20m 11s):
That? Fuck the skis. How, how do you get

2 (20m 12s):
Get that? It's, it's over Joe. But no, he's, he's, oh no, no.

5 (20m 15s):
He, they, they had to, I think I've read, read about this. They had to get search and rescue. He had to hang out down there for a while. Search and rescue had to come up and holy,

3 (20m 23s):
I figured get more of those GS

2 (20m 24s):
Trackers. Lucky you see though. Lucky he was so lucky that he stopped right there.

4 (20m 27s):
But the way he, he right here, he is not flailing. He's like putting his arm in his ski out to try to like, so this guy was able to keep some composure as this was happening. Which is which kind of the craziest part.

2 (20m 38s):
Oh my God. So this is the snowboarder that's buried upside down. So this guy just sees that little blue piece.

4 (20m 44s):
Bro,

5 (20m 45s):
Just randomly this, this happened to me. He

3 (20m 47s):
Ski right over him.

2 (20m 47s):
Yeah. He I mean He easily could've missed

3 (20m 49s):
That that take that. Yeah. Could've gotten

2 (20m 50s):
The other way. There's not much blue

5 (20m 52s):
Soft snow. He's in a tree. Well, is what it is. Yeah. So the tree wells, it's really soft, soft snow. So if you get stuck in a tree, well you are fucking dead. A lot of people die in tree wells.

2 (21m 2s):
God damn.

3 (21m 2s):
Yeah. I'm thinking of getting one of those GS things on. When we

5 (21m 5s):
One we went snowboarding in Matterhorn. Yeah. Hella skiing. Oof. And the guy put a beacon on us and the first thing he said, he puts a beacon, it's like four feet of powder. And he says, this is so we can find the body. Oof. And I was like, what? He's like, you might fall to CVA or an avalanche. So we put the beacon on to find the body. You

2 (21m 26s):
At

5 (21m 27s):
That feeling can't breathe. This happened to me. That feeling is terrifying. This,

3 (21m 30s):
This guy's like, thank you. Okay,

7 (21m 32s):
Good. We'll get you outta here in a sec. Okay.

5 (21m 36s):
He was paniced the panic. You knew he was dead. So

2 (21m 38s):
I'm feeling panic

5 (21m 39s):
Watching this. The panic. So what happens is, like what happened to me in, in the, when we were hell skiing is I fell face forward in powder. I and I just, I'd never snow skiing. Snowboarding and powder. Four feet of powder is very different than snowboarding. It's like you have to have your bindings reset. You have to really know how to ride the powder. And, and I could not turn right. And the guy told me, he is like, don't go within five feet of my tracks. They're within my tracks. Oh. So the whole time I can only turn left because I'm, at the time, I really wasn't that good of a snowboarder and I. But I could snowboard but not in powder. And so he's going like this and all I can do is go left. And I'm just going off the track.

2 (22m 15s):
Oh no.

5 (22m 16s):
And I'm fucking panicking. We're, but by the way, we're at like 13,000 feet, 14,000 feet. It's very little oxygen. I'm gassed, I'm fat, I'm hungover. It's the day after the national championship that we went to. So we'd eaten edibles. It was like, it

3 (22m 28s):
Was the day after that.

5 (22m 29s):
It was the, it was the day after that. I flew to fucking Jesus. I flew to Switzerland and immediately landed and went hell skiing. don don't remember that. And so no, no, no. When we went to Florida State versus Alabama. Oh, 2013. Yeah. 2013. So all of a sudden I go to turn cut. Right. and I catch my nose and I fucking go face firsts in the snow. And at first I'm like, fine. I push my arms in and they just do not touch anything. Oh my gosh. It just goes like this. And now snow's impacted on my face. So I can't really breathe. and I, I'm First of all, I deal with panic. But panic hit kicks in immediately. And I'm like, this is why I have the fucking beacon on.

5 (23m 9s):
And so I try to clear the snow outta my face, but I'm like pulling all the muscles in my back trying to turn over. And then the guy just comes up behind me, grabs me on the back, flips me over. And he goes, you should see your sound guy. My sound guy's upside down skis kicking upside down in the snow. And we just got the fuck out. We got on a helicopter and got the fuck out. I was like, this isn't safe. What?

2 (23m 30s):
Yeah. I'm not interested in any of that nonsense. Lemme tell you about my last ski experience. I, I only used to ski with my family. You,

5 (23m 38s):
You, this resonates every time I go skiing. 'cause you go, it's not worth it.

3 (23m 42s):
Not worth. He always says that, he always says

5 (23m 43s):
This,

2 (23m 44s):
The time I go skiing, when I would go skiing because they wanted to go skiing. and I would be like, this is fun. It's good for kids to learn early 'cause they're really good at it. And my wife likes it. But I would be like, don't get hurt. Don't get hurt. Don't get hurt. Didn't get hurt. Back up. Don't get hurt. Don't get hurt. Don't get hurt. Didn't get hurt. Good. So all I'm doing is mitigating risk the entire time I'm skiing. Sure. Because I've had fucking three knee operations. I really know what it's like to blow your shit apart. And they're like naive to how vulnerable your knees are. And kids are fucking rubber. They just fucking bounce off rocks and they're fine. They fall down. They only weigh 80 pounds.

2 (24m 24s):
They fall down, they get right back up. Right back up. But I, so this last time I was going around this turn and this lady didn't know how to ski and it looked like she was just a fresh beginner. And she was like doing the pizza thing, but she was sliding right into the trail. Oh. And it's a, it's a narrow trail. And I'm like, I have two options. I'm wiping this lady out or I'm gonna catastrophically fall down. I went with option two and I fucking tried to slide around this lady and my skis went up in the air and I banged the back of my head hard. Oh fuck. and I fractured my leg. Helmet on. Really? Helmet on. Yeah. It was, it's called an insufficiency fracture.

2 (25m 4s):
It's a, a fracture at the top of the, the fibula where the, or the tibia rather where the tibia like touches the cartilage. I had a fracture and I was 100% concussed. Wow. Because I got on

5 (25m 18s):
Wait on helmet on, excuse me, helmet.

2 (25m 20s):
Yeah, helmet on it. but it didn't matter. It was hard. Snow headfirst, bam. and I remember thinking like, wow, that was a big one. I remember thinking that like when I got hit, I was like, that's a big one. And I got on the ski lift afterwards and I just miscalculated. Like I wasn't coordinated. and I fell down and I couldn't get up. What? Like I couldn't get up with, without help. The lady had to help me get up. She had to reach out and grab my hand and help because of, of the concussion. A hundred percent. Yeah. Wow. 100%. So I'm, I'm just dizzy. I'm off. How long ago was this? A couple years ago.

5 (25m 59s):
It was more than than that. It was more than that. It was pre pandemic Joe. I think about this every time I go fucking snowboarding. I

2 (26m 3s):
Think it was three years ago. No, I think it was three years ago.

5 (26m 5s):
After pandemic. Yeah.

2 (26m 7s):
I think it was during pandemic. I before was on People's story Ski again

5 (26m 10s):
Before. It was definitely before.

2 (26m 11s):
I don't think so. Man,

5 (26m 12s):
This story resonates. The last

2 (26m 14s):
Time you went to ski at the most, it's four years old,

5 (26m 17s):
But 2019

2 (26m 18s):
I was like,

5 (26m 18s):
When did

2 (26m 19s):
We go? That's just too, and then Shane Dorian tore his fucking knee apart. World champion, big wave surfer, tears his knee apart, snowboarding just slammed into a tree. And

5 (26m 29s):
That's why you gotta ski folks. Oh hey. Hang on. Hang. Do you wanna hear a story about old father? I just told

2 (26m 34s):
I was skiing. I was skiing. I gotta You don't

5 (26m 36s):
Like snowboarding? Oh no, no, no, no. Lemme share the story of skiing with Ari. Shafi. So First of all Ari gets this app that tracks how fast you're going. So the entire ski trip is based on how fast can

3 (26m 47s):
You get

5 (26m 47s):
It? And Ari's like, I think I got up to 70. I bet I can break 75. I bet I get

3 (26m 52s):
75 ski. He the sound barrier race.

2 (26m 54s):
Som you go 75 miles an hour on a skis.

3 (26m 56s):
Let's try Joe. Yeah.

5 (26m 58s):
So we go, our last run in, there's on, it's a Blue Park City and Ari is absolutely reckless off trail.

3 (27m 6s):
Well 'cause O'Neill's better than me. I'm Cha I was like, let's race. And I'm like, go and I just got the one second head start. So

5 (27m 11s):
We got Sean Patton, Mark Norman, O'Neill, Fredi,

3 (27m 14s):
Fat, gay loser. Yeah.

5 (27m 16s):
And we're all just, all we're doing is skiing to a bar. Okay. We're all gonna go get drunk and ski to a bar. and I just hear Ari fucking basketball. He dressed like a fucking 13-year-old basketball jersey. Fucking, he's got the Viking horn helmet on like a fucking lunatic. This isn't,

3 (27m 33s):
That's my mask. That's that's my, that's my mask jersey though. And look at like, I got my sweatpants over the,

5 (27m 38s):
And so Ari,

3 (27m 39s):
I'm, I'm a damn

5 (27m 39s):
Fool. Ari's worth the top of the mountain. He's like, let's see how fast we can go before we get to the bar. And I was like, I'm on snowboard. The fastest I'm getting is 37 miles per hour. That's the fastest I'm going. And I'm terrified. 'cause I hear you in my head going, it's not worth it. It's not worth it.

3 (27m 51s):
Worth. 'cause he'd already stopped

5 (27m 52s):
Ari decides to break the sound barrier. Pins his feet together and like a goddamn bullet starts fucking flying. Literally feet in front of the bar, wipes out and breaks his wrist. Some

3 (28m 5s):
Snowboarder turned back too fast. He was making nice wide loops. You you broke your wrist doing that. And then he like made a sharp one. Flew. Yeah. Demolished it. He had

5 (28m 12s):
It

3 (28m 13s):
Reconstructed. Yeah. There was a pin in there. Really? Yeah.

5 (28m 16s):
And all I heard was Joe. Rogan. It's not worth it.

3 (28m 20s):
We killed. How fast were you going? I was going pretty fast. I was winning. I I thought O'Neill was right behind me. He had stopped immediately. You

2 (28m 26s):
Have to think about it this way. For this momentary thrill of adrenaline and excitement. You potentially risk a life of catastrophic injury.

3 (28m 38s):
That's every time I come on this podcast, I've

2 (28m 42s):
Never stopped. I get it. Look, I get it because life is finite. I get it. You want to live and experience everything you want. But I believe you should mitigate risk and I believe people are drawn. You seek, drawn

3 (28m 53s):
Out dangerous animals.

2 (28m 54s):
I yeah, but I'm telling you I mitigate risk. And the, the risk of skiing to me is like, that one is like, there's too many variables. What's the, what do you think the most dangerous zipping around you do? Well, when I'm training in, I'm not doing juujitsu right now, but that's for sure the most other than driving because of potential damage than driving car. Yeah. Driving. Yeah. You're driving car, you're practicing strangling each other. Yeah. And you're doing it with people who are really good at strangling people. Yeah.

3 (29m 19s):
I love skiing so much.

2 (29m 21s):
Grabbing your legs and yanking 'em apart. and it's,

5 (29m 24s):
This last trip was the

3 (29m 25s):
Last, how was, how was the skiing as a, as a less pack guy, as a Sober

5 (29m 27s):
Person was a

2 (29m 28s):
Less fat guy

3 (29m 29s):
Person. I didn't, that was the less fat guy.

5 (29m 31s):
It was fucking amazing. I posted, I didn't, I did a weird thing this year. I didn't post any videos. I didn't record anything. I just hadn't lived. Just lived. Whoa. My girls loved it. They were like, this is great. We're not on Instagram for fucking people to see. But I, and I wasn't drinking and I was for what? and I was skinny and I was, like I said, the only thing I recorded was, I wanna show you my favorite trick. I could touch my foot. I could never touch my foot snowboarding. So getting my bindings on was so fucking tough.

3 (29m 59s):
It was so annoying. Lift to wait

5 (30m 0s):
10. Your gut was in the way and it was so uncomfortable.

2 (30m 3s):
You were on stage Tuesday night and I was like, you're too jacked. You're too jacked to take your shirt off now. Great. You look great. Thank It's not funny anymore.

5 (30m 11s):
It is I don. I can't, you know the people that really believe that. Yeah. There are people that really believe, oh, now you're not funny. You're like,

2 (30m 17s):
It's your freedom of you being you is you taking your shirt off? But if your freedom of you being you and now you no longer have a a gut and you got jacked shoulders, you got traps and shit, it's like that's a, a celebration of still who you are

3 (30m 31s):
Also. You're still fatter than you were when you were the fat guy.

5 (30m 33s):
Yeah. I'm fat. I'm still fat. He

3 (30m 36s):
Got so fat that he lost weight. Everyone's like, that's amazing. When he started playing the fat guy,

5 (30m 40s):
Playing the fat guy

3 (30m 42s):
Than

2 (30m 42s):
This. He playing

5 (30m 42s):
The fat guy. You mean when Tom started fat shaming me? Yes. When Tom was fatter than me and decided to start fat

2 (30m 47s):
Shaming me. I naively thought that when we did the first challenge, which was the weight loss challenge that led to Sober October group. Yeah. I really thought like you'd like stay on that path. You got so

5 (30m 57s):
Skinny. I didn't I didn't care. I didn't care. Yeah. You have to, you have to want to do it November 1st. That's true. I'll tell you right now. Sober October was an interesting experiment. But I will tell you, having done like three months or whatever I did, that one month is, and you, and the big difference is, I stopped drinking on planes 'cause I wasn't not drinking on a plane because of you three assholes. Like I was not drinking 'cause of you guys. Mm. And then when you're not drinking and you go, I'm not drinking for me, it's very fucking different. Mm. And then that was, then I got really comfortable on planes and I was like, oh, I've, I can get through this. I

2 (31m 32s):
Can Can't scientists just make a booze that doesn't kill you. Yeah. Can't you fucking you scientists out there? There has to be,

3 (31m 42s):
There

2 (31m 42s):
Has to be. Make a booze that doesn't kill you. So this is

3 (31m 46s):
Natural.

2 (31m 47s):
A better gay to, if you can make synthetic marijuana and turn it into pills, there's gotta be a way to take whatever the fuck it is that alcohol does. Good. Yeah. That gives you that fun. The sparkle.

3 (32m 12s):
And you're just like, in a good mood. You get that buzz, you ride it,

2 (32m 15s):
You ride it. Nice meal. Like how many times have we had meals on the road where we're having a couple of drinks, we're eating a nice meal and slowly goes up. We're talking and we're laughing and we're just,

3 (32m 25s):
It's a lubricant.

2 (32m 26s):
Enjoying ourselves. God damn.

3 (32m 28s):

You, the news. I go, well dude, I the news, am I allowed? I go, can I wear another pair of glasses that that are approved? And he said, and he's like, he goes, yeah. He goes, but it can't be those. and I go, okay, then he goes bar.

2 (33m 46s):
He takes his buddy Holly over

4 (33m 47s):
Here. Yeah. He goes, I'll see you in two. I'll see you in two weeks. and I go, where you gonna see me in two weeks? He goes, when you come to Jersey, when you in Atlantic City and I go, oh great. He goes, I notice the na Last time you in Jersey, you didn't gimme a call. You were hanging out with your white friends. and I go, I go, I go. He goes, don't think I forgot you are fucking Hispanic. You give me a call every time you come to Jersey. I go, okay. I'm sorry.

2 (34m 12s):
I'm sorry. He's the king of New Jersey. Yeah. Joey's open to a residency here in Austin. Yeah. To do that. We're we're talking about doing it once a month. Joey would come down for like three days. Great.

4 (34m 21s):
That'd be great. Yeah.

5 (34m 22s):
Oh, Joey and I should get a house together. I'm here for three days. Dude.

2 (34m 25s):
He, he loosened up on the podcast like, like having a podcast with Joey. Like, you forget. You forget like what that dude is. I don't what a special unicorn he really

5 (34m 36s):
Is. I told I I've said this, this is great.

2 (34m 38s):
He's the unicorn. Like there's no one even remotely like him.

5 (34m 43s):
He was there when Ari drugged me. He came and said, my life. He came, he came. He, Jesus is

2 (34m 49s):
Just getting, getting dramatic. He stole

5 (34m 50s):
The stomach. No, no, no, no. I was having stole the other mile. No, he, no, this is the best Joey Diaz story. He goes, I call him up. I, I'm having a panic attack. I go, Joey, I already just drugged me. He's like, I'll be there in five cock. Okay. Walks through the house. He goes, Mrs. K don't come out back. Bad shit's happening out there.

4 (35m 6s):
Comes

5 (35m 6s):
Out, comes out. He goes, what's going on Cocksuckers? I go, Ari just drugged me. Oh Jesus. He goes, he goes, he goes, lemme see it. Ari pulls out the other Molly. Joey takes it, eats it, and goes, we're all seeing the devil's dick tonight. Cocksucker. No one's dying on my watch. If you die, I die. We're all dying. He's the fucking best.

2 (35m 25s):
We're all seeing the devil's dick tonight.

5 (35m 28s):
He's the best.

4 (35m 31s):
Oh

2 (35m 31s):
Jesus. He's the funniest human being

5 (35m 32s):
Ever met. I helps with Joey in a heartbeat.

2 (35m 34s):
Yeah. Well I think that's one of the ways to do it. I think a comedy

3 (35m 37s):
Condo

2 (35m 38s):
Make it. No, I'm legitimately thinking about that. I've been thinking about that anyway because I've been thinking about doing a studio in downtown Austin with a view. 'cause there's like apartments that have a view. And if you could do a studio in an apartment out there, you could have nighttime podcast right after doing a comedy.

5 (35m 54s):
Drunk Cast.

2 (35m 54s):
Drunk cast. So you do a show at the comedy just like we used to do at the Ice House. I know. Yeah. You do a show show at the mothership and then go straight up to the condo, which is like three minutes away. I

5 (36m 5s):
Should do that, dude. Im gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna

2 (36m 6s):
Makes sense. Right. You should do that.

5 (36m 7s):
I'm gonna problem solve this. And and after doing now I think seven sets in this couple days at your club, I think that's a horrible idea. The amount of freedom that is at your club, the amount of free speech at your club, it'll come right out there is so dangerous. Yesterday I went up and I was like, wait, I didn't realize I can say anything I want. You should have

3 (36m 26s):
Seen his face light up. I was like, what are those, what are those bags on, on everybody's tables. Oh yeah.

5 (36m 30s):
Oh,

2 (36m 30s):
You didn't

5 (36m 30s):
Know. I didn't know. Oh yeah. Well I I was like, wow, Shane Gillis is really taking some chances

3 (36m 36s):
About how Communism's

5 (36m 37s):
Good. Yeah.

2 (36m 39s):
Yeah. Whole

5 (36m 39s):
Pot was a God. And so I got up, I was, I was hosting and then did an hour at the end of the sh Well we did like three hours at the end of the show. It's a long time together, but wild shit. And, but I didn't realize you can say whatever you want. You really can just take chances. Yeah. So I felt like I wasn't doing my due diligence as a comic. So I wrote the worst joke I could think of, like just insider joke. Just like a, I was just, and I and it was, and it did well. And I was like, fuck, this is crazy. You wanna take that

4 (37m 7s):
Energy up to that studio and do

5 (37m 9s):
A podcast and then, and then I get off your thing and I'm, I'm talking wild. And then I go up to yours and I'm like, you know, what about Hitler? Here's the deal. His dad wasn't a bad guy. He came from good people. He came because he was a beekeeper. You know that Joe? You interviewed a beekeeper?

2 (37m 22s):
I did interview a beekeeper. I basically interviewed almost every walk of life, I think. Yeah.

4 (37m 28s):
Yeah. How many, how many episodes have

2 (37m 30s):
You done now? 2000. Wow. What? Wow. 2093. Yeah. And then there's the Fight Companions, which is like a hundred. And how many of those, there's

8 (37m 39s):
Probably 60 to 70 of those in a hundred. One of those 53 MMA

2 (37m 43s):
Shows. Yeah. So that's another 200.

5 (37m 46s):
What's what's your worst one?

2 (37m 47s):
I don't think I have a lot of bad

5 (37m 49s):
Ones. Oh, wow. So bad. We can go around and nail our stinkers. Yeah.

2 (37m 53s):
The early ones definitely. I sucked at it.

5 (37m 55s):
No, you didn't. That was, that was when it was wild. It was wild.

2 (37m 58s):
I mean was so long. and I mean. You just, but if you're having conversations with people, you're not good at like facilitating the conversation. Especially if you're talking to a scientist and you're trying to get as much information into as many people's minds as possible. It's, if there's any confusion about what they're saying, you have to know when to interrupt them or when to lay back or when to, you gotta bookmark like a thought. Like don don't wanna interrupt. I gotta bookmark this because I gotta understand what do you mean exactly by

3 (38m 24s):
That? Yeah, you're good. You're good at saying that. Wait, wait. That wasn't clear to me. Can you say that? Yeah. Like, make that clear to me. I'm not sure.

2 (38m 29s):
You can't pretend you understand something if you don't. You know, you, you have to, you have to just like, you're almost like a, like a cattle herder a little bit Yeah. For the conversation. You're just kind of trying to keep the conversation, you're trying to let it flow as much as possible. But you're also trying to, like, you have to interact with it. Like, so you have to figure out like, what am I not absorbing about this? Do

4 (38m 52s):
You feel like there's somebody looking back that you understood the least? In other words, you were like, fuck, I don't get what is going on no matter how hard I trust

2 (38m 60s):
Simulation theory is the big one because I, I had this conversation with what, what did, what was that gentleman remember we had a, he was,

5 (39m 11s):
I was hoping it was a subject I'd understand s like swimming.

2 (39m 16s):
It's about probability theory. Probability theory. Yeah. So what his argument was, was like simulation theory. Nick Bo, that, that's it. Thank you. Thought he's brilliant, brilliant guy. But when, when we're having this conversation he was in, he was talking about simulation theory and saying that simulation theory, the idea that this whole thing we're experiencing is just a simulation because of probability theory, because of the probability of extraterrestrial civilizations. Just given the amount of planets that are out there, the amount of time that has gone on, this is an inevitable thing that's going to happen. And that it's probably already

4 (39m 54s):
Happened. That it's, it's probable that this is a simulation.

2 (39m 56s):
If it's not, it's going to happen. and it probably already has. Hmm. The idea through that we're the first run of a

5 (40m 3s):
Billion runs is

2 (40m 4s):
If you're a real expert, salute,

5 (40m 6s):
Finish it.

2 (40m 7s):
I know I'm butchering this, but the, the, I believe the concept in layman's terms is that given the sheer number of planets that probably have intelligent life and given the amount of time, if they can develop technology to the point where we have, and then further on to the point where you literally create some sort of a simulation that all time and all experiences exist in, and that this was something that was possible through technology eventually. Oh. And if you look at all these planets and you look at the direction that human beings are going, you look at how far our technologies progressed in a relatively short period of time. It's inevitable. Give it a thousand years, 10,000 years from now, if we don't blow the earth up, we will have a simulation theory that's indiscernible from the reality you're experiencing right now.

2 (40m 58s):
And that may be how life is experienced sometime in the future when we integrate with computers. Wow. That might be like one step into that integration. Wow. So yeah. Having that conversation Yeah. Is like what

4 (41m 13s):
That also gives you, I think you might have a better perspective than people when you try to, when you really break down how brilliant some people are like Yeah. Just scale. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. Like, we're all of like moderate intelligence and you go like, ah, you can understand these things. Like I can have this conversation with you. No, no. And then, you know, you, you p you meet people who are notably not there. And then people who are look at you like existing on Yeah. Like a you a child. Yeah. Yeah. And you go, wow. Those people are really operating on another wavelength. Right. Almost like who likes them?

2 (41m 50s):
It's just like athletes

4 (41m 52s):
Athletic. I was about to say it's like athletic ability. Yeah. There's some people who you go, holy shit. Yeah. You have a 40 inch vertical.

2 (41m 57s):
Yeah. Like just dunk it. Yeah. Like what, what what? There's, there's some people that are just I mean, we've all met guys that don't even work out and they're just ridiculously strong. Yeah. They just have superior genetics. Thank you. You know, there's, there's a lot of folks like that, that are just country strong.

4 (42m 11s):
The guy that will do the, the tomahawk dunk in jeans and you're like, what? Fuck. Fucked

2 (42m 15s):
Up. and it doesn't even work out. Like, fuck

5 (42m 18s):
I know Cam Hill, cam Hans's children run marathons in jeans. Yeah. They're different. They're different people. Yeah.

2 (42m 26s):
And hiss other sons of Ranger. Yeah. They're Yeah. I mean there's with different Yeah. Different humans

4 (42m 31s):
That, that d one body where you're like, oh this is diff

2 (42m 34s):
This is different. Well Cam's dad was a, an athlete too. Really? Yeah.

5 (42m 37s):
Hardcore runner. His book is amazing. Yeah.

2 (42m 40s):
I think Cam's, wasn't he a, a jumper? I What did he do? He, he was

4 (42m 44s):
Cam's so modesty.

2 (42m 45s):
He was like a very high level athlete. His father

4 (42m 48s):
Was Cam's modest as shit

2 (42m 49s):
About, he's so modest.

4 (42m 50s):
He's like, you're like, how the fuck? He like, well, you know, you just gotta,

2 (42m 53s):
You know what, man, that guy is always tired.

4 (42m 56s):
Is he? He's so tired. So fall

2 (42m 58s):
Asleep at 10 table. He but I mean, that's why he's like so chill. Yeah. He's conserving energy knows. Run 18 miles in in

4 (43m 4s):
The morning. He sleeps like a baby though. Huh? I

2 (43m 6s):
Bet he sleeps like a brick

5 (43m 7s):
And I think he's Christian. So then he doesn't He is worry about death. Masturbate. I could go to heaven. Yeah. His shoes.

Cam's shoe (43m 14s):
Have you run with his shoes? Oh, we do Over here. Those shoes are great, Dude. I I, I wanted to put a toast out or a post out today. 'cause they're that good. Oh, They're, they're excellent. He, He Look cool Own brand shoes. So Cam was sponsored for a long time by Under Armour and then he went for a second, tried out Solomon and then he said, fuck it. I'm just gonna make my, I think he has his own clothing brand, but he's doing his very own shoe. And when you get a motherfucker that can run like he does, who develops technology and the shit that makes him comfortable. Yeah. This shoe is amazing. These bo laces Keep your heel in place. Blood splattered on it. Yeah. That's It's blood. You could say it's mud, but it's red. Shut the fuck up. You know what that is? I love that Tom's pouring a drink. They're dope. This is the Tom I Love. They're dope sneakers and they're super comfortable. They're amazing. The thing about, so the thing about plantar fasciitis and a lot of people have is your foot moves around in your shoe laces do that. But with Cam's shoe, those boa things lock your heel in. And I've been running every single day. No plantar fasciitis and it's, they're very fucking comfortable. Yeah, they're great. You know, I think plantar fasciitis probably is a lot about foot strength and foot endurance, isn't it?

2 (44m 19s):
I used to have

4 (44m 20s):
It. I think so.

2 (44m 21s):
Like, you just go too far.

4 (44m 22s):
Everybody also, like the PTs will tell you that a lot of that originates from your big toes movement though. Oh really? But if you start, if you start to, because you can feel planter faite is starting a lot of times you're like, oh, this is starting to get uncomfortable. Yeah. It's not full blown in the mornings. And they's they'll tell you to train your big toe Whoa. To work on strength with your big toe people

3 (44m 43s):
Move to New York at it. 'cause you're walking constantly. Yeah.

4 (44m 46s):
You guys walk so much and then

3 (44m 47s):
It just like, what the fuck's in my heel?

5 (44m 49s):
Do you remember when you told me to get rolfed for my plantar fasciitis? Yeah.

3 (44m 52s):
What is that? When you come out of a dude's asshole? Hey,

5 (44m 55s):
No, that's,

2 (44m 55s):
That's, that's Naked Martin don't show going onto the internet. This

5 (45m 0s):
Is felting. The

2 (45m 1s):
Whole world's gonna listen to show. Do you know

4 (45m 3s):
How many fucking

2 (45m 4s):

4 (45m 19s):
That's the only fans I'm signing

2 (45m 20s):
Up. That guy ate his own shit Covered and cu and we watched, he

3 (45m 22s):
Didn't even pause

4 (45m 23s):
And he smiled and,

2 (45m 24s):
And he smiled. Thumbs up is great. Who hosted Fear Factor for six years. I almost threw up, got sick from watching that scream.

5 (45m 31s):
We're so excited for you to get your present. Yeah,

4 (45m 34s):
Yeah.

3 (45m 36s):
What's the, what's the present? Nothing.

5 (45m 38s):
You'll see, you'll see.

4 (45m 39s):
It'll be, it'll be in the group thread.

2 (45m 42s):
Yeah. That feeling of the was like,

4 (45m 46s):
Yeah,

2 (45m 46s):
That's such a horrible film. I was like,

5 (45m 48s):
That's the, you don't have a, you don't have a up up here thing.

2 (45m 51s):
Oh, I do. For real. He holds it. Yeah. Well, here's what's fascinating. I lost it when I was filming. Fear Factor. Nothing, nothing can make me Pew de

3 (45m 60s):
De

2 (46m 0s):
Desensitized. Desensitized. Completely desensitized before I was the kid in high school that like if you threw up in the hallway. I would throw up. I

5 (46m 7s):
Do. Right?

2 (46m 8s):
Like, you smell throw up. You're like,

3 (46m 10s):
That's a YMH rech. Yeah, yeah,

4 (46m 12s):
Yeah.

2 (46m 13s):
That's a

4 (46m 13s):
YMH rech. Yeah.

2 (46m 15s):
It's what? It's just, I, I think that's evolutionary. I think that when you smell to catch you away, smell throw up. No, no, no. It's letting you know that someone around you has consumed something that's bad. Yeah. Oh, and that you should purge too, right. Immediately. So it's, yeah. So it's, it's like a survival. It's protecting

4 (46m 34s):
You instinct. Yeah.

2 (46m 34s):
Yeah. It's a protective, it's not a weakness to want to throw up when you smell throw up. It's actually a strength. So

5 (46m 39s):
What happens when people cry and I cry too.

2 (46m 42s):
That's good too. Because you're commiserating. You're showing you're a good person. I

5 (46m 45s):
Cry so much. Yeah,

2 (46m 46s):
You're a

3 (46m 46s):
Sweetheart. Really? 'cause you switched to weed more.

5 (46m 49s):
Yeah. Well, weed weed is really beautiful. Weed will get to cry. It, it, it allows you to appreciate.

4 (46m 54s):
You are an emotional guy though.

5 (46m 55s):
Grow tits. I get, I cried the other day on our podcast. You

4 (46m 57s):
Did?

2 (46m 57s):
He's grown tits. Nobody

3 (46m 59s):
Cries more on podcasts than not me anymore.

5 (47m 0s):
He cries a lot. I cry. I cry a lot. I regret a couple cries. Schultzes. I regret that one.

3 (47m 6s):
You cried on Schultz's podcast. Of course.

2 (47m 7s):
What'd you cry about?

5 (47m 8s):
Fucking nothing. Bambi No. Was tough. No, he fucked me up.

2 (47m 13s):
Park you was tough.

5 (47m 14s):
No. Marketing. I think you're gonna say marketing. Marketing. No. He brought out a clown and some balloons and it fucking fucked me

2 (47m 21s):
Up A clown. And balloons made you cry. No, no,

5 (47m 23s):
No, no, no, no. It gave me a panic attack. What? and I was, yeah, don don't like clowns. You were shaking. Now I'm just fucking looking

2 (47m 28s):
Over my shoulder. Hold the fuck on.

3 (47m 30s):
Hold the fuck. That's my favorite show, by the way. What? Hold the fuck. He, he lets it in. He lets it in. He's like, it's like the fuck. Are you talking about? Hold on. What? Yeah, for

5 (47m 42s):
Real. Schultz gave me the opportunity to not pr Don't, don't play it. Play Don't play it. Don't play it. There's no reason to play it. Okay.

2 (47m 47s):
No. You have a real issue with clowns.

3 (47m 50s):
And then you became one.

5 (47m 53s):
Technically. Isn't that crazy? Yeah. I, I have a real issue with clowns and a, and a real, real issue with balloons. Like, if I smell balloons, I, I fucking freakout. It just, they freak me out. Wasn't there

2 (48m 5s):
A Jerry Lewis movie that was never released where he was like a clown in the Holocaust?

3 (48m 11s):
What? Oh, really? No. Well, life

2 (48m 14s):
Is beautiful. No, no. Patch Life. Beautiful. Is the clown patches Adams That was, no, it was Robin Williams.

5 (48m 19s):
Patch. Adams Patch

2 (48m 20s):
Adams. No, he was,

3 (48m 20s):
That was a hospital though.

5 (48m 21s):
He was a doctor who was a clown for kids.

3 (48m 23s):
Good morning, Neil. Well, who's that? The day that laughter cried. Yeah.

2 (48m 30s):
There was a there. That's what it, there is a Jerry Lewis movie. There's some weird Jerry Lewis movie that never got released.

3 (48m 38s):
Oh, that's weird.

2 (48m 39s):
Long buried Holocaust movie. The day the Clown cried May finally be viewable one year today.

3 (48m 46s):
So they they buried it.

2 (48m 47s):
Yeah, they buried it.

3 (48m 48s):
It was like on Bee. Like, what? This is this they must have been

2 (48m 52s):
Doing. It's gonna be be

3 (48m 53s):
Available to view at one place. Hey,

5 (48m 55s):
Everybody get in the oven.

2 (48m 57s):
One of few people have seen even a rough cut of the film. Comedian, voiceover artist, Harry Shearer of The Simpsons told Spy magazines in 1992 that the movie is so drastically wrong. Its pathos and its comedy are so wildly misplaced that you could not in your fantasy of what it might be like and prove on what it really is. Oh my God. That's all you can say. This movie was so bad.

3 (49m 23s):
I wanna see it so bad though. They buried it forever. Holy shit. Oh wow.

2 (49m 26s):
They buried it forever. And when did this movie get released? 72. So this is a movie from 1972 that was so bad

3 (49m 33s):
That never saw the light. They put it

2 (49m 35s):
In a vault in the bottom of the earth.

5 (49m 37s):
I paid, I paid to buy it. I, I

3 (49m 39s):
Buy, I'd buy it. I wanna see it so bad. Even if it's bad. I wanna see it.

2 (49m 43s):
I wanna see it more than I wanna listen to that Wang album. That, that Martin Silla

3 (49m 48s):
Big JI was the other day made

5 (49m 50s):
Angry. Big J has it. What do you mean what Big J has it? Martin has it. Leg s He won all Legion sks. It's one of the most frustrating episodes to listen to because it's Legion of SKAs. And you have Martin Skrilly and Shane Gillis is grilling him. Yeah. And then, but you got Legion of SKAs being Legion of SKAs. Yeah. Right. They don't really care about the information. They just wanna fucking talk about whatever. Yeah. Cum and everything. But Martin Skrilly said, I have the album. You want it? And all of them are like, fuck yes. So

2 (50m 15s):
How'd he give it

3 (50m 16s):
To them Jay? The same way.

5 (50m 17s):
Vinyl player. Your thing

2 (50m 18s):
In what form?

5 (50m 19s):
Like just sent them an MP three

3 (50m 21s):
A vinyl. No, no, no. What? Oh,

2 (50m 22s):
So then it's out on the internet. No,

3 (50m 24s):
No,

5 (50m 24s):
No. Legion sks didn't, no, no one ever shared it.

2 (50m 27s):
Wait a minute. Well, so what's Martin doing with it?

3 (50m 29s):
He bought it. It

5 (50m 31s):
A vinyl, I gotta send everyone of the episode. It's one of the most fascinating episodes I've ever listened to. Is

2 (50m 34s):
It, have you listened

5 (50m 35s):
To it? No. I I don't have it. They have it.

3 (50m 37s):
He had some good information where he was like, you know what? He was like, got the thing for the aids. It's so interesting. And he goes, he's he's jacking the price. He goes, you know what? No one ever said, there's also a generic version of the same drug for $40 for 40 bucks. I dunno why everybody's mad at me. You can still get it. You just can't get the name brand thing. It's the

4 (51m 5s):

3 (51m 6s):
What does that mean? It's not finished.

2 (51m 7s):
I was Why so I'm so confused about generic drugs. My, my, that's

4 (51m 11s):
Hilarious. My brain just went to like, wait, is it without Rizza? Well,

3 (51m 15s):
Hey,

2 (51m 16s):
This is a real conversation, but this is a real conversation because with ai, they're gonna do that. Yeah. They're gonna make new versions of Wu-Tang songs. I keep, they already did it with Drake.

4 (51m 24s):
I think that the thing too is, you know how they go, oh, likeness. And, and, right. Yeah. Like the stars. Like, Hey, you know, I want to, this movie's without Tom, Tom Cruise will be like, no, you cannot use my likeness. I'm protecting it. That's like what some of this like labor union stuff is about protecting your, your image and likeness. Yes. But they're, I I just feel like there's, you know, there's just gonna be one of these offers to one of these people where they go, okay, go for it. Right.

3 (51m 51s):
$20 million. Go for it. Nicholas

4 (51m 53s):
Cage.

2 (51m 53s):
Nicholas Cage. Bruce. Bruce Willis has a neurological condition. Yes. I I

4 (51m 57s):
He's

2 (51m 57s):
Not doing well. I forget what it's called.

5 (51m 59s):
It's called Aphasia. Aphasia. I

4 (52m 0s):
Think I might have it. Yeah, you're right, you're right.

5 (52m 2s):
I talk about it non you just

2 (52m 3s):
Bring it back to yourself. of course. Which is here talking about

5 (52m 5s):
Per, I can't look at a post and not think about me.

2 (52m 8s):
He's, I could

3 (52m 9s):
Money.

2 (52m 10s):
So Bruce Willis

3 (52m 10s):
Sold Bruce seven.

2 (52m 11s):
Bruce Willis sold his likeliness likeness. So you can likeness. Sorry. You for the purpose of ai. He did. Yes.

4 (52m 22s):
Hmm.

3 (52m 22s):
Yeah.

2 (52m 23s):
All find out what is, I can say thank you, I mean, but in in his position, I mean he's, he can work incapable of making money anymore. No, he can't work. He he has a real issue. Yeah. He's

4 (52m 31s):
Act It's actually very advanced. And they think this is towards, we're at the close to the end. Oh my God.

5 (52m 35s):
Yeah. I follow his daughter to Lula.

2 (52m 38s):
So, no, Bruce Willis didn't sell his likeness to a deep fake company. Despite initial reports, the deep fake company does not own the rights to Bruce Willis like likeness. Partially because that's literally not possible. The company said Willis appeared in a recent advertisement through Deep Cake, which managed to create a digital twin of Willis that can appear in new content despite the actual Willis retiring from acting as a result of aphasia a brain disorder that hinders cognition and speech abilities. I like the position of my character Willis set of the process, according to the quote, deep, deep Cake website. It's a great opportunity for me to go back in time.

2 (53m 18s):
The Neural network was trained on content of diehard and fifth element. So my character is similar to the images of that time. Who, so it's young Bruce Willis doing ads.

5 (53m 31s):
I, I sent you guys, I sent you're guys.

4 (53m 33s):
That's what, right. That that is what they're saying.

5 (53m 34s):
Yeah. I sent you guys George Carlin's new special.

2 (53m 37s):
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's But hold on a second, but hold on a second. That seems like that is what we're saying. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

4 (53m 44s):
It feels like that. This is, and and also this is literal phase one of, phase one of the A-list celebrity. Yeah. Being like, you can use it for this. Sure. When

2 (53m 54s):
Barbara Streisand gets to be a certain age. Right, right. And Trump's president again, that fucking, she might say, you know what, for just million

3 (54m 0s):
Dollars,

2 (54m 0s):
Go for it with my young face. Exactly.

3 (54m 2s):
And also, what about the people who, it's not a major movie making it, it's just some YouTube account. What

2 (54m 7s):
Happens to tech people? You know, what happens to like James, James Cagney

4 (54m 10s):
To their, their estate goes Can

2 (54m 12s):
What if the estate decides to

4 (54m 14s):
The Marilyn Monroe estate?

2 (54m 15s):
Yeah. Charles Bronson sale and soap. Yeah.

8 (54m 17s):
This is the George Carlin one that came out a couple weeks ago.

2 (54m 19s):
Yeah. Yeah.

5 (54m 20s):
How many views?

8 (54m 21s):
It says change the cover focus under 500 K.

2 (54m 24s):
How many views?

5 (54m 24s):
It keeps getting pulled down Ghost.

2 (54m 26s):
But

5 (54m 27s):
It keeps getting pulled down. Yeah. Because George Carlin's daughter Kelly, I think keeps, doesn't want it up. What's

2 (54m 32s):
Was bring up? Oh, I disagree with that's this is,

8 (54m 35s):
It's put on a Oh, web, a YouTube account called Dudes Z. Yeah. Dudes. He says, I'm a comedy ai. I like, they wrote this as though dudes, he made it, if you will, when you look at what dudes he is, dudes Iss a accountant by Will

5 (54m 48s):
Saso. Oh, it's Will saso.

3 (54m 49s):
But they have an AI that

5 (54m 51s):
Will

2 (54m 52s):
Saso Wait a minute, wait a minute. That's where

8 (54m 53s):
It becomes like, how would will Saso have this super secret AI program?

5 (54m 58s):
Hold on. Just write it. Will Will Sasso has a podcast, if I'm not mistaken, where he has AI bring up the subjects of the podcast. And that's what they talk about. Theoretically, thinking this will based on research, be one of the best podcasts out there. Well,

2 (55m 11s):
There's a podcast on it. Look, click on that says George Crow resurrected. That's

8 (55m 15s):
What this is. So this, that's what I'm trying to say is like, when I was looking into like, what is this George Carlin thing? It's on this account, right. That they called dudes Z and they're saying like, dudes Z made this.

2 (55m 24s):
Oh, so they made it through

8 (55m 26s):
Ai. Yeah. It's most likely like that Kanye song we played with Tony, where someone wrote in the, in the, in the, like in the, how George Collin would write and then performed it all and then got George Carlin's voice to go over top of that. To

4 (55m 38s):
Rephrase. Well, it's like a version of his voice.

2 (55m 39s):
Right? Oh, wait a minute. So AI didn't write the jokes? I think so.

5 (55m 42s):
No, I heard a, I wrote the jokes.

8 (55m 44s):
That's a, that's tough. That's where it becomes very tough.

4 (55m 47s):
You're saying that he, that AI didn't write the jokes in

8 (55m 49s):
This case? I don't know. but it seems a lot more like the fake thing that, that the Drake song and the Kanye song where it's not a hundred percent done by ai. What you're hearing is like an AI doing a deep fake video. Like,

4 (56m 0s):
And who would write, who would write

8 (56m 1s):
It? The, in that case, it was the rapper who wrote the rap song. In this case, it's probably comedians who know how to write, like, called

3 (56m 7s):
On scs this week. They played AI versions of their standups to this, to the Soder Jay Lewis, Dave and, and one other guy, I forget. And they were like, here's your AI version of your standup. And they just played it for 'em. And they all broke it down. Geez.

4 (56m 22s):
How was it?

3 (56m 23s):
They said it was a lot of fun. It

5 (56m 24s):
It, it's hard to be

3 (56m 25s):
Worse. Yeah. Butterly. Yeah. It's hopefully it's not amazing

5 (56m 33s):
Joke

2 (56m 34s):
That bad. I

5 (56m 35s):
Feel like we're Lewis is like, can I use that?

2 (56m 38s):
I feel like we're joking around about the first rain shower that comes before the torrential flood that caused I

5 (56m 45s):
Gonna Middle

3 (56m 45s):
Fucking

5 (56m 46s):
Ark.

4 (56m 46s):
You're right. I think it's gonna get bad. I

3 (56m 48s):
Think

2 (56m 49s):
It's gonna be a new world. Like the world is gonna be built in a very hazy way.

4 (56m 55s):
All this stuff about ai, everybody, like, we all talk. It's scary. And you see, you know, I understand why writers were like, writer's Guild was like really concerned about this. Yeah. They should be. And they're, they're concerned by version one dude. Right. Like, this just started and this

3 (57m 10s):
Is teaching the next version,

4 (57m 11s):
First fucking iPhone. And you're like, this is wild.

2 (57m 14s):
Also, it's gonna get rid of a lot of shitty rider. That's

3 (57m 16s):
True. That's the thing. Could you stop stealing Copenhagen TV shows and fucking make something?

2 (57m 21s):
All those people keep making the same cop show over and over again. Get the fuck out doing

3 (57m 26s):
Mr. And Mrs. Smith,

4 (57m 27s):
Here's the thing. It'll replace, it'll replace a lot of low level basic shit,

5 (57m 32s):
And you'll lose a lot of great

4 (57m 33s):
One. Ones you still need your Christopher Nolan to write. Yeah. But

5 (57m 35s):
Christopher Nolan had to be a shitty writer first. A hundred percent. Yeah. You gotta be a shitty writer first to become Christopher Nolan.

2 (57m 40s):
Yes. Yeah. You gotta build, unless you're some wizard that comes outta the Charles

3 (57m 43s):
Goman. Charlie Colman. That's

4 (57m 45s):
Very rare.

5 (57m 45s):
Very rare. The only thing I think that would be beneficial is be great if I could do my podcast with AI and then type in, yo, can you take all the annoying parts of me out of there? Like when I talk over you or I talk like, like, I would love to

2 (57m 59s):
Laugh. How much does not talk over people? I, don. You don't need a fucking

5 (58m 2s):
Robot. It's kind of fucking tough.

2 (58m 3s):
You don't need a robot

4 (58m 4s):
To do it for. I finally, I told you, I, so Bert has this thing where anybody, anybody with any level of celebrity, he fucking geeks out. It does

3 (58m 15s):
So hard on it. It's so embarrassing.

4 (58m 17s):
Like a TikTok person. Oh,

3 (58m 18s):
That pissed

4 (58m 19s):
Off. He's like, I'm the biggest fan. Oh my God. I saw the video. Oh my God, I'm the biggest fan. I love you so much. I saw the thing. And then he goes, and then he waits to tell them about him. He's like, he tells me his resume.

2 (58m 29s):
But do you have imposter syndrome? of

5 (58m 31s):
Course, if You don't. I am curious why

2 (58m 33s):
I didn't say don. Don't. Okay.

5 (58m 35s):
Yeah. Yeah. Of course. I Of course

3 (58m 36s):
I

2 (58m 36s):
Why is it so aggressive?

3 (58m 37s):
Aggressive

2 (58m 38s):
Imposter? My, my answer is fairly calm, right?

5 (58m 41s):
No, but imposter syndrome is

2 (58m 42s):
Kind of, I was just trying to find out what he was feeling.

5 (58m 44s):
Imposter syndrome has been loaded as like a, as like a slur as like

2 (58m 48s):
I don't think it's a slur at all. I

5 (58m 49s):
Have it. It's a slur.

2 (58m 51s):
No, no, it's a slur. I think it's a hardcore No, no, no. I don't think

4 (58m 54s):
It's a sl. I think it comes and

2 (58m 54s):
Goes. I think imposter syndrome is a sign of an introspective person. Yeah. Who's trying to navigate a very Bazar situation. I think it's completely 100% natural and normal. And if you didn't have it again, like what you said, I would be curious

4 (59m 9s):
And don't you think it comes in waves? Like you, there's what you feel. Yeah, but what I, the whole reason I brought you up doing that. 'cause you're, you're ridiculous with it. Like you, I'm really bad. You do it to everyone.

5 (59m 20s):
I didn't do it to Joe. Oh, I did it to

4 (59m 22s):
Joe. But you told me You

2 (59m 23s):

I wanna play pool and I wanna get high, and then we can do the podcast. And you were very generous. You're like, cool. I remember you walked me in your door.

I'll show you the swing set. We'll get high. We got high. And then we did the podcast. And I was like, man, that is the, here's my thing is there's generous celebrities like Generous who give you their time. And they're, they don't, maybe they don't notice. And I was like, this guy's a real fucking guy. Like, he's cool as fuck.

5 (1h 0m 16s):
And then we did the podcast. I had a fucking blast. and I remember going home and going like, man, I, I, I don't wanna say this out loud, but I was like, I wanna be like that guy. Like, I wanna be like that guy. Like cool as fuck and real. I remember I little things in my life where I've pinpointed things in your life where I go, oh, I got a thing that Joe had. Your closet was a fucking mess. There were, there were dildos, or not dildos dildo, there was flashlights everywhere

2 (1h 0m 41s):
That your flashlight was a sponsor. We had, we would give flashlights away to early days.

4 (1h 0m 47s):
Hey, do you wanna fuck this? When you go home and

2 (1h 0m 49s):
You, you're be like, Hey, like a pussy. It feels great.

5 (1h 0m 53s):
But I remember

2 (1h 0m 53s):
They gave us a fucking, I had a perverts box. Yeah. I was like a, a large, a large box. Like a, like the washing. That's how far this has come.

5 (1h 1m 2s):
I got the Alien butthole, I got the Alien Butthole, the blue one. But, but you, I remember you had so much stuff in there, and you had this generosity. You go, yeah, grab whatever you want, man. It's all stuff from people that want me to check it out. and I, remember I took a bunch of vitamins. I like grabbed shit. I was, I was, I wasn't poor, but I, I was like, free stuff. and I grabbed a bunch of shit. Went home. And I was like, but the, I look at life and when you talk about imposter syndrome, I highlight, we talked about this the other day. I highlight cool people and I kind of wanna be like them because I go, man, I wanna be a better person. You know, like,

4 (1h 1m 34s):
But he does this thing where he's like, I met the lead singer of, you know, Wilco. I humiliated myself. I

3 (1h 1m 40s):
Humiliated myself.

5 (1h 1m 42s):
I humiliated myself. I humiliated myself.

4 (1h 1m 45s):
He just tells him how much he loves that. And then he's like, have you seen my stuff, dude? But

5 (1h 1m 49s):
He, me, he tells me I know with George. RR Martin. Oh yeah.

4 (1h 1m 52s):

George R. Martin.

3 (1h 1m 54s):
How did be him met at Buffet?

4 (1h 2m 0s):
That was good. It was really good. What

2 (1h 2m 2s):
Is that

3 (1h 2m 2s):
One? It's when a bunch of foods out and you can just take as much as you want. but it loves, he's on a website. He is an app. Buffets near me.com.

5 (1h 2m 9s):
I saw him at a Grateful Dead concert.

3 (1h 2m 11s):
Oh really? Yeah. That's

5 (1h 2m 12s):
Cool. and I, I clocked him like three times. Three times. Thursday night, Friday night, Saturday night he went. And then Sunday night here, there's that sauce. Sunday night. I fucking, I couldn't control myself, man. I was a junkie. I was like the way a pedophile must feel when he sees kids riding

4 (1h 2m 29s):
Bike. The best part is that Bert tells him, you know, I'm Shut up,

5 (1h 2m 33s):
Shut

4 (1h 2m 33s):
Up, shut

5 (1h 2m 34s):

Shut the fuck up, George.

5 (1h 2m 36s):
Stop. Stop. George

4 (1h 2m 37s):
Reveals things about the show that like nobody knows. And then when they leave Leanne's like, can you believe he told you all that? And he's like, told us what? He's like, well, he told you all like those insights, like secrets about Game of Thrones. And he's like, what secrets? And he's like, I just wasn't listening. 'cause I was, I wanted to talk. So

5 (1h 2m 54s):
Like a cokehead,

4 (1h 2m 55s):
He was just waiting to talk.

5 (1h 2m 57s):
He told me secrets about writing.

2 (1h 2m 60s):
You just embrace this aspect of yourself. It seems, didn't like it. You don't like it. It makes you angry when it comes out. You get upset at yourself, but yet you also embrace it.

5 (1h 3m 11s):
It's so, so gross though. It's so gross.

2 (1h 3m 14s):
You're playing, you're playing tic-tac toe against yourself in your own

4 (1h 3m 18s):
Head. It's funny. But here's the thing I wanted to confess to you. 'cause you go, you told me that you admire the way that I am around celebrities. I love it.

5 (1h 3m 26s):
I love it. I wanna beat that. You're, you're the guy in an orgy. You're the guy in the porn who's jerking off before he fucks her. I'm the guy in the porn going,

2 (1h 3m 33s):
I got three minutes. Give the worst analogy. Literally. That's a tough one ever. That one makes no sense. Is like, no one listened to that was like, yeah,

4 (1h 3m 41s):
I get it. I get it.

2 (1h 3m 42s):
That's good call. Good call.

4 (1h 3m 44s):
But here's the thing. What I told him was the truth, which was that I would say 90% of the time when I meet a famous person, I don't care that I'm meeting them. Right. In other words, like they just, I'm just like, yeah, alright. What's up? How you doing? So it looks like I'm being cool or aloof, but I just don't give a shit. Really.

5 (1h 4m 2s):
Genuinely does not care. I just don't care. He really does. Right?

4 (1h 4m 5s):
Because if you go like, Hey, this is the guy from this show. I'm like, what's up man?

5 (1h 4m 8s):
Anytime I've ever met a famous person, I text Tommy immediately and go, guess what? I just met. and I sent him a picture. And then, and then Tommy has hung out, legit as friends with Brad Pitt and Jason Momoa and didn't fucking tell me. And then I go, why wouldn't you tell me this immediately? And he goes, don, don't know. I didn't think about it. It

4 (1h 4m 25s):
Just didn't really. But then he goes, well what would it take? And I'm like, don, don't know. And then I text you last night. I go, I guess it's Snoop Dogg. Because I fucking went into his, we were on Kimmel and I went into his dressing room and I was like, I'm going FI guess I'm going, bur I did my version of Burke. Wow. I was like, I was like, it's so admirable that your career has lasted.

2 (1h 4m 47s):
You didn. I did. I You didn't

5 (1h 4m 50s):
Suck. That's fucking

2 (1h 4m 51s):
Great's. A tough one's a tough one. He's so nice. He's so nice.

4 (1h 4m 54s):
And I. All I did was I was like, I couldn't believe I'm on with him. I met him first First of all he told me, he was like, it's Good to see you again. I was like, we've never met. He thought you were me. And then I went back into his dressing room and I was just like, it was great to be on the show with you and I. I had to tell him. I was like, you know, it's just crazy to me that I bought your album. I, I bought in 93 tape. The, the year before in 92 was a a, a deep cover. I bought that. And you're still like, you're still Snoop. It's fucking, it's crazy. It's 30 fucking whatever years.

2 (1h 5m 24s):
Yeah. He's got the best longevity of any and you know,

4 (1h 5m 27s):
And so I go, I just, I just admire that like so much. And then he, like he said, you know, he says everything cool.

5 (1h 5m 32s):
Yeah. Wait, probably guess. Try to guess I'm shut

2 (1h 5m 35s):
The fuck up. Jesus Christ. I know where this is going talk.

4 (1h 5m 39s):
He goes, let me get a flick with you. and I go, oh, that means picture. Like I had to let get a flick with you. and I was like, yeah. So he asked for the photo and then I was like, yeah, this is I mean. He goes, yeah, I wanna be a movie star too. and I'm like, I'm not in any movie.

5 (1h 5m 57s):
You were in a very big movie with Mark Walburn. That's bro.

2 (1h 5m 59s):
Sure. Do you know how high he is? All day long? Do you know how high he was there? Snoop lives in an alternative dimension. Yeah. and it really is. It's not where we are.

4 (1h 6m 8s):
It's very cool to be, 'cause I know he's been on the podcast. But like to be around someone and be around other people who you're like, dude, everyone, every age group, every generation loves him. Everybody

3 (1h 6m 18s):
Just loves him. Sesame Street.

5 (1h 6m 39s):
I lived with Snoop for three a month. We lived in a hotel together. Wow. We were across the hall. and I worked with him every day. But, but I have to say, and you know this, I was really nervous about meeting Snoop. 'cause I can overwhelm people sometimes. Like I'll just, I have a right wide, large weight. Get that

2 (1h 6m 55s):
Self-awareness. That's advanced. He does have It still does. That's advanced, right?

5 (1h 6m 59s):
I'm trying. But I said to Tommy, can you tell me how to meet Snoop? 'cause like, I know how you do it. You do it cool. Tell me how to do it. Cool. Because I wanna be friends with him. Hey,

2 (1h 7m 8s):
Whatever. You know, hide

5 (1h 7m 9s):
Stuff. Did I don did you? Yeah. Yeah. And you said, and you said, I like you, Snoop will like you be yourself. So I was myself. And of course I fucking lost my goddamn shit. And Snoop stopped. Snoop stopped. And real quick, like in the middle of me being me, he just FaceTimes Red Grant. And he goes, Hey, you know this guy? And he flips it around and I go and Red goes, he's cool. And he goes, all right, cool. And he's like, you're cool. It is me and Snoop FaceTiming with Dave Chappelle and Don Rollins. Ah. But that was the night we got high. And fucking Snoop's the best man.

2 (1h 7m 45s):
Fucking best. So you, you got him to the point where he was like, maybe I don't want to be in this conversation. He had, he

5 (1h 7m 49s):
Had to check my, my credibility.

4 (1h 7m 50s):
He checked him.

5 (1h 7m 51s):
He had to check my credibility credits. Yeah. We were talking about Cat Williams and I was talking about Pimp Pimp Pimp

4 (1h 7m 57s):
Chronicles

5 (1h 7m 58s):
Chronicles. And then I was, and then it's embarrassing. It's embarrassing. But I knew that Snoop knew Red and I knew that if I brought up Red, Snoop would think maybe. Okay. He might know people I know how smart. But then immediately Snoop called me on my shit and in the middle of my story, just FaceTime red, you know him. And then Red's like, yeah, he's great. I love

2 (1h 8m 19s):
Bird. Yeah. But haven't you ever had conversations with people where you know, you don't know them and they pretend they know you all time. and I also bring up people that supposedly they know that

The

2 (1h 9m 12s):
Weird gonna put you under and stick his dick in your

4 (1h 9m 13s):
Mouth. Think the weird thing about the Joe connection is people being like, can you give this to Joe? Oh, I get that all the time. That's the thing I get the most when I'm like, huh, God damn. They're like, I wrote this. Can you give this to him? I'm

3 (1h 9m 25s):
Like, what is it? Another manifesto? Yeah, sure.

4 (1h 9m 27s):
I'll definitely, if the

4 (1h 9m 32s):
Or you get the scariest is

Ever seen writing on writing? Yeah. What do you mean's that's schizophrenic. Schizophrenic tell tales. Schizophrenia. Writing on top of writing. What do you mean?

3 (1h 9m 50s):
On top of writing? So

Like you write, so you write something and then write writing over,

4 (1h 9m 52s):
Write on top of it. So like it's, it's it's, you can't read it. It's alien. Yeah. Yeah. And then they'll be like, check this out. And so you immediately, you're just like, oh yeah, no, this is good.

3 (1h 10m 2s):
I'll get this

4 (1h 10m 3s):
To 'em. Oh yeah, this is really good. Just

Him. A hard time. Ari Ari changed. Ari changed the scope Comedy. I'm in the middle of, of giving

2 (1h 10m 50s):
Him a hard time at Bird's cock pocket.

5 (1h 10m 52s):
Alright. You know what?

2 (1h 10m 53s):
Fuck you. Ari changed the scope of comedy.

3 (1h 10m 55s):
He did. I did. I united the scenes. You did

5 (1h 10m 57s):
United

2 (1h 10m 57s):
The scenes. Well, you

5 (1h 10m 58s):
Would not, you would not know Andrew Schultz without Ari.

2 (1h 11m 3s):
You

5 (1h 11m 3s):
Would not know Chris to Stefano. Is that a rosary? You might, you may not know. I found on the tape Tim di without Ari branching

2 (1h 11m 9s):
Ari. No. I reached out to Tim Di

3 (1h 11m 10s):
No, I showed you a tweet of his and you're like, that's

2 (1h 11m 12s):
Good. Who last two you? Well no doubt you'd 100% introduced me to very funny comedians.

5 (1h 11m 18s):
Hold on. He's very, he's very Joe You don not know the back tweets. We back texts we have when we want to introduce you to people. Why? Because because you are the biggest You don't like media brand in the world. Don't like

3 (1h 11m 31s):
What recommendations? You don't. I

2 (1h 11m 32s):
It's not

3 (1h 11m 33s):
True. You're like, I'll find it on my own. And so it's like fair.

2 (1h 11m 35s):
Fair. Well I do like to find as many things organically as

4 (1h 11m 38s):
Possible. Yeah. I recommended Brian Simpson.

2 (1h 11m 39s):
Yeah, you definitely did. Yeah.

5 (1h 11m 41s):
He's the shit, shit. Well, Tommy's recommendations are different than me and Ari's. We

3 (1h 11m 43s):
Recommended Shane Gillis for a year half.

5 (1h 11m 45s):
How long did we text back and forth Ari? One time I this guy not

3 (1h 11m 48s):
Taking this guy.

5 (1h 11m 49s):
And we're like, and we're like, yo, we gotta send him, send him the Toyota Isis. And then, and then Ari's like, I'll send it. You reply and be like, how fucking funny is this Ari? Yep.

2 (1h 11m 58s):
Listen, I get to things. Oh

3 (1h 12m 0s):
My God. You're right. I

5 (1h 12m 1s):
Get,

2 (1h 12m 2s):
I get to things a perfect amount of time.

5 (1h 12m 4s):
You do. No, you do

2 (1h 12m 5s):
Have to follow. It's too overwhelming. The nu the the wave that comes at me is too overwhelming. So what I do is I just do my best to just stay present. Think about what I want to talk. It's

4 (1h 12m 17s):
A lot of information

3 (1h 12m 18s):
Coming in. It's actually freeing. 'cause people are like, can you get me on Joe's podcast? I was like, he's not gonna listen to me. So no, I there's no point.

5 (1h 12m 23s):
The, I had a guy, I I, I'll say his name. Yeah. Guy reached out and wanted to be on Joe's podcast is so fucking bad. Are

2 (1h 12m 28s):
You sure you wanna say his name?

5 (1h 12m 29s):
Sure. don. Don't care. I love the guy. Why do it though? I love the guy. I don't need to, who is it? Theo Vaughn wanted to be on Joe's podcast before you would've ever like clocked him. And he was like, Hey man, can you help me get on Joe's? and I said to Theo, you know what? It's not good if I take you to him. Trust me. I go, trust me. You're so fucking funny. Joe's gonna find you. And when you do his podcast, you'll murder because Joe loves you. And, and, and Theo's first appearance on this podcast was a monster. And, and I trust you. If I had said like, Joe, can you take my buddy? You would've. You would've. And Theo's so Bazar that if you don't know who he is,

2 (1h 13m 3s):
I almost always take comic recommendations. Like if Ari recommends someone, I I almost always. 100% Adrian, you

5 (1h 13m 9s):
Do this Joe. Shaking

3 (1h 13m 10s):
Your Yeah. After two years,

5 (1h 13m 12s):
Joe, we love you. We love

3 (1h 13m 13s):
You Joe. No. Yeah. I don having

2 (1h 13m 14s):
Shane on. Is that what No, I do. I just don't. I I filter them in. When I see fit, I have scientists and athletes and authors and movie stars. There's this, there's this funnel of people and I have to keep it in the realm of what do I want to do? Yeah,

3 (1h 13m 35s):
True. I have to,

4 (1h 13m 36s):
I gotta ask you one, what, like, and there might not be one answer, but maybe there's a few. Have you ever had the most like, okay, I'll have 'em on. Like, like yeah, I'll have this person on and you're the most impressed, like most blown away by them.

3 (1h 13m 51s):
Like they were

4 (1h 13m 51s):
Great. Yeah. Like, were you like, and it doesn't have to be a comedian, it could be athlete, actor, a scientist where you're just like, holy shit, that was amazing and you weren't expecting it.

2 (1h 13m 60s):
You know what, I, if I mentioned one, I would do a disservice to so many of 'em. Sure. That have

4 (1h 14m 5s):
Happened that way. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

2 (1h 14m 7s):
There's there's so many, there's so many that people recommend to him.

3 (1h 14m 9s):
Henry I was like, holy

2 (1h 14m 10s):
Shit. Oh, he was amazing. I was like, he was done a couple of times. Guys should have him on. And that was like one of those ones where I was like, I worried that we wouldn't get along. Yeah. You know, because with Henry, he's very volatile. He Yeah. He's a, yeah, he's very volatile, but agro kinda, yeah. But like, in a weird way that I feel like I'm glad you struggled too. I feel like if you, if you confront him with any aggression, he comes back at you tenfold and feels justified. Ah. You know, like I was on a radio station once in Austin and they play, they, they had this conversation with him and they said something and it went that he interpreted what they said really badly. And then he went off on them and just fucking attacked them and was talking about how successful he is.

2 (1h 14m 54s):
And it was a weird conversation. And I was like, I love hearing those. But I know guys like that. I know guys like that from fighting. There's certain guys that you just have to massage your relationship with them. And I'm not saying that's Henry Rollins, but I I'm saying it's guys who get angry really quickly and like maybe misread the, I think you know how to navigate that really well though. And the dude First of all, he was like, Henry Rollins at one point in time was like a fucking serious powerlifter. Have you ever see like, I didn't know that. Yeah. When he did that video, I'm a liar. Do you ever see how jacked he is? Yes. Always. Jack, why? Why put up, put up? I'm a liar, but cause I'm a liar. But now, you know, he's like, he's like settled into his older years and he mostly does body weight stuff.

2 (1h 15m 35s):
We actually had a conversation about it, but he wrote an amazing essay. Jesus. No, that's not him. That's Franco Colombo. He sounded, bitch, what the fuck? No, there's a, there's a video, there's a music video. That's it. That's it. I was like, he had a pull outta of air. And you see how he's screaming in that, that snapshot? Yeah. That is, that's from the video. That's from the music video. The music video is, has nothing to do with this essay. But he wrote an essay about lifting weights. What is it called? Jamie? Something about Truth is in the Iron. It's fucking great. Really? Truth is in the iron's. A badass statement. The iron. That's what it is. Does he say it Here, give me volume.

2 (1h 16m 16s):
This is nice.

11 (1h 16m 17s):
The humiliation of teachers calling me garbage can and telling me I'd be mowing lawns for a living. Sounds like someone else.

2 (1h 16m 23s):
Real. This is a kid reading Henry Rollins. Oh book. That's what that is. Hump with the chump. Just get to the go, go to the essay itself. God, I like Henry Rollins because it's an essay that he, Henry Rollins, by the way, writes constantly. He writes for a bunch of different publications. He, he writes Essays all the time and he listens to a shit ton of fucking, a shit ton of music. Like on vinyl. He has this insane setup in his house where he is like $250,000 speakers. It's madness. Wow. He's just a music fiend. So this is it. I believe that by definition of definition. Oh, I believe that the definition of definition is reinvention.

2 (1h 17m 7s):
To not be like your parents, to not be like your friends, to be yourself completely. When I was young, I had no sense of myself. All I was was a product of all the fear and humiliation that I suffered. Fear of my parents, the humiliation of teachers calling me garbage can and telling me that I'd be mowing lawns for a living. And the very real terror of my fellow students. I was threatened and beaten up for the color of my skin and my size. I was skinny and clumsy. And when others would tease me, I didn't run home crying. Wondering why? I knew all too well. I was there to be antagonized in sports. I was laughed at a spazz. I was pretty good at boxing, but only because of the rage that filled my every waking moment made me wild and unpredictable.

2 (1h 17m 49s):
I thought with some strange fury. The other boys thought I was crazy. I hated myself all the time. As stupid as it seems now. I wanted to talk like them, dress like them, carry myself with the ease of knowing that I wasn't going to get pounded in the hallways between classes years past. and I learned to keep it all inside. I only talked to a few boys in my grade. Other losers. Some of them are to this day, the greatest people I've ever known. Hang out with a guy who has had his head flushed down a toilet a few times. Treat him with respect and you'll find a fateful friend forever. But even with friends, school sucked. Teachers gave me hard times. I can't read this forever. This is gonna boy shit

4 (1h 18m 29s):
A

2 (1h 18m 30s):
Lot. Yeah, that's a lot. Let's get to the weight part.

5 (1h 18m 32s):
Oh my God. Have you ever had your head flushed in the toilet?

2 (1h 18m 36s):
Me? Yeah.

4 (1h 18m 36s):
No.

5 (1h 18m 37s):
Okay. Have you Of course and really

4 (1h 18m 40s):
In high school. Yeah.

2 (1h 18m 41s):
I love how I know you brought Henry Rollins again back to you. Yeah.

5 (1h 18m 45s):
I prefer to work out alone. No, it's a pivotal moment in the thing is have you ever had been violated like that I mean that what what he's writing about is violation. Was there anything in the toilet? Yeah. No, no, no. It was, it was at Forest Hills baseball. I mean it, it it's being violated. You have to be held up by a group of boys and then they put your head in a toilet. Which flushed or not flushed. It's a violation. That's I don I mean it's a humiliate. I'm not bringing, I'm not bringing it back to me. I'm just saying like, that's a very fucking powerful thing. They, they were called sws right here through the years swirly.

4 (1h 19m 13s):
Yeah. Through the years I have combined meditation action and the iron into a single strength. I believe that when the body is strong, the mind thinks strong thoughts, time spent away from the iron makes my mind degenerate. I wallow in a thick depression. My body shuts down my mind. The iron is the best antidepressant I have ever found. There is no better way to fight weakness than with strength. Once the mind and body have been awakened to their true potential, it's impossible to turn back. The iron never lies to you.

5 (1h 19m 42s):
That's badass. Fucking

2 (1h 19m 43s):
Perfect. That's badass. That's perfect. That's a hundred percent true. I feel that. Yeah,

4 (1h 19m 48s):
That's, you embody that.

2 (1h 19m 49s):
Yeah. Yeah.

5 (1h 19m 50s):
But you were bullied as a kid.

2 (1h 19m 51s):
Oh yeah, for sure. Yeah. Yeah. I was little so I didn't like it. and I didn't also moved into like, new neighborhoods all the time. I moved into new neighborhoods like three or four times when I was a kid. So it was like, it was so every time I was the new guy and I wasn't a big guy and the dudes were fucking with me. I was like, damn, I gotta learn how to fight. Yeah. That was the, the a hundred percent my motivation. Like I didn't, I wasn't like a kid that looked for fights ever. I was just terrified. I was like, okay, I'm tired of this. What's the solution? Like I, I gotta learn martial arts, watch Bruce Lee movies. I'm like, all right. I don't wanna be like that guy. Is that physically possible? What

4 (1h 20m 28s):
About, 'cause what we were talking about right before was like asking people things. 'cause you've had so many fighters on like, you love MMA. Yeah. You and, and you. You're a great commentator. I think you're a great analyst. You break you, you really know so much about it. You like, it's, it's fun to talk to you like to learn. I think it's fun to learn. But do, have you ever had a fighter that, you know, because you give, you're, you're not like, you give honest takes on things. When you're watching something, you're like, this guy's ground game is not as strong. Or this guy's striking is what it is. Like you Yeah, yeah. You're honest about it. Has a fighter ever carried that like, comment and then come in here and been like, you know, I didn't really

2 (1h 21m 5s):
Like, no, not in

3 (1h 21m 6s):
Here. and I saw it once, I saw it once at dinner where he heath herring when he is like, Hey, you said some stuff about me, whatever. But just so you know, I was injured, but during that fight, I, I was, yeah. But I was nursing a knee injury. I know, just so you, you're aware of what going

2 (1h 21m 18s):
On. Said I have to comment on what's happening. Yeah. IIII would normal, like I always give, if someone's like, got an unusually bad performance, I will say I will, I will try to like give this kind of qualify

4 (1h 21m 34s):
It.

2 (1h 21m 34s):
You never know what's going on. Yeah. If you see a guy that carrying a little bit of extra weight give, like, sometimes you see a little bit of love handles, like, Hmm, that's weird.

4 (1h 21m 41s):
His camp, it maybe wasn't as strong.

2 (1h 21m 43s):
Yeah. There might have been something wrong. Yeah. And that's so fucking common. That's a, it's literally no fighter at a world class level goes into that octagon. A hundred percent. Wow. They just don't, they just don't. Someone's got a fucked up elbow, someone's neck kind of weird. Someone doesn't wanna wrestle their knee's bad, their ankle's fucked. They got their ankle taped. Why is his ankle taped? There's so many guys go in there with like real fucking injuries, man.

4 (1h 22m 9s):
But do they ever bring a host, like any hostility to a comment made? Like when you

2 (1h 22m 14s):
No, I've had conversations with guys, but I'm, over the years, I've learned to express as much respect as I have. You know, like sometimes you just comment in the moment like you would with friends. Like, oh, he's breaking, he's breaking. You know? But you have to be careful like how you say that when a guy is in a fight, if the guy's gonna watch it and he knows he's breaking and you just kind of compounding his awful moment.

4 (1h 22m 37s):
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because

2 (1h 22m 38s):
Guys break. Sure they do break, you know. But it's not my place to say that necessarily. It's, it is my place to comment on the technical aspects of how the exchange is going. Sure. If I see them folding. Yeah. If I see certain characteristics where they're not engaging, they're just moving in a defensive way and they seem to be looking for a way out.

3 (1h 22m 59s):
You know, Greg Jackson told me that he sees fighters accept that they're not gonna win a hundred percent. And then they're just, just fired not to get knocked out. Who

4 (1h 23m 6s):
Did we see exactly?

2 (1h 23m 7s):
A hundred

4 (1h 23m 7s):
Percent. Who was at the UFC Austin that like he was 40 and like, he's been fighting for like

2 (1h 23m 12s):
Bonil Dush.

4 (1h 23m 14s):
Man, that was

2 (1h 23m 14s):
Crazy. What the guy he fought though is a fucking assassin. He, he has one loss to Gamrat and he has one loss to Ismail Che who's the world champion. And by most people's eyes at least number one or number two pound for pound in the world. Oh, was that the, what are you showing me that I

4 (1h 23m 38s):
Was just looking stuff.

2 (1h 23m 40s):
So that guy, Armand Sian, he's a fucking assassin. And Beil Dus, who's a very good fighter at this stage of his life is, you know, he's, I don't know how old Beil is, but he, I think he's close to 40. Yeah. That's, he's got gray

4 (1h 23m 56s):
Hair. That was a na That was the thing that stood out that you're like, man, can you imagine doing this at 40?

2 (1h 24m 1s):
But he's also, he's also a very elite fight. Ben Beil. Dush is fucking elite. He's very good. Yeah. I mean. But the UFC is a clean sport right now with usada gone and now what is the new company called?

4 (1h 24m 19s):
Clean,

2 (1h 24m 20s):
Clean Sport. No.

3 (1h 24m 22s):
So what,

2 (1h 24m 24s):
So they, they still drug

4 (1h 24m 25s):
Test. So there is still a governing body

2 (1h 24m 27s):
Command. Yeah. And if you're gonna be 40 years old, you're fighting at a disadvantage. So the advantage would be that you know more. Right. Which is an advantage like

3 (1h 24m 36s):
Old Captain America,

2 (1h 24m 37s):
There's an advantage of knowing more, but it's not enough of an advantage to deal with people who also know a lot. Yeah. Yeah. And the young people, there's an acceleration that comes from watching things on YouTube and watching things streaming. The young people are way better than the people that are older now. Were when they were that young. Sure. Sure. It's, there's a, there's a one drug free sport,

4 (1h 24m 58s):
The guy company. But the guy, the guy he fought that the guy you were saying. Sorry, you kidding? Wasn't he like 22 or some shit?

2 (1h 25m 3s):
Yep. Yeah. He's world class. And he was world class when he was 20. And the fight with mache was, it was a very close decision. don don't remember if it was split, it might've been unanimous, but it was a super close decision. Imagine

4 (1h 25m 16s):
Why'd you bring

2 (1h 25m 16s):
Him up? So Bon Neil's only 34. Yeah. No way.

3 (1h 25m 19s):
Why'd you bring him up? Tom

2 (1h 25m 21s):
Bene is only 34. I'm sorry bene. It's your hair brother

3 (1h 25m 25s):
Ben.

2 (1h 25m 25s):
Neil's gonna be mad at me. No, Ben Neil's a very good guy. He's a very, very smart guy. He's gonna

3 (1h 25m 29s):
Take his walker over here and beat you with it.

2 (1h 25m 31s):
He's also El juujitsu I don

4 (1h 25m 34s):
Remember why I brought Bring it up? It was just, it was, we were talking about the fight. It just saying something. God damn,

2 (1h 25m 38s):
Why did I think he was

4 (1h 25m 39s):
40? It was just, I think that, I think at that, at that fight someone had said 40 and I was just like, that is insane.

2 (1h 25m 46s):
Oh, that's what it is.

4 (1h 25m 46s):
Like that's insane to be like, if, if that were true, can you imagine jumping in the like at 40 with a guy who's 21, 22. It's just, but

2 (1h 25m 56s):
Randy Couture was world class when he was 40. Yeah.

3 (1h 25m 58s):
Yeah. Heavyweights are different.

4 (1h 25m 60s):
Yeah. Randy Couture's badass.

2 (1h 26m 1s):
He was world class when he was 40. But also there was no USADA back then. Mm.

4 (1h 26m 6s):
So

5 (1h 26m 7s):
There's a few things. How do you measure, how do you measure

2 (1h 26m 10s):
I mean? Alistair Ovum isn't Alistair Ovum,

4 (1h 26m 13s):
Right?

2 (1h 26m 14s):
With usada? It is not the same thing. They didn't have, that's not what he paid

3 (1h 26m 17s):
For. Didn't, they didn't have any testing.

2 (1h 26m 19s):
It was a fucking intelligence test. He

4 (1h 26m 22s):
Looks like he's not,

2 (1h 26m 25s):
He's withered white. He also fought that night. He's 42. Could have been him. Oh yeah. Clay Gui. Is that

4 (1h 26m 30s):
Clay

2 (1h 26m 31s):
The wild man? Yeah. You're not talking about the guy who got knocked out. No, no.

4 (1h 26m 35s):
I'm talking about this too. That's

2 (1h 26m 36s):
Where our conversation confused. That's

4 (1h 26m 37s):
Where Confused No

2 (1h 26m 38s):
Clay is

3 (1h 26m 39s):
So why'd you bring him up? Because

4 (1h 26m 41s):
He was at that fight. He's

3 (1h 26m 41s):
Gorgeous. And you said, you said Joe said something about him or something like that. What whatcha talking about

4 (1h 26m 45s):
It was, I forget, I forget what the origin I've been drinking. I forget the origin. How,

5 (1h 26m 49s):
How do you measure when you are a legit fan of someone and you kinda want them to win? Yeah.

2 (1h 26m 54s):
You can't, you can't. Well that was a real problem with being sha when Shab would fight. Because I also knew that Sha I know when someone has one foot in and one foot out. 'cause I had one foot in and one foot out when I started doing standup. I was still fighting when I was doing standup. And I know when you're not 100% focused, that's a dangerous place to be. 'cause you can get overconfident and you think that you're still at the same level that you were at. If you're 100% all in, but you're not. Yeah, you're not, you're not the the, the people that are 100% all in on being world champion are not also thinking about, I'm gonna start this podcast and we're gonna go do a tour and do standup and now making more money doing podcasts that I was doing fighting.

2 (1h 27m 37s):
And you know, now they're taking the, the promotions away. I had more money from a Shaw had more money from ads on his shorts than he would get from his UFC paycheck. So I knew he was one foot in, one foot out. So with that situation, it's like, you gotta stop. Like I've seen this, you gotta stop. But some guys, you can't tell 'em to stop. It's like they have this thing in their head and they want to figure out how to get to where they used to be One more time. They think they can do it. They know they can.

5 (1h 28m 8s):
That

3 (1h 28m 8s):
Would standup. But I would, I would root for a guy though. I'd be like, come on, I'd like that would come out. That's

2 (1h 28m 13s):
Tony Ferguson. That's Tony Ferguson. Everybody roots for Tony talking. Everybody

4 (1h 28m 16s):
Loves

2 (1h 28m 16s):
Tony. Yeah. Everybody roots for Tony to go back to when he was the boogeyman. 'cause you know El Kakuy, when that fucking guy, he just seemed impenetrable. It didn't matter if you hurt him, you weren't gonna stop him. He was coming forward.

4 (1h 28m 29s):
He has a series of losses in a row now. Right.

2 (1h 28m 31s):
Well it was really all from that one knee injury that he got backstage. He tripped over wires and destroyed his knee. No, destroyed his knee.

4 (1h 28m 40s):
That's

3 (1h 28m 41s):
How Yeah. You gotta mitigate risk.

2 (1h 28m 43s):
He was, he was El Kakuy, he was the interim lightweight champion. He was supposed to fight Khabib Ner Nerov in, in Madison Square Garden.

4 (1h 28m 53s):
And he tripped over wires

2 (1h 28m 55s):
In the promo leading up to the show. He was doing one of those, you know, ESPN things or whatever. Yeah. And there was some wires on the ground. He didn't see him and he tripped on him

4 (1h 29m 4s):
And he wrecked his knee that way,

2 (1h 29m 5s):
Wrecked his knee, tore it apart, had to have surgery.

4 (1h 29m 9s):
That would be, that part would piss me off so much. Go ski. If that's the way. Yeah. That, that's how it happened.

2 (1h 29m 14s):
And then he comes back or like dunking a basketball, he beats Anthony Petti. Remember that

4 (1h 29m 19s):
Rib? That, that would bother me less.

2 (1h 29m 22s):
Are you a hundred percent now

4 (1h 29m 23s):
On the knee? Yes. And the arm? No. Really. Which is the opposite of what they tell you. Can you jerk off? They told me when they told me,

2 (1h 29m 29s):
You don't jerk off less handed. You fucking psycho. You don't fucking rookie.

4 (1h 29m 33s):
When they, when you're in the hospital, they, they point to your arm. Wait

2 (1h 29m 36s):
To turn that around quickly. They go, good volley.

4 (1h 29m 38s):
They go, this is not gonna be a problem. This is gonna be a problem. And you're like, oh, okay. 'cause then you think, oh,

2 (1h 29m 44s):
Okay, and now your knee's a hundred percent.

4 (1h 29m 45s):
A hundred percent. But I have nerve damage in my arm. So it, it might never, ever, ever be where what it was.

2 (1h 29m 53s):
Damn. Hmm. So where's it at now? Well,

4 (1h 29m 55s):
It's just that I, for life, it's fine. Like, like, you know, I can do anything from high level

2 (1h 30m 0s):
Athletics. Yeah.

4 (1h 30m 1s):
So with like heavy, like don don't know if I'll ever be able to lift anything heavy again because can you beat Bird of Tennis as external rotation? It's, it really is bad. But even when you're like, have a heavy weight in your hand. Well, First of all, I get wrist collapse at a certain weight. Oh. So like this hand will be fine and it at a certain weight, this list just, it'll collapse. Ooh. You know, and then you feel things all in the elbow area with heavy weight. So I can, I can, I don't know if I'll ever, and not that I need to. So that's the thing. It's like you go, don don't need to be a power lifter. Right. But it's still kind of, yeah. It sucks when you're in there and you're like, oh, my, my whole arm has like these crazy vibrations and pains going on with heavy weight.

4 (1h 30m 43s):
So you just have to like shift what you do.

2 (1h 30m 44s):
Yeah. That's why I stopped doing Juujitsu for a whole year. I had, I started getting these nerve pains in my fingers. Oh.

4 (1h 30m 51s):
If you push, if you push on my forearm, my whole hand will go numb.

2 (1h 30m 54s):
What? Yeah. Really? Well they took a nerve from here. Nerve thing is super

4 (1h 30m 59s):
Dangerous. They took it outta here. You know, I have no nerve here. What? Yeah, I have none. They took it out and they put it in here. Do

2 (1h 31m 4s):
You mean tendon?

4 (1h 31m 5s):
No, they took the nerve out. So what happens is they took your nerve out. They took the nerve out. Reconnect nerves. Yeah. It's, it was, it was a state of the art surgery at the time. The time. Wow. So when the guy did it, I was like, how many of these have you done? He goes, one. I go, oh no,

2 (1h 31m 17s):
My God. Oh my God.

4 (1h 31m 18s):
And he goes, oh my god, nerve. 'cause you have two nerves and two muscles here to let you pronate. So and so they take it out.

2 (1h 31m 24s):
Did you explain what was happening? That the fingers, the, the last fingers weren't coming back. This

4 (1h 31m 29s):
Light watch, they would go, They go, it was injury is in December, and in like, in like March, they do a nerve test and they go, everything is not firing. Like, are you, are you, how are you functioning? And I'm like, yeah. You know, and it, there were things that were notable. Like if I went to pick something up, you might not notice, right. But I would just like grab it and then grab, like, my hand didn't open all the way. So if you, you go like, go like this. I would go like this with my healthy hand. and I would go like this. Oh. And that was the most I could do. Mm. And they told me, they go, if you wait a year, if you wait a a year and the nerve doesn't fire and reconnect on its own, your body consumes a nodules.

4 (1h 32m 16s):
Oh. It just consumes them. It just, it's like, have you ever seen somebody who has like a hand that just doesn't work anymore?

2 (1h 32m 21s):
That's it.

4 (1h 32m 22s):
That's what that is. A lot of people, that's that nerve damage. Oh my God. So, so they go, if you elect to just wait it out, just know that where you are could be worse. Just where you are forever. Oh,

2 (1h 32m 32s):
Shit.

4 (1h 32m 33s):
And so when he told me that, he's like, or I could do this surgery. That's like, it's, it was, it was actually a Brazilian surgeon who came up with this idea, like, this process, this surgery. And he goes, it works, you know, a hundred percent confident in it. True ker surgery. And then he just,

12 (1h 32m 49s):
It's an enormous,

2 (1h 32m 50s):
When it starts to hurt, you turn your fucking card over to red

13 (1h 32m 59s):
More.

4 (1h 33m 2s):
No more knee. But then he did it. And dude, like, you know, I can, yeah. I go all the way. Yeah. and I can pick things up, but there's things where, so you'll think, you would think it's strength, but it's not strength. It's the nerve firing. Like, if I pick up something heavy, I could pick it up and with my right arm, pull it up, and my left arm is here. And you go, oh, I guess you're just not strong. It's not strength. It's that the nerve isn't firing. It's just not sending the signal. It won't tell it to go. It won't tell it to go all the way. Wow.

2 (1h 33m 28s):
Dude. In the lone loss in my career where I got T kd, I got hit with a left hook and I got hit with a left hook and my legs shut off.

4 (1h 33m 36s):
Totally shut off. It's

2 (1h 33m 38s):
The weirdest sensation of all time. Wow. I got hit with this hook, it hit my arm, my chin and my legs just stopped working. Just stopped working. I'm conscious. And my legs just stopped working. They just completely collapsed. And so the referee starts counting one, two, and I'm like, whoa. Totally new experience. Yeah. All my years of competing, never had that happen. Never had that. So then I stand up and I'm like, these things aren't working right. And then this dude's like throwing punches at me and they stop the fight. but it was a, it was a fascinating experience because it was like, it's not about heart and Will No, it's not about, they just stopped working.

4 (1h 34m 16s):
Haven't you had Zach bidder on

2 (1h 34m 17s):
Before? Yeah.

4 (1h 34m 18s):
Yeah. And he just did that thing where, you know, he's a elite, elite, ultra marathon runner. Yeah. And he was out on one of these like a hundred milers and at like 80 miles, he was like, I felt sick. I had to lay down. I tried to rest. He posted about it, you know, and he's like, my, my legs every, they just shut down. So he's like, I just had to, at a certain point he just goes, I'm tapping outta this one. and it wasn't like, you know, it's different than obviously getting hit, but his body just was like, enough. It,

2 (1h 34m 47s):
It's not from tire's enough. That's it. It's

4 (1h 34m 48s):
Just like, that's enough

2 (1h 34m 49s):
Not

4 (1h 34m 49s):
Happen. Yeah. That's kind of like, this is

2 (1h 34m 51s):
The wildest thing about these people that are pushing themselves. Like Zach Bitter does or David Goggins does. Is that like, inevitably they're gonna get damaged to that body. David has to. Oh no, he already,

5 (1h 35m 4s):
His

2 (1h 35m 4s):
Is bad. He shared it. No, he he shared it. He's, he shared it. He, he sent me videos of his leg where he takes his leg and he compresses his fingers around it. And the edema around his shin is so thick that his fingers are embedded in his shin. What? He had his knee severed. What? And, and then reconnected. He has no cartilage. He's bone on bone. Yeah. What's that gonna be like? It's 60 for that guy. The doctor's is, he's gonna get replacements. A hundred percent. His doctor looked at his knee, he said, I can't believe you can fucking walk on this. Nevermind. Run thousands of miles. Thousands. Yeah. That's his leg. Look at that. That's edema on his leg. That's from him just putting his fingers on his leg. And that's after one of multiple surgeries he's had.

2 (1h 35m 46s):
What

5 (1h 35m 47s):
Is edema? If You don't mind me asking. It's

2 (1h 35m 48s):
The swelling. It's like all this like fluid. It's, it's basically just Rip Chester fucking torn. Meanwhile, he's doing, he's an animal bro. He's like, don't be a bitch, bro. He's an animal. When he came to my podcast, he got there early. When I walked in, he was already doing Chin Up.

5 (1h 36m 2s):
He was,

2 (1h 36m 3s):
Yeah. When I first met him, we, I went into the gym, you know, the podcast starts at whatever it started out. and I, I get there and he comes in, he is

5 (1h 36m 9s):
Like, don't mind if

2 (1h 36m 10s):
I do. I I meet his wife, I meet some, you know, I, I go back and he's back there doing Chin Up with his shirt off.

5 (1h 36m 18s):
It's,

2 (1h 36m 19s):
I was like, there's no reason to rest. Why am I resting right here? There's a whole full gym. Can I use this gym? Let's go. Wow. He goes out there, he's doing Chin up. He's crazy. Chris, what a great way to maximize your time though. Yeah. He's, he's real. You just sit there like, you know, guess we're early, you know, whatcha gonna do? There's a gym right there.

5 (1h 36m 35s):
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's get some Most Look at his toes.

2 (1h 36m 38s):

5 (1h 36m 43s):
Oh,

2 (1h 36m 44s):
Come on. That's G's toe. Eat it. That's from running. He, he ran some insane amount of a hundred milers in like a short period of time.

5 (1h 36m 53s):
Can I tell you the most human thing about him is that he, he reads negative comments. Like when you see that he gets records them, he gets upset about them. He

2 (1h 37m 1s):
Listens to them when he runs. but

5 (1h 37m 3s):
It like, that's where I connect with the guy where I go like he would ever hate on David Goggins. Like, that guy's, listen, nothing but inspirational. You

2 (1h 37m 11s):
Gotta let that go. There's people that are gonna hate on every fucking thing that has ever existed. And it's not an honest perspective. It's flavored by their own inadequacies. That's you. A big part of it is flavored by their own fucking disastrous life.

5 (1h 37m 25s):
David Goggins is what I listen to when I, if I'm hungover, I go to the gym, I throw in David Goggins. They got a thing on him. Oh yeah. I'm gonna fucking throw one of those in too. One, one.

2 (1h 37m 34s):
I take a row three. This one's a six, I think a

5 (1h 37m 36s):
Six. Two rows. Six. No, six Rogue. Alright. Yeah.

You weren't encouraged to be spitting on set. Yeah. You had to gut it. Oh. So he would just swallow it. Oh, so he got accustomed. Fuck. Yeah. So Perry got accustomed to swallowing his own tobacco juice. I'm like, that's a fucking

3 (1h 39m 9s):
Best I'm doing. No weed, no coffee.

2 (1h 39m 11s):
Weed is essentially steroids for comedy.

3 (1h 39m 14s):
Weed is great. You're right. It is. Or it's a unique, it helps. It hurts you.

5 (1h 39m 18s):

3 (1h 39m 34s):
You should sit on it

5 (1h 39m 35s):
And you're like, fuck yeah. It's the coolest man.

3 (1h 39m 38s):
Oh, I never finished telling you this. So I, they say, do what do you want after your set at the Wilbur and I was like, I, I'm cool. Sometimes after I get off, I like a glass of scotch. and I finished the last time I was there. I was like, thank you. Goodnight. and I took one step down and she just hands me a glass of scotch. That's nice. And I was like, I've never been treated like this in my life. That's nice. It was so fucking fuck.

2 (1h 39m 57s):
Yeah, dude. That's thoughtful. Yeah. A nice glass of scotch after you just did what you needed to do. Like, whew.

It. The amount of deodorant I put on.

5 (1h 40m 27s):
No, no, no. I do think about you. When I put on deodorant though, I lost enough weight that I have an armpit again.

3 (1h 40m 35s):
Tried before a

5 (1h 40m 36s):
Gut. No, it's just, it was just fat. You couldn't feel the tendons in your, in your pack, in your back. What? So like, it's just a fold. It's not like an armpit.

3 (1h 40m 44s):
Yeah. And so now you're like, oh, he is gonna be jealous.

5 (1h 40m 46s):
No, no, no, no, no, no. I was thinking I a little buzz while I'll share it, but I was thinking, how cool is it that you've had moments in your career where everyone's like, fucking write that guy off. Oh yeah. And you're killing it and you're killing it. And then you, and then you start thinking

2 (1h 41m 2s):
That has to do with armpits.

5 (1h 41m 3s):
Well, no, no. Armpits thought of Ari and then I thought of Ari. I've been thinking about Ari All day because of what happened last night. Oh, okay. And so, and I thought I, you know, with what happened last night. I thought, I love that. I love that there's forgiveness in this world. and I love that he's got a, I love that he's killing it right now. People

2 (1h 41m 21s):
That don't want to forgive people that are, are actively trying to be better people are bad people. Yes.

5 (1h 41m 28s):
Yeah. Yes. True.

2 (1h 41m 29s):
There's a, there's a negative aspect to this non forgiveness mindset that is inescapable. It's not good for the person that perpetuates it. It's definitely not good for the people that receive it. If you have this fear that you'll Bertcast out of the kingdom forever for a thing that you deeply regret and you might have done in duress or you might have done for whatever fucking reason. But you realize as a human being, how could I have done that? If you're not willing to say, I get it. We're all human and, and I, I believe your intention. Gimme a hug. Let's work this out. If you can't do that, you are the problem. The problem is you are the problem.

2 (1h 42m 9s):
Unforgiving mindset. It's,

3 (1h 42m 11s):
It's

2 (1h 42m 11s):
The least charitable perspective on every person you run into. Because you think that somehow or another that elevates you. but it doesn't.

3 (1h 42m 20s):
Doesn't. And they make you stick to this. My mistake when Kevin Hart was like trying to be nice about gays and they're like, well, where was that then? And I'm like, he's being nice. Right. And this is your moment to shit

2 (1h 42m 28s):
On him. Also, Kevin Hart was trying to be famous. Fuck yeah. And trying to get laughs. Trying to get laughs. And when you try to get laughs you will say things you don't believe but you think will be effective. And it's a sign of a comedian that's not that good yet. It's a normal thing that we all did. Yeah.

5 (1h 42m 47s):
We all did. And and still do.

3 (1h 42m 48s):
And still do still do

5 (1h 42m 50s):
Mothership. I watch I don, I'm watching people

2 (1h 42m 51s):
Fucking pussies.

5 (1h 42m 53s):
I watch people take wild chances at the mothership chance. Like wild chances. Yeah. And I know the audience sometimes goes, why? Why does he care about that? And you're go, no, it's his in his head to find some and he's trying to find something. Yeah.

2 (1h 43m 3s):
Well I think the audience, the mothership is more aware of that than most clubs because we talk about it so much that the process of creating a a bit is sometimes you have to trot it out there and while you're saying it, you're free balling and you might go down the wrong path. Right. Right. And try to get committed to it. Yeah.

3 (1h 43m 22s):
And then you're like stuck on a route. Yeah. You're just like, well lemme try to get out of this fun.

2 (1h 43m 26s):
But that's how new bits are created. Like Yeah. There's new bits that get created because of that. That's

3 (1h 43m 30s):
Why I hate when people say,

2 (1h 43m 31s):
You push yourself

3 (1h 43m 32s):
Into a corner. Yeah. See somebody like that guy's not good. Like he's trying something

2 (1h 43m 36s):
Yeah's figure it out's what infuriated me, infuriated me about Louis Cks leak set. Oh, I thought about that today when comics were going after him. I'm like, do are you

3 (1h 43m 49s):
Lying? Comic

2 (1h 43m 50s):
To the Normies should about the process.

4 (1h 43m 53s):
It's also one of those things where I remember when that happened and you're like, we should not lose this list of names. Right.

3 (1h 44m 0s):
Oh,

2 (1h 44m 0s):
I've never lost that list of names. Traitors.

4 (1h 44m 2s):
Just stand up hus. Where you're like, it's so obvious by the way that this is a popin. Like, I'm working this shit out. It's a workout

2 (1h 44m 11s):
Set. He hasn't done standup in 10 months.

4 (1h 44m 14s):
It's so

2 (1h 44m 14s):
Crazy. No standup in 10 months. And every one of those premises had promise

3 (1h 44m 20s):
Also. Yeah. They were good Every related to people when they were like, what's going on? I would tell 'em, they'd laugh at me retelling that joke.

2 (1h 44m 25s):
It's literally like the farmer.

3 (1h 44m 27s):
It's funny, it's unique. It's

2 (1h 44m 28s):
Literally like a farmer being criticized for not having a crop to take the market right after he plants the seeds. Yeah.

3 (1h 44m 35s):
Yeah.

2 (1h 44m 35s):
He might be, where's your fucking tomatoes?

4 (1h 44m 37s):
He, he might be the most fun person to watch workout period too. Like he really, he's so, he's dude, he's so good at it. And he just takes, he takes chances and he goes for it. And he, and the thing is, he actually sits in suffering more than other comics. Like, meaning like, if it starts to not work, so many people bail out like that and he'll sit in the suffering

2 (1h 45m 2s):
Strength. But you know, we were talking about this this last night at the club that there is a giant group of fans that wanna see that happen now. Yeah.

3 (1h 45m 11s):
So you try fans,

2 (1h 45m 12s):
We're talking, talking about guys, like guys are coming up to Duncan and saying, Hey, I love how you changed that. Yeah. And now you're like, oh shit. Now you've watched me multiple times do this thing. But they like the pro, like, I like music. I can't play music, I can't play anything. But I love watching live music. Yeah. I love watching people perform. And if there was a way that I could go watch them develop live songs, develop them. Like if I knew that like Gary Clark Jr. Is gonna start out with like this sort of melody and put it together in front of crowds, then one day it's gonna be on Spotify. Yeah. But for now I'm getting to watch it happen. Yeah. That's comedy fans now.

4 (1h 45m 53s):
Yes. That is comedy fans. Now

5 (1h 45m 54s):
What percentage though? In, in a room?

2 (1h 45m 55s):
37. No,

5 (1h 45m 56s):
37.

3 (1h 45m 57s):
I'd say like less than a

2 (1h 45m 58s):
Half at the mothership. Less

5 (1h 45m 59s):
Than half. Yeah. At

2 (1h 45m 60s):
The mothership that

4 (1h 46m 0s):
Are wanting to

2 (1h 46m 1s):
I bet, I bet at the mothership there's a lot more than most. 'cause I bet at the mothership there's, they've at least listened to one conversation between comedians.

3 (1h 46m 10s):
But you have to have seen the standup set a few times

2 (1h 46m 12s):
To see how its don't ass lighter. That is American

2 (1h 47m 15s):
They're very firm. They, they also, they, they look like a guy who could pick up some heavy shit. I'm, we were talking about in the green room. When you got on stage, I was like, damn, look at bird's fucking shoulders. You got traps, you got shoulders, you look jacked. You remember that one day we did Sober October we went back there and everybody's like, how much can you bench? It was one of those, how much can you bench things? And we put 2 25 on the bar and no one could bench it, but I just saw you benching it the other day. And how many did you do? How many reps? 10. 10 reps.

4 (1h 47m 45s):
By the way, the for progress, like, to be clear, he got pinned the first time

5 (1h 47m 51s):
I got pinned. Pinned, pinned, pinned, pinned on. One pinned. I remember we all had,

2 (1h 47m 54s):

5 (1h 47m 59s):
Love it.

2 (1h 48m 0s):
I think I did 12 or 13. But I can do 15 now. Every now and then I'd try it.

To the desk. I love this about you.

2 (1h 48m 16s):
You don't like it.

5 (1h 48m 17s):
I love that you own a little territory in my head. You don't

2 (1h 48m 19s):
Love it. I do. You

5 (1h 48m 20s):

2 (1h 48m 21s):
Love it?

5 (1h 48m 22s):
Absolutely. Do

2 (1h 48m 22s):
You think you love it? Until we're actually engaged in competition and then it's an anxiety when you get up to piss in the middle of the night, I know you think about it. But for real joke, we were

5 (1h 48m 29s):
Doing could double them.

2 (1h 48m 30s):
I could do double them. No, I doubled them with pushups. That's

5 (1h 48m 33s):
Ridiculous. No, that's ridiculous. You couldn't.

2 (1h 48m 34s):
I definitely could. Could

5 (1h 48m 35s):
You do double em and bench way? Could you do

4 (1h 48m 37s):
30 reps?

2 (1h 48m 38s):
No. 30 is tough. No.

5 (1h 48m 39s):
Impossible. Tough. It's possible. My dogs big NL guys

2 (1h 48m 42s):
25. No, my frame can't handle it. At 15 I'd I'd be struggling. At 15 I'd be struggling. But I did. Or how would you get seven? Seven? When I did, when? When I did with you guys. 12. I had no idea what if I could even do it. I literally hadn't benched in forever. Yeah. All I do is kettlebells. The heaviest weight I do is 70 pounds.

5 (1h 48m 60s):
Hey, would you ever think about posting when you program for your workout? I would love to know what you do. Simple. Do you ever post on Instagram? Do you do circuits?

2 (1h 49m 8s):
Yeah. Yeah, I do circuits. But I'm, I think there's a real value to doing. Like, there's a bunch of exercises that are standards, like straight leg, dead lifts, clean and press. There's these things are,

4 (1h 49m 23s):
You start with swings. Do you

2 (1h 49m 24s):
Do like I start with pushups and body weight squats and I. Start with cold plunge. Every workout's three minutes, 34 degrees. Boom. Go from there. 20 body weight squats, 20 pushups, 20 body weight squats, 20 pushups. You do two sets in a row so that you get two sets of legs, two sets of pushups and get warm. So you get warm up warm. Yeah. Then you do the, the final three, you get to a hundred pushups, a hundred body weight squats. Then it's kettlebells. And if I'm on a regular schedule, it's 70 pounds. So I go to 70 pounds. That's so heavy. Heavy. 70 pounds, 10 swings each arm three sets, 10 presses. Each arm three sets, 10 windmills. Each arm three sets. 10 renegade rows.

2 (1h 50m 4s):
Each arm,

5 (1h 50m 5s):
Three sets. Renegade rose

2 (1h 50m 6s):
With 70 pounds. At the end of that is rough. Then re a sled. Then you go to the sled. Oh the sled. And then it's the torque sled pushing it. You're pushing it about 35 meters. And then you're pushing it and you're pulling it back. And we do that. We'll do that for three sets. You work with

5 (1h 50m 23s):
Someone?

2 (1h 50m 24s):
No, I'd get it. I just do it in my head. And then I have comics do it with me.

5 (1h 50m 28s):
Oh yeah. I've been there for those.

2 (1h 50m 30s):
So then we go from there to Tabatas on the heavy bag. Tabatas are 22nd sprint followed by 10, second rest. So we do that and we blast out the end of the workout. We put the rock through this. Yeah. And the end, the end of the workout. You quit. No, the rock is fucking, he was cool, man. He's humble. He, he didn't, he's not a kettlebell guy. He had never done cold plunge before. Before he did it with us. What? Yeah. Never done it. So he was super humble. He was, he, there was no guys built like a fucking superhero. Right. But I think he's also doing a lot of stuff to increase like the aesthetics. Yeah. The mask. Yeah. You know, so he's doing a lot of machines.

2 (1h 51m 10s):
If you look at his iron paradise, that insane Jimmy has set up. Yes. By the way, American flag fucking prominently displayed. When you look at that setup, that setup is a setup. It's perfect for a guy who wants to look like a superhero in a movie. It's perfect. Yeah. But I'm concerned with like functional strength. I'm concerned with like, I wanna be able to move my body like an athlete as long as I can. And so we did a bunch of like wild shit that he had never done before. Really? Yeah. Windmills are hard. Man.

5 (1h 51m 40s):
Windmills are really hard.

2 (1h 51m 41s):
It's hard, you know, but I've been doing that whole routine for so long that my body is like just fucking primed

5 (1h 51m 49s):
For it. Are you pretty much at that every morning? Is that your, is that roughly where you're at? That's

2 (1h 51m 53s):
One workout that I do twice a week.

5 (1h 51m 56s):
You know, you know a guy like me would love to get on Instagram in the morning, come work out with tomorrow. No, but I'd love to get on the morning in LA buddy. Well, I got a flight out at eight. Let's go. I texted you.

2 (1h 52m 6s):
Let's have a 5:00 AM workout. I

5 (1h 52m 7s):
Texted. Sorry. You have no fucking idea. I'll shoot my testosterone at fucking four 30.

2 (1h 52m 13s):
Let's do it. No, three 30. You wanted to get a couple hours and it where it really gets into your system.

5 (1h 52m 17s):
Oh, I love getting information like that.

2 (1h 52m 19s):
And then we'll, cold plunge first. Cold pl first. While it's

5 (1h 52m 23s):
Dark out with your big

2 (1h 52m 24s):
Cock, you'll hear it's not that big. It's

5 (1h 52m 26s):
Right. No, buddy. The, the video you showed of your yourself getting the cold punch the other day. I had to stop myself for going, is anyone looking at his cock?

2 (1h 52m 36s):
Only Bert. Only Bert. And a couple of chicks.

5 (1h 52m 38s):
They call me a hog watcher. If you have a big cock. I'm gonna notice

2 (1h 52m 43s):
There's something fun about getting in that cold when it's raining out. I mean

5 (1h 52m 46s):
When it's raining out today. Who's 32? When you got in that video? Yeah.

2 (1h 52m 49s):
No, it was 21. 21. It was 21 outside and 34 inside. How

5 (1h 52m 53s):
Much do you think it's worse when like, like no. What what,

2 (1h 52m 56s):
What do you mean? No, something getting in the cold

5 (1h 52m 58s):
When it, when it's cold outside. No. 'cause it

3 (1h 52m 59s):
Feels like you want relief from

2 (1h 52m 60s):
Something. No, no, no. It's so much better

3 (1h 53m 2s):
After the sauna. Yeah,

2 (1h 53m 3s):
Yeah, yeah. For sure. but it doesn't matter if it's hot out. Once you get in, it's still fucking so cold. It's

5 (1h 53m 8s):
Insane. Do you do box breathing?

2 (1h 53m 10s):
I just breathe. Well, I'm really accustomed to being in there now. I loved it. So I can just sort of Great.

5 (1h 53m 15s):
It's, it's after this first

3 (1h 53m 17s):
20 seconds, then it's like, just shut up. Shut up.

2 (1h 53m 19s):
Unless you use the blue cube. The blue cube, there's an option to have it like a raging river. And you never get what's called a thermal barrier. A

5 (1h 53m 26s):
Bubble. Wow. Yeah.

2 (1h 53m 27s):
Yeah. What is it? A thermal barrier.

5 (1h 53m 28s):
You realize how in the weeds you are about coal plunging. Yeah.

2 (1h 53m 31s):
I'm in the weeds. If you wanna be a guy who tortures yourself, blue Cube is the way to go. I would love

3 (1h 53m 36s):
To open up Rogan's YouTube on his computer. Just see what it's suggesting to him.

5 (1h 53m 40s):
I can't wait until the North Korea finds this fucking phone

2 (1h 53m 43s):
By the amount of guns I research and the amount of animal attacks.

5 (1h 53m 48s):
Yeah. The the polar plunge is, is is badass. But I, the do you do the light thing? Yeah.

2 (1h 53m 56s):
I did that red light therapy. Yeah, I do that every morning. Did you get that bed? Yeah, I got it. What's that? I got Gary Breca. Well, one of the things that's happening is as you get older, your face, your skin starts to get thinner. 'cause you have a lack of collagen. That's what I wanna hear. And you start looking like, you're like, ugh. It looks sick. Even if you feel good. Yeah. Your skin has more laxity. Yeah. In the one and a half months that I've been using it, my skin looks better. What

5 (1h 54m 21s):
Is it? What is it? What is it? It's red light therapy. Red light therapy. What? What is it? Just like a thing. We

2 (1h 54m 25s):
Could, we could talk about it, but I don't know what I'm saying. So I'd be

5 (1h 54m 28s):
T it

3 (1h 54m 28s):
That shoots light at you.

2 (1h 54m 30s):
Yeah. It's, it, it, it helps your body. You see people with the mask sometimes wear

5 (1h 54m 35s):
Masks. I do that for my head.

2 (1h 54m 36s):
It helps you re rehabilitate from injuries. There's a lot of, there's a lot of things I'm not the guy to, to talk specifics about, but I do it every day. You

2 (1h 54m 50s):
And I have a flotation Tank. I don't know which one is better for you. 'cause both of them are really good for you. The the flotation Tank is, there's a reset that I think you can achieve from that. It's just like doing psychedelics without any of the weird fuckery of recovering and coming back to normal. You get outta there and you're frying, you're out. It's, if you could, if you could take what you get from a sensory deprivation Tank in a pill with, with just as a drug, everybody would take it.

5 (1h 55m 20s):
Yeah. It's called Xanax.

2 (1h 55m 22s):
No, it's the opposite.

5 (1h 55m 24s):
Great. It's great. It's the best.

2 (1h 55m 25s):
I bet Xanax is awesome. but it, Xanax, I think what that is is the opposite. That's like an instead of like pretending your house isn't wrecked, it's check out. That's like going in your house and examining all the cracks in your foundation.

5 (1h 55m 38s):
Oh, I had to check off

You didn't bring my name up. I'll

4 (1h 59m 52s):
Tell you why. Why a PX

3 (1h 59m 53s):
Copperhead.

4 (1h 59m 54s):
It wasn't a,

3 (1h 59m 56s):
He didn't want to own up to you?

4 (1h 59m 58s):
No, no. It wasn't a long conversation. Oh, okay. and it wasn't like, it wasn't settling in to talk. It was the first time I met him. I met him for three seconds. Yeah. and I thought that was it. And at the end of the night when I went in there, it was, I had major hesitation about walking into his dressing room. Yeah. With his bodyguards and everything around. Or

5 (2h 0m 19s):
Papa you mean? Papa

4 (2h 0m 20s):
And I just went in to say, and Big Wall. I just went in to say it was fun to be on the show with you. and I thought that it was that, and he asked for a pic. It was very, very fast. It wasn't long.

3 (2h 0m 30s):
I went to see Danny Brown.

4 (2h 0m 31s):
If I had, if I had stayed to talk, if he was like, pull up a seat. Yeah. It would've been something

3 (2h 0m 36s):
I wanna see Danny Brown. and it rap's just not my genre. Like it is yours. Yeah. And he's cool. We've become friendly. Danny's

4 (2h 0m 41s):
Fantastic.

3 (2h 0m 41s):
But Daniel Simonson, that's his number one guy. Really?

4 (2h 0m 44s):
What?

3 (2h 0m 44s):
Simon? That's simonson's. Like Danny. Are you? What do you mean? Can I I was like, sure. and I we're having a conversation. Oh, cool. What's, what about the weather? I don, whatever. and I look over and Daniel's just like, ha ha ha ha. Really? Yeah. Really? He's trying to be cool, but

4 (2h 0m 55s):
It was like I was trying to navigate the conversation. Yeah. With without looking Like

5 (2h 1m 0s):
You realized I would've been like, if you had worked with him for a year, I would've walked in and been like, I know Tom Segura.

4 (2h 1m 5s):
I, I just, I was

5 (2h 1m 6s):
So, so who I am.

4 (2h 1m 7s):
Yeah. But I was I mean, here's the thing. You say that like, 'cause you were in my mind and the fact that you guys worked together was a natural thing to bring up. but it was also, I think when you're in, sometimes in those situations, you're like, when's the time to say this? You're kind of nervous about how you say it. Yeah. And you're looking for the end to say it. Yeah. So if I, if I had talked to him for longer, it would've been a normal thing to bring up.

5 (2h 1m 30s):
Cheers. I love drinking with you.

4 (2h 1m 31s):
Okay. I love drinking with

5 (2h 1m 32s):
You too. and I. Ari. Oh,

4 (2h 1m 35s):
You're doing so gang. You're not drinking. Yeah.

3 (2h 1m 37s):
I got another week girl.

4 (2h 1m 40s):
Yeah. That little dog.

3 (2h 1m 41s):
Oh, it's so fucking cute.

4 (2h 1m 43s):
The cutest thing I've ever seen. I think

3 (2h 1m 44s):
We should. It's so fucking cute. Oh,

2 (2h 1m 46s):
He's so

3 (2h 1m 46s):
Cute. I just swallow his face.

5 (2h 1m 48s):
Hey Joe, can I ask you a question? Sure. So when you watch Conor McGregor and a TS fight, did you want one of them to win?

2 (2h 1m 54s):
No. Okay.

3 (2h 1m 55s):
Really? but it,

5 (2h 1m 56s):
For real, for real.

2 (2h 1m 57s):
To started, I want the, the, the main problem I had during commentary was s Shab. That was the only problem I really ever had. For real. Yeah. This is a why guys. I love, I love Donald Cowboy Cerone. I fucking love that dude. Cowboy rules. I love him

3 (2h 2m 10s):
Cowboy.

2 (2h 2m 11s):
I, I wish, wish there was more men like that in this world. I love him to death. But when he's fighting Conor McGregor, I can't have a favorite. I just have to let it happen. These guys have all, they're all professionals.

5 (2h 2m 22s):
How do you that though? It's impossible. Even though I had a favorite

2 (2h 2m 25s):
Proposal. Him. No, I it I do it. I do it. I swear to God I do it. Even when Sean Strickland fought Israel outta Sonya. Izzy my friend. I love it. Izzy's the I love motherfucker. He's the

5 (2h 2m 33s):
Shit. He's the motherfucker.

2 (2h 2m 34s):
He defended me with Whole n n-Word video came out. Yeah. Yeah. Said the dude I made that made me tear up. Yeah. I love that

4 (2h 2m 41s):
Dude. He's my favorite, by the way, as a personal favorite. 100% my

2 (2h 2m 45s):
Personal favorite as human being Human. He's one of of my favorite people that I've ever met. Yeah. He's an extraordinary human being. So fun. But when he fought Sean Strickland, I, you know, I have to be neutral. I have to be like, whoa,

4 (2h 2m 54s):
What's happening? Well, that's the job. You can't be like,

2 (2h 2m 56s):
It's the job that was during Fight Companion. That was during Fight Companion. Oh.

4 (2h 3m 1s):
Oh,

2 (2h 3m 2s):
Right. Yeah. So You don that was, I wasn't even working. I was just hanging out here watching the fight.

4 (2h 3m 6s):
But you still are trying

2 (2h 3m 6s):
To be I still have to be neutral. I have to be, I have to have a neutral mindset when I watching people fight.

3 (2h 3m 11s):
Can

2 (2h 3m 11s):
You just be a fan? I think No, no, no, no, no. When, when people are fighting, that's just like, for my own mind, I don't allow my mind to go into like this avenue where I want someone to win and someone to lose. 'cause you'll get a biased perspective. And I know, I've been, I've been guilty of that in the past when I, when I was in the early days of my commentary and I realize that's a flaw. It's a flaw. Like I could appre like I have friends that fight and I love them to death, and I want them to win. But if they don't win, I can't be attached to that. I have to be attached as a person who's appreciating the sport. I'll check in on them. How you doing? You're all right. Yeah. Yeah. You know, but the reality of what they're doing is I have to be a a a clear objective viewer of the transaction.

2 (2h 3m 55s):
That's interesting. Who's winning the exchange?

3 (2h 3m 57s):
Because when I'm hearing MMA commentary, I definitely want what you're saying. Yeah. When I hear like football or sports commentary. Yes. I want hear the Yankees, bro. I wanna hear the go. Come on. You can't

2 (2h 4m 6s):
Let that out. But I, yeah. The thing thing is, there's a giant difference between a sport and a fight. Right. Despite a fight, you're exposing a man's soul. And you gotta be respectful of that. You're spo you're exposing everything about what he's capable of. Right? Right. He's literally, this is a, this is a, they, they're fighting to the death. They're just not letting them finish it. That's what that is.

4 (2h 4m 27s):
That's true. That's true. I think, by the way, that Kirk Herb Street does that so well, what? He's an Ohio State graduate like he played there and he commentates on all the biggest games. And he can commentate on, on Ohio State game

5 (2h 4m 38s):
And be neutral,

4 (2h 4m 39s):
In my opinion. Yes.

3 (2h 4m 40s):
Oh, see, I want somebody, I think he's, I would, I would turn the Redskins games on mute and let the radio, like the hometown radio guys.

5 (2h 4m 46s):
Yeah. I think he's very good at it. Wow. Yeah. So sweet. My favorite Nate Diaz clip ever, ever is the coolest thing. Especially if you've ever been bullied. Do you ever see Nate Diaz when they go, Hey, were you ever bullied as a kid? And he just looks and he goes, no, I had a big brother. And you're like, and your heart swells. Oh wow. And you go, fuck. Yes. And

2 (2h 5m 8s):
His big brother was Nick Di, Nick

5 (2h 5m 10s):
Diaz,

2 (2h 5m 10s):
Di

5 (2h 5m 11s):
Nick Fucking Diaz.

2 (2h 5m 12s):
Nick Diaz, one of the all time greats.

4 (2h 5m 15s):
I have to ask this you, is that what you, I remember when the story broke.

14 (2h 5m 19s):
Okay. Hell nah. You,

4 (2h 5m 21s):
That never happened to you.

14 (2h 5m 22s):
And I had a big brother. Man.

5 (2h 5m 24s):
Fuck his big brother. Yeah.

2 (2h 5m 26s):
And his big brother's a savage, savage.

5 (2h 5m 28s):
Look at that.

2 (2h 5m 29s):
A real legit savage. I remember when Nick, when Nick Diaz fought Robbie Lawler. Robbie Lawler was the man. He was like 20 years old. He was an assassin. Just smashing people. Yeah. And Nick Diaz went into the octagon and as he walked into the octagon, he was like, stomping on the floor. What, what part of California's he front again? Stockton.

5 (2h 5m 52s):
Stockton. Stockton. Are you serious? The worst place

2 (2h 5m 53s):
On earth. I forgot for a second. The worst. And he was yelling out Stockton. Stockton, motherfucker. Stockton. Stockton.

5 (2h 5m 59s):
I love it.

2 (2h 5m 60s):
By the way, I was like, what is going on here? Yeah. Yeah. I was confused, like, as a, a commentator. I'm like, what's happening here? He's like, Stockton motherfucker. Stockton. I can't believe I forgot Stockton. Yeah.

5 (2h 6m 9s):
You are the one that brought it up. The only reason I know that I need today. Okay. All I've

2 (2h 6m 12s):
Had is alcohol. Really?

5 (2h 6m 13s):
Yeah. You

2 (2h 6m 15s):
Worked out. Got up fucking rib. I was up late at night. I wrote late at night till four in the morning. Got up. Oh fuck. Got up, got in the cold, did my workout

5 (2h 6m 23s):
Tonight. Go back to this story. Stocked him, motherfucker. Yeah.

2 (2h 6m 24s):
He yells out, stocked him. Motherfucker stocked him. And, and you see Robbie Lawler going, what is

3 (2h 6m 30s):
That I don Dunno what that means.

2 (2h 6m 32s):
And when, when we thought Nick could beat him, like we knew Nick was a Juujitsu guy, but he beat him with boxing. He knocked him out. He knocked out Robbie Lawler when he hit him on the right hook. And Robbie dropped like face plants. And we're like, what? It was nonsense. Like, no way. Somebody bullied ruthless Robbie Lawler.

5 (2h 6m 51s):
Oh, look at that.

2 (2h 6m 52s):
He just started I. mean, I mean Robbie was an animal. Robbie was throwing back. But Nick was just, oh, talking. You gotta understand that that talking shit is a 100% legit psychological tactic. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It fucks with your mind and impedes your performance. 100%. It's a brilliant move.

4 (2h 7m 11s):
And he's, it's in all sports too. In all high level sports.

2 (2h 7m 13s):
It is. And in fighting. I I think it's, he did it better than anybody in the beginning. Nobody did it better in fight. He would talk so much shit to them. Frank Shamrock said that he couldn't believe it was happening to him. 'cause when Nick di go to Nick Diaz versus Frank,

3 (2h 7m 29s):
I wanna see his

5 (2h 7m 29s):
Knockout. I wanna see it too.

2 (2h 7m 31s):
Okay.

5 (2h 7m 31s):
Is this one Nate, Nate's one that flicked off the cameras, right? Yeah.

3 (2h 7m 34s):
Yeah. I was at that, that fight.

2 (2h 7m 35s):
He stunned him with the one two. Yeah. But that, this is Nick was better fucking all due respect to Nate. Nate will tell you that Nick is better than Nate. Nick was just weed killed Nate. Nick was one of the Nick I mean no man. He, I thought he stopped

3 (2h 7m 46s):
Fighting because

2 (2h 7m 46s):
He wouldn't get tested. No, no, no, no, no, no. Nobody got killed because of weed.

3 (2h 7m 51s):
I thought he stopped fighting 'cause he was like, I'm not cleaning up

2 (2h 7m 52s):
Nick. Yeah, no, no. There's no testing now in the UFC. Now he's just had some real injuries, man, that like if you, you gotta go to Nick Diaz right there. Boom. Face plant. You gotta go to Nick Diaz in Strikeforce. If you wanna see Nick Diaz at the elite of the elite level where he achieved like real true greatness. When by the time he got to the UFC, he was still great. When he fought Gomi and Pride, he was still great in Strikeforce, an elite athlete in combat sports has a small window of time where they can perform at their best level. And when Nick Diaz was in Strikeforce, when he's a champ, he was fucking everybody up.

2 (2h 8m 33s):
He would just walk you down and beat your ass. And if you went to the ground, he would fucking strangle you 100% of the time. He beat everybody's asses.

5 (2h 8m 42s):
God damnit

2 (2h 8m 43s):
The thing is like, he would let guys take him down and like, shut up. You can't knock me out. Like you never knocked him out. No one knocked him out. He always survived. He always figured out a way to turn into a grappling exchange. And then slowly but surely he would beat you out. Nick Diaz swam from Alcatraz.

5 (2h 9m 2s):
That's the gangster thing.

2 (2h 9m 3s):
Five times. No, really? Yeah. Five

5 (2h 9m 6s):
To the mainlands, the great white sharks

2 (2h 9m 9s):
Five times might be more. Nick, I'm sorry if it's more since then. It's probably more since then. He beat everybody down. Beat everybody down. Eventually you just withered and he never got tired and he just kept putting it on you. And at the end of the fight, he was always like this. And he was basically hitting a fucking punching bag. A person who couldn't believe the amount of pressure that Nick Diaz put on them, just beating the fuck out of them with not even breathing heavy. He did not

5 (2h 9m 34s):
Stop. He did not stop.

2 (2h 9m 35s):
And he was standing on top of him. Like, what? That's it. That's over. I want you to go to Nick Diaz versus Frank Shamrock. 'cause Frank Shamrock was a legend hardcore. He was a UFC champion. He was the first complete mixed martial artist. He could wrestle, he could submit you, he could do anything. And Nick d as the entire time was like, what bitch? What bitch whatcha gonna do? Bitch? He was just constantly talking to him. And Frank was like, I couldn't believe he was talking to me.

5 (2h 10m 3s):
He's talking right now.

2 (2h 10m 5s):
Always. Wow. Gimme some volume. See if you can hear it.

15 (2h 10m 9s):
Love him or hate him. I think he's tremendous for the sport. You need these kinds of characters in mixed martial arts.

16 (2h 10m 16s):
I think they both like talking, Frank's trying to focus right now though. You can tell

15 (2h 10m 20s):
Frank using that straight right hand to the body.

2 (2h 10m 22s):
And that's, and the thing is, he's just touching you. He's hitting you with like 50%, 60%. But he's, he's so relaxed. Look how relaxed his style is. He's not getting tired. Look how easy he's hitting him. Why?

5 (2h 10m 39s):
Because

2 (2h 10m 40s):
He's just wearing him out. He's cooking his food

5 (2h 10m 43s):
And he's he's holding back. Yeah.

2 (2h 10m 46s):
Oh no. Nick is 100% holding him back. Look how he's punching him. He's not punching him full force at all. And just pacing

5 (2h 10m 53s):
Him slowly. Yeah.

2 (2h 10m 54s):
Everywhere. See, the thing is, without wearing, if you can fight at that style where you're just 50% in guys, you don't get tired. And if you can do 20 punches at 50%, it's almost as good as 150 punches at a hundred percent. Yeah. Or, or rather 10 punches at a hundred percent. It's like if you go cut it in half the, the volume also keeps you from being able to take a good breath. Oh, right. The guy's on you all the time. You never get a breather. Frank's not getting any breathers and Nick's not tired. Look, he's just piecing them. Look, even that kick, there's no real power in it. Just touching you, touching you until he starts to really see you wilt. And look at him.

2 (2h 11m 35s):
Look. But look at him. Look at his stomach. Look at his stomach. There's no breathing heavy at all. He's probably at 120 beats a minute right now.

4 (2h 11m 43s):
That's insane. This

2 (2h 11m 44s):
Is a, a fucking guy runs triathlons. Look at up so he can stand in front of you and you are fucking cooked. So he's cooking his chicken right now. He's got his chicken on the frying bed right

5 (2h 11m 55s):
Now. Wow. Damn.

2 (2h 11m 56s):
He's fucking, he's cooking chicken breasts. He's just piecing them up and look. Not tired. Not, not exhausted. Not hitting him. That there's a dig. That's a dig. First dig. Wow. That right hand of the body he dug into. So

5 (2h 12m 9s):
Right now he's a hundred percent going after it.

2 (2h 12m 10s):
Yeah. Now he's going after it. See the difference. Yeah. Look, these punches have a lot more fury behind him. Right. He's gonna tie around because, because he's ending the fight. He's, he's more, Frank's already at 180 beats a minute. He's wilting and he's beating the fuck out of him. And then he helps him out. He goes, you're a legend. Get up. He said that you're a legend. Get up. And he holds his hand up. God damn. Because that's how he feels about him. Wow. That's legitimately how he feels about him.

5 (2h 12m 37s):
Is there anyone better than Diaz brothers? Yeah. Brothers. No, the brothers man. That legend.

2 (2h 12m 43s):
Look, look, there's a lot of,

5 (2h 12m 44s):
That's, they're like, are they better than Peyton Manning and, and Archie Manning or those? Eli Manning. Yeah. Eli Manning. Of course. All sports you're saying? Yeah. Like the brothers. No, Peyton and Eli are better. don don't know man. World titles. Yeah. MVPs, multiple rings. Yeah. don don't know. Yeah.

2 (2h 13m 1s):
Nate Nate's biggest. Nate McGregor. Yeah. Nate's win. That's his big win. But

4 (2h 13m 4s):
You said though that, that elite guys, when they get in there, they go to, they, they do the most of the fight at like 60, 70%.

2 (2h 13m 11s):
Right. Less like Max. That's one of the reasons why Max Holloway stopped sparring. Max decided at one point in time that he sparred enough and he understands it. He just does drills and trains and does a bunch of strength and conditioning work. And when he goes into a fight, he hasn't been hit in a long time. And that's his philosophy. Well, that's that. But he's also a world champion at the top of, you know, there's a top five pound for pound max always should be in there. Yeah. He's one of the greatest of all time. Because

4 (2h 13m 39s):
That's that thing though, like if you're amateur, you always start going like, I'm going a hundred percent dude. Yeah. Like, you know, you step in Yeah. Whether you're doing jiujitsu or you're, you're boxing or something, you're just like, I'm gonna go all out. And then you realize this, this is not sustainable. It's not sustainable. Right. Yeah. And, but those elite guys are like, oh, you gotta make this shit

2 (2h 13m 57s):
Last. Well that's, Nick Diaz was the best at that. 'cause he understood endurance from the perspective of someone who swam from Alcatraz, someone who does triathlons. When you do triathlons for sharks, you're fucking swimming. You're running and you're biking. There's three different things you're doing. All of them are exhausting at any one of 'em. When it's over, it should be over. Yeah. Like, wow, what a workout. But then you got another one, and then after that you got another one. It's

5 (2h 14m 19s):
Crazy. What does he take the, he'd takes the tourist boat out there and it is like, I'll catch up with your guys. Does

2 (2h 14m 22s):
No, no, no. They, they do that specifically. Endurance athletes do it. They swim back from Alcaraz because if you don't make it to the shore, you're dead. And there's also great whites, they've nest out there. They nest San Francisco. That, that area out there is famous butt population. You can't have

5 (2h 14m 39s):
Great to

2 (2h 14m 40s):
Great whites. No, you're dead. It's like,

5 (2h 14m 41s):
What are you

4 (2h 14m 41s):
Do? So there's like a, there's like a follow boat kind of, kind of like,

2 (2h 14m 44s):
I don't even know how they did it. Yeah,

5 (2h 14m 45s):
Yeah. They is. They did.

2 (2h 14m 46s):
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Either way he made it all the way five times.

5 (2h 14m 51s):
No, not that I, I follow, that's gonna help you times

4 (2h 14m 53s):
Five. How far are you swimming when you do that?

5 (2h 14m 55s):
I just was there.

2 (2h 14m 56s):
It's too far. It's more than a mile.

5 (2h 14m 57s):
No, no. It's, I think it's, if I'm not mistaken. Current though. Well, the current Of course, well they do, they time it out a current, they don't, they don't go with like

2 (2h 15m 5s):
An outgoing tide. But the distance, just the distance as the crow flies. What's the distance? Yeah. What's the distance between Alcatraz and the shore? It's

5 (2h 15m 10s):
Gotta be at at least two miles. No, no.

2 (2h 15m 13s):
Yeah. There he says, yeah. It's

5 (2h 15m 14s):
Gotta be at least, at least a mile. He

2 (2h 15m 16s):
Says, I have done Alcatraz five times. So during the Con McGregor ha failed dos Sanjo. Anyway, during one of the

4 (2h 15m 22s):
Fights. That's

2 (2h 15m 23s):
That distance though. I said that he did it twice and he, he corrected me. How he corrected me. He said he did it five times. How far are citizens? But this was, by the way, 2016. He's probably done it five times since then. of course. Yeah. He's a fucking psycho. Jesus.

4 (2h 15m 35s):
This is a story, like, I remember how hot this story was. What's

2 (2h 15m 38s):
The distance between Raz? It's

5 (2h 15m 39s):
Gotta be, at least, I'm just telling you on Marathon, on triathlons. It's gotta be a mile. Yeah. Mile. I think

2 (2h 15m 45s):
A mile. It's

5 (2h 15m 45s):
More than a mile. It's Oh, I know it is, but I'm, I'm just saying, yeah, to be safe, it's over a fucking mile.

4 (2h 15m 52s):
Whatever. Okay. What happened with the Kane story?

5 (2h 15m 55s):
Ka Velasquez

2 (2h 15m 56s):
Velasquez. He hasn't been convicted. And two,

4 (2h 15m 59s):
1.25.

2 (2h 16m 0s):
1.25 miles. Okay. It's a long swim dude. Cain, it's a long swim. Kane has not been convicted.

4 (2h 16m 6s):
He's still locked

2 (2h 16m 6s):
Up. No, he's free. They, they released him on bail.

5 (2h 16m 10s):
Can I ask you to pause for a second? Is Kane Velasquez the kid, the guy in Hawaii whose son No,

2 (2h 16m 16s):
No. He, sorry. The guy in northern California whose son was molested by someone who was running the daycare

5 (2h 16m 22s):
Center. Same, same. I thought it his wife,

2 (2h 16m 24s):
Keep going. He's from AKA, he's one of the greatest heavyweights of all time in his prime, maybe the best. And he found out that his son had been molested by a, a daycare worker. And he went after that guy and drove, drove his car in a rage and shot a gun at him. And they arrested him. They kept him in jail for a long time and they finally let him out on bond. And now he's coaching at AKA and I don't know what the status of his case is, but Kane isn't an exceptional human being. Totally. He's an amazing human being.

5 (2h 16m 59s):
I feel like that was a story

2 (2h 16m 60s):
Where like every world, every dad who heard that was like, I fucking get it. I get it. It's

3 (2h 17m 6s):
Like, you gotta be careful with stray bullets. But yeah, I

2 (2h 17m 8s):
Get the reason the guy who, the guy who did that is out. What? Yeah. The guy who did that is out on bail. So he's out. And Kane was in jail at the same time. It's one of the most terrifying situations a father could ever find themselves in. And not just know that that guy is out, but that you are in prison and that your wife is home with your children. And this guy who has already targeted your kid, who knows how fucking sick he is. He might try to target him again while you are in jail. 'cause Jesus, you're, you're, and you might be in jail forever. Who knows? You might be in jail for 30 years. Who knows. Yeah. It's attempted murder. He was shooting a gun at the guy allegedly.

2 (2h 17m 48s):
You know, but I'm on Team Kane All day,

5 (2h 17m 49s):
Every GoFundMe, GoFund, everybody

2 (2h 17m 51s):
Is I. don know. But if he is, I'm donating.

5 (2h 17m 53s):
But see you find out if there's a

2 (2h 17m 54s):
GoFundMe. I'm on, I'm on team Kain All day, we strangle time. Every person except Ari, who has a kid. But even Ari for his dog.

3 (2h 18m 1s):
No, I gets, I totally on board. I know,

2 (2h 18m 3s):
Strangle it. But, but there's a feeling that You don get the chance when you have kids, man, there's a fucking protection feeling. That's Jim Brewer said it to me, he goes, I never understood murder. He goes, now I get murder. He goes, I had murder for my kids. Yeah. GoFundMe, shut down. What? GoFundMe shuts down. Kane Velazquez fundraiser says Donors issued refunds. Oh my God. Why'd they shut

3 (2h 18m 29s):
It down?

2 (2h 18m 32s):
Violation of terms of service. What's your terms of service? GoFund Legal defense of a violent crime. Oh, okay.

5 (2h 18m 42s):
Prohibits raising money for the legal def defense. Yeah, but

3 (2h 18m 44s):
Why so, so hurricane you could raise money for h

2 (2h 18m 46s):
Want, but that's not a violent

3 (2h 18m 48s):
Crime. What do you mean? He was between human

2 (2h 18m 49s):
Beings?

3 (2h 18m 50s):
What fact of

2 (2h 18m 50s):
God? Hurricane? No, no. Mean Ruben Hurricane Carter. Yeah.

3 (2h 18m 54s):
You couldn't have his defense.

2 (2h 18m 55s):
I'm glad I I, you know, I just added Bob Dylan's hurricane to my Spotify Green room playlist, which should now be available. That's why I knew

5 (2h 19m 3s):
Hardcore n Edward using that song

2 (2h 19m 5s):
Saying I knew Hurricane Bob,

5 (2h 19m 6s):
Bob Dylan should be Yeah, of course. Yeah. Bob Dylan says n word.

2 (2h 19m 10s):
That that hurricane story is complicated.

3 (2h 19m 13s):
Yeah. But so you couldn't raise money for that defense with the new GoFundMe.

2 (2h 19m 16s):
Yeah. But that the def the story's complicated. Whether or not that person was guilty or not is complicated. The hurricane story. Yeah. Yeah. It's a little complicated. And the, the version in the movie is a hundred percent horseshit. Oh, wow. The, the version, the movie of the guy who's like targeting him horseshit.

3 (2h 19m 36s):
They always, in the movies, you always do that with like Fruit Vale Station. They have a, they can't make him a drug dealer. So he is like, here, take on my weed. I'm done. Yeah. And it's like, you could be a drug dealer, not deserve to get shot.

2 (2h 19m 46s):
Yeah. Well also what, when drugs are legal and some drugs will get you put in a cage and the people that own the patents to those drugs are funding politicians. Like what?

5 (2h 19m 57s):
That's

2 (2h 19m 58s):
Very what

3 (2h 19m 59s):
Yeah.

2 (2h 19m 60s):
Interesting. You know, you just don't want entrepreneurs. You don't want drug dealers on a street level. Yeah. Drug dealers everywhere. Every time you go to Walgreens, it's a fucking plexiglass wall behind you and the drug dealer.

5 (2h 20m 10s):
True. We were, they're

2 (2h 20m 12s):
Filled with people's stuff.

3 (2h 20m 13s):
Me and Kevin Ice were driving through Arizona and we passed by some prisons and we were just looking 'em up. They all renamed rebrand. And we were like, they made since the 85, 86, they made $2 billion. And if you told them, Hey, one of your big funding things is weed arrests, we're gonna make that not a pro, they're gonna go full on. I'm like, make that illegal. Keep that

2 (2h 20m 32s):
Illegal divorce. Well, you know that, that prison unions

3 (2h 20m 34s):
Guard all our

2 (2h 20m 35s):
Business prison guard unions lobby to keep marijuana from being decriminal.

3 (2h 20m 39s):
You're taking away a quarter of our business. Yeah. Just

5 (2h 20m 41s):
To keep them employed,

2 (2h 20m 42s):
Basically. Yeah. Because it's like, if you're, if you're a business person, that's what you're supposed to do. If you have shareholders. Yeah. If you have union members, you're supposed, you're not supposed to do it morally. You're supposed to do it. Like, what's the benefit of this? The shareholders,

3 (2h 20m 55s):
This

2 (2h 20m 56s):
Group of people that I represent, are

5 (2h 20m 58s):
You wise enough to, that's

2 (2h 20m 58s):
Dirty about corporations,

5 (2h 20m 59s):
But are you wise enough to not do that? Like, say, say you're the, what's the family that Jelly Roll just talked about on at Congress? The Bilderberg?

2 (2h 21m 10s):
No, the Clintons.

5 (2h 21m 11s):
Nobody talked about a family that did all opioids.

3 (2h 21m 14s):
Oh, Sackler

5 (2h 21m 15s):
Family. S Sackler, family. Yeah. I'm just saying be fair.

3 (2h 21m 20s):
Well, the kids are saying, let's get outta this. Are

5 (2h 21m 21s):
Could you, could you, could you walk away from millions who you as a person and say like,

3 (2h 21m 28s):
You'd like to say you could, but, so I

5 (2h 21m 30s):
Like to say I could. I'm just saying I can't.

2 (2h 21m 32s):
You were, if you were in the family, the Sackler family are out. That shit. Kids are shit. It was going down shit. Yeah.

3 (2h 21m 39s):
The kids were like, shut down.

2 (2h 21m 40s):
Do you think you would've kept your mouth shut? Yeah. If you knew that everybody was dying. Yeah.

3 (2h 21m 44s):
You justified yourself.

5 (2h 21m 45s):
Everyone would, everyone would everyone lying?

3 (2h 21m 48s):
I think Facebook started. Nice. You're

5 (2h 21m 49s):
On a yacht in fucking no meek up.

2 (2h 21m 51s):
This is, this is what I believe. I think

3 (2h 21m 52s):
Facebook started nice and it was all friendly. Super nice. Then once Zuckerberg, once Zuckerberg realized, oh, people are turning on each other hard for your thing. He's like, keep it running. Just keep it running. We got a machine here.

5 (2h 22m 1s):
Yeah, it buddy. It's so hard.

3 (2h 22m 2s):
I don't think it's like intended

5 (2h 22m 3s):
To walk away from money.

3 (2h 22m 5s):
Philip Morris.

5 (2h 22m 5s):
Not everyone, not everyone has a sweet thing in life. Philip Morris

3 (2h 22m 9s):
Too. They're like, on

2 (2h 22m 10s):
Bird, how much money are we talking about? You? You are willing to let people die for this money.

3 (2h 22m 16s):
You're saying

5 (2h 22m 17s):
You couldn't tell. I'm just saying I'm not better than the average person.

2 (2h 22m 19s):
You know what? I'm Well, I don't stop you right here. I know you what you're saying. This is what I'm gonna stop you. Okay. You're you. Yes. And those people that work for the Sacklers are a different thing. They're, if you take flour and sugar and chocolate and you mix it up and you make it a fucking cake, that's how you make a cake. If you wanna make sourdough bread, you need different ingredients. If you wanna make a really nice guy who's a good dad and, and a and a and a good husband and a funny guy, and does a tour and does standup comedy, you go through your life. I disagree. And you make Burke Chrysler, you make you, if you wanna make a Sackler, you have to have disconnected parents.

2 (2h 23m 7s):
You have to have this weird privilege of insane financial wealth. You have to have a pharmaceutical, gigantic company that's been bribing politicians and manipulating narratives and shaping the public's view of pharmaceutical drugs by hiding negative side effects and accentuating the positive benefits of it. And also all the lawyers all for money, but also

3 (2h 23m 32s):
All the lawyers

2 (2h 23m 32s):
Are the secretary. This is the environ. This is the, that you grow up in. You're a different thing. It would be hard. You're a different thing. You right now would pass up on the money. No, no.

5 (2h 23m 43s):
Hundred percent. If you I have money right now, but I'm saying

2 (2h 23m 45s):
No. I'm saying Sack, if you got a fucking phone call and the Sackler said, this is gonna sound crazy, but the

3 (2h 23m 51s):
Comedy is killing

2 (2h 23m 51s):
People. but it turns out you are a part of the fucking Sackler family and you all have a seed on the board and you can come in and you're a part. Well, we didn't know, but you're a part of the family and you know, we have to give you a piece and you gotta come in. You're worth $10 billion now.

3 (2h 24m 7s):
No, that's different. That's, that's inheriting it. What if you're comedy? What if something you do now you realize,

2 (2h 24m 11s):
No, but the sack. But your family inherited their wealth hour. That's why this is valid. He didn't, he built up his life. That's why he wouldn't do it. Now. You would do it if were trapped. If in that environ life was

3 (2h 24m 23s):
Damaging

2 (2h 24m 23s):
People, that's what determinism is. The idea behind it is you're shaped by all of the different circumstances you encounter and to, to compare your circumstances to another circumstances are crazy. They don't make any sense.

5 (2h 24m 36s):
But I'm wondering, I'm wondering just argument's sake, if they had said to me at a young age, yo get outta comedy. The Sacklers have this thing called Oxycontin and it's really helping with cancer. And it's, and it's like, 'cause that's how you get into it. Right? Right. It's

2 (2h 24m 54s):
Good. Yeah. But for sure you would've got out at an early age. I don it just like if somebody gave you a lottery ticket. If you, if you got a lottery ticket and you won a hundred million dollars, I've thought about this all time world. It would the probably ruin your career when you were 21. A thousand percent. A hundred percent no.

5 (2h 25m 9s):
And 21 it would've, but you

3 (2h 25m 10s):
Wouldn't have gotten out of it. You would've

2 (2h 25m 12s):
Taken it No. And ruined your career. You would've taken the money and you would've become a loser.

3 (2h 25m 16s):
No, I'm saying you wouldn't have gone outta the money. You would've taken

2 (2h 25m 17s):
The money. No, you would've taken the money. Yeah. If you're, if you don't have any money when you get money, it is the panacea. It is the elixir. It is the thing that exists that you didn't think was possible. Now all of a sudden you're not worrying about bills, which is 35% of everybody's fucking stress.

3 (2h 25m 33s):
Yes. Those wardens, those prisons are, are, they're convincing themselves. No, no. These are dangerous drug addicts. We can't have 'em on the street. They're convincing themselves. They're not lying. They're like lying

2 (2h 25m 42s):
Themselves. True. Yeah. But you don't even have to convince yourself, man, that's a human dynamic that was exposed in the Stanford prison experiments. Yeah. If you get people and they have power over other people, they start abusing them almost instantly. Like you have to have like a very, especially

17 (2h 25m 56s):
If somebody tells you

2 (2h 25m 57s):
Yes to do it,

3 (2h 25m 59s):
The, those Stanford experiments are all,

5 (2h 26m 0s):
But at the same time, it's like,

2 (2h 26m 2s):
No, they're not totally debunked Ari at terrible of the end of it. These people decided that they'd wanted to get out of it and they got out of it. But the, the real the reality is the way they behaved with each other was documented and

3 (2h 26m 15s):
It was like leading them.

2 (2h 26m 16s):
Yeah. But you couldn't lead me to do that. You could I know. You could

5 (2h 26m 21s):
See that's my, that's my problem

2 (2h 26m 21s):
Is that you couldn't right now, but you could if I was 20,

3 (2h 26m 25s):
He was like, they weren't really convinced and they were like, push harder or go. And it's like, okay. They weren't convinced they were actually doing,

2 (2h 26m 30s):
There's been a lot of weird things about people in power. And one of the weirdest ones, the one of the weirdest ones is there was people that were administrating electrical shock to a person and they were told to do it by someone else. So they did it. and it got to the point where they thought the person might be dying. And some people kept doing it and people, some people did not. And there is, you could get screaming in the, there is a power dynamic that I think allows people to torture people. Yeah. It allows people to kill people. Whether they're, you know, whatever the fuck you are. If you're an Israeli Palestinian, if you're a Palestinian Israeli, you can kill someone.

2 (2h 27m 14s):
They're not even a human. That is the other, yeah. There's a fucking programming that exists in our mind because of all the tribal warfare human beings have gone through over hundreds of thousands of years. When the time we were prehistoric humans, the time we were fucking modern humans. We have been killing each other for so fucking long that we have a program in us where it's easy to other people. That's how the holocaust happened. That's how what's happening in Ukraine is happening. What's happening in Israel is happening. You can decide that someone is something other than a human being and they can get you to do that pretty fucking quickly. If they tap into that mindset, they tap into that programming. They can give you a button.

2 (2h 27m 54s):
They go hit him. But he said, he said he is dying. Hit him. Hit him.

17 (2h 27m 58s):
And they would hear him scream. They, they would have them screaming.

5 (2h 28m 2s):
I have to say, I say this with love. Tom's dad was in the Vietnam War. don don't think Tom's dad was a guy that wanted to ever kill anyone, but he had to in that programming. The thing I think is there's a disconnect with where we as Americans look at things on social media and we think we're not that Karen, we're not that person. We'd never do it. But until you're in that moment, You don't know. You don't know. You really don't

3 (2h 28m 25s):
Know. There's a lot of normal gis in Vietnam that were raping fucking villagers. You know? Probably they didn't go as monsters,

2 (2h 28m 32s):
Bro. They, they

4 (2h 28m 34s):
War does. If

2 (2h 28m 35s):
So can't, if you can't

5 (2h 28m 36s):
Connect, if you can't connect to the fact that that's in you Yeah. That's in you. They also and I think you're lying to

3 (2h 28m 42s):
Me. It's a possibility. You don't,

5 (2h 28m 43s):
The rogue is

4 (2h 28m 44s):
Good when you go into that want one. When you show up, ah, You don't just go, well, I love them. The training you, you do get trained to be a killer. Right. That, that whole speech of like rich, they are training you to see the enemy as the enemy and somebody that you have to kill. Right. So you're, you're, it's not day one, you're prepared over a series of months and it's a version of a brainwashing. They brainwash you to become a killer. And

3 (2h 29m 11s):
Like, this is good. Do it.

2 (2h 29m 12s):
But there's a, there's a pattern that you can follow in your head where you can destroy another human being. The thousand percent. You know? And that's what cast taught.

5 (2h 29m 19s):
I have that

2 (2h 29m 19s):
In me taught Mike Tyson. Yeah. You know, he taught Mike Tyson that through hypnosis. He, he taught him the most effective way to, to, to think and to to view. You don't exist. He was telling him, you're just, the task is the only thing that's important. You don't exist. You don't exist. Wow. Just the task of smashing this person is all that it is. And if you can think like that, that alleviates so much brain power. Wow.

4 (2h 29m 44s):
Alleviates the guilt.

2 (2h 29m 45s):
And if you can tell that to a soldier, you can get 'em to do some wild shit. And they did your dad and they do, your dad

5 (2h 29m 51s):
Talked to you about that.

4 (2h 29m 53s):
Yeah. In the later years. Yeah.

5 (2h 29m 55s):
I'm curious, I would love to hear like the insight your dad had about that as, as a son hearing a dad kill, like going like, yeah, I just had to kill people. My dad's never killed anyone. But just 'cause he was a, he had asthma, but like, but no, no, but I'm curious 'cause we're talking about this like, like what was that? As a son here in the rationale, you have to accept it. You have to figure it out.

4 (2h 30m 20s):
Yeah. And he was a great dad and he was a really kind, loving guy. But I mean fucking First of all. He loved the Marine Corps. He loved the Marine Corps. So

2 (2h 30m 28s):
Well, I would imagine the bonds you make when you're literally fighting for life and death.

4 (2h 30m 33s):
19 also. Yeah. And he had, and he had, you know, if you're a li he's a lieutenant. So he has a, a platoon of 70 men under his command. So you feel also the

2 (2h 30m 41s):
Responsibility,

4 (2h 30m 41s):
The responsibility of take. And like, you know, he told me in the right before he died, like in the last year of his life, that he thought about the men who died his platoon every day. And he had never told me that before. I was like, what? He goes, every day I think about those guys that I lost. And I was like I had, because I had no idea. He never spoke about it. And he would tell me like stories about different, like guys dying next to him, stepping on a mine next to him, exploding three feet from him getting shot. And the worst one he said was a guy that, to watch, to watch movies back then, you'd have to go to like a base, get a film canister and bring it back.

4 (2h 31m 22s):
And in a monsoon season, one of those guys went to get films just for entertainment. And he drowned in a monsoon on the way back. What? So it was, it felt like a more meaningless death. Yeah. He wasn't in combat. Right. Things like that. And he would talk about that. And then also they do become, they, Jesus. They do, they do get this disconnect. If you're in, if you're in combat. Like, it's not like you talking about could you kill someone? It's like you're in a world of killing. That's all that's happening around you.

2 (2h 31m 54s):
It's not could you? You have to. You have

4 (2h 31m 55s):
To. And so then he was just like, yeah, that's when he started telling me, like, because I asked him as a kid, I mean, I ended up doing like a bit about it, trying to make, but I used to ask him as a kid, could you see wars? You see wars? And you're like, you see movies and you're like, did you do that? And as a kid you're not gonna tell a kid. So he was like, no, it didn't work like that. I was in charge like I was a lieutenant. I was like, and then later years, he's like, well, I threw grenades in the bunkers. And I was like, were there people in the bunkers? And he was like, yeah. and I those why waste grenades. Yeah. Yeah. He's like, oh yeah. And then he also said I mean, it became like this joke, but it was true. He said, you know, there's no, there's no better feeling than killing the enemy.

4 (2h 32m 35s):
Right. Like in, in combat. 'cause they're all trying to kill the people around you. Right. And they aren killing people around you. Right. So yeah. He said, you know, he said they would pull bodies out of these holes. The, the Vietnamese were small people stature wise. Yeah. So they would hide in holes a lot of times, like holes in the ground, coochie tunnels. And they would throw grenades into there and then when they'd pull 'em out, they'd be in half. So they'd pull like a torso out, you know? And, but he also said, you know, losing men left and right, like in your platoon I mean it's Dofasting to you. It's like the person you bonded with and, and here's basic

2 (2h 33m 12s):
Training. You're over there for a lie. Yeah.

4 (2h 33m 15s):
I think that's a part that they don't, a lot of people don't ever reconcile with. Yeah. If if they're,

2 (2h 33m 20s):
That's gotta be the hardest. Yeah. You are over there committing atrocities for a lie. Yeah. There's no reason for you to be there. There's like, they're not here. Gulf of Tonkin. You're over there. The Gulf of Tonkin incident wasn't real

4 (2h 33m 33s):
To the Gulf of Tonkin too is something that even active duty people at the time didn't realize till 20, 30 years. You know what I mean? They're not Well that's

2 (2h 33m 43s):
Smedley Butler. The war war is a racket. That's his whole, that article that he wrote from 1933. He was a, you know, very established general at the end of his career. He writes what he was really doing, what he thought he was doing. It was really just like making things safe for bankers. Wow. Controlling resources. And this is 33. Wow. and it's called War is a Racket. Really. I recommend it to

4 (2h 34m 11s):
Anybody. Things you've talked about before.

2 (2h 34m 13s):
I've talked about it every time I can. Because people need to understand these patterns are, they're repeating themselves forever. 'cause they're a part of human behavior patterns. They're these natural pattern patterns that exist in order to enable us to survive. To survive. You have to conquer your enemies. Control resources, establish safe grounds. And that stuff can get outta hand. If that's your whole business. If that's your whole business, you'd be doing that forever. Then you find reasons to go to war.

4 (2h 34m 42s):
That war machine.

2 (2h 34m 43s):
The war machine. Yeah. Eisenhower talked about at the end of his presidential

4 (2h 34m 46s):
Term.

5 (2h 34m 46s):
Yeah. That's how you get to Hillary Clinton.

4 (2h 34m 47s):
It's still still

5 (2h 34m 48s):
Thrown him. Yeah. Wait, is your dad's still alive? Yeah. Is your dad's whole life?

2 (2h 34m 54s):
Yeah. Allegedly.

4 (2h 34m 57s):
You know, my, my uncle. You tell my dad was active duty on the ground. My uncle flew over 600 missions in Vietnam. Damn dropping bombs

2 (2h 35m 6s):
On your mom's. Fuck Vietnam.

4 (2h 35m 8s):
I mean, think about it. Think about it.

5 (2h 35m 11s):
Stand by that.

4 (2h 35m 12s):
Think about those numbers though.

5 (2h 35m 13s):
That's down there

4 (2h 35m 16s):
600 times.

2 (2h 35m 17s):
Jesus Christ. Imagine being the guy in the plane that drops the fucking nuke. The the first nuke.

4 (2h 35m 23s):
Did you ever see the guy that did? And he was like,

5 (2h 35m 26s):
It fucked him up. Oh wow.

4 (2h 35m 27s):
No. One of them was like, that's just what it is. Like he I

5 (2h 35m 30s):
Don, you know, the big thing is they

2 (2h 35m 32s):
Didn't know, but that guy just killed 150,000

5 (2h 35m 36s):
People. But they didn't know if their plane was gonna let be able to ex like, get away from the bomb. They had to go over. So they had to like fucking fly crazy altitudes. Try to get out of the bomb.

2 (2h 35m 45s):
Isn't that crazy? Like, first time you're not exactly sure. Yeah. Did you see Oppenheimer? Yeah. It's amazing.

4 (2h 35m 51s):
I read

5 (2h 35m 52s):
The book. Shut up. No, you don't read. I don't read.

2 (2h 35m 56s):
I don't even read. I do read occasionally. of course you do. But if I read, I read like 10% of what I listen to

5 (2h 36m 2s):
Books on tape. Yeah. But I wish you read for less.

2 (2h 36m 5s):
Huh?

5 (2h 36m 5s):
I wish you read less. Why? It'd be easier to hang out with you.

4 (2h 36m 10s):
Hard to hang

5 (2h 36m 10s):
Out this Joe. You know, too much at you. It's like, I can't, you're like, Laurie

2 (2h 36m 15s):
Knew me when I was stupid. Yeah.

5 (2h 36m 16s):
I know. I wish I got that, that Joe, let's smoke the weed. I got the early Joe, the dumb Joe. That was the my favorite Joe. This Joe, like, before he discovered a book. Oh fuck Yeah. It's not, I remember, I remember when you got curious. I remember it.

2 (2h 36m 28s):
Well. I've been curious forever. We just

5 (2h 36m 29s):
Talked, remember?

2 (2h 36m 30s):
Have I didn't have a platform where I can get people to talk to me.

5 (2h 36m 33s):
As long as you can keep from Moon landings or aliens or pyramids. You're, you're good. Lean said Leanne's always wondered what's it like hanging out with Joe? And I was like, don don't know. It's really hard to explain. And then you hung out with the other night and I don't know what you were talking about because I just stopped listening. But you were like about inclusions and, and and Bob Lazar and, and the

2 (2h 36m 55s):
Fucking Yeah. We were talking about this lady Diana Paska who was on the podcast, who is, she's a religious scholar and she was talking about how there is a, a growing theory that these experienced people are having with UFOs UAPs, alien abductions. That this is not something from another planet. It's something that's always been here. Oh. It's an inter interdimensional being that there's a bunch of different variables that have to come into play for these things to be able to pass forth into our realm. But that they're somehow or another monitoring us and have always been. And that these crash retrievals, they call them donations.

5 (2h 37m 37s):
Best post sex conversation I've ever had. Hope Brogan's. Right. I wanna be angels with you up in heaven. Yeah.

2 (2h 37m 43s):
And my that and

5 (2h 37m 44s):
It was the coolest as fuck. Yeah. She hung with Joe for fucking 10 minutes and then we had sex and she was like, Jesus. She was like, Hey, I love that idea that there's angels are real. It's cool. I

2 (2h 37m 58s):
I think if you stopped and thought about how many cultures believe in some greater power that's above everything that they intuitively know is guiding you in a moral and ethical direction. There's gotta be something to it. Yeah. There's something to

5 (2h 38m 14s):
It. Agree, agree. Suck my dick Louis Cck. You're right. He can suck my dick. He doesn't believe. Why did he suck your dick? Because he doesn't believe in anything.

2 (2h 38m 22s):
Well, that's a fair way to believe. No, you wanna just do it based entirely on evidence. That's a very reasonable perspective's total

5 (2h 38m 28s):
Atheist. Because he is like, you're just making up a reason. It's this. Yeah. But I like that more. I like that more.

2 (2h 38m 34s):
I think the universe is God. That's what I think. Keep going. I think this idea of God creating the universe is silly. I think the whole thing is God. I think it's, it's God in the fact that it's the entire creation of everything that exists that we can measure. All of it is the universe. Yes. And if you read the Bible, the Bible talks about in the beginning and there was light. Boy that sounds a lot like the Big Bang boy that sounds a lot like the Birth of the universe. I think these fucking people that wrote the Bible were recounting stories that were told down through people that had a scientific understanding of the birth and death of the universe. Just like we do now. maybe even more than we do now. And then they got hit by asteroids. And then it was thousands of years before civilization reestablished itself.

2 (2h 39m 16s):
And the stories had been told down, handed down forever and ever. And by the time people wrote them down, they were goofy. And they were goofy. and it was like God created the earth in six days. And the whole story of Adam and Eve. And there's probably a lot to all of it. That's true. and it, it's probably a historical record that was told to people that were essentially barbarians, that were surviving from the collapse of a superior civilization superior to what we have today. And there's a lot of real physical evidence of that. There's a lot of archeological evidence of that. and it seems to be a, a direction that a lot of people are headed into when they understand how often we get hit with asteroids. Somewhere around 11,800 years ago, we got pelted and it stopped civilization in its tracks.

2 (2h 40m 1s):
And we had a rebuild from scratch. And the people that survived were probably monsters. Monsters. The Mongols and the fucking hoards and the barbarians. They were the most harsh people. 'cause that was the only way you survived. 'cause there was no longer a technologically advanced civilization. It was all just barbarism. And there's very few animals to eat. 'cause there's a nuclear winter because the sky is filled with foot. The the impact of this massive meteor that slams into earth and kills 70% of all the people. And then about 6,000 years later, they start figuring out mathematics again. Wow.

5 (2h 40m 41s):
This is why listening to this podcast,

2 (2h 40m 43s):
That's what I think.

4 (2h 40m 44s):
What do you think as a, you grew up religious, huh? What is your take on God? And

5 (2h 40m 49s):
You gave up your Lord.

3 (2h 40m 51s):
Yeah. They said, they said the years were different. So when they said it was created 5,000 years ago, they're like, that's our understanding of the years. Yeah. They're like, this guy's, this, this, oh, this guy lived Of course 260. But they're like, that's just don don't know. Some seasons passed when

2 (2h 41m 4s):
They wrote that they didn't even have a sun dial

3 (2h 41m 6s):
Dial. Right. So they're like, how do, how old are you? Like I don't, we don't if calendars, but

4 (2h 41m 9s):
Are you a believer in a higher power? No.

5 (2h 41m 11s):
No. Why? What do you mean? Why? What happens when you die?

3 (2h 41m 14s):
There's no why to a belief.

5 (2h 41m 15s):
Why do you, when what happens when you die?

3 (2h 41m 17s):
When you die? I won't forget you.

5 (2h 41m 19s):
Nah. But when I die, I'll be, remember Harold, you know, I've worked really hard so that doesn't happen. You know, that's one, one of my biggest things about working is I wonder, 'cause you d they say you die twice. You die when you die. And then you die when the last person that remembers you dies. I try to,

3 (2h 41m 34s):
This is the, I try to go to graveyards. I try to like look at the graveyards and see who they are and try to Nate say their name and keep 'em alive a little longer.

5 (2h 41m 39s):
Whoa. Yeah. Yeah. That's creepy.

3 (2h 41m 42s):
Hmm. So there's not a second death.

5 (2h 41m 43s):
Sometimes I call my dead friends on their cell phone numbers. Did they ever answer? Nope.

3 (2h 41m 48s):
They never got that number again. That's

5 (2h 41m 50s):
Interesting. Yeah. I Why I I, I don't like the death thing. don don't believe in it. But don don't, don't believe in death. Yeah. It has never

2 (2h 41m 57s):
Happened to me. I have one, I have one phone that I keep active 'cause I have a text message chain from Anthony Bourdain and a voicemail from a buddy of mine who died.

3 (2h 42m 8s):
A pool player.

2 (2h 42m 9s):
No. Dave Dolan my, and a private investigator friend who was the funniest guy I ever met that never did stand up. Hmm. He, I was a amateur comic and he was a private investigator that lost his driver's license. 'cause he was drunk driving, so he needed an assistant. And so he asked, we really just needed someone to drive him. And so I was like private investigator's assistant. That'd be a cool job. Yeah. So I, I just start working for this guy and he died a few years back when he left me a voicemail. It was fucking awesome.

5 (2h 42m 37s):
What was the last text Anthony Bourdain sent you?

2 (2h 42m 41s):
Oh, that's a good question. Please let him call

5 (2h 42m 43s):
You the

2 (2h 42m 43s):
First. No, there was a, there was a restaurant and I, I took a photo of this chef that was prominently figured on the wall. I go, who's this guy? and it is Marco Pierre White. You know who he is? Google that guy. He's one of the most extraordinary chefs that's like ever existed. He's, he's like a true artistic Genius That's a chef.

5 (2h 43m 11s):
Where's he based

2 (2h 43m 12s):
Out of? He English. He's inspired. Yeah. He is English. He's amazing. He's a really fascinating guy. There's a a ton of videos of him talking about food and talk. The the way he approaches food is the way, you know, Rembrandt approached paintings. Wow. Love I mean. He's a I love this guy. He's a wizard. I mean he's legitimate. He's 100% all in. I believe now the way he's, he, he sets up these insane restaurants and I think one of them he's using now from a farm, if I remember correctly, that like he runs, he's, he's certainly done that in the past where they source all their ingredients, everything

4 (2h 43m 47s):
From that love,

2 (2h 43m 48s):
Love it, love it. And you know, they set the, they set the menu. I mean, it's just, it's cuisine taken to a level of precision that it just, just doesn't, it's not just food.

4 (2h 44m 1s):
The food experience I had in Asia, by the way, it was unbelievable.

2 (2h 44m 4s):
Yeah, I saw your post. It

4 (2h 44m 6s):
Was unbelievable.

2 (2h 44m 7s):
So how did you know where to go? Food

4 (2h 44m 8s):
Guy? A lot of it was that Philip Lee was there, or a friend. Philip Lee, the chef. Oh, he was in Tokyo. Tell you where to go.

2 (2h 44m 15s):
Oh, that's

4 (2h 44m 16s):
Amazing. He had been there a month.

2 (2h 44m 17s):
Oh, that's

4 (2h 44m 18s):
Amazing. And so he, like, we went to an omae sushi place for lunch that I was like, this is absolutely insane. A tapan yaki place at a hotel. Here's the well are the things, oh, my dick's hard. Oh my God. So tapan like, fuck. Oh, he said this thing that I was like, oh, I didn't realize this. That in the states, a lot of times when you stay at a hotel, you go, we gotta get outta the hotel to find something good to eat. Right. Like the hotel restaurant, you're like, no way is shit. Yeah. But the, the thing in Tokyo is that hotels, like your, your fucking Hyatt hotel has a restaurant that you're like, I wish I could eat here every night.

4 (2h 44m 60s):
Like the food, the, you know, it's that thing of like, the ingredient is the star. So like a salad. You, you have a basic salad. The tomato is like the best tomato you've ever had. The lettuce. Well they, yeah, we had king crab. They go, you want king crab at this teki place? And I was like, yeah, I like king crab. And I'm thinking of it all the times. I've had it before. And they bring it out raw. It had just been brought in from a ship earlier that day. And then they just season it. Put a little butter on the, like the griddle there and prepare it. It was the best. I, I'd never had anything like that before. The Wagyu Mafia, which is like a theater performance. It's six top six tabletop and it's just 13 different variations of Wagyu beef.

4 (2h 45m 45s):
Wow. I mean. And then we went to Hong Kong and we had, there's this place called New Punjab Club. It's one star Michelin place Indian food. That was What's one star mean? So one star first level. It's like, yeah, there's three star possibilities. So one star is that This is, if it's, if it's accessible to you, it's worth going to eat here. Okay. Two stars is like, it's worth going outta your way to eat here. Three stars is, it's worth making a trip to go to this place just to eat here. Oh

3 (2h 46m 14s):
Fuck. We went to one of those.

4 (2h 46m 15s):
So the ones, yeah, we went to a three star in Singapore that was called Zen. That was just unbelievable. But in Hong Kong, that Indian place, their kitchen was smaller than the space we're in right now. Whoa. And they had a

2 (2h 46m 29s):
How many seats?

4 (2h 46m 30s):
They had probably six tables. Wow. And they had a, a cylinder, like a ceramic cylinder. And they brought us into the kitchen with coal down there and they just take sticks and they put 'em in there with chicken and beef and everything. and it gets to like, fuck don. Don't know how many thousand degrees in there, but every dish came out and you're like, this is every, everything we ate was like, this is the best thing I've ever eaten. You know. Wow. But the three star in Singapore really was one of those experiences where the experience starts when you walk in. When

3 (2h 47m 0s):
You walk in, you know,

The reason this podcast is what it is today in, in, in all fairness, is because of that fucking show. But it's also because of Jim.

5 (3h 1m 29s):
Hey, what's going on?

4 (3h 1m 30s):
What did you fly to I that episode?

2 (3h 1m 32s):
Oh no. While the show was happening. Yeah,

4 (3h 1m 34s):
Yeah, yeah. And,

2 (3h 1m 35s):
And You didn realized your mic was on

4 (3h 1m 36s):
Kind of, and then You didn

5 (3h 1m 39s):
Get radio

4 (3h 1m 40s):
And Ricky and I just kept talking. And then I'd look over and I'd see the guys like, what are you fucking doing? Yeah.

5 (3h 1m 46s):
It was, you might be the most epically in retrospect, horrific Comic Taber do radio. What? Without a doubt. 'cause Tom has never given a fuck about anything ever in his life. Ever. Oh God. So when you did Tom, when you did Bob and Tom, they like write out your things. You wanna say it? Tom was like, I'll just figure it out. Yeah. I never do that. I never gave

2 (3h 2m 7s):
A fuck. They asked me to do that too. I'm like, I'm not doing that. I'm the producer. Get really upset. I got upset. Sucked too. They upset. Like, and I go, we're gonna figure it out. Yeah. They,

5 (3h 2m 16s):
I'm not that kind of comic.

2 (3h 2m 17s):
They didn't like it. This is nonsense. You're doing some 1985 nonsense. They didn't like that at all. And this is not 1985. Get outta here. They

4 (3h 2m 25s):
Were nice, but they were,

5 (3h 2m 25s):
Tom was doing that before anyone else. Like I with Absolute Love, when you see all the comics coming on and fucking up radio and, and and TV that they're doing now, it's a little bit based on the fact that you really did not give a fuck.

2 (3h 2m 41s):
Hang on. A lot of guys didn't including Tracy Morgan. Oh, Tracy

5 (3h 2m 45s):
Morgan. Hold on. Tracy Morgan. Better than anyone. Better

2 (3h 2m 48s):
Than Bunny out. Ms. Belly was like, someone's getting pregnant. Someone's getting pregnant. He would be slapping his, that's my main call.

4 (3h 2m 55s):
My philosophy on it was basically, I think podcasts, radio, television, all go, can go really well based on the hosts interest. Yeah. And so what I had was, I had a real like, personal fuck you to a host that was like, don don't really care who you are or what you're doing here. I'm just, this is what we do. And so if they were like, you're at the club this week, I would go, yeah. Right. And then they were like, be funny. and I'd be like, why don't you go suck your fucking mom's dick? And, and, and then they would go like, what happen happen?

5 (3h 3m 33s):
That's a business partner

2 (3h 3m 34s):
Right there. So that's why you came out with DJ Dad mouth.

4 (3h 3m 37s):
That's what's, that was why DJ Dad Mouth came out, was

2 (3h 3m 38s):
Like, so it came out to this specific person

4 (3h 3m 41s):
That came out just because I was like, don don't wanna do this. I, don,

5 (3h 3m 44s):
Or TV never did anything.

4 (3h 3m 45s):
I don't wanna do this. It

2 (3h 3m 46s):
Never helped you Contractually obligated. They just make

4 (3h 3m 50s):
You, so what they would end up doing is, the funny bones would go, Hey, if you would, if you would do this, you know, we, we bring people every week, no matter whether they're big or small selling tickets or not. So like when I started to sell tickets, they'd be like, oh, oh. They go, oh, your shows are sold out this week. I'd be like, cool, and you're doing Good Morning Hartford tomorrow. And I'd be like, why? And it'd like, because we do it every week. And I'd go, but it's not to sell tickets. Right? 'cause the tickets are sold, it's just to promote the club. Yeah. So they're like, no, but get up at five and go do it. and I Amm like, alright. So that kind of came from that. But before that, I'm saying like, like even like I did Kimmel last night, you, when you go there, you're like, all right, I'm gonna like, you know, you do a pre-interview with a producer, still rides on the fact that he's engaged and wants it to go well.

4 (3h 4m 38s):
Yeah. Right. And so, and he totally was. and it was really fun and it went well. But in the radio days, a lot of times those radio hosts, sometimes there's like the, the, the Philly guys, Preston, Steve Preston, Steve. Yeah. So they, they come in like, you come in and they're like, they, they know questions. They know what you've been doing. Yeah. Yeah. So that makes the experience fun. They're fun,

5 (3h 4m 60s):
They're happy to see you.

4 (3h 5m 0s):
They're fun, they're great. But you go into places where they're just like, they're literally like, you're born in Cincinnati and you go Yeah. And they'll go

5 (3h 5m 9s):
Trying

4 (3h 5m 9s):
To lead you. So like, yeah. So tell us something about that. And you're like, what? So I, it's a place I didn't go, oh, in Ohio, if I left that place and you, the host were like, I didn't really like you, I'd be like, I don't give a shit that you don't like me. I'm not here to fucking dance with you,

5 (3h 5m 24s):
Man. You have rid that horse into the grave. I love that about you. Is that, you gotta remember, this is before when you were doing that, the only white, no one white, white person was doing that. Tracy Morgan as a famous person would go in and be wild on, on thing and, and everyone would fucking love. We'd share with each

4 (3h 5m 43s):
Other. Yeah. Tracy was the best.

5 (3h 5m 44s):
Tom was doing it in earnest, like, fuck off everyone can. and I knew at the same time I was gonna the same places. And being like, oh God, please play a Tracy Morgan one.

18 (3h 5m 57s):
Look at me on that. Look at that. I'm handsome. Now I can see why I got so many kids. Texas El Paso. I'm telling you, man, I went to Jaguars last night. I love the ladies here. Oh wow. Yeah. Oh my God.

4 (3h 6m 9s):
Yeah. So again, not

18 (3h 6m 10s):
Family entertainment necessarily. Somebody gonna get pregnant. Somebody gonna get pregnant while I'm in town. Two days, watch two days somebody gonna get pregnant.

5 (3h 6m 18s):
So yeah,

18 (3h 6m 19s):
Trace,

4 (3h 6m 20s):
It's always these guys, you know, it's, it's the same guy in every market. Like, oh boy.

5 (3h 6m 23s):
Yeah. But they're loving it. They're loving it. And Tom will go in and do that, but he would do it his own way, you know? and it was so fucking awesome, man. Well, because so many of us, myself included, would just suck a dick and be like, we're 22.

4 (3h 6m 39s):
No, I I don, I disagree. What you would do is you would go in, you'd go with, with fun energy, you'd go in Papa Jack and you go let go. And you go, I'm gonna make this fun.

5 (3h 6m 46s):
I would drink on those.

4 (3h 6m 47s):
You go, yeah. Blow in his, you go, come

That was

3 (3h 7m 56s):
Fucking No, it's just completed, I think is the damn. Oh, but

4 (3h 7m 58s):
Here's the best. I just remember this. The best radio one was when I went in. Did you ever have somebody and they go sit here and they're doing a thing, just waiting. We're Yeah, you're just waiting. And they are, we're coming back from break. Alright. So then they walk you in the room and they sit you here. Then the guy could not be less interested. He's like reading the paper.

5 (3h 8m 18s):
What radio station

4 (3h 8m 20s):
Tell it. So he's, it's in the northeast. It's a long time ago. But he goes, he goes, all right, we, we will be back from the break in 30 seconds and I go, okay. He goes, then just take over and I go. What? He goes, just take over and I go, what are you talking about? And he goes, it's just your show. You have shows this weekend. Just do whatever you wanna do. and I go, I'm not gonna do anything. And then it's like 10 seconds. He's like, what do you mean you're not gonna do anything? I go, I'm not gonna do anything. I go, if You don't ask me something, I'm not gonna say that single fucking word. And he goes, and he goes, he goes, all respect. He goes, Bobby Lee was here last week and he took all his clothes off and I go, how'd that play on radio? Was that a fucking hit for your audience?

4 (3h 9m 0s):
And then it was like, you're on. And this guy was fucking scrambling, like

3 (3h 9m 5s):
Freaking out.

4 (3h 9m 6s):
He read my fake bio because fake bio, I had a fake bio. Yeah,

5 (3h 9m 10s):
That's his internet

4 (3h 9m 11s):
Footprint. So it was all like made up and it was like, you played for the Bengals. And I was like, yeah. He was like, he was, so he's asking me all the fake questions and he is in a full, starts sweating. He starts sweating and he has this co-host who doesn't know how to also navigate, but they were just, to me they embodied like lazy, disinterested, and, you know. Yeah. They were like unhappy in this market doing what they do. And they were just like, take over. And I was like, fuck you, fuck

3 (3h 9m 39s):
You. Yeah.

5 (3h 9m 39s):
The best thing that's great to it's best

3 (3h 9m 41s):
Thing about him, I would've scrambled.

5 (3h 9m 42s):
He really doesn't give a fuck.

3 (3h 9m 43s):
You just go, no, that's not

5 (3h 9m 44s):
Cool. You realize how many times me and you, yeah. Maybe, maybe I'm saying maybe not me and you, but like just went in and did the dance. Yeah. And that's why I, that's, I, I, I, I'm, I look up to you. 'cause it's the coolest thing about you is that you really don't give a fuck. That is nice. It's so cool to not give a fuck. It's so sexy. Like, it's not when you give a fuck, it's a little sad sometimes. You know? I think I give a fuck about certain things. You don't give a fuck. Yeah.

3 (3h 10m 13s):
Yeah. Right. But what you don't give a

5 (3h 10m 14s):
Fuck about Tom don don't be give fuck. You do not give a fuck. You do not give a fuck.

2 (3h 10m 20s):
You give the perfect amount of fucks. Yeah.

5 (3h 10m 22s):
I think it's like a balance. No,

2 (3h 10m 23s):
It's the right balance.

5 (3h 10m 24s):
No, it's detrimental shit.

2 (3h 10m 26s):
To what?

5 (3h 10m 26s):
To him.

2 (3h 10m 27s):
How so? Why

5 (3h 10m 28s):
If I read his comments, I'd be like, start giving a fuck.

2 (3h 10m 30s):
Yeah. But who's writing those comments? You can't read comments. I do. The, the people that are writing them. You're getting a disproportionate amount of failures. You're getting a disproportionate amount of people. Positive ones are just Yeah, for sure. But it's not, it's not. If you're trying to get like a control study of the population, general population. If you're doing a pharmac pharmaceutical study, pharmac, you have a bunch of old people, bunch of young people, different walks of life, you're gonna do it right. You, you, you do it with a bunch of biological variability. The variability of people that are wanting to comment negatively online is like, you could find those people. You don't have to shit together mess. That's the

5 (3h 11m 6s):
People with dizziness.

2 (3h 11m 8s):
Some of 'em are kids. Just

3 (3h 11m 9s):
Ignore them. Yeah.

2 (3h 11m 10s):
A lot of 'em are kids Look at the positive ones. They're real young. Some of 'em, they think it's fun. They don't, they're trying to get a reaction. They don't know what to do. They just try to like shit on you and see if you respond. It's a nonsense way to communicate. It is

5 (3h 11m 22s):
Nonsense

2 (3h 11m 22s):
Waste. You don who they are. You don't know what their background is. You don't know whether their opinion is valid. You're accepting negativity. And human beings have a, a natural propensity to look towards negative things because your brain is programmed to look for intruders and dangerous things. Yeah. So you could look at a hundred people in your village that you love. You see one person that doesn't love you to stand on a hillside, you know, 50 yards away and you get scared. Sure. Like, oh shit, what's that? And that's what that is. That's what comments are. It's just you're, you're hijacking your natural system. That's

5 (3h 11m 54s):
Why I love,

3 (3h 11m 54s):
I think even the positive ones are bad. He's why

2 (3h 11m 56s):
I love him.

5 (3h 11m 56s):
He says, no, no, no. Because I, I remember I, there was a time I was getting negative. Well, when the movie came out, I was getting a lot of negative shit. And I texted Tommy I was like, can you just take a look at it and see if it's real? You know, because I don't, I can't look at it. It fucks me up. So I just stopped looking at it. I hired someone to do it for me, but I I don't trust them. Read. No, no, no, no, no. Just to, you're monitor them. And then Tommy read them and he was like, that's actually kind of sweet. You were like, it's not that bad. And I was like, oh, for real? And he was like, yeah, I love that. You gotta find a, you gotta, you're

2 (3h 12m 32s):
Gonna have a certain amount of people that fucking hate everything. 'cause

3 (3h 12m 36s):
You're big hate everything.

2 (3h 12m 36s):
Like we were talking in the green room the other night. I was talking about this person who wrote this. They were talking about all time great guitarist. And they said Hendricks was mostly noise. Yeah. They're like, that is the craziest fucking thing I've ever heard to

3 (3h 12m 49s):
Anybody's. It's trying to be abrasive. It's like, no, you like him. You just don't like him as much as everyone else does.

2 (3h 12m 53s):
No, it's just, just a, it's a contrarian perspective.

4 (3h 12m 57s):
A lot of people like to do that too. Yeah.

3 (3h 12m 59s):
This guy, shit on the thing is the best. Like anything, they don't suck. They just, you think they're a b plus.

4 (3h 13m 3s):
It's also fun. Don't think it's fun sometimes. Sometimes just to provoke. Yeah.

3 (3h 13m 6s):
It is

5 (3h 13m 7s):
Me not, no, not me. Not me. You definitely, you are. Yeah.

4 (3h 13m 10s):
It's fun. Yeah. You're number one at that.

5 (3h 13m 12s):
You love

3 (3h 13m 12s):
It just to provoke. Just like, lemme get a rise

2 (3h 13m 14s):
Outta you. Yeah. It's a fun way to initiate a conversation. Yeah, yeah.

5 (3h 13m 18s):
Yeah. Not, not me. I like, I just, I cruise by. Try to keep my head down.

2 (3h 13m 25s):
Read those comments, huh? No,

5 (3h 13m 26s):
You

3 (3h 13m 27s):
Should. Yes you do. You just said you did.

5 (3h 13m 28s):
No, no, no. No. Tommy's comments. Read Tommy's comments. You

2 (3h 13m 31s):
Don't read

5 (3h 13m 31s):
Yours. No, I do. Not ever.

2 (3h 13m 33s):
Not ever. Never. Every now and then. Never late at night taking a shit. Three in the morning.

5 (3h 13m 38s):
Never shut, open

4 (3h 13m 39s):
Up that phone. Never

5 (3h 13m 39s):
Read yours. I never, I'm

2 (3h 13m 41s):
Pretty happy about this

5 (3h 13m 42s):
Post

2 (3h 13m 42s):
So that I can, lemme see if it's positive. Lemme see if people have a good thing. Do you read it all? Didn say No. No.

5 (3h 13m 48s):
So wait, why would you believe I didn't?

2 (3h 13m 50s):
'cause I'm different than you.

5 (3h 13m 51s):
How so

2 (3h 13m 52s):
Don't you think? Nope. You don't think you think we're the same. I

5 (3h 13m 56s):
Think we're so similar.

2 (3h 13m 57s):
That's fascinating buddy.

5 (3h 13m 58s):
Me and you. If we slept in bed together, we'd fight over the sheets. don

2 (3h 14m 2s):
Don't think so. I I'm not a sheet fighter. We

5 (3h 14m 5s):
Get him then I would be up. and

2 (3h 14m 7s):
I would want you to have an equitable amount of the sheets is if I would assume there's enough sheets for two people.

5 (3h 14m 12s):
What part of you? You're on a twin. What part of you? You have to identify with me a little bit because I know I drive you nuts.

2 (3h 14m 17s):
That's

5 (3h 14m 18s):
Interesting. I know I drive you nuts at times and I know. How

2 (3h 14m 20s):
Do you guys feel about what he's saying?

5 (3h 14m 22s):
The

4 (3h 14m 23s):
End of it about you guys being

2 (3h 14m 24s):
With the same thing?

4 (3h 14m 26s):
I mean. No, I, I think there's similarities in everyone, but I think you're pretty different people.

5 (3h 14m 32s):
I think like,

2 (3h 14m 33s):
As far removed as can stay in my friend group.

4 (3h 14m 41s):
Here's the, I I told you what I

5 (3h 14m 43s):
Told you what I think. Can I tell you? Can I tell you how I feel about look down? Can I tell you how I feel? Let's stare down. Can I tell you how I feel you when Nate Diaz says I didn't get bullied. I had a big brother. Right? I think like you're, you're my big brother.

2 (3h 14m 58s):
Aw sweetie. I do.

5 (3h 14m 60s):
I I feel like I have a big brother. I've said that to you and I've said that to you. I

4 (3h 15m 4s):
Think you guys approach things very differently.

5 (3h 15m 6s):
We do. and I think I I think I drive you fucking nuts. No you don't. Sometimes to, I have I know. I drive me

2 (3h 15m 11s):
Nuts. I you drove me nuts during Sober October, you

3 (3h 15m 13s):
Bring out his competitive spirit, you

5 (3h 15m 15s):
Bring that

2 (3h 15m 15s):
There's a fucking monster in there and you let him outta the cage.

5 (3h 15m 19s):
But I love your monster. Yeah. Like the way a younger brother would like needling his big brother. I like your monster.

4 (3h 15m 26s):
Here's the big, like one of the big things I think is super different is that he approaches things of like, alright, if I wanna be proficient at this thing, I'm gonna do it all the every day. 'cause that's how you get good. The consistency and the discipline. Yeah. And you go, you know what? I think I can wing this shit and be pretty

5 (3h 15m 47s):
Good at

4 (3h 15m 47s):
It. Yeah. And that's one of the big like philosophical differences of how you approach life.

5 (3h 15m 51s):
Yeah. But I, but I, but I, listen, I listen to your podcast all the time and I love. He does. and I love the way your brain thinks. I would never listen to my podcast, but like, I like the way your brain thinks. I'm

2 (3h 16m 3s):
Just curious. That's the way my brain thinks. I'm always just trying to figure out why I think what I think and why this other person thinks what they think. But I do that.

5 (3h 16m 11s):
That's what I'm doing. I do the same in a flip-flop. Like, I like the way your brain thinks, but it's not the way my brain thinks. I have no discipline. I don't like discipline. That's

2 (3h 16m 19s):
One of the cool things about hanging out with different walks of life. You obviously become very successful with claiming you have no discipline. You,

4 (3h 16m 26s):
You do discipline.

2 (3h 16m 27s):
You don't discipline. You work all

5 (3h 16m 29s):
You discip. You know what secret time that I go to you, I lean on you for like, in times of real need. Like when I, when I was with my cardiologist and I was like, Hey man, I'm lost. don don't know what to do. And you were like, Cardi carnivore. And, and so I I do that, I do that. But the problem is, and I would say this, honest honestly just to Ari privately. But like, we knew you before you were you like, we knew you before this thing. Right? So like, I know you I know I know you and I know who you've become And, and I I obviously respect that. I really do. But I, but like my my Joe Guy I knew is you is you and Right.

5 (3h 17m 12s):
But I I

2 (3h 17m 12s):
Don. I don't think I've changed that much. No.

3 (3h 17m 15s):
It it's a perception of you that's changed. Yeah. Yeah. And so everyone else falls into that with a lot of famous people. They fall into what they think of someone. Sure. But then, and so they don't get treated as who they really are.

2 (3h 17m 24s):
I, I think I've improved my perspective on things and the way I treat people. But,

5 (3h 17m 28s):
But you've grown. I'm the same person. You're a better person. I mean honestly. You're an amazing person. But, but I will always know you as the dude that walked me into his house. I will never know you as this thing. Like, this thing is pretty fucking insane. It's

3 (3h 17m 44s):
Just like cool for you. But that's not,

2 (3h 17m 45s):
But my version of it is fairly small. You've

3 (3h 17m 49s):
Been pretty good at keeping, keeping

2 (3h 17m 50s):
Your heads clear. That's because I, I hang around with the same people. I go to the club, I go to home. That's the key ingredient I work out. I do all I have to do. It's not just that I have new friends. It's just like I, I fucking torture myself. So like, my perspective is balanced. Yeah. Like the worst thing that happens during my day is probably not as bad as what I've done to myself. So like I go into every day with like a baseline. Like I can handle shit that

5 (3h 18m 16s):
Hasn't changed in you at all.

2 (3h 18m 17s):
No. That's the best way to regulate things like what Henry Rollins was saying in that essay. It's the best way to regulate things. Yeah. It's the, the best way to keep a perspective on things. You don't want to become a tyrant. You don't want to become like enamored with power and enamored with influence. I, I'm not interested in that.

3 (3h 18m 34s):
You're not a guy who says, do you know who I am?

2 (3h 18m 36s):
I'm not interested in that. But you don't need to. I say that if You don't, if You don't know who I, if you don't know who I am, I'm happy. I would love to talk to a dude who doesn't know me. That's my favorite. It's be shocking. That's gonna be shocking. My God. It'd be fun. Talk to, to talk

5 (3h 18m 47s):
To someone. When was the last time you had that? Or someone was like, because you can tell sometimes what do you do for a living? What

4 (3h 18m 52s):
Someone has

2 (3h 18m 53s):
No idea. I know. Because sometimes people bullshit you. It's great. It's great. Sometimes people pretend they don know who you

5 (3h 18m 57s):
Are. Tommy's got friends that I've met that I go, what do you do for a living? and I get fucking angry and I go, how do you not know who I am? That dentist or whatever. The guy lives next door to you. Yeah. So, so what do you do for a living? Fucking shut down.

2 (3h 19m 14s):
I had this fancy, fancy lunch once with Eric von Danin. I love it. Eric Weinstein invited me to this lunch with Eric Von Danin. Eric von Danin is the one who wrote The Chariots of the Gods. He wrote that book about ancient aliens coming down here and like building the pyramids and all this wild shit. And he knew that I was gonna, he knew I knew everything about this guy. I knew everything about his book. I knew I watched his documentary multiple times. I've seen all the criticisms about it. and I want to have this conversation with him and find out why he thinks the way he thinks. But when he said, what do you do for a living? Because he didn't know who I was. I was like, I'm a comedian. And Weinstein started laughing and, and he goes, well he's, you know, I go, I'm a comedian.

5 (3h 19m 57s):
And

2 (3h 19m 57s):
He started explaining the podcast and all that different stuff. But I was like, I just, just tell me what you think. Tell me what you think of why you think. Sure. But if you ask me what I do, it's

20 (3h 20m 6s):
Gonna change the answer.

2 (3h 20m 7s):
Yeah. It's also, it's like, I like that he didn't know who I was. like, this is wonderful. Yeah. This is wonderful. Like this is a nice conversation. Totally. and I and respectfully, why do you believe this and why do you ignore all the evidence that seems to lean to an advanced civilization that built this and that we're, we have a rebuilding of advanced civilizations today that's much more plausible. But he's, his whole business is sort of, once you have an initial assertion and you write a book about it and you make a documentary about it, everybody's gonna say like, that's, you can't change your opinion. Right. Because that book's still on the shelf. I bought your fucking book. Your book's bullshit. The book's. What I thought back then, I didn't know any better.

2 (3h 20m 46s):
Right. But that was a good one. It's

20 (3h 20m 49s):
Fun meeting somebody You don. You don't know who they are.

2 (3h 20m 52s):
I know everything about him. Oh really? I, I had studied him for so long. I had studied his film. I'd watched his film multiple times. 'cause his film asks real questions like, how the fuck did they do this? There's some, some stones in Lebanon and some fucking crazy quarried stones. It's like, how the fuck were they planning on moving this where they had a band in the stone? 'cause there was a crack in it. And so they moved on. So they have the evidence of how they actually quarry these things. don

4 (3h 21m 21s):
Don't understand those, all those ancient quarries like structures when you think about what it takes, how we build things today. And you see these things built and it's like a hundred thousand pound stone.

2 (3h 21m 33s):
It's the best evidence that people were more advanced back then. Exactly.

4 (3h 21m 36s):
And then you go, and then not only is it like together, whereas it's seamless between two, you can't put a piece of paper between them. It's

5 (3h 21m 43s):
All aqueduct.

2 (3h 21m 45s):
They, what they did, what they did was probably follow a line of innovation that's different from the line we

4 (3h 21m 54s):
Followed. One that we can't really Right. Relate to data

3 (3h 21m 57s):
Vs.

2 (3h 21m 57s):
We followed, we followed combustion engines, industrial evolution, manufacturing at a large scale. That's what we followed. Yeah. What they followed is probably something very different

4 (3h 22m 6s):
That we Yeah. So we just, it

2 (3h 22m 8s):
Probably, it probably had to do with frequencies and sound and how you could pour through bore through stone. They had diamond drills.

3 (3h 22m 16s):
Do you think if they saw our stuff they'd be like, what the

2 (3h 22m 18s):
Fuck? Yeah. They'd probably be like weird out by the internet. Oh yeah. If they didn't have it. But the thing is like if you have electronics and you leave them on the ground, they're, they don't exist in a hundred years. They will get absorbed by the earth within a thousand years. There's no Trace. You'll find the minerals that are in the, the, the batteries and all that stuff. That'll all break down. There'll be nothing left. Wow. There's not, if you watched buildings that were in Detroit that people abandoned and you see trees growing through those buildings quickly, quickly, quickly. Man houses, cars, you see a car that gets left in the woods, it just gets broken down to rust. And within a thousand years there will be nothing.

2 (3h 22m 59s):
So if there was some shit that existed, like the conventional dating of the gray pyramid is 2,500 BC that, that's under heavy speculation. The real belief is that it's probably the guys from John Anthony West and Graham Hancock and Randall Carlson. They point towards a, a possibility of a super sophisticated civilization. More than 11,000 bc.

4 (3h 23m 23s):
See, I think that's the thing that I've never really consi No really considered is that you always go, oh, they had like an archaic system that just worked. Right. Like levees and pulls and No, you know what I mean, but what they had like full electronics and like, and I never considered that. Guns and stuff never

3 (3h 23m 40s):
Considered that shit dude. Right. You think we're, we have to be the best. We

2 (3h 23m 42s):
Have to be instead

3 (3h 23m 43s):
Of this

2 (3h 23m 43s):
Start over, start over, start over the way they move things, they move things that were thousands of pounds. It's

4 (3h 23m 51s):
Crazy through, through the

2 (3h 23m 52s):
Mountains.

3 (3h 23m 52s):
If another 500 years passed from here, how much technology will advance if that all gets wiped out, it'll get started over and we'll be at our level. Exactly. and it be like, well they were massive events. Exactly. I'm the same way as you. It's like it doesn't make sense.

2 (3h 24m 3s):
Exactly. So you have, because you think of like, if everything collapsed right

4 (3h 24m 6s):
Now carrying a rock,

2 (3h 24m 7s):
Right? Yeah. If we just had to live from now on, the human race evolves from the, the genes of the preppers. The what if that's it. Preppers people that have fuckings in their fucking backyards and canned peaches and that fucking, you know that. Who's that? That religious guy that sells survival food on tv. You know those? They have Jim Bakker. Oh yeah, yeah. Remember bucket buckets. Buckets of survival food, buckets of food. You could use this as a stand for your table. They're eating at the dinner table with like buckets of survival food under it

4 (3h 24m 41s):
At the time. Bucket prep. Yeah. Yeah,

2 (3h 24m 43s):
Yeah. If you know, if you're one of those dudes, man. And that's all that lives. Yeah. These survival prep I mean, how long would it take one of these dullards in the crowd? Look at these dull minded gray brained people. Look at the, what are these, what are the chance that those people gonna invent the fucking

3 (3h 25m 1s):
That's your joke. If I like if I dropped you off from the middle of the woods with a hatchet, how long till you could send me an email? Yeah.

2 (3h 25m 7s):
Close. It'd be millions of years. Wow. Yeah. If you had access to all the tools that people ever created. Yeah. Look at that stove. Fuck is that, where is that When Jamie, what Fuck

8 (3h 25m 15s):
Egypt? The unfinished bolus. So like in theory they would have

3 (3h 25m 18s):
Raised it up, taken

2 (3h 25m 19s):
It out of there somehow. So, so there was an ois. They cut into the stone and they had the technology to not only cut that, but unfortunately some of that stone would crack and they would've to abandon it. But they have to pick it up and move it hundreds of miles. Wow. And they did it routinely. There's

4 (3h 25m 37s):
No way to like grasp that unless you think the technology was other level. Like

2 (3h 25m 44s):
Not only that, dude, there's a lot of evidence that even the great pyramid is a more recent creation to some of the older kingdom work. The deeper they go into the sand on some of the structures, they'll find like as they, they start excavating that there's another structure underneath it. And then they uncover that and the older they uncover them, it seems like the larger the stones were, the more complex the systems were. Whoa. It's y old shit man. These people were doing something a long fucking time ago. And if you listen to guys like Robert Shock, who's a geologist from Boston University, he studied the erosion marks on the outside of the temple. The sphinx. He said this is indicative of thousands of years of rainfall that created this.

2 (3h 26m 26s):
This is where you get these kind of fissures in the stones. The only time there was rainfall in the Nile Valley, it was like 9,000 bc. So you gotta go back thousands of years that predate that because you got thousands of years of rainfall. Wind. Wind. It's a rainforest. Yeah. Right. All that area. Like the Sahara Desert used to be a fucking tropical rainforest.

3 (3h 26m 50s):
Wow.

2 (3h 26m 52s):
Like all this shit happened before we were fucking driving diesel trucks and yeah, coal plants. The world has been in a constant state of flux forever. And that area where they initially established the kingdom of, of where we, where Giza was and Cairo is and all those areas, that area was lush with resources. And that's probably why they advanced there for so long. They, they did some wild shit in this one area that there's wild structures all over the earth that they found. Nothing compares to what they did in Africa. Nothing. Not one thing is anything like the great pyramid of 2 million, 300,000 stones moved from quarries hundreds of miles away.

2 (3h 27m 38s):
Cut in a perfect position. True north, south, east and west. It's fucking wild what they did. and I think they were probably more advanced than we are. That's what I think has

4 (3h 27m 48s):
To be I know when you go and when you see it firsthand, like, yeah, going to going to Machu Picchu, you know, up in the Andes. You're like, what? How did they build this up in the mountains?

2 (3h 27m 57s):
Just imagine if everything collapsed right now, what people would be like 200 years from now. They would be fucking barbarians. Totally tried. There'd be walking dead. Walking dead. People like living in little groups and tribes trying to stay alive. And eventually they would rebuild. But I think it would take forever. and I think that's what happened. Do

4 (3h 28m 15s):
You ever think about that? Like tech, like you, you go, technology exists with the same things that were available like hundreds of years before. Words.

2 (3h 28m 27s):
Thousands of years. Hundreds

3 (3h 28m 27s):
Thousand. Same. Same. Like there is

4 (3h 28m 29s):
Nothing new put here. We just were able to develop a phone

2 (3h 28m 34s):
And every technology builds on previous

3 (3h 28m 37s):
Technology. Someone's invented this so we go radio waves. If they didn't tap into that, then that civil issue never had radio. Yeah.

2 (3h 28m 43s):
So if someone invents something quicker, that's different. You build on that. Like if someone invents nuclear fission like way early and everybody's like, whoa. Or someone invents cold fusion way early. You're like, okay, well now we've solved this energy problem. Now we can move in a different

3 (3h 28m 58s):
Direction. Or stops plague early. Yeah.

2 (3h 29m 0s):
Early.

3 (3h 29m 1s):
That allows you to like,

4 (3h 29m 2s):
Do you learn all the technological stuff that has evolved is with that the theory that we are borrowing from what we've taken from basically alien life leaving technology here or giving us hints? Oh Jesus

2 (3h 29m 15s):
N no, I think the alien technology thing is fascinating, but it might be also be bullshit. You always have to look at all these things that are public and that are talked about and the Pentagon releases things about might be bullshit. You always have to think it might be bullshit. Every time I look at any phenomenon, whether it's UFOs, UAPs, whatever the fuck you wanna call 'em, I always say to myself, if I was the military and I had some top secret drone program that moved through a totally unique and novel propulsion system that operated on gravity and that we figured out how to do this and we can move it around. and I would be testing in exactly the same place as these people were testing.

2 (3h 29m 59s):
They were testing in all this restricted airspace where they would run these military drills. They did it off the east coast and they did it off the west coast. So where they're seeing these things is exactly where the military runs their, their tests. Oh, I would assume that if I was the military, that's how I would think I would hide things. I would hide things by saying they're UFOs and saying we have no idea what this is. And if you have top secret programs, which we 100% know they do. And if you have a theory of propulsion that's based on gravity and not on igniting combustible fluids like rocket fuel, which we definitely have.

2 (3h 30m 39s):
And they have had since the, I believe the 1950s, they first started theorize, theorizing about magnetic propulsion systems. Wow. They, they, they probably have been developing this forever. They've probably been doing it in secrecy and probably China's doing it as well. And the best way to hide it, I would imagine would be to say that this is something from another world also. We might be visited by other worlds also. We might be visited by things from other dimensions. I think it might be all the above. and I don't think you can count out any of it. Just 'cause the fact that we know there's planets. If we know there's planets, they're far enough away from the sun that the, the water doesn't boil and nothing freezes. If they're in that goldilock zone, maybe life can develop.

2 (3h 31m 22s):
And we know that there's a shit load of those out there. We've found a bunch of 'em already. So if they're out there, we would assume that something would be like us plus a hundred years plus 500 years. And they would want to go to these other planets and say, look at these crazy fucks with Flint tools trying to start fires by knocking sticks together. Yeah. And we would say, let's run. Leave him a radio. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly's. That's what I and I think. That's what they do. And that's what this Diana Paska was saying about researchers were describing these crashed UFOs as donations. So if I was from somewhere else, whether it was another dimension or another planet and I wanted to accelerate the technological innovation by these beings, I would give them fiber optics.

2 (3h 32m 4s):
Yeah. I'd go figure that out. Crash this thing back. Engineer it, figure it out. Get your brightest minds. Lock everybody down. Shoot everybody with a big mouth and figure out how to fucking make this, how to do this. and I think that's what the Bazar story's all about.

5 (3h 32m 18s):
Bert, I was not listening. Yeah, I got lost. I got lost. Yeah. It sounds cool. What'd

2 (3h 32m 26s):
You get lost in

5 (3h 32m 27s):
Buddy when you started with propulsion? I was like, I was like letters. It's funny. I felt like I was listening to your podcast. I know Shit I should learn.

2 (3h 32m 36s):
You are while it's happening.

5 (3h 32m 37s):
I, I, I, I It's all take a nap. I love your, I love your brain. I just got tired,

3 (3h 32m 41s):
Guys.

5 (3h 32m 41s):
Tired. You wanna take a nap? It's all take naps.

3 (3h 32m 43s):

2 (3h 33m 26s):
You definitely have done comedy. Drunk

3 (3h 33m 27s):
Come a long way to admit that past. Alright.

5 (3h 33m 29s):

Drunk?

2 (3h 33m 31s):
What is that? I seen you fiddle that the whole time. That is a Bammo Ivory handle for a 1911, which is type of pistol.

3 (3h 33m 40s):
Oh, it goes in like that. I

2 (3h 33m 41s):
Got Yeah. You have to get it fit for a 1911.

5 (3h 33m 45s):
Are we really doing a spot tonight?

2 (3h 33m 47s):
What is this really? Aren't you a professional? It's

You just watching not do it. That'll be

5 (3h 33m 55s):
Have a good, I'm I can't Of course you're I can't knock it on stage.

2 (3h 33m 58s):
How you gonna take all that shit off in the time that it takes? Takes a second.

5 (3h 34m 1s):
Takes a second. No, keep on it. Every I start off like John Malaney, like very pr like tactile and Well, you're gonna keep it on, right? No, no, no. I, I realized in taking it off. I'm a different person without my shirt off on

3 (3h 34m 14s):
Stage. Keep it on. Keep it on. Keep it on. Keep

5 (3h 34m 16s):
It on. Keep it on for the show tonight. It on Shirt your

2 (3h 34m 18s):
Spot. Listen, listen, Clark Kent, we're all gonna

5 (3h 34m 20s):
Wear it.

2 (3h 34m 21s):
Clark Kent. Stupid glasses I. know who you are, bitch

5 (3h 34m 24s):
Clark Kent was the alter ego.

2 (3h 34m 25s):
Clark Kent with your stupid glasses I know it's Superman. That's, that's

5 (3h 34m 28s):
Superman's this real person. Yeah. Yeah.

2 (3h 34m 31s):
Duh. What the fuck is this guy doing? Come on. Don't you think I've watched the TV show? Fucking don't you think I've read the comic books?

3 (3h 34m 37s):
Same thing with Hulk. Come on dude. Yeah.

2 (3h 34m 39s):
What are you saying?

5 (3h 34m 40s):
Don't change. I had a really good set with a suit on.

2 (3h 34m 42s):
You can, you already have shoulders, bro. You're jacked. You don't even have to take your shirt off. You can still kill. You can kill with a shoot. A suit and a tie on. Yeah.

3 (3h 34m 49s):
Stuff your shoulders. I

2 (3h 34m 50s):
Know you love that pop when you take your shirt off. and it is a wild pop buddy buddy. That's a wild pop buddy. We were watching it last the Tuesday night. It's a big pop. It's

3 (3h 34m 58s):
A, I had the last recorded. They,

2 (3h 34m 60s):
They're like, is he gonna take his shirt off pressure shirt off? You can see they're saying, is he gonna take his shirt off? I remember when he wouldn't take his shirt, shirt off in the, or like don don't want shirt off

5 (3h 35m 8s):
Secret.

2 (3h 35m 9s):
Not in the or not the

5 (3h 35m 10s):
ORI was young.

2 (3h 35m 12s):
Mitzi would not like it. Do you do it now?

3 (3h 35m 14s):
She would not like it. Yeah.

5 (3h 35m 14s):
Yeah. Let's get something to eat. I'm the only one there. Let's

2 (3h 35m 17s):
Get something to eat. Oh yeah, you, you. Only one there that's, excuse me.

5 (3h 35m 19s):
Let's get something to eat and go. Wanna get something to eat and go? Yeah, it's five, five. Whatever you want. I would love Eddie. Let's go to

2 (3h 35m 24s):
Add b's. I I Gentlemen wearing suits. Would

5 (3h 35m 28s):
Love to go. Abs Let's go. Let's, let's go right now. Let's

2 (3h 35m 31s):
Go. Let, let's go. This podcast is over. Thank you. Love

5 (3h 35m 33s):
You guys.

2 (3h 35m 34s):
I love you too. Listen, this has been

3 (3h 35m 36s):
14 months

2 (3h 35m 37s):
For all these years of us doing this. It's been a fucking, it's been fun. We've had a good time. It's been wild fun.

3 (3h 35m 43s):
New civilizations will never have this. Yeah.

2 (3h 35m 45s):
I mean they're gonna lock this down. You know, no network would ever allow it. No fucking producers would ever bank their mortgage on this being something like, they would be like, guys, guys, guys, guys. Let's talk. Can I just out, let's talk about what you said there.

3 (3h 35m 58s):
Eddies,

5 (3h 35m 58s):
You

2 (3h 35m 58s):
Guys admitted a lot of things. You

5 (3h 35m 60s):
Probably love Eddie B's right now.

2 (3h 36m 1s):
Let's go eat some steak. All right? Alright. I love you guys. Love you guys. Bye everybody.

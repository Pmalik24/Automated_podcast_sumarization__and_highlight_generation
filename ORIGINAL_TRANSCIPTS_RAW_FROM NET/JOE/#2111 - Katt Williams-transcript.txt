The. Joe Rogan Experience

1 (6s):
Train by day. Joe Rogan podcast by night. All day.

2 (14s):
What's up? How are you? I can't believe we never met each other until today. That's kind of crazy.

3 (20s):
It's really

2 (20s):
Weird. It's kind of crazy. It was always like at the store, like Katt was here last night. I'm like, fuck. It was always two ships in the night.

3 (30s):
Right. I would, I would see you and I be able to get to you. Like comedy is small, but only if you're mediocre. It's big. It's a vast, vast place.

2 (46s):
It's vast. And it's also small 'cause there's so few of us and worldwide, we were talking about this the other day. There's maybe 500 of us on the planet. You know, you gotta be real generous and say 500. 'cause it's really probably about two 50. Right. But legit comics guys, you want to hang out with guys who have fun, guys Who? Your number

3 (1m 10s):
Going down, your numbers going down, your numbers going down.

2 (1m 13s):
Guys you'd recommend leave your house, get a babysitter. The number's going down. There's not a lot of people.

3 (1m 21s):
Right.

2 (1m 21s):
You think about the billions and billions of people on the planet. There's a little

3 (1m 25s):
Smidgen of us. Well, as, as children, we all take to talking with ease. And so the fact that later on in your life, you'd be one of the people that could say, I talk for a living is an amazing honor. It's

2 (1m 47s):
Amazing.

3 (1m 47s):
Even if you look a thousand years back.

2 (1m 50s):
Yeah. Especially today. Did you be able to talk for a living? Oh my God. What? And that, that's the problem also with what we do, is that everybody can talk. So they see you talking. They're like, I could do what he's doing. Right. He's just up there talking.

3 (2m 4s):
And the better you do it, the easier it looks. Right. Which is part of the trap. Yeah.

2 (2m 8s):
It's part of the

3 (2m 9s):
Trap. It looks like he doesn't think about what he says. He just says stuff. But you couldn't be as accurate.

2 (2m 16s):
No, no. And then there's hanging around with comics and getting to know about shit. Like they're electric Rolls Royces.

3 (2m 25s):
Right. Right. If Satan hits me, just know I'm hitting back immediately. You're you're gonna know about it if I've never heard. Yeah. The electric specter.

2 (2m 37s):
That thing is insane. That thing's insane. Just the way the doors open up, the way the doors close. When you touch the brakes totally silent

3 (2m 48s):
For the price point it has. It would have to be perfect. And the whole thing is, it is. And that's, that's what you're trying to do in any genre. Like you're trying to find that thing that is flawless in that genre.

2 (3m 6s):
Right.

3 (3m 7s):
And that's it.

2 (3m 8s):
That's the Rolls Royce. I've never had one of those.

3 (3m 11s):
Right. Well, because, because it's important to you that you be grounded in the important ways. So I can see you not have had, having not had a Rolls Royce, I've had four or five.

2 (3m 26s):
I'm not opposed to it. It's just the idea of it to me is like, don't do that for me. You know, I'm always like, eh, get away from that

3 (3m 37s):
Yourself. A muscle car. What? Well see, you see what I mean? Yeah. Because, because we live vicariously through these things and it's been that way for all of humankind. I'm saying it was still like that for the Roman in his chariot. Oh yeah. Like that's how he felt. Like that's, that's how horsemen feel about that ride. You know, like Yeah.

2 (3m 59s):
Yeah.

3 (3m 60s):
Transportation and people have a love story.

2 (4m 5s):
Yeah. That's really the only object that I'm really into. Like, I'm, I'm in this vehicles Yeah. Vehicles. I'm into mechanical vehicles. Right. There's like something about mechanical vehicles that just speak to me. I love them. I love looking at 'em. I love sitting in them. I love driving them. It's just like, it's one of the things that people say like, money can't buy you happiness. That's definitely true. If you're fucked up, you're not gonna get happier if you get rich. But if you're already reasonably happy and you can afford a nice muscle car, God damn, you'll feel happier. You'll feel happier. But,

3 (4m 40s):
But every time, every time you drive. So what I'm saying is when I got to 67 Chevy Camaro, I needed no other cars. I was complete. Yeah. When I got the Grand National, you couldn't tell me anything. There was nothing on the highway that was of my ilk. Yeah. But I've felt that way 12, 13 times. That's what makes it real love. Yeah.

2 (5m 6s):
They give you real joy. Yeah. Every time you drive

3 (5m 9s):
And you feel like that character in that movie, you know, fuck. Yeah. Like, yeah.

2 (5m 16s):
Yeah. You drive a 1970 Chevelle, you feel like John Wick.

3 (5m 19s):
Yeah. It's a sacred, sacred place. There's music there, there's yeah. Recklessness, but there's safety. Yeah. You know, it's like, it gets to the essence of a being

2 (5m 31s):
And I think it's a thing that won't exist a hundred years from now. I think automated driving will be mandatory. I really do. I don't, I think we're about a hundred years away, a hundred years away from No, no personal automobiles, no control of your vehicle. We're gonna stop all crashes if we could stop all crashes on all highway desks. Come on. Katt. Won't you contribute and give up all your rights to drive? Yes. We're gonna stop all death.

3 (5m 59s):
Yeah. It's not, but understand that it, all of these things have financial benefits and then they use those perks you just mentioned to get you in. But yeah, I, I, yeah, but somebody's

2 (6m 12s):
Making

3 (6m 12s):
Money. I believe that it'll be mandatory, but, but for practical reasons, like this thing where the police want you and they have to chase you and you may get away. Those, those days are done. Yeah.

2 (6m 26s):
They're just gonna, gonna shut your car off. Yeah.

3 (6m 28s):
Your, your car is going to do what they tell it to do. Yeah. Which is get behind this patrol car and follow us to the station. Lock

2 (6m 35s):
The doors like this speculation that they've, they've had that for a long time. You know, there was that, that famous journalist, Michael Hastings was his name. There's this journalist, don don't know if you know this story, but it's pretty crazy. This guy went to Afghanistan, so Afghanistan with the troops, and he was only supposed to be there writing a Rolling Stone article about this general for a very short amount of time. But then there was the volcano in Iceland, and the volcano in Iceland stopped air travel. So he, this journalist from the Rolling Stone was embedded in this, this troop. And they started talking shit. And he started reporting the shit that they were talking, including disparaging comments that the general had said about Obama.

2 (7m 17s):
So the general gets back. He has to retire, he has to, you know, it's the Rolling Stone expose. It's a big deal because everybody loves this general. So he retires, and this Michael Hastings guy is on the run, and he's terrified. He's telling people, if, if I commit suicide, I did not kill myself. People are threatening my life. And then he's going down LaBrea and his car is going like 120 miles an hour and just slams into a tree and explodes. And there's a video footage of it. This dude is just fly. Look at that. Flying down the street hits a tree and the car explodes. And they asked security experts at that time, I think it was like 2005, four I know, 2004, 2005.

2 (8m 5s):
Is it possible to control a vehicle remotely? They said, does your vehicle have a computer? If your vehicle has a computer, they can control it, period. There's a way.

3 (8m 16s):
And they know that.

2 (8m 17s):
And they've been doing that for, this is 2010. 2010. So this is 14 fucking years ago.

3 (8m 23s):
Easy peasy.

2 (8m 24s):
If they could do that, then what can they do now? They just shut your fucking car right off. Oh,

4 (8m 29s):
That's what his article came out. I'm sorry. So I think the act accident was 2013.

2 (8m 32s):
Oh, there you go. Well, how was the article in 2010 if the accident's in 2013?

4 (8m 38s):
Well, the article came out first and exposed McChrystal.

2 (8m 40s):
Oh, oh, the rowing Stone article. I thought you meant the article on the, on the accident.

3 (8m 45s):
If you actually do reading about Tesla. See, that's the thing, Joe, that, that's why I love history so much. Because once you find out that this world is a circle, you can never get lost. Like Right. You can look at certain things and it'll tell you what's going to happen later. Like with amazing accuracy. Like Yeah. Like that's how I knew that things like what you showed me with Hastings, that those were real things. Yeah. It's not, they've always been

2 (9m 19s):
Real.

3 (9m 19s):
It's everybody who has ever been killed in one of those ways. There was a financial benefit to it. It was obvious. It was easy, you know where it came from. It's just that they do a good job. But how, how is that difficult if that's your job? Like Exactly. They do this, they do this really well. They do it worldwide.

2 (9m 40s):
And well also, this guy fucked with the worst person. You could fuck with a high ranking beloved general who's in charge of trained killers who love him. And you don't think he could put one of those dudes on you with a coffee meeting? Just have a sit down at Starbucks with no phones on you, and lemme explain what's going on.

3 (10m 2s):
A shadow government is no more difficult than a government. Yeah.

2 (10m 6s):
And so not only that, You don't, they don't have to get elected. It's even better, even nicer. They can stay for a long time. They can I mean, think about j Edgar Hoover. How long did that motherfucker stay in power for? He was running the FBI wearing a dress for like three

3 (10m 22s):
Years. Because of what you just discussed.

2 (10m 25s):
Yeah.

3 (10m 25s):
Like, like there are that, that's why I can speak with impunity about the Illuminati, because I know who you would have to be in order for what I'm saying to bother you, number one. Right. Number two, I. know your big secret I. know that you are not the Illuminati I am. So you can't be illuminated. You're too dark. But the, the difficulty is getting people to believe something that they don't want to believe. And in each of these cases, this is where the money is. If you're just a capitalist, it is, find something, establish a value for it, and make sure that that includes your profit.

3 (11m 14s):
And make sure people really want it. Right. It it, it's very fundamental.

2 (11m 20s):
Also, if you are running corporations and you're making billions dollars Yeah. You're gonna get bored. What's the ultimate game? The ultimate game is a run. The whole world. Do you know what the ultimate game is? Katt?

3 (11m 31s):
I do.

2 (11m 32s):
We have an overpopulation problem. Katt. Yeah. It's an overpopulation problem. Right. And we're gonna, we're gonna be able to mitigate that with vaccines. We we're gonna be able to mitigate that with, with healthcare. Right. We're gonna figure that out. We're gonna, we're gonna get rid of a bunch of people. We

3 (11m 46s):
Used to be able to do it with neglect and it was called Nature's Way. Right. You know? Right. Like, like whatever was ailing you, it wasn't ailing everybody in the world. The Chinese didn't have it because they had 6,000 herbs 6,000 years ago and knew what each one did. And you know, like,

2 (12m 7s):
You know, people are very resistant to that when they don't realize that almost all pharmaceutical drugs come from plants a big,

3 (12m 15s):
You can't be a against the original.

2 (12m 17s):
Yeah. It's ridiculous. Like, that's, that's government propaganda working on you. That's like when they remember when they had Marinol, when they were making weed illegal and, but people had, were going through cancer and their doctors are prescribed him weed for chemotherapy. So they gave a marinol. Do you remember that shit? I do. It is, it is like a synthetic version of weed. That's terrible.

3 (12m 37s):
I, but, but terrible is subjective Right. To nothing. So they have this oil like cannabis that is for people having seizures. Right. And it's the only thing that will stop a seizure.

2 (12m 57s):
Yeah. It's incredible. It

3 (12m 59s):
Is. But here's the thing. The fact that there is a God is the biggest conversation worldwide. But the truth of the matter is, there is more reason for you to believe there is a God than there is for you to not like the way that things interact. Like if we're just talking about marijuana or alcohol or whatever that is, you have to understand that this thing serves no other purpose Than to bring pleasure to this small group of beings.

3 (13m 39s):
Right. And the fact that it already was set up to do that, the fact that it was already set up on this planet for there to be medicines for us to find and to utilize and Yeah. You see what I'm saying? Yeah. It's like, it's not like, oh yeah. So he made a cow. No. To make a cow, it means you had to also have made grass. and it means you would've had to have invented a whole new eating system for this animal, which was cud. And that means you would, you would then have to have given him three stomachs to be able to, and you would have to have known that he was gonna then emit a gas that was going to be necessary and on the planet. Like Yeah. Like none of these things, fertilizer, all of it.

3 (14m 20s):
Right. The fact that everything goes together is how, you know,

2 (14m 24s):
It's pretty wild. And every time we step in and fuck with it, it goes haywire.

3 (14m 29s):
Right.

2 (14m 29s):
Every time human beings do it.

3 (14m 31s):
Predictably haywire though. Haywire. Right. Haywire. Right. But that's part of, that's part of the benefits of free will, is you really can jump into a volcano, dude damn

2 (14m 43s):
Haywire.

3 (14m 44s):
You really can't.

2 (14m 45s):
I mean, think about what we've done to wildlife. The wild the the craziest thing in this country, especially right here is pigs. But wild pigs are everywhere. And there's so many of 'em. I went to a friend of mine's farm, or well, it's like a ranch to, to hunt wild pigs. Yeah. And you just hear 'em like, like Lord of the Rings characters and the bushes crazy. And there's 150 of 'em near you. 250 of them thousands on the ranch. They're all over the place. And they have three litters a year, and they start having litters when they're six months old. They just pump out piglets. Let's go.

3 (15m 22s):
You can tell they're not delicious.

2 (15m 24s):
They are delicious. Oh,

3 (15m 25s):
Well then here we go. Then we don't really have, they're delicious. We don't really have a problem then do

2 (15m 30s):
We? Right. No. We have a, we need to eat pigs problem.

3 (15m 33s):
No. We need to be sending this off somewhere. Yeah. To someone who does.

2 (15m 39s):
Well, definitely we should. That would be an easy way to solve a lot of hunger problems. I'm

3 (15m 44s):
Saying we live in a country where we're complaining about food sources.

2 (15m 47s):
It's a good point.

3 (15m 48s):
These chickens are pecking us to death. They're everywhere. I can't eat and sleep. Yeah. But they're delicious,

2 (15m 56s):
Right? Yeah. Yeah. You have more chickens. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. We do have an overabundance problem for sure. We really do. But the pig thing is a wild one. It's, it's hard to get 'em. Like, you gotta you, they're very smart and they spread out and there's so fucking many of 'em, they shoot 'em with helicopters. Oh yeah. They fly over. I,

3 (16m 16s):
Right.

2 (16m 17s):
I haven't been invited three times since I moved here to go shoot pigs out of a helicopter. Well,

3 (16m 22s):
That's part of the reason that you came to Texas,

2 (16m 25s):
The freedom for, for

3 (16m 26s):
Sure. Texas. Texas is a place of great adventure. Yeah. And people who believe in that. Yeah. It's really God's country in the right places.

2 (16m 36s):
It is in the right places. I think you're gonna have annoying people everywhere you go in this world. But in general, I think the people here overall are nicer. They're friendlier and they're not captured, they're not captured by the ether of Hollywood that they haven't been sucked into the, the vortex of ideological thinking and just that weirdness of that town. So when you escape that and just be around regular people, you're like, oh, people all right. I've just been in an insane asylum. You are looking for a girlfriend. You know, like you, you have to be in a place where you're around good people, like normal people. That's better for you.

3 (17m 16s):
You're not trying to say that people that happen to live there are not nice people. There's

2 (17m 22s):
A lot of nice people there. For

3 (17m 22s):
Sure. Here's, here's the thing. Hopefully we can agree that the problem is with extremes. Yes. Extreme anything. Yes. Extreme left is as vicious and as, as far right? Yep. It's, you know, the mentalness of it all that makes America great. For sure. And Texas has been front and center of that forever.

2 (17m 49s):
I think a, a big part of it though is how much does your government control you, even when things don't even make sense. Like in California, they made flavored vapes illegal. Can you imagine? Yeah. Your strawberry mist is our number one

3 (18m 3s):
Problem. That was fine. But they let it also hurt black people in that it counted menthol as a flavor and hurt Newports.

2 (18m 11s):
So you can't sell menthol cigarettes in California. Right.

3 (18m 14s):
They have their own cigarettes. That is wild. They have non-menthol Newports. Yeah. It's terrible.

2 (18m 20s):
Why do black people like menthol so much? What's that about? It's a totally different type of cigarette. You're

3 (18m 28s):
Gonna get me canceled. Oh, this is very racist. This conversation is even, even though neither of us are

2 (18m 36s):
Go figure, just talking about a type of cigarette that

3 (18m 38s):
People enjoy. Just us saying, just saying, why do black people like Newport so much? And a black and a black person actually getting ready to answer this? Ugh. It's terrible on all ends. don don't think

2 (18m 51s):
It is.

3 (18m 52s):
Well, I don't think it is either. Because we have a, a news.

2 (18m 55s):
It's like if you start asking me about spaghetti, I'm not gonna get offended. You start asking me about Italian food or why, why Italian people so loud? I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna get

3 (19m 4s):
Offended. How many people have ever died of pasta related illnesses? A lot, Joe.

2 (19m 10s):
A lot of fatso out there kicking the bucket, bro.

3 (19m 12s):
That's, that's not because of pasta.

2 (19m 14s):
That's an overabundance of carbohydrates, sir. They

3 (19m 16s):
Were gonna be fat wherever they live. Sir. Maybe

2 (19m 18s):
That's an over gonna be great

3 (19m 19s):
Bread eaters in

2 (19m 20s):
Delicious high carbohydrate food. They couldn't stop it. People are addicted to food, like they're addicted to anything. And if there's a thing that I could ever be addicted to, it's that.

3 (19m 29s):
Right. That's all of us though. All of us. And what a blessing.

2 (19m 33s):
Yeah. We have so much

3 (19m 35s):
Starving people aren't addicted to anything and they don't have food related illnesses.

2 (19m 40s):
Exactly.

3 (19m 41s):
Exactly. But back to where we were. Yeah. You were asking me about the

2 (19m 45s):
Last verse

3 (19m 45s):
Is the right I just about the menthol cigarettes. Oh, that's right. And, and the answer is we value strength in product. So there's this whole thing with liquor and malt liquor and the difference between the two and one is richer and stronger. Oh. And

2 (20m 16s):
The more potent version. Right.

3 (20m 18s):
And as, okay, that makes sense. As a people, we tend to go with those products,

2 (20m 25s):
Things that are stronger. That makes sense.

3 (20m 26s):
Right? Like before things were called concentrate. Yeah. That's what we appreciated.

2 (20m 33s):
Hmm. That makes sense.

3 (20m 34s):
Concentrated and the fact that menthol is a natural thing. So you know. Right. Anybody who is from the south knows about mint plants and

2 (20m 52s):
You know, and menthol used as a skincare product, like injuries and shit. Right.

3 (20m 58s):
Like, you appreciate that as a flavor profile Isn. Right.

2 (21m 2s):
You know, that makes sense.

3 (21m 4s):
The mint.

2 (21m 7s):
It's just telling people they can't have that anymore. Who the fuck are you? That's my position. Well,

3 (21m 13s):
And that's a, a noble position and we appreciate the fact that you represent that, but the truth of the matter is not pretty. And the truth of the matter is that most people would like to be controlled more by their government if they had, can

2 (21m 28s):
Make it easier. Maybe

3 (21m 31s):
Most people are all for government control as long as they don't have to discuss it.

2 (21m 36s):
Yeah. As long as it works in their favor, they'll give up a lot of rights. And then hopefully the next administration That's

3 (21m 44s):
Right. Are generally worthless at the time.

2 (21m 47s):
Yeah. Well, there's a lot of people that if the government can make life easier, a lot of people have it hard. Right? So the government comes in and says, I'm gonna make it easier for you, but I'm gonna need certain requirements of you. I'm gonna need you to have a digital id. That digital ID would be attached to a social credit score. And we're going to give you universal basic income. You no longer have to worry about food or shelter, you'll be taken care of, and now you can pursue your dreams.

3 (22m 13s):
Is this the mark of the beast you're speaking of, sir? Yeah, I think it is. Right. That's the whole thing is it's never been difficult at any point in history. Like, like we got a dude right now that's telling you front and center that I put a computer in somebody's head, guys. Right. Like,

2 (22m 31s):
Yeah. And everybody's going, yay.

3 (22m 34s):
It's the greatest thing in the world, sir.

2 (22m 37s):
Yeah.

3 (22m 38s):
But we understood this 15, 20, 25 years ago. We understood, while watching Tron or while watching Cyborgs, we understood that there was just this small line medically that needed to be crossed in order for us to be able to do these things. Yeah. Like if you can hook a battery up to a octopus and make it go like this, you're halfway there.

2 (23m 4s):
Yeah.

3 (23m 5s):
Why? Because this, this is a, this is a machine that we have.

2 (23m 11s):
It's a biological machine. Right.

3 (23m 12s):
And once you understand it, you understand it.

2 (23m 15s):
Yeah. And you could fuck with that machine. You could juice it up, you could fucking get it stronger. You get it smarter. This is, you do a lot of things with that

3 (23m 22s):
Machine. This is what the Anki said. Yeah. This is how you know that these are not made up things from people's imagination because everything is too factual. Like, like this necklace. Right? Right. People online were like, yeah, is that Buddhist or that's this or that. It, it's none of that. Like, like I just try to find the answers to things. So I I, is that a ship wheel? I designed this because this is that thing that you see that all the anki guys that have that look like a r watch. Oh. And they always have it. And you're always trying to see what that is. Now what is that? It is a time and it's a compass.

3 (24m 6s):
It's a time keeping compass. That's what that is. So yeah. So that's what made the carrier of great importance because he was able to do things that were magical in nature. Like go somewhere and get right back. Like, you know what I mean? Like, so like

2 (24m 31s):
That that thing on the wrist was a compass.

3 (24m 34s):
A time keeping compass, a time keeping

2 (24m 36s):
Compass.

3 (24m 37s):
Yeah. A right. So you had to believe in things that didn't exist at some point, like magnetics and distance and Right. Probabilities and

2 (24m 58s):
Right,

3 (25m 1s):
Right. That's how, like, if you, if you were to read like thousands of books about people that knew a bunch of shit, like you find, start finding out that it's not really about knowing anything. It's about where to go to get the information. You know what I mean? Yeah. So like, when we look at all the ruins all around the world, like we are not seeing ruins of colleges and universities and all of that. We're seeing temples and synagogues and churches and, but people don't understand that that's where that information was coming from for that period of time.

3 (25m 47s):
When we went to these temples, they weren't in there singing and reading from a book. They were in there being taught things that they were able to go put into practice. You see what I'm saying? Yeah. Like they were being taught our agriculture, you know what I mean? Like they were being taught.

2 (26m 7s):
Yeah.

3 (26m 7s):
Yeah.

2 (26m 9s):
They had some very Bazar knowledge too. They had a detailed knowledge of cosmology. They, they, they had a really detailed knowledge of our solar system.

3 (26m 18s):
100% of the writings across the world. Whoever said anything about space or the universe or what was out there, why were all of them correct, Joe, it's not even possible. Like, how did they know that Mars was the red planet and why was it a worldwide fact? Right. Planetarily that Saturn had rings like, yeah, based upon what information? Because nobody worldwide is disagreeing. Nobody's like, oh, I thought of this, or I, it came to me in a Dr.

3 (26m 60s):
Nobody's saying that anywhere in anybody's civilization, everybody's civilization says, this information came from the people that came from there.

2 (27m 10s):
Yeah.

3 (27m 11s):
This like, there are no coincidences.

2 (27m 14s):
Well, they know that Mars used to have an atmosphere. Mars used to have an atmosphere, used to have water. Something happened to its environment.

3 (27m 23s):
If, if that's correct, then there's a guy right now saying he's getting ready to put people up there.

2 (27m 27s):
Yep. Exactly. Restart it all over again.

3 (27m 31s):
50 years ago, there was no water in our whole universe. Let them tell it now. There's been water almost everywhere. There's water on the Moon for crying out loud. Are

2 (27m 40s):
You familiar with the younger driest impact theory? Do you know what that is?

3 (27m 45s):
Say what it is.

2 (27m 46s):
Younger driest impact theory is a theory that earth goes through a cycle of like comet storms every June and every November. And most of the time nothing happens. But every now and again, we get hit, we get hit big and they think we got hit big 11,800 plus years ago. And that, that had to restart civilization. And that what you're seeing from like Mesopotamia, all these people 6,000 years later, they think that is a rebuilding of civilization that was already like just whispers and stories and tales. And then they rebuilt it again thousands of years later. But if you go back to like 11,800 BC 11,800 years ago, you're, you're dealing with what we thought were hunter gatherers.

2 (28m 27s):
And now we know they weren't. Now we know they built complex stone structures. And the real speculation is they think that the people who built the pyramids built them way earlier than the conventional dating is. They think there's real evidence. It shows they're 9,000, 11,000 years old. Easy.

3 (28m 44s):
No people built the pyramids.

2 (28m 46s):
No people No. Who built them?

3 (28m 49s):
No. People built the pyramids. And if you, and if you look around the world, you see certain telltale things that let you know that advanced machinery was in usage. Look there for sure. This whole thing where slaves are stronger people is a fallacy. We like to believe that slaves are stronger. Slaves are weaker because they don't eat the right food. And they live a terrible life. Your slave population is not smarter in better condition. They don't, unless they're enslaving. The Jews

2 (29m 24s):
Don't think the pyramid, they stopped thinking that quite a while ago. They think it was actually skilled labor because the way they were eating, they found what their camps were, where their food was. They ate like very good food. So they think they were actually skilled labor, but also probably forced skilled labor. But that's probably not the people who built it. That's probably the people that were working on it. Yeah. That's the, probably the people that worked in the village or in the in, you know, in the city.

3 (29m 49s):
How many companies have done renovations on the White House? None of them have done enough renovation that they can claim it's their White House. So yes, thousands of years worth of people were there. But that doesn't have anything to do with the building of it. Who do you think built it? Well, understand. We, we know enough now to understand that this was a complex, this was not

2 (30m 15s):
Right.

3 (30m 17s):
We've been led to believe that this is how much they worshiped their dead bodies. Right. But the evidence doesn't show any of that. No, it doesn't. Like when you see inside, when they have those intricate carvings and paintings and stuff in gold and stuff, you have to remember, this isn't a window windowless room folks. There's no candle soot. There's no this, it, it's clearly a power plant and built specifically for that location on this planet for

2 (30m 53s):
What do you think it was powered by

3 (30m 57s):
The hot water springs underneath it.

2 (31m 2s):
So it was powered by the hot water springs and to but what, to what end? How do you know all this First of all is this Marijuana talks don

3 (31m 11s):
Don't, don don't think. So. This is

2 (31m 17s):
Where did you read this?

3 (31m 21s):
If you, if you follow information about humankind, you find out that in all parts of history, people were coming to this region for their information and their knowledge and their things that were forbidden and their, these, these were not the, these were the, the highest of human civilization here.

2 (31m 44s):
Not even comparable to anyone else. No. Nor sense nor

3 (31m 48s):
Since now or Yeah. Nor sense. Right. The

2 (31m 51s):
Great period maggi is insane.

3 (31m 52s):
Right? Like it's insane. Like even Tesla says that this is where he came to get the information. But if you follow that information pathway, it leads you to this character called th Right. And the emerald tablets of thought are literally mind changing and mind blowing just because you understand when this was written and the terminology being used is

2 (32m 29s):
When was it

3 (32m 30s):
Written far too accurate for now? So I'm I'm sure that

2 (32m 41s):
Here it is. Emerald tablet, also known as the Smar Smar Dine Smar dine tablet or the Tabula SS Smar Boy, I fucked that up. It's compact

3 (32m 60s):
And her tris Masti,

2 (33m 2s):
Yeah. A cryptic hermetic text. It was highly regarded by Islamic and European alchemist as the foundation of their art though attributed to the legendary Hellenistic figure. Hermes truss tris me. How do you say it bro? How do

3 (33m 16s):
You say it? Tris Mastis.

2 (33m 17s):
Tri mastis. Yeah. The text of the Emerald tablet first appears in a number of early medieval Arabic sources, the oldest of which dates to the late eighth or early ninth century. It was translated into Latin several times in the 12th and 13th centuries, numerous interpretations and commentaries followed. So what does it say though? The Egyptian god t thought. Okay. It says, beginning in the second century BC onwards, Greek texts attributed to Hermes, a syncretic combination of Greek God Hermes and the Egyptian god thaw appeared in Greco-Roman Egypt. Those texts knows that known as the hertica are heterogeneous, hetero heterogeneous collection of works that in the modern day era are commonly subdivided into two groups.

2 (34m 3s):
The technical hertica compromising of astrological medical botanical alchemical and magical writings. And the reli, philosophical hertica comprising of mystical philosophical writings. Holy shit.

3 (34m 20s):
Is this weed talk, Joseph?

2 (34m 21s):
No, this is so legit.

3 (34m 23s):
So legit, my

2 (34m 24s):
Man. So this dude was probably an alien

3 (34m 28s):
Dude. First of all, there are no probablys. Yeah. That's the benefit once you hear it or read it, is the fact that it's given in first person. And that's not possible. The things that are being said are impossible enough. Time has passed though that it's not like that. But, but it

2 (34m 50s):
I'm gonna read

3 (34m 50s):
That he literally says, Hey, there's a spaceship on earth and this is where it is. Because if all you care about is information, right? Like that's what you start to see is when you get to everybody's civilization, Asian, Indian, African, when you get to the crux of their information, nobody's disagreeing with anybody.

2 (35m 21s):
Right. If you figured out who, how the fuck they did it, if there was any logical explanation that people could have done it, I would be on board. I'd be like, well, okay.

3 (35m 36s):
But, but there aren't any people saying that in

2 (35m 39s):
Le human beings can. There are. It's possible if you had enough power and you had enough engineering and mathematics that you could figure out how to design and construct the pyramid. Yes. But then the logistical problem of getting the stones from hundreds of miles away, massive, massive. Several ton up to 80 ton stones.

3 (36m 1s):
Joe, that's crazy.

2 (36m 2s):
If you 500 miles away, some of

3 (36m 4s):
'em, even if you could do it, let me ask you this, would you build it on sand?

2 (36m 10s):
I don't think it was originally sand. See that's the thing, right?

3 (36m 13s):
This was a fertile valley.

2 (36m 15s):
Yeah, it was. Yeah. The Nile Valley,

3 (36m 17s):
That was the reason why chose, they had electric and wifi and they had all of that.

2 (36m 23s):
They probably did. And that's probably where the younger driest impact theory comes in.

3 (36m 28s):
The greatest trick is to make us believe that people back then we're dumber and we're smarter. Right. And that whole thing is a fallacy. Yeah.

2 (36m 38s):
That's definitely not

3 (36m 39s):
Real. But it's worth it for us to believe that.

2 (36m 44s):
I think we are the, the children of the survivors of some great catastrophe and I think that's why every single

3 (36m 52s):
Ancient, not everybody

2 (36m 53s):
Biblical scholar. What?

3 (36m 55s):
Not everybody. Some people, what

2 (36m 57s):
Do you mean

3 (36m 57s):
Are that

2 (36m 58s):
Some people are the survivors, right? Well, I mean most human beings probably got wiped out in common storms. and I think we probably got, there's been points in history that they know of where human beings got down to like 7,000 people

3 (37m 14s):
Who's counting them?

2 (37m 16s):
I think they use genetics and they back Trace and they try to find individuals that were capable of having X amount of children. I wonder how they do the calculations. That's a good question. The

3 (37m 25s):
Things in Hollywood, I'm just guessing honestly, in and in writing that have attracted our attention worldwide. Were all based on some truth. So all the stories of hobbits and have been successful in all of their genres. Why? Because they existed. Like, like we now know that there were whole py me groups and that, you know, we understand that that's what the seven dwarves was. Yeah.

2 (37m 57s):
Like that Island of Flores man that they found that, that they literally call it a hobbit. It was like a three foot tall person that was covered in hair, smaller head than us used tools.

3 (38m 11s):
A as a, as a preteen. I knew that Atlantis really existed just because of how it was spoken of offhandedly.

2 (38m 28s):
Just that it was known

3 (38m 29s):
In early writings. Yeah. Well, not just mentioned but mentioned offhandedly. Like you would a place that's just a landmark,

2 (38m 41s):
Right? We landed in New York before we went to Montreal. Yeah.

3 (38m 45s):
We were in Austin. Yeah. By Dallas. Right,

2 (38m 48s):
Exactly.

3 (38m 51s):
Yeah. Yeah.

2 (38m 52s):
Have you ever seen the, the guy that thinks that they found the spot in Africa? What is that, that the ring called, that Jimmy Corsetti is, he's on this, this dude is an, an expert in this shit. And he is an expert in ancient catastrophes and, and the remnants and the evidence that shows that these civilizations existed and something happened. And he's focused on this one area in Africa that he believes is Atlantis. And he, he says it has all the hallmark characteristics and there's all the evidence of massive water erosion surrounding the area that at one point in time, it's very likely that this area got hit with a massive flood.

2 (39m 40s):
and it matches all the characteristics of Atlantis. When you see it, when you see the way the, the concentric circles of rings, like try explaining this, you're gonna see it and try explaining this through a natural phenomenon that doesn't exist anywhere around it. Right. Concentric circles that is near what used to be water. And there's heavy water erosion marks all around it that indicate massive amounts of quick flowing water in a very short period of time.

3 (40m 7s):
Right? Yeah. Look at this. I

4 (40m 10s):
Forget what it's called, but I know exactly where it is. It's right here. So you can zoom in.

2 (40m 13s):
That's it. Look at that thing, bro. Are you fucking kidding me?

6 (40m 19s):
The reshot

2 (40m 20s):
Structure that's, it's called the reshot structure. I mean, are you fucking kidding me? I think

6 (40m 25s):
If you go 3D you can see the,

2 (40m 29s):
Now imagine if that was this massive city of concentric circles and walls and a thriving population and then it gets hit with this water. You could see the water erosion all over the place. The whole thing looks like it's washed out. See?

3 (40m 44s):
Yeah.

2 (40m 45s):
It looks like it was washed out 'cause it

3 (40m 47s):
Was. Right. And

6 (40m 48s):
That's salt,

3 (40m 49s):
I believe. But that's what makes,

2 (40m 50s):
There's salt there. That's the other thing

3 (40m 52s):
Between this and the Garden of Eden locations. Like these are the two, these are two of the great landmarks in human history.

2 (41m 7s):
Where's the Garden of Eden?

3 (41m 9s):
Well, when you read the stories, right, the, the thing that strikes you is that it's so specific. Like it says things in talking about the Garden of Eden that wait a minute, if I can't find what you're talking about, this isn't even real. You see what I'm saying? Right. Like, like where the Garden of Eden was. There's I think four rivers that come from it and then it names two of 'em. Like, I don't wanna be specific 'cause at least he's gonna bring it up. But it's like the Nile and the Afraid.

3 (41m 49s):
Right? Right. So you know two of them. And it's saying, you know where the four meet, this is where it is. And yeah, my whole life I was like this, this is really weird because at one period of time we're thinking no flood happens. There's so many things that have lined up from these great religious books Yeah. To we where we can see that no, something happened here. Like

2 (42m 22s):
Something happened. And these are stories of people telling stories that have been told to them for about a thousand years before

3 (42m 29s):
Anybody wrote it down. But this is why. Right. This is why they were told. And that's what you, that's the difference between those of us that want to know the world's mysteries and conspiracy theorists. Like there's nothing to a conspiracy theorist because you're not producing what you're using. But these world mysteries, like that's harder to do. A lie is not something that people are going to repeat for generations on generations. It's being repeated like that because people have reason to believe it to be true.

3 (43m 11s):
And and as you go through history, you see that those are the stories that we still talk about, but they're still valid. Like the, there were writings that the African Dogan tribe is like, right? Like, like they're

2 (43m 29s):
From like the serious star system.

3 (43m 31s):
Like they're saying very specific things. And for hundreds of years we're going, you guys are idiots, You don't know what you're talking about. Right? Right. Like somebody will have a fake star story. Right. You see? Right. And now we get to the point where we can actually see what they were talking about.

2 (43m 53s):
What if we find out that we're aliens that we were just dropped off here? A long ass comedy. The Adam and Eve story is the, the story of the place where they created us.

3 (44m 4s):
I'm sure we are the only people in the universe that think like that.

2 (44m 8s):
You think so? Why do you think that?

3 (44m 16s):
No, no portion of humankind story differs from that.

2 (44m 24s):
It's all creation story.

3 (44m 26s):
Like if you go, that's why NASA and Space Force are not more forthcoming. Because the further you get in space, the more obvious shit is like once you're up there and you're looking down, this shit doesn't look like there is no God. It looks like you're in the middle of somebody's workshop and they just showed you every single way that every star can be made, every single way a planet can be made, every way that a black hole can be a galaxy, a universe, and then showed you the best of the best.

2 (45m 10s):
It is the spot I mean in our solar system, we're the best neighborhood that's ever existed. They all suck. Every other planet sucks.

3 (45m 24s):
We're rudimentary enough that we still require environmental help.

2 (45m 30s):
Right. Until you get that chip. Once you get that chip

3 (45m 33s):
At each point it would be like, it would be like saying people that didn't learn how to ride horses, they were slow. Like they couldn't run fast enough so they got horses.

2 (45m 45s):
Right.

3 (45m 46s):
No, it didn't have anything to do with that. Better's better.

2 (45m 50s):
That's, that's really what it's gonna be better's better. Right? We're all gonna integrate.

3 (45m 54s):
Like we would, we we would've told you 30 years ago that we wouldn't need a space force unless we went up there and found something.

2 (46m 3s):
I think the space force, the idea is that they're worried about,

3 (46m 6s):
It's not an idea. Someone

2 (46m 7s):
Else being in space first with weapons flying around.

3 (46m 11s):
You mean us?

2 (46m 12s):
Yeah. Well if we can do it, they can do it. That's

3 (46m 15s):
The thing. Who is they?

2 (46m 16s):
Whoever it is.

3 (46m 18s):
No, China, there's only humankind and Alien. Yes.

2 (46m 21s):
Oh, I agree. Right. The problem is this is what we really need. We really need this neural link to lock us all together so everybody could read everybody's mind. That's what's gonna happen. And then there's gonna be no more leaders. There's gonna be no more

3 (46m 34s):
Governments. Okay. You're being, there're very controversial right now. Okay. So look that that better is better. That exists already. So just understand that the worldwide government is way smarter than we give them credit for because we, they have us believing they don't do nothing. But the truth is like, like there's no such thing as the government is in bed with the internet. No, the internet is a government installation that they allowed the world to use for free so that they could have the information willingly because you're on it.

2 (47m 21s):
That's what it became.

3 (47m 22s):
Exactly.

2 (47m 23s):
But I think it's,

3 (47m 24s):
That's what progression

2 (47m 25s):
To become. You think so? Yes. I think the progression of technology oftentimes lead leads itself to like even cell phones. At first it was Michael Douglas walking on the beach and Wall Street looking, looking amazing with that brick, carrying that big brick. Like, look at that guy. He's got a phone with no cord, he's out on the beach. This is insane to everybody having a phone.

3 (47m 46s):
But not to everybody because those in the ham radio community and people with the cbs, they didn't feel like that was cutting edge because it really wasn't like, like it's still

2 (47m 59s):
Cutting edge to walk around with a device. It's a leap in technology. Here's

3 (48m 4s):
The thing, when you look at all of our inventions, that's when you know that these space encounters were real because we only have advancement in a couple of industries in the world and everything else is nothing. So like the microwave that they had 30 years ago, it, it looks the same as the same microwave now. Why? Because it wasn't, it was done as a military thing. It was supposed to be a weapon. And then they found out, you know, it heats up food and they put a door on it. And so it hasn't changed that all because invention is very difficult.

3 (48m 49s):
And

2 (48m 52s):
Do you, do you subscribe to the idea that we get back engineered?

3 (48m 56s):
Absolutely. Yeah. That's why those leaps, we don't see those leaps in anything else is my point. Like, like

2 (49m 4s):
Yeah, theres

3 (49m 5s):
So much speculation

2 (49m 7s):
About the creation of a bunch of different things that came outta Roswell. Fiber optics.

3 (49m 14s):
Right? But remember 20 years ago, 15 years ago, this is crazy talk, crazy talk. But but now it's, but it's not like it's at the point at, at this point, like area 51 would have to be doing something.

2 (49m 32s):
They were definitely doing something

3 (49m 34s):
Right. And nobody's telling a differing story as to what it is. Right? Like people have great imaginations all through history. They could make up something. The only damning information is if you read 3000 accounts of, of these entities and realize, wait a minute, why is everybody describing the same couple of beings? Right? Like there's no

2 (50m 4s):
Right,

3 (50m 5s):
There's no outliers. Like every,

2 (50m 8s):
There's like three different things they describe. Yeah. They describe, they said that there's the documented eight to 12.

3 (50m 16s):
We're not talking about English speaking people. We're talking about worldwide. Worldwide. Right. Worldwide. Like that's what is striking

2 (50m 24s):
Indigenous people in Australia drew them. Yeah.

3 (50m 32s):
Right. Nobody's saying anything outlandish. No. And that's what you get to when you go religiously or

2 (50m 44s):
Well the alien thing is a bit of a religion to a lot of folks. They, they don't want to believe

3 (50m 49s):
Any, it's a necessary component. Yeah. It whatever religion you're a part of, at some point it says

2 (50m 57s):
You were contacted

3 (50m 58s):
That there was a fight in heaven and you know Yeah. This happened and that

2 (51m 5s):
Happened. Yep. Every single one of them.

3 (51m 7s):
Every one without nobody's telling a different story. Right. Everybody's telling the same stories. Yeah. Like that's how you know that vagina and gold are universal things. Because in everybody's story, none of these other worldly interests entities had any interest in anything other than women

2 (51m 40s):
In gold.

3 (51m 41s):
Right. Pussy or gold. Like because, and, and you understand that now when you start learning about what's in space, because you can see that any element or any commodity that we sell here is abundant in space like trash. You know, they found one meteor that was worth all the money

2 (52m 6s):
On earth. Yeah.

3 (52m 7s):
770 billion,

2 (52m 11s):
No

3 (52m 12s):
Trillion. It was another number. It's some crazy

2 (52m 14s):
Number. Some

3 (52m 14s):
Crazy number number. Right, right. Yeah. Wow.

2 (52m 18s):
Yeah. They know that there's, there's spots in space that have abundant minerals that are very valuable. And the, the, the thing about the, the Sumerian story, the Sumerian tech story story may make everyone a billionaire on this earth. Everyone would be a billionaire, but every person would earn seven several billion dollars.

3 (52m 41s):
It it, so it sounds jokey, right. But understand somebody got this contract, like they broke this up into several worldwide contracts, like

2 (52m 51s):
10, 10,000 quadrillion.

3 (52m 53s):
It's just there.

2 (52m 55s):
But here's the thing. If you've got that much gold, is gold valuable anymore? 'cause one of the things about gold is that there's not that much of it. You know, if you look at, you ever seen the number of gold on

3 (53m 4s):
Earth? That's, that's not necessary In capitalism, they showed us that with diamonds. This is

2 (53m 9s):
That's true. They could hide it. It is

3 (53m 10s):
About the perception of things. And if I buy up all of something, it is rare now immediately. Right. Just because I have control of all of it. Right. And that is worth killing Tesla over. And that's why Yeah. The people are still in business in Hollywood because everything's a commodity.

2 (53m 34s):
Did you ever read, you ever heard of Zacharia Hitchen? Zacharia Hitchen was a biblical scholar who he deciphered the Sumerian texts and he's like an expert in language. And when he deciphered, he might not have been a biblical scholar, might just have been a language expert. But either way I love it. He, he deciphered these texts and wrote these books about the real meaning behind everything they were saying. And he said that the reason why we are so fascinated with gold is that the Anki literally would have us mine gold for them. 'cause they needed it to protect their atmosphere. So what they would do is take gold, which is a very rare in what it does.

2 (54m 18s):
What gold can do is you can take a little piece of gold like this big and coat this entire table. It's real weird. Right. It's a very, and you could turn into a fine dust and they suspended this fine dust in their atmosphere to protect them from a, a degrading atmosphere. 'cause they were getting global warming or whatever.

3 (54m 35s):
Everybody that was, he

2 (54m 37s):
Wrote about this in the seventies.

3 (54m 38s):
Ev it doesn't matter because everybody in Egypt knew it. Like this is where the alchemy

2 (54m 50s):
Yeah. That's where it all originated.

3 (54m 52s):
Right? Like, well we

2 (54m 53s):
Don't even know what they knew.

3 (54m 54s):
None of those people are saying, Hey, I came up with this shit they're saying. Right.

2 (54m 59s):
Somebody gave it to

3 (54m 59s):
Us. Somebody who came from this place here came and told us that this is how this goes and this is what this is worth. Yeah. Because I'm saying the people that were being abused in the mines going to get the diamonds. It wa it wasn't like that for them. It was just them getting these rocks. Right. And this crazy guy's gonna pay a day's wages for us to gather rocks. Let's gather 'em. Right. You know, this is, but when you follow back, it's all about the information. And and at the top of it, nobody's trying to claim it like nobody's saying.

2 (55m 42s):
Right. I invented this. Yeah. Yeah. That is wild. If, if imagine this. That's why we're getting most of our shit back engineered stuff. They leave for us. We have to figure it out, sort through it. The people that have alien technology, if they, the people that do have an alien craft that they work on. What a weird reality. You must live in the whole rest of the world's got guessing and you got this thing in front of you like, oh is real. We have one.

3 (56m 13s):
I could show it to you. That's how everybody in Space Force will have to feel. Right?

2 (56m 17s):
Right. They must How many of you you think, see shit?

3 (56m 21s):
I'm saying how do you think Elon Musk really feels like?

2 (56m 24s):
I don't think he's gonna tell you.

3 (56m 26s):
No, I'm saying in his head, can he still have a superhero or is he one of them? Ooh, you know, he's one of them. Like if you're the rigid dude in the world

2 (56m 37s):
And you're also a super Genius, how the fuck do you stop yourself from thinking you're a superhero? That's the big question.

3 (56m 43s):
No, it's not like that. No, no. It doesn't have superhero side effects to it.

2 (56m 48s):
I mean You would

3 (56m 49s):
Probably think like, like the more you know, the more you know how little you know. That's true too. There's not a, you know what I mean and nobody has ownership of information. That that's, that's why reading books moves civilization. Because like when I, when I said like, you know, I read 3000 books, people were like, yeah. Right. But you know, every, everything in life is about the environment. It it was grown in the Petri dish. Right. So if I told you that from the time I was eight to the time I was 12, I never celebrated any birthdays.

3 (57m 33s):
I never went to a birthday party. I never had a Thanksgiving, a Christmas. I never trick or treated. I wasn't allowed to watch movies and I wasn't allowed to watch tv. All I could do was read. If I told you that, then you would understand that Wow. For eight hours a day, I got eight hours. and I can read and I love to read. And so I'm reading books that are 250, 200 pages and it takes me about an hour to read one. So yeah, I'm reading it takes an hour to read 50 pages. I'm reading a day. Yeah. Like all I'm doing is reading. 'cause that's what, so I'm, I'm checking out 20 books.

3 (58m 18s):
The limit at the library is 20 books at one time. So I'm going Monday, Wednesday, and Friday just because this is my thing. Like,

2 (58m 28s):
So you're getting 60 books a week.

3 (58m 30s):
Abs minimum because Really? Yeah. Yeah. Because I'm reading more than that because I still have religious books that I have to read. So under un understand, this is pre-internet first. Right. So understand that in reading one thing that I'm reading, right, right. This one thing that I'm reading is also requiring me to have this appendix book that is the source book that it's telling me it's getting these things from. And so I've got four books open at a time just for this one book.

3 (59m 12s):
Like, but yeah, I'm, so first I, I guess between eight and 12, I'm only, I'm, I'm a, I can read classics and nonfiction. So I'm saying no novels or anything like that. I'm just reading the like, time Life has like 1800 of these individual books on all subjects of the world. And

2 (59m 48s):
So you just spent most of your time reading,

3 (59m 51s):
Not most, all of it, all

2 (59m 53s):
Of your time reading. And then when did it,

3 (59m 55s):
That was my thing because like, like I was able to be in each of these stories. Right. You follow what I'm saying? And, and I was getting so much information, like half of those I probably had to write a one page report on after, you know. But yeah, that was my whole thing. and I the numbers aren't even really accurate. 'cause I read more than that because like, sometimes, sometimes I would read something and I wouldn't get it. Like, like there was this classic book called Little Women that I probably read it four times 'cause I just didn't, I didn't understand it and I knew it was a classic, but

2 (1h 0m 48s):
I never read it. What's it about?

3 (1h 0m 52s):
It's

2 (1h 0m 52s):
About, have you read it,

3 (1h 0m 52s):
Jamie? Some little women

7 (1h 0m 54s):
A kid. I just, I just watched an episode of Kerber. Was there talking about it.

2 (1h 0m 57s):
That's What is this story about?

3 (1h 0m 59s):
Well, well I, here's the thing, sisters I know. Yeah, right, right. Like Four Sisters think that. Okay. Okay. But they, they had money and a, an incredible circumstance. But the thing was, I didn't have any sisters, so I didn't have anything to pull from and I didn't have women in my life like that. So yeah. A lot of things I would have to read multiple times for me to get

2 (1h 1m 28s):
Right. To try to think how they thought.

3 (1h 1m 30s):
Right. Well yeah, like even like the Three Musketeers, like I probably read it three times because I, you know, it was so I read it like the first time to read it, but then the next time I had to read it again because these characters were really distinct characters. Right. and I couldn't figure out, wait a minute, did this happen really in history or was somebody just this good at telling this story of the, you know, but, but it's things like that that leads you to the Knight's Templar story, which leads you to, you know, seeing how things through history have remained, you know what I mean, like all of that you get from the books.

2 (1h 2m 23s):
Well, history to me has always been the most fascinating thing because you can't quite imagine it. You're trying to imagine it. You're piecing it together. Yeah. Listen to these stories and you just sit back and go, what the fuck was that like? Right.

3 (1h 2m 36s):
And I wasn't even, which is what we create every day. Yeah,

2 (1h 2m 39s):
Yeah.

3 (1h 2m 40s):
Right.

2 (1h 2m 41s):
Yeah. We are, we are creating the future's version of what the fuck was that? Like? Yeah. This, this place right here freaks me out the most. 'cause this this area specifically this area of Texas, the hill country was just all Native Americans forever. There's thousands of arrowheads. Man,

3 (1h 2m 58s):
Look at this. Here's the, here's the thing.

2 (1h 2m 59s):
My friend found this on his ranch.

3 (1h 3m 1s):
None. None of those people, when we say those people n none of them picked a bad place ever.

2 (1h 3m 9s):
No.

3 (1h 3m 10s):
That's when you understand that there's a grid. Yeah. Because nobody's who people picked bad spots. No. Everybody understood certain things about the area and long before they had x-ray machines. And

2 (1h 3m 26s):
Yeah,

3 (1h 3m 27s):
If you just went by that in the whole world, you would start to understand like the true power of the Vatican and the fact that certain things are based on real shit. Like the arc of the covenant ain't some spooky little story. It's like, what do you think

2 (1h 3m 47s):
It is? Think it's like a nuclear generator or something like that. What do you think it is?

3 (1h 3m 53s):
Whatever the nucleus is that would nuclear power. Something that would have initially been in the pyramids would also have been in the arc of the covenant, which would be the same thing. It's something that you can't fuck with and it's radioactive and it's very powerful. That's why they gotta put around it still beep.

2 (1h 4m 12s):
Oh shit.

3 (1h 4m 13s):
That's what Im saying. Nobody's telling any crazy stories, my man. Not globally.

2 (1h 4m 19s):
No,

3 (1h 4m 20s):
No. Every, everything

2 (1h 4m 22s):
Was about it gets less crazy every year. It gets less crazy every year. Yeah. 20 years ago talking about any of this stuff was straight up nonsense. Yes. But now people are like, well, hold on. That's probably what disclosure actually looks like. Yes. It looks like a slow trickle integration into the zeitgeist, to the point where it's just normal.

3 (1h 4m 42s):
Because a lot of times they're right. A lot of times it turns out that they were right. That no, we couldn't have told people this because yeah, they would've went and this would've happened and that would've happened. And you can start to see that like, yeah.

2 (1h 4m 57s):
That's why when when you, you think about what, what people have always believed, that's why Angels and Devils freak me out because no one wants to believe that there's a Satan, that there's a devil.

3 (1h 5m 15s):
You believe in astronauts, though, right? Yeah. Okay.

2 (1h 5m 21s):
But people have always said there is,

3 (1h 5m 24s):
You mean a bad and a good?

2 (1h 5m 25s):
Yeah. Not just a bad and a good, but an actual evil malevolent force.

3 (1h 5m 28s):
No, just start with bad and good. Okay. Yes. Bad and good. Okay. So if we started bad and good, then we understand what must be at the extremes of that. Right? Nobody's telling a different story.

2 (1h 5m 40s):
And then there's a concept of actual entities

3 (1h 5m 42s):
Yes.

2 (1h 5m 44s):
Actual demonic entities that do exist.

3 (1h 5m 47s):
Well, I'm saying your DNA is either fused or it's not. If it is, they requires a fuser. Mm. That's all

2 (1h 5m 58s):
A fuser. Right? What do you mean by that?

3 (1h 6m 5s):
I'm, I'm saying if they tell you that certain parts of your DNA are fused, that requires a fuer. Did I say that right?

2 (1h 6m 20s):
I'm not sure I see what you're saying there. The structure to us in everything, all of it does seem remarkable

3 (1h 6m 32s):
In a no mistakes type of way.

2 (1h 6m 34s):
Yeah. In a, a synchronistic sort of

3 (1h 6m 36s):
A way which flies in the face of the accidental big bang. Nothing from nothing way of thinking. Yeah. and it always has been.

2 (1h 6m 47s):
Well, that's what I think, like in the beginning, there was light. When they talk about that, if you were gonna describe the beginning of the universe, even if you're describing the Big Bang, which there's a lot of speculation that that wasn't necessarily the beginning. That there might be a continuous cycle of these events happening over and over again. But if you were talking about a creation story, you would say in the beginning there was light because there was, it was fucking enormous amount of light. It created the entire universe.

3 (1h 7m 18s):
Literally.

2 (1h 7m 18s):
Literally.

3 (1h 7m 19s):
Right. I think, which is all it says. And, and, and here's like, whatever they say that hell or Hades is in any of these religions worldwide, it is the perfect description for what a black hole is. In real life.

2 (1h 7m 39s):
It is. You fall through forever

3 (1h 7m 42s):
A bottomless pit.

2 (1h 7m 44s):
Yeah. But time doesn't exist.

3 (1h 7m 47s):
Where time does not exist. Where you don't die, but you don't exit where the information like,

2 (1h 7m 55s):
And it eats stars.

3 (1h 7m 57s):
Right. But, but how? but it eats stars in galaxy. Yeah. All that. Right? But, but we can have multiple of them and everything all over the place. They'll still be okay. All

2 (1h 8m 12s):
They're the center, the

3 (1h 8m 14s):
Center of That's the flex.

2 (1h 8m 15s):
Yeah. Yeah.

3 (1h 8m 16s):
We're fine with them. The

2 (1h 8m 18s):
Right. It's like if you live in Africa, you gotta deal with

3 (1h 8m 19s):
Lions. What's this thing? Oh, it kills everything. Right? Everything. What? Everything. It touches

2 (1h 8m 23s):
Everything. Everything. It's gonna get us eventually, but not now.

3 (1h 8m 26s):
What you mean? You have two of them.

2 (1h 8m 30s):
They find them floating around.

3 (1h 8m 32s):
They find them,

2 (1h 8m 33s):
They find 'em floating around. Right. I mean they noticed them. Yeah. They noticed that they're out there floating around. Yeah. They found one that's so fucking big. So they, we did this thing where we played a video of how small the earth is in comparison to the sun, how small the sun is in comparison to the giant stars, and how small giant stars are into the most, the most massive, super massive black hole that they know currently. It's bananas.

3 (1h 8m 59s):
What's out there? Our perfect habitat is so perfect that anyone universally would sense would say, whew. Location, location, location. You know,

2 (1h 9m 11s):
Like the greatest real estate

3 (1h 9m 12s):
Agent ever. Yeah. If the Moon or the Sun were further back, we'd,

2 (1h 9m 16s):
We'd be fucked.

3 (1h 9m 17s):
Yeah. Or the trooper wasn't there. Or closer or like, like Yeah. The whole thing is, you know, someone later saying, do you think Beverly Hills was, I think this was an area they built on purpose. Yeah. It was. Oh, don't let me, oh,

2 (1h 9m 42s):
Just imagine if the, the Moon was slightly smaller. Just imagine, look, imagine if the earth was slightly further away from the sun.

3 (1h 9m 51s):
They know that it is to the point where it, some of it might have been artificially done, and they're aware of that. They're, they're aware of the truth.

2 (1h 10m 7s):
So

3 (1h 10m 7s):
The artificial specific of the Moon

2 (1h 10m 9s):
Solar system. Oh, the Moon,

3 (1h 10m 10s):
Right. Specific. I've heard that theory.

2 (1h 10m 12s):
That's a wild theory.

3 (1h 10m 14s):
Well, some of it's not theory. Like I, I was, I was on that subject as a teenager, but as a grown person is when the thing happened where they hid it with the missile and it rang like a bell. Yeah. Like certain things are,

2 (1h 10m 40s):
What was the explanation for that? 'cause it did have some sort of a crazy, like,

3 (1h 10m 44s):
The question is, who would offer an explanation? Right? Because it wasn't like the, they, they didn't just do it once. Like imagine all accounts say it rang like a bell for hours and hours and hours.

2 (1h 10m 59s):
Imagine if that's a feature for a stable planet that they put there.

3 (1h 11m 4s):
Well, that's how Xbox works, really. You know, or a PlayStation. I'm an Xbox guy, but I'm saying, you know, you have your gaming system and it just requires that in your wifi nearby and bam, you know Right. Make things happen. And so many of our things globally, we come by understanding that and the magnetics and dynamics and things that really work.

2 (1h 11m 39s):
There's a lot of people that think that whatever we're seeing isn't just from another planet, but from another dimension. That they're dimensional travelers. That they have access to places that we don't have access to because we're too primitive. We, we can't wrap our head around it as a civilization. We haven't reached the ability to transcend, but that they can, and that they're here all the time.

3 (1h 12m 7s):
Well, the way we look at it, you know, we're the greatest spot in the universe, but the travelers don't lead us to believe that.

2 (1h 12m 19s):
Well, there's always competition. There's always going to be a greater civilization than the one previous. There's always gonna be more. There's always gonna be more. If people are going to innovate to the point where they're gonna make spacecrafts, that means these people are competing with each other, these things, whatever they are, they're still, they, they must be in some sort of competition. There must be something that motivates them. And so, right.

3 (1h 12m 40s):
But at, at that level, competition is healthy and there are no unhealthy components. Hopefully. So. Well, no, not, not hopefully. Definitely. Once, once we're all building space, personal space contraptions for ourselves. We're going to push one another. It's, it's not just, we're gonna all want the best one. Yeah. And we're going to insist that that be the case. Just like we do with cars. When

2 (1h 13m 14s):
I said hopefully what I mean is that like, hopefully they will be like healthy, friendly competition. That's what motivates them. What's not hopeful is that they could be robotic emotionless things that have transcended biological needs. And that they just have a function. That function is seeding intelligent life in the universe and establishing, just like you would be a farmer and you would go out and leave hay for the animals

3 (1h 13m 43s):
Needs are primitive.

2 (1h 13m 45s):
Yeah. They are primitive. but it, we're always moving into some more and more complex direction. Technologically, it seems like that's never gonna stop. Right. And the only thing that makes sense to me is that we're, we're doing something because that's like what we're literally designed to do. It's, we have all these things that sort of motivate people and greed and lust and Curiosity. Yeah. But what we're doing is we're always making better things.

3 (1h 14m 11s):
Yeah.

2 (1h 14m 11s):
Constantly making better things, which would lead ultimately to the creation of a higher life form. Some, some more intelligent emotionless being. And that's the scary thought, is that all this life out there is life that was created by biological creatures who had these desires and needs that ultimately led to them making a better version of them. And then that is like the butterfly that comes out of the cocoon.

3 (1h 14m 39s):
As soon as we put people in space, we became aliens that day. Right, right.

2 (1h 14m 44s):
Yeah.

3 (1h 14m 45s):
A lot of things are perspective.

2 (1h 14m 48s):
That's true. I mean, you could say you're a camper, but you're really only go in a tent. Your yard, you're still kind of camping. Well, I know that's

3 (1h 14m 55s):
What we're doing as far as space travel. I'm say our, our guy has put a date on the Mars colonization though, right?

2 (1h 15m 2s):
Yeah. But he's also put a date on the Roadster when that Tesla Roadster's coming out, that motherfucker's never gonna see the light of day. What is, what is that car coming out?

3 (1h 15m 10s):
No, because I, there's something about it the

2 (1h 15m 11s):
Other day. That car is supposed to be out for years. Yeah. It's supposed to be

3 (1h 15m 14s):
Out two or three years ago. I think that's, God, that's part of being a billionaire. Sure is. It's not worth putting out something that's not right. It doesn't matter how bad it's wanted.

2 (1h 15m 26s):
Well, he actually explained that. He said it was, man manufacturing is insanely difficult. The way he explained it. It's, you know, you don't consider it. 'cause every, you know, people just manufacture things, think it's normal. But he was like the process of manufacturing, especially like a car, an electric car, insanely difficult.

3 (1h 15m 43s):
He had a harder time doing that cyber truck than he did. Yeah. Space stuff.

2 (1h 15m 50s):
Cyber drug's, hard. What's all folded steel? It's this fucking massive 7,000 plus pound folded steel truck that goes zero to 60 in three seconds. and it looks like it's from the future. It looks like if you were gonna watch

3 (1h 16m 5s):
Movie, movie, it's the hottest thing on Mars movie. It's crazy.

2 (1h 16m 7s):
Yeah. That's, that's what it is. Yeah. Yeah. It looks like the most futuristic car ever.

3 (1h 16m 13s):
Right?

2 (1h 16m 16s):
Yeah. But

3 (1h 16m 17s):
As kids, that's what we drew. don

2 (1h 16m 19s):
Don't know when we're going to Mars and Don don't know who the fuck's gonna do that. That's a six month journey. And you're just hoping.

3 (1h 16m 26s):
So what, so what several billionaires were talked into getting into a capsule with limited air. To go a long way down, bro,

2 (1h 16m 41s):
That's a dark way to die. Just knowing that you

3 (1h 16m 44s):
Chose to do it. Well just know, even if you're a racist hearing this, all death is dark. So

2 (1h 16m 50s):
What I mean is the last moments must be horrific.

3 (1h 16m 54s):
No more creaking, no more horrific than anyone else's

2 (1h 16m 59s):
I know. But there's something about the choice of being, you know, thousands of feet under the water.

3 (1h 17m 5s):
No, it's being a billionaire. It's crushing your soul dies. Long before I could have done anything, this is what I chose.

2 (1h 17m 22s):
That's hilarious.

3 (1h 17m 23s):
That depth.

2 (1h 17m 25s):
That guy could be fishing in Maui right now with a nice cold beer hanging out with his friends, listening to some music. Instead he hears,

3 (1h 17m 42s):
Right.

2 (1h 17m 45s):
He is like, carbon fibers starting to crack. God damn.

3 (1h 17m 51s):
It's already done at that point. Yep. Done. None of that's happening. It's,

2 (1h 17m 54s):
They knew those people were dead a long time ago. Which is interesting because I didn't know how sophisticated the underwater listening devices are. But they have these super sophisticated underwater listening devices everywhere to make sure that Russia's not sneaking up on us. 'cause Russia will sneak up on a motherfucker. Russia, sorry, Russia stuck up on people before.

3 (1h 18m 15s):
Sorry. None of that is for Russia. You

2 (1h 18m 21s):
Think it's for aliens.

3 (1h 18m 21s):
None of that is for Russia. Do you think

2 (1h 18m 25s):
That's, you think that's for aliens?

3 (1h 18m 27s):
That

2 (1h 18m 27s):
Would be the wildest shit of all time. What? Underwater listing devices? 'cause they knew the aliens were under

3 (1h 18m 31s):
There. Okay, let's see if this is weed talk or not. Let's go. So which one do we know more about? Do we know more about space? Or do we know more about the oceans?

2 (1h 18m 41s):
We know more about space. Yeah. Quite a

3 (1h 18m 44s):
Bit more. Okay. So yeah. Yeah. And part of that is because

2 (1h 18m 51s):
The oceans very difficult to

3 (1h 18m 52s):
Penetrate at. At some point. It's government.

2 (1h 18m 59s):
They're hiding things from us. I would hide things from people. I would definitely make it illegal for you to have a submarine. You could have a yacht. Don't get crazy. You can't go underwater. I gotta know where the fuck you are. If I need to collect taxes.

3 (1h 19m 12s):
Well, I'm, if

2 (1h 19m 13s):
You're floating around, I could pull up.

3 (1h 19m 14s):
It was a conspiracy theory at one point that you, you know, the government got bases inside the mountains.

2 (1h 19m 23s):
Right? Well, until they had to expand the boundary behind area 51 and make area 51 larger. They never even admitted it existed. It wasn't until the Obama administration that they actually came out and said, area 50 one's a real thing. We need more land. Do you ever see the video of Bob Lazar, the guy who used to work there? Have you ever seen that guy? That's a

3 (1h 19m 48s):
Wild one. I was following old Bob Lazar. Yeah.

2 (1h 19m 52s):
What do you think about that? Do you think he's telling the truth?

3 (1h 19m 57s):
Here's the thing, Joe, just, just an opinion. But what I find fascinating is the lack of imagination in any of these stories where imagination could apply. Like,

2 (1h 20m 21s):
Like if someone was bullshitting, you'd see evidence of it. Like, right. Because that's the thing. If people bullshit, they kind of bullshit about everything. Right.

3 (1h 20m 29s):
Right.

2 (1h 20m 29s):
Because they think they're smart enough to trick you. No one's smart enough to come up with one story only their whole life. Their whole life. They're straight down the middle square. Tell the truth all the time. But one time they decide to have a whopper of a lie and just fabricate this thing and structure

3 (1h 20m 47s):
It. No, you're seeing somebody tell you a story that is the only explanation for certain things that are happening. Yeah.

2 (1h 20m 59s):
Especially he tells you a story. And then you have independent people who also used to work for the government now becoming whistleblowers and saying, there's a crashed retrieval program. Crashed UFO retrieval program.

3 (1h 21m 14s):
It goes back to what I'm saying, Joe, these are the, this is how you say this without getting canceled. Look, you do think they're doing something, don't you?

2 (1h 21m 23s):
They're doing something. They wouldn't tell us

3 (1h 21m 25s):
Everything they're doing. We, we wanna believe like nobody's doing nothing. Like no, no. We are doing stuff like they're doing

2 (1h 21m 33s):
Something. They're just not telling us

3 (1h 21m 36s):
That. That's part of it though. Right.

2 (1h 21m 38s):
You know what? The people involved in the retrieval called the vehicles? They call 'em donations.

3 (1h 21m 46s):
Right? Well, because

2 (1h 21m 49s):
That's what they think they are. They think that the limited times that these crafts have shown themselves, you

3 (1h 21m 55s):
Didn't, you as the driver or the occupant, didn't mean for that to be your destination. And you don't take anything, you only give, therefore, that's why it's known as a donation. Mm. Because it's like, it's what you would say if one of those meteors that we were talking about, if one just the size of a refrigerator landed in your backyard, like a billion dollars can land in your backyard.

3 (1h 22m 36s):
Easy peasy.

2 (1h 22m 38s):
Or obliterate an entire city and send everybody back to this stone age. That's the wildest one.

3 (1h 22m 45s):
Right. But the, but it's not that wild. If you look at the Moon,

2 (1h 22m 50s):
Right?

3 (1h 22m 51s):
The Moon shows you the evidence. That's a thing pelt. Right? Like, if

2 (1h 22m 55s):
We could just look at it, it's just filled with holes.

3 (1h 22m 57s):
Right.

2 (1h 22m 59s):
Big fucking craters all over that you could see with the naked eye.

3 (1h 23m 3s):
Well, I'm saying most of the people that are in America and drive in urban settings know what potholes are. And so, you know, it's the same thing.

2 (1h 23m 15s):
Yeah. This is a weird time where people are just starting to pay attention to so many of these subjects and so many of these things. Like, are we alone? Have there been advanced civilizations before? How did we become us?

3 (1h 23m 31s):
It's, it's been a conversation at all points in Yeah. In time. Like, but

2 (1h 23m 36s):
More people are having it now without fear of being labeled an idiot.

3 (1h 23m 40s):
Well, it's because information is now a free commodity. Whereas in different points in history, it wasn't like that. Right.

2 (1h 23m 53s):
It was protected.

3 (1h 23m 54s):
You didn't make enough money to get access to this information. And no matter where you're looking information is the driving force of almost every war and conflict. This. Yeah. It, it was about the place that you conquered. Not only did you conquer them, but you got a chance to know what they knew and that you found was more important than anything else. Mm. And that's,

2 (1h 24m 25s):
Well, think about the people that lived just before they translated the Bible from Latin. How many people couldn't read it?

3 (1h 24m 33s):
Well that was part of the experience that you were getting from church was the fact that pe that it was being read to you. Right. You see what I'm saying? It not what we have currently where you have the book and they have the book, but you know, this person is literally reciting the word of God to you.

2 (1h 24m 60s):
Yeah. Yeah. And he becomes the holder of all that information and the only one

3 (1h 25m 4s):
All holders of all information. Yeah. Are

2 (1h 25m 8s):
That. Yep. It's like a human pattern that people follow. Even if they just run an internet company, even if they run a social media company. Yeah. They follow that same pattern.

3 (1h 25m 18s):
W well, because control everything in the universe. Everything on this planet, everything that we could look at in the wildlife or in the plant life, or e every, everything is a formula. Everything is that way. Yeah. And that's one of the, you know, the science and math go together with the occult and alchemy. And all of these things are based on things like, like even the Smurfs story, right?

2 (1h 25m 56s):
The Smurfs are based on something.

3 (1h 25m 58s):
Well, religious people will say, oh, you can't watch the Smurfs 'cause 'cause it's bad. 'cause they have witchcraft and stuff in there. But the whole thing is, it's based on this, the homunculus, the idea that you can create a human life form without a mother or a father. So

2 (1h 26m 26s):
Really that's what the Smurfs are based on.

3 (1h 26m 32s):
So who, so who, what, what two Smurfs do you think got together? I know, I know much about Smurf and had Smurf at, she was the only female of the Smurfs. So

2 (1h 26m 44s):
It's a good question.

3 (1h 26m 45s):
Well, it is not a question in the Smurfs. They tell you, they tell you that Garga male made Smurf at, but you know, in somebody's history, don don't want to say what race of people or group of people it is. But in somebody's history, you know, there was this homunculus thing and

2 (1h 27m 11s):
Like a genetically engineered human

3 (1h 27m 14s):
Life form. Yeah. Life form

2 (1h 27m 17s):
Creature.

3 (1h 27m 17s):
Right. Whoa. And so, you know, it's spoken of his in history, very sparingly. But you know, a lot of things in per in in the world are, are about perception, you know? Yeah. So we don't believe that there's clones. We don't believe that because we don't feel like we have the technology. But the truth is, if you go body part to body part, you'll go, what if I lost two legs? Oh, we give you two legs. Well, what about two arms? I could give you two arms. Okay, well what about the heart? Yeah, no problem. What about the, what about the, like we are already,

2 (1h 27m 55s):
Yeah. All you'd have to do is make a clone, brain dead. Figure out how to engineer a brain dead clone that'll grow organs for you. Look. And then they'll make cloning legal. 'cause then you'll never have to worry. Hey Katt, you need a new heart. Guess what this

3 (1h 28m 10s):
Sir, this is the same, this is the same pathway that everybody is on in all of these departments. Like, this is, this is what you're like, people spend their life trying to find the cure for cancer. You know what I mean? Yeah. And, and working as hard as they can every single day. You know what I mean? Unsuccessfully. We, those are the type of people that help make the world go around, you know?

5 (1h 28m 52s):
Mm.

3 (1h 28m 55s):
Yeah. 'cause it's all about information. And we, and we'd be so close most of the time. But that's how you, you can see when we've had influence from something else.

2 (1h 29m 11s):
Well, I think it's very possible that we have, it's just so frustrating when you want to know. You know, it's one of those things where life would change forever if you had undeniable contact with something. If it would've just change forever. Your perception of light y just to drive through the, In-N-Out drive through would be different. Everything would be different.

3 (1h 29m 34s):
Right. But

2 (1h 29m 34s):
You taking a shit would be different. There's aliens out there.

3 (1h 29m 37s):
You could say that about smelling salts or, or mushrooms or you could say that about lots of things.

2 (1h 29m 46s):
Yeah. But about that specifically that if that, if we knew that that was real. 'cause I think it's probably true, but I still will hold open the pa the, the possibility that it's all bullshit.

3 (1h 30m 0s):
Here's the whole thing. No one who has ever seen more space or the universe than you and I has ever seen anything that was bullshit.

2 (1h 30m 12s):
What do you mean?

3 (1h 30m 14s):
Any universe?

2 (1h 30m 17s):
What I mean is like fake UFO footage. There's a lot of fake footage. I would wanna see if you could see something yourself. and I have good friends that have, I have good friends that have had experiences that they say there is no fucking way that that is us. That this is something else.

3 (1h 30m 37s):
Right. Just understand that part of the job in any of these circumstances is to kick up kerfuffle. Like Right. That's part of it. Like if you live in Florida, you see how many times things go off into space and you know that there's a pattern between that. And government airplanes and like, like our stories of cooperation have been nothing but cooperative as they could only be like, we don't hold any leverage.

2 (1h 31m 20s):
I think some of the shit that we're seeing is our stuff.

3 (1h 31m 24s):
Right. I'm saying, but nobody would have a way of like, as advanced as we are, we still gotta let that balloon fly over. Right?

2 (1h 31m 38s):
Yeah. What the fuck is that? That's the most obvious shit ever. That's your neighbor peeking over the fence.

3 (1h 31m 50s):
No, it is not. It is your neighbor's drone.

2 (1h 31m 55s):
Yeah. Your neighbor's drone

3 (1h 31m 56s):
In your yard coming

2 (1h 31m 57s):
Over your house. Yeah. Right. Ridiculous.

3 (1h 31m 60s):
Right. Filled with a pinata of the next covid.

2 (1h 32m 8s):
Right. I mean, what are they doing flying

3 (1h 32m 13s):
Robots? It's not like that. It's not like that. In the world of flying things, sometimes things go off course. You see what I'm saying?

2 (1h 32m 24s):
You think that's all

3 (1h 32m 25s):
It was? Was especially spy stuff.

2 (1h 32m 27s):
Do you think that's all? It was a one off course that it just magically happened to go near all the military bases.

3 (1h 32m 31s):
Don't say magically. I'm say wind.

2 (1h 32m 36s):
The wind. Got it.

3 (1h 32m 37s):
Well, I'm saying

2 (1h 32m 39s):
Pro, they just flew those things over and they hoped that bidet didn't notice. They said they flew over during Trump's administration too, but they didn't tell 'em. 'cause they didn't want 'em to shoot 'em down.

3 (1h 32m 47s):
Neither of those stories is true. That information was out there. It was one like two days ago, right?

2 (1h 32m 52s):
Another one. Yeah. They said this was a hobbyist though, but Oh, that's what they said.

3 (1h 32m 58s):
A hobbyist. Well that, yeah, this doesn't count. Yeah, this doesn't count. And the way that you know immediately is it says over Utah, like that would be where, you know,

2 (1h 33m 12s):
That's like white sands, right? No, that's New Mexico, isn't it? Yeah. What's a, there's gotta be military base in Utah though, right?

3 (1h 33m 19s):
Well, I'm saying in the, actually the image I showed was in, in the map wise. The first one, the Chinese surveillance balloon

2 (1h 33m 25s):
Is what this is. Oh, that's what this one is. This is the one from February, 2023. Right? That's the one they shot down. Look at that. So it's just a balloon with a solar power and some kind of camera. How weird.

3 (1h 33m 40s):
Not weird. Not weird.

2 (1h 33m 43s):
Well, not weird if you just think about human patterns, we've gotta see what the enemy's up to. It's fly over, take some pictures, see what the fuck is going on with these people.

3 (1h 33m 53s):
I'm saying we can say whatever we want, but we're civilized and maybe they're not civilized. So if you weren't civilized, then maybe part of your job is airborne weaponry.

2 (1h 34m 5s):
Yeah.

3 (1h 34m 6s):
So you gotta test it out. You gotta see what it can do. Yeah. And yeah, they're gonna go off course. Okay,

2 (1h 34m 18s):
Well that's not an airborne weaponry, but we have a lot of

3 (1h 34m 21s):
It. Information is,

2 (1h 34m 22s):
That's true. Information is weaponry

3 (1h 34m 24s):
Information is. Yeah. Just knowing what the conversations are over this wide swath of people is worth money. Because at the end of all these information driven society places is analytics. And that's what this is. Yeah. I probably said too much.

2 (1h 34m 50s):
No, it's all right. We'll be fine. I just wonder where it's all headed headed. 'cause if it seems like we're building towards an event, I think about it all the time. It seems like it's not, it's

3 (1h 35m 3s):
Time to get a bunker.

2 (1h 35m 4s):
It seems like it might be a good time to get a bunker or at least some a supply of water.

3 (1h 35m 11s):
Well, here's the thing, if you follow what becomes accessible, that's how you can generally see where things are going. You know? And so that's the true magicalness of Elon Musk, you know, is take that guy out of the story and just tell that story and

2 (1h 35m 38s):
Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's moving us into so many different directions all at the same time. The electric car thing, the internet satellite thing. And now this Neuralink thing, the Neuralink thing is the craziest one,

3 (1h 35m 51s):
Because all of these things are connected in these higher upper echelon conversations. I'm saying you see the same conversation with Tesla or Da Vinci or like, information is what is limited. And whole industries can be built upon your ability to know how certain things are gonna hit certain people. And this was before we called things promotion and marketing.

3 (1h 36m 31s):
You know what I mean? That's Hollywood is not really there to entertain you. Like that's great that that happens. But propaganda is something that is important to all civilizations.

2 (1h 36m 51s):
Well, propaganda and Hollywood movies is built into the ingredients list. It's like, if you want flour, you need wheat, you're gonna have to get the wheat. And if you wanna be able to make movies about certain subjects, you have to be willing to work with some people that, you know, it would be nice if you made it so that this is what we're trying to accomplish. And this is showing the, the negative side of this other society. And this is the ju and this is our hero, is our hero who's gonna go do America's bidding and go over there and you're like, okay. And those movies are successful. And so they continue this relationship and you become a bit of a propaganda arm for the government.

2 (1h 37m 40s):
And in turn they don't fuck with you.

3 (1h 37m 44s):
Right. But that's what, That's what makes information so powerful is, you know, you don't care how people feel about the ritual. It's about just following the ritual work. Yeah. And so you can fool yourself into thinking there isn't one, but the evidence will be clear. So like when I, when I be like, oh, these guys are wearing dresses, everybody's like, oh, he keeps talking about people wearing dresses. No, it's not. That is a weird thing. It's not like that. Look at it from a different way.

3 (1h 38m 25s):
Look at it. Show me one person that ever wore a dress in Hollywood, unsuccessfully. That's how you understand what a ritual is. Mm. So 20 years ago, I knew that transgenders was going to be a thing. It wasn't because I was a prophet. Just, I had gotten so much information that I understood the path that things are secular. So I understood that the earliest I had seen that word transgender was bidet the transgender.

3 (1h 39m 11s):
And so I knew that in the ritual of the transgender to show allegiance to him, you had to kiss his ass ring. Really? and it said both of those things. So I knew that both of those things will become popular in the future. And that somehow calling people the goat would be normalized over the sheep being always the most popular reference.

2 (1h 39m 49s):
Let's just, god damn, we got some good weed cat. Jesus Christ.

3 (1h 39m 53s):
This must be the weed time. I'm trying to figure out

2 (1h 39m 56s):
How to jump in on that.

3 (1h 39m 59s):
Right. Which is my only goal. I,

2 (1h 40m 5s):
I always wonder whether or not all the stories in the Bible, it's just where we are experiencing it. Like the, the mark of the beast thing that we were talking about earlier. If that is not, if that is not, I think if, if you had to tell a story for so many years Yeah. Before anybody ever even figured out how to write it down. And you're telling a story about a civilization that allowed people to put brain implants in them, and then all of a sudden the brain implants were hijacked by machines and people became just meat zombies controlled by corporations. That would be the mark of the beast. That'd be a demonic thing. If it, if a demon tricked human beings into wearing a hat that turned you into a zombie, that demon would be like a, a famous character in books and folklore.

2 (1h 40m 54s):
But that demon exists, and it's just technology. It just shows itself through this desire for the newest, latest gr innovations that are gonna constantly fuel it becoming more and more powerful into one day. It tricks you into letting it into its head. Like a vampire. Like the vampire stories you had, you had to let 'em in, remember that was the thing. You had to invite them in. And if you invited them in, you're fucked. But if you didn't invite them in for some reason, they weren't allowed to kill you. It's almost like

3 (1h 41m 25s):
The story, here's the thing, that you have to be able to benefit from the zombie. Like there's no benefit in, in, in that taken out of context. Like if you are making them zombies so that they can mind for you, then there's a story of that over there. Yeah. Like, like that's the whole thing is when you look at these ancient writings, they're not, they're, they're not saying like, yeah. So he was from another world and we had to bring him, our kids and he would eat 'em in front of us. And like, they're not telling those stories.

3 (1h 42m 7s):
They're saying like, agriculture and knowledge, literature and

2 (1h 42m 14s):
Cosmology.

3 (1h 42m 15s):
Right. Explain

2 (1h 42m 16s):
The origin of life. Yeah. Like show, show the double helix. DNA

3 (1h 42m 20s):
To a fault. Yeah. Nobody's Yeah. Saying out anything outside of mathematic parameters.

2 (1h 42m 30s):
Well, the wildest stuff is when you look at some of those old Sumerian tablets, and you see how they had the solar system mapped out. They had the sun in the center looked just like a sun with little marks around it. It had Venus where it should be Jupiter, where it should be Uranus, where it should be, they're all in the right spots. It's

3 (1h 42m 51s):
Crazy Like this. The Ethiopian tribe have the saved. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Like, no crazy. It's not you, but there's very, there is no craziness. All right. Everything lines up the same grids. Look at

2 (1h 43m 10s):
That. That is just nuts, man. Yeah. I mean, I don't know what the conventional explanation for that is. 'cause that Zacharia sit guy who said all this stuff, he was often criticized that people said that he took things too far. That his, his analysis went too far. And he just went into speculation. But god damn, a lot of the stuff that he was saying, like you could see the di implication in the actual tablets themselves. They show these gigantic beings with these little tiny people like sitting on their laps. And the people have tails. Have you seen those? It's, it looks

3 (1h 43m 50s):
Like

2 (1h 43m 50s):
Genetic

3 (1h 43m 51s):
Engineering. Maybe it's a tail, maybe it's piping. What? Oh, oh, Jesus.

2 (1h 43m 55s):
Right. It could be piping.

3 (1h 43m 57s):
You understand? Right. What I'm Oh yeah.

2 (1h 43m 58s):
Of course

3 (1h 43m 59s):
It could, what I'm saying is nobody's telling these outlandish. Right.

2 (1h 44m 6s):
But they're all kind of all saying the same thing. There's some higher power that comes and gives you structure, tells you what to do and how to live.

3 (1h 44m 16s):
Mm.

2 (1h 44m 17s):
And every society,

3 (1h 44m 18s):
Information, information, that's what they

2 (1h 44m 20s):
Give you's it, they give you information. Yeah.

3 (1h 44m 23s):
Every story, every civilization. Yep. Every time. Yep.

2 (1h 44m 29s):
Yeah. That's it. And that's what we're all thirsty for.

3 (1h 44m 32s):
Right.

2 (1h 44m 33s):
You know? And what

3 (1h 44m 33s):
People aren't. Well, we're thirsty to monetize.

2 (1h 44m 36s):
That's too, but also, humans, individually are thirsty for information. We always want information. We want gossip, we want news, we want bullshit. We want science. Especially if you have an appetite for, you know, things that make you think there's so much information that people are just constantly consuming. There's bullshit information like TikTok and nonsense that just passes you by. But there's still Yeah.

3 (1h 45m 1s):
But none of that stuff is nonsense.

2 (1h 45m 3s):
Well, it's not all nonsense, but it is, is

3 (1h 45m 6s):
It's just another off shoot.

2 (1h 45m 7s):
Something to, to get your attention.

3 (1h 45m 9s):
Right. Yeah. Which is what all of this is about. From the Roman coliseums to, it doesn't matter.

2 (1h 45m 20s):
Yeah. The Roman co

3 (1h 45m 21s):
Arthur court time. Like that's

2 (1h 45m 23s):
The first viral videos, right? Like

3 (1h 45m 26s):
That's right. Right. Like

2 (1h 45m 27s):
They would tell viral stories.

3 (1h 45m 29s):
Yeah. This is, this is all about this experience of being a human being and this amount of time Yeah. And interaction between other people who have done this thing you're doing.

2 (1h 45m 45s):
Yeah. And in the middle of you doing it, you realize you only have a certain amount of time and you're like, God damnit, I'm just starting to figure this game out.

3 (1h 45m 54s):
Right. So understand that's, I I was probably like five years old when I had that moment. So I lucked out because it happened to me so early. Mm. but it wasn't about the Yeah, I got that part. So I thought, I thought at like that age, I was thinking, okay, so don don't know how long I'm gonna live. 'cause I'm kind of conflicted about how long people live. A hundred's a good number. But there's been people that 600, it seems I know, like, seems like there's, but I, I'm just gonna space it out seven years at a time.

3 (1h 46m 41s):
So every seven years I'm, that's gonna be a life. So I don't waste anything. So I couldn't wait till I got seven because that was gonna be the start of my first life. Why'd

2 (1h 46m 54s):
You bring it into sevens just randomly?

3 (1h 46m 59s):
I don't, I don't know what randomly means. It's a seldom scene thing in the universe randomly.

2 (1h 47m 12s):
So just seven seemed like a good number. Was it instinctual or was it, was it

3 (1h 47m 16s):
To, to people around the globe?

2 (1h 47m 18s):
Seven. Yeah.

3 (1h 47m 20s):
That's

2 (1h 47m 20s):
A great number. It's a lucky number. That's why I asked. Yeah.

3 (1h 47m 23s):
Well, I'm saying not for no reason. I'm saying if you like math, you know I'm saying it's a great number. That's how you know that the pyramids are about something because of what they represent mathematically. That level of mathematical information is another step in civilization.

2 (1h 47m 51s):
Yeah. The idea that, that was just by accident. Like when they, they, there's

3 (1h 47m 55s):
Trigonometry is not by Yeah.

2 (1h 47m 58s):
Accident also that they figured out like the, they there's some measurement. It's don don't wanna bore anybody with the details 'cause I'll butcher it too. But it's the measurements of the heightened width and the mass of the pyramid in comparison to the, the, the circumference of earth. It's like they, they knew so much about like, where constellations would be at certain times of the year, like in the summer solstice. It's just wild shit, man. That

3 (1h 48m 25s):
They did that

2 (1h 48m 26s):
All in stone.

3 (1h 48m 26s):
But not that wild though. Because we know that if you were traveling, that buoys are out there and they're out there for certain reasons. Right. And we understand satellite positioning and No, no, it makes perfect sense. Mm.

2 (1h 48m 48s):
Imagine that's what the pyramids were, that was their ultimate buoy. That was home base.

3 (1h 48m 54s):
Well, I'm, I'm saying it's not different than what, how we would treat a planet that we had not been to before.

2 (1h 49m 1s):
No, not at all. Not different at all. I mean

3 (1h 49m 4s):
We would, we would locate, where's the best place to land? Where is the most hospitable of this place? And we would put something there. And

2 (1h 49m 15s):
Let's imagine that we landed somewhere and we found this lush, green, vibrant planet and we found those hobbit people. And those are the most advanced people. Those homo Flo. Flo. Is that what it is? Flores, Flo. So this creature, this three foot tall human, imagine if we found them, I guarantee you someone would want to introduce them to tools, introduce 'em to how to make fire, introduce them to figure out language, try to transfer their language to our language. Try to teach them our stuff. Try to genetically engineer them and turn them into something different.

2 (1h 49m 55s):
If we have the tools that we have now, like Crispr and we found some primitive apes and there was like a, a massive population of Australia Pacificus on a planet. Yeah. And we said, look, they're, they're on the way. Right. Let's just give 'em a little loose. Just give 'em a little boost. Right. And that's what the people

3 (1h 50m 10s):
Think. But not too much. Not too much. And that's what you see with all of the UFO stories is, is they keep popping up in these times when we as a civilization are getting ready to f it up. Right. In real time.

2 (1h 50m 27s):
In real time. Yeah. You know, that's like my comedy club. That's why I named

3 (1h 50m 31s):
The mothership

2 (1h 50m 32s):
The rooms. I named the rooms Fat Man and little boy. Oh. 'cause the UFO started coming after the big bombs. That's when they really started like ramping up their s like if you look at all the, the, the reports, the flying sauce reports, they're all like 19 47, 19 50, 19 52.

3 (1h 50m 47s):
If you cross engineer our shit, it's gonna show up on our radar at some point. Like Yeah. This information is,

2 (1h 50m 56s):
Especially when we're using that information very recklessly wild.

3 (1h 51m 0s):
Even in the Bible story, the Tower of Babel. Right. This, this story is that, you know, with everybody speaking the same language, it intensified shit getting done. Yeah. And they could do stuff that was, is

2 (1h 51m 21s):
If they, I think they're very close to being able to translate language instantaneously in real time. 'cause they can do it right now with Samsung phones, the new they have, the new Galaxy S 24

3 (1h 51m 33s):
Animals are doing it worldwide. Oh,

2 (1h 51m 35s):
For sure. They, they have some sort of a language. They have some sort of a communication. They, they, there's something going on with animals that's non-verbal.

3 (1h 51m 43s):
And, and with all of our, and with all of us,

2 (1h 51m 47s):
You know Tom Green, you know Tom Green, right? Yes. Tom Green was here and he had, he has a mule. And he said that you have like a connection with that animal where you know you want to go left and you start like looking left and that thing starts going left. He goes, it's really crazy. It's spooky. He goes, you develop it, it takes time. They have to earn your respect. But once you develop this like, loving relationship with this animal, you're tuned into it like an avatar creature. Just like when they would lock onto their dragons. He's like, dude, it's like that.

3 (1h 52m 18s):
I have that with women and, and, and with ducks and geese and Canadian geese Yeah. And goats. Like I have. Yeah. No, that's, but understand again, that's part of some religion's story is that one of the gifts was the relationship between humans and the animal world. Yeah. And it's something that all civilizations have been able to use and it stayed true. You know?

2 (1h 52m 54s):
Yeah. It it's amazing the relationship humans have with animals.

3 (1h 52m 58s):
Yeah. Especially dogs. Self horse. No, there's no, especially like all, all, all of them have their own beautiful thing. Abuse some of them. and it, well

2 (1h 53m 6s):
Just, horses don't interact with people the same way a dog does. That's all I'm saying. It's like the interaction you have with dogs is almost like psychic. Like they're, they dogs are like your little friends. You know? They know when you're in a bad mood. They, they know when you're hurt your foot. You know, they, they, when they're happy to see you every fucking time. Every fucking time. Bar none.

3 (1h 53m 27s):
I have that relationship with everybody that's Yeah. All, all animals and like special needs people. It is the innocence and the purity that you get. What? It's not always good. This is, but it's so

2 (1h 53m 45s):
Yeah. We can learn from them

3 (1h 53m 47s):
That no, we have learned.

2 (1h 53m 48s):
Yeah. We should know it. But we're scared. People are scared of other people being shitty and we put up like shields and we, you know, we worry about running.

3 (1h 53m 59s):
Well it's been proven the real historically that, you know

2 (1h 54m 6s):
Yeah. It

3 (1h 54m 6s):
Has can't enable is a real story that like, you know what I mean? Like people are like, people are so violent these days. Yeah. And that's true. But people have been violent. Yeah. Like there was this point where humankind learned that they could take a life and it changed things. Yeah. You

2 (1h 54m 28s):
Know? Well especially take a life quickly with like, when they figured out swords and bows and arrows and shit.

3 (1h 54m 35s):
What do you

2 (1h 54m 35s):
Think the story of Sodom and Gomorrah is about? 'cause I was just reading that

3 (1h 54m 41s):
Last cleanliness night.

2 (1h 54m 43s):
Cleanliness. Yeah.

3 (1h 54m 45s):
Yeah.

2 (1h 54m 46s):
That, that's what took them out. That like plague.

3 (1h 54m 51s):
Okay.

2 (1h 54m 52s):
Because

3 (1h 54m 53s):
It's 69 times I've gotten canceled in this one conversation. No,

2 (1h 54m 57s):
The stories of Sodom and Gomorrah, there's two speculations. Right. One of them was that God decided that they weren't hospitable enough and the other one was God had decided that there was too much sin.

3 (1h 55m 12s):
Wait a minute. That's not speculation. That's in the book, right? That first one.

2 (1h 55m 16s):
Right. But the, what's the second one? But the respectability part that they, they were not hospitable enough.

3 (1h 55m 22s):
Yeah. That was a, that was a part of

2 (1h 55m 24s):
It. That's part of it too. So he just, so God had just decided this, I'm gonna fuck up this whole city. No, no,

3 (1h 55m 30s):
No, no,

2 (1h 55m 30s):
No. Right. What's the real story

3 (1h 55m 32s):
Though? Okay. So turned

2 (1h 55m 33s):
It into pillars of Salt two cities. Right. And he said, find me 50 good men and I won't do this. And then he, I think he said, find me 10 good men.

3 (1h 55m 45s):
Okay. So they, this story is generally used to say that God doesn't like homosexuals.

2 (1h 55m 55s):
Oh.

3 (1h 55m 56s):
This is the story that highlights that.

2 (1h 55m 58s):
Okay. So it's not, it's not just sin, it's not just so, because sodomy is even technically like oral sex.

3 (1h 56m 8s):
The meaning of that word comes from Sodom

2 (1h 56m 10s):
Sodomy. Gamora.

3 (1h 56m 11s):
Right. Right.

2 (1h 56m 12s):
So that's why I said it's technically includes a lot of things people think is deviant sex. Yo, I gotta piss so bad. Can we, can we come back to this Sodom Gaura come back to this.

3 (1h 56m 21s):
I would

2 (1h 56m 21s):
Love that. Okay, let's take a look. Take a Sodom and Gamar.

3 (1h 56m 27s):
Yeah. So it tell, it tells several stories, but there had to be an explanation for what the story said happened to two cities of people. Right. Right.

2 (1h 56m 54s):
There had to be a reason to tell that story. Most likely

3 (1h 56m 58s):
To tell this story. It requires all of those people that really have been killed during, in those circumstances. And the historical evidence shows us that something like that happened, like those two cities really did exist.

2 (1h 57m 22s):
Do we know where Sodom and Gamora was?

3 (1h 57m 26s):
Are you kidding? I know a guy who will pull that information up so fast. Really? And put it on a screen young Jamie.

2 (1h 57m 34s):
Like, is there speculation

3 (1h 57m 35s):
As to what part his sidekick is awake Now this is, you gonna see the best Carl part of him when Carl wakes up,

2 (1h 57m 41s):
Carl's awake. Now he's a three 30 waker. Right.

3 (1h 57m 45s):
As we all would be if we were in charge of our schedules.

2 (1h 57m 48s):
Yeah, probably. What do, what do they think that it, like is there real speculation as to where it was? Where, where do they think it was?

3 (1h 57m 56s):
It's not speculation. A lot of these places just changed names. Like Right. They used to be called this. Right. And then they later were called something else. But like,

2 (1h 58m 7s):
Iraq used to be Sumer. Right?

3 (1h 58m 8s):
Like these are literal places that you can find on the real map. That was, that was a part of that biblical rabbit hole I was telling you about is just seeing the f My only concern is how do these ancient Islamic Judea, how do you say that those three that exist, the, that all religion is built on Judeo-Christian, Islamic, that whole belief system of how that this is a speculator operates.

3 (1h 58m 53s):
Right. So you see they have question marks here. Right. Only because they know that there were cities there.

2 (1h 59m 4s):
Oh, so they have wreckage there. Or,

3 (1h 59m 6s):
Or like, like for example, everybody, if everybody in Gaza talks about going there, it exists. If everybody in Hebrew has family members that live there, it exists. If everybody, we, we know that.

2 (1h 59m 26s):
So they think that was right near the Dead Sea. Wow.

3 (1h 59m 31s):
Well they didn't think it any differently than they thought T Hamam, if I'm pronouncing that correct. Like these were places like Yeah. People throughout history, if you show anybody of water, those are always hot spots. Yeah. Water is its own commodity and currency at all points. And that was the Dead Sea. But that's everywhere.

2 (2h 0m 6s):
Was the Dead Sea always the Dead Sea?

9 (2h 0m 8s):
I think so

2 (2h 0m 10s):
Because God damn there's so much interesting stuff that came from that part of the world. Right. That's where they found the Dead

3 (2h 0m 15s):
Sea. But a lot of the stuff that was supposed to be unbelievable was all based on something real like Right. How long was it the Dead Sea? Long before they knew what high salt content was. Right. Or they might've called it high content salt competency. But what they were trying to say is the lowest point on the planet stuff, not stuff not growing here. Okay. Don't be looking, don't come here as a fishing spot. Right.

2 (2h 0m 48s):
But it's a good spot to gather salt, which at that point in time was as valuable as anything on earth. Salt did go to war for salt. Salt allowed people to preserve their food. Salt was insanely valuable.

3 (2h 1m 2s):
I understand the whole portions of, because at the end of the day, for all people, it comes down to quality of life. So the jump that was made between people eating food that you had to kill yourself catching just so that you could put it over something hot so that you could get it where you could eat it and eating it. Like you, that experience to seasoning your food and you know, having Yeah. Order from the best place because they do eating

2 (2h 1m 43s):
Too much spaghetti so you get fat.

3 (2h 1m 45s):
Right. That's part of the greatness of human experience and has been, yeah. That the part of being a king or being royalty through all civilizations was being able to experience the best culinary things. Because if you believe in God, that's one of the attributes that makes you believe in him. Because every vegetable, let's say that you would have, when it gets to the point where it would spoil and it would be useless and you'd have to throw it away, it becomes worth more money

10 (2h 2m 29s):
Because

2 (2h 2m 30s):
It's compost.

3 (2h 2m 31s):
No. So what do you mean? Like, if you have potatoes, right? And so you have potatoes, but now you got too many potatoes, you could get vodka from that. And if you have too much rice, you could get sake from that. And if you got too much wheat and barley you can get, and if you and everything that you could have too much of, we got too many grapes you could get wine with that. The whole, that's why alcohol is called spirits. 'cause it's literally a gift from God.

3 (2h 3m 12s):
Just something that's just for your milk. Once it's going bad, that's where cheese comes in. Like whatever it is you would be having as a commodity. Grapes, the raisins, wherever. Like this is why we believe mathematically because of the certain things that are just done for the enjoyment of, yeah.

2 (2h 3m 47s):
So you think there's a reason why all these things exist? Why? Like, rotting fruit can become alcohol. Alcohol can put you in a different state of mind. All of it is connected together so that you discover it and figure it out.

3 (2h 3m 60s):
Unless you can figure out the benefit that a mushroom gets for being hallucinogenic or the frog. That's the special ones. Do what special benefit did that frog get from that? Right.

2 (2h 4m 15s):
Why is a frog making DMT?

3 (2h 4m 18s):
Is he living a better life as a frog? Does he live under the effects residually of

2 (2h 4m 25s):
Constantly carrying around DMT?

10 (2h 4m 28s):
Right. Right. Right.

2 (2h 4m 32s):
Well they secrete it when they're scared. Right? Isn't that the whole idea that you, you take them and you Yeah. You rub 'em on a windshield

3 (2h 4m 38s):
Dry out. It's weaponized from the beginning.

2 (2h 4m 40s):
Yeah.

3 (2h 4m 41s):
Right, right.

2 (2h 4m 42s):
They, they're scared 'cause they think they're gonna die. So their body's producing it.

3 (2h 4m 45s):
Well, the,

2 (2h 4m 46s):
Just like ours,

3 (2h 4m 47s):
The inventor of perfumes and colognes was whoever saw a skunk in action first because you know it, that's when someone was able to see how powerful smell is, even from a distance. And that the aerosol, like, you know what I mean? Like we, we've learned so much from that world. That's how we know. Like we were able to look at animals and insects and understand that we would be able to do the helicopter after we got past Orville and Wilbur in Dayton, Ohio.

3 (2h 5m 35s):
You know what I mean? Like we understood 'cause we had seen the hummingbird. Right. You know what I mean? Like we had seen how things worked.

2 (2h 5m 43s):
Have you ever seen those Egyptian gliders? They found these gliders, these wooden things that they carved that looked like fucking planes. And they were in some of the tombs that they had found Thousands of years old. Looks like a fucking airplane. I mean straight up looks exactly like

3 (2h 6m 3s):
An airplane. Devin is saying that these are things talked about there, like even forever, even if you're just following Jesus. Right. Okay. So you believe that he was perfect and that this was how he grew up and got it when it comes to him going to get information, he went to this specific place that we're talking about to get information and to get talked. And that's not a hidden fact. Like it's been that way. So you, you can't be reading all of these stories and not see how everything lines up.

2 (2h 6m 58s):
It does kinda line up in a strange way. You try to decipher it from all the different cultures. They all had their different versions of it, but at the end of it, there's a lot of similarities if you follow the stories and like what, what they, what are they saying? Right? All of them have some sort of a creation myth.

3 (2h 7m 15s):
Well, I'm

2 (2h 7m 17s):
But isn't that odd though that a creature, if you think of human beings as a creature, that a, a human being that's never created a being itself has this idea that a magical force that is all knowing and all loving created. Not, not they evolved, not they came from this and they learned they got better, but that they were created. And that seems like a universal story. The created story.

3 (2h 7m 48s):
That's only because the duck that's outside of my house right now believes that. So what, so the duck is sitting on six eggs on a nest right by the house, right By a 250 pound dog, a alibi. And believes that it has life that it's sitting on and it's gonna come from that. And that there's somebody there that looks out for them and makes sure they're fed. and it, the, in the bible story, it says, the sparrow said, like, like Jesus said, who, who feeds the sparrows?

3 (2h 8m 34s):
Like, like worldwide. There's how many birds? Like billions and billions and billions of birds. Like who's feeding them every day? Like real talk, right? Yeah. Because what you're looking for is you need to find a mistake. That's how we would know. Maybe there's no creator, but we don't go through our regular life seeing things and thinking. Nobody created it. Like I would be as weird as us being in this room going, nobody made those curtains. Nobody made these cameras. Right. Nobody. Like what? We we never have evidence of that. What

2 (2h 9m 11s):
Do you think, why do you think people have a reluctance to take in the idea of a creator? What do you think about it to them is there's some people that fancy themselves as intellectuals and they refuse to take in a concept for which there's no proof. And that's what they'll say. They use this very reductionist view of what God is and they'll say there's no proof. And that, you know, they're a staunch athe atheist. And a lot of them, they even talk like religious people. They, they almost, their atheism becomes a religion. Well, instead of being completely open-minded to the possibility, you have zero idea what happens when you die.

3 (2h 9m 46s):
A lot of people that are atheists don't like God and God will have to exist for them to not like. So the whole, the whole thing is if you were to believe in the Big Bang, you would have to believe that that had happened several times throughout history. Just because that's what we've seen from everything that's been created.

2 (2h 10m 20s):
We don't see one individual unique thing that exists. and it is responsible for all things except the Big Bang. That was the Terrence McKenna always said,

3 (2h 10m 29s):
There's too much thought that went into certain things. Like the fact that you can study all the butterflies and not one of them has a sense of humor. You know what I mean, but me and you do. And like it goes for all humans. If universally, if we see somebody trip and fall Yeah. We all laugh no matter what our back, like there are certain Yeah. Like, like there's that, I, I'm trying to think of what the reasons are to not believe, but I can't remember what they are because it, it doesn't, it doesn't line up with anything.

3 (2h 11m 13s):
Like, and, and we would've had to have gone in space and there'd be no other planets. Just this one.

2 (2h 11m 23s):
Just that's it

3 (2h 11m 24s):
For this story too. Make sense universally. Like we, we are at a terrible time in history to say, oh, we don't believe in people from outer space when we can go to outer space. Like it's, it's almost asinine to try to make both of those make sense. And to think that there's our son is not the biggest sun. Right. Not even close, but it's the biggest sun we ever gonna see. Yeah. Right. So it's the biggest fucking sun. Right. But the truth is no, it's way bigger. Like, Right. Like that a thought went into picking this particular sun for this planet and the Moon and the positioning of much as if you were building a house, like you would put particulars in like kid rock.

3 (2h 12m 17s):
Yeah. Like kid rock to make sure that throughout the time period of history you put a stamp and a mark on it. Right. Right. Yeah. That's why if you were extraterrestrial, let's say, and you were gonna build one building on this planet, it would be the pyramid hundred. Like most people don't even understand that there was a whole outer covering on that thing. And gold cap the top Mm, top cap

2 (2h 12m 45s):
Limestone. Yeah.

3 (2h 12m 46s):
It it was a planetary monument.

2 (2h 12m 52s):
Yeah. Right. You might be right. It makes more sense than the idea that these people push those things into place and it got 'em hundreds of miles outta the mountain with ropes. Shut the fuck up.

3 (2h 13m 3s):
Throughout history, we have not done things that did not profit us. And I'm, and not 150 years from now. Right now, right

2 (2h 13m 14s):
Now. Always

3 (2h 13m 16s):
All through history. Right. So to be thinking that this particular civil as, oh you know what we all care about when he going to die let's we all I dedicate my life to when he going die, I'm gonna die while I

2 (2h 13m 33s):
Yeah.

3 (2h 13m 34s):
No, history doesn't say that in any way.

2 (2h 13m 36s):
It's also the sheer mass, 3 million, 200,000 stones in the great pyramid. That is so much mass.

3 (2h 13m 47s):
All of the wonders of the world are truly that.

2 (2h 13m 57s):
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. There's a bunch of 'em too, man. The wild shit that they're digging out of Turkey is nuts too. That's the go Beckley tepi place where they found 12,000 year old structures back at the time when they thought people were just using sticks and stones and hunter gatherers.

3 (2h 14m 18s):
No, no, no. They had stone because the whole time they were saying that it was there. Yep. But understand these are the things worthy of a war, just so you know,

2 (2h 14m 32s):
Worthy of a war.

3 (2h 14m 33s):
Yeah. You see what I'm saying? All throughout history, like you know what I mean. Yeah. That's the only thing a rational person can take from Hitler's story is being able to see what if you had unlimited resource and ability to just follow global rabbit holes. You find out that most stuff that is labeled BS is not Bs. BS is very hard to come

5 (2h 15m 11s):
By.

2 (2h 15m 12s):
Well the Hitler thing is real weird. 'cause the Nazis are really into the occult

3 (2h 15m 17s):
At some point in the information process that was required. So

2 (2h 15m 28s):
It was required to be into the occult.

3 (2h 15m 38s):
So, so in like the world of medicine, like certain things before they had a label of being toxic, you just knew don't touch it. Like, you know what I mean? You didn't know what it was good for, but those occultists were the keepers of things that did work. Not things that did not work. Right. So, but throughout history, that whole process of thinking, anything that could fall into the al alchemy conversation was seen as oc cult based.

3 (2h 16m 25s):
It, it meant doing something unnatural. Hmm. So even like the blacksmith was considered a part of that world through most of history

2 (2h 16m 38s):
Really.

3 (2h 16m 39s):
Because he had an unnatural relationship with elements. He was able to take this and turn it into things.

2 (2h 16m 49s):
Forged steel. Yeah. Oh, that makes sense. Yeah. I always wondered like at the heart of

3 (2h 16m 57s):
Alchemy, all processes that are discussed at these pyramids and all, because they're all processes.

2 (2h 17m 7s):
Yeah. I've always wondered if Alchemy is trying to regain lost knowledge. Like if at one point in time they did know how to just make metals, they did know how to create elements. They did know how to change lead into gold or whatever the fuck they wanted to do. That's

3 (2h 17m 22s):
What the, this whole line was consisted of. Yeah. but it required money and time and all royalty, all kings, all great leaders of the world. This is what you paid for, was people that could make things happen. So being able to understand the weather and to then be able to manipulate it in any way possible was valuable. All through human history.

3 (2h 18m 3s):
All the way before we get to the seeding of clouds part, do

2 (2h 18m 7s):
You think they, they had the ability to manipulate weather back then. It'd be wild if they did, if that's what caused the Sahara desert to emerge. Because all that shit used to be lush, tropical rainforest. Imagine if that's humans fucking with cloud seeding, they just ruin it.

3 (2h 18m 34s):
Well, that wouldn't explain how that has its own environment. That's just as valuable. You know what I mean? It, it goes to further back up what I was telling you about how it seems like somebody put thought into every scenario you might be in. So let's say you lived in one of them deserts and all you had was cactus. Guess what? You could take that cactus and make tequila too

2 (2h 19m 4s):
True.

3 (2h 19m 6s):
Like every part of the process. Like

2 (2h 19m 9s):
People figure something out.

3 (2h 19m 11s):
Not the people figure something out. Something is there to be figured out. Right,

2 (2h 19m 17s):
Right,

3 (2h 19m 18s):
Right.

2 (2h 19m 19s):
Well, that's what the indigenous people say about ayahuasca. They said that the plants told them how to make it. The mushrooms told them how to make, make it

3 (2h 19m 29s):
As a person that loves nature, you know that most of your experience in nature is based upon how other things react. You know what I mean? Yeah. So you don't know that this is poisonous except for the fact that it doesn't look like anything's eating whatever's on here and looks like everything is avoiding it. Like these are, these are real things and that requires creation as well. The whole consequence thing. And the fact that this animal is able to live with this thing that's going to be doing damage to you.

2 (2h 20m 17s):
So let me ask you this, 'cause this is the end conclusion of that. If, if creation is real and if God is real, and if God created us.

3 (2h 20m 24s):
Wait a minute, hold on. Let's be specific creation of, of what I just told you about my ducks and her eggs. That creation is real. For sure. For sure.

2 (2h 20m 32s):
Yeah. I'm,

3 (2h 20m 33s):
I'm not And life is gonna come from that. Yeah.

2 (2h 20m 35s):
Right. What I mean is that, that God created everything and that there's, that there really is a, a reason for all of it. What is the reason for us? Like if God, okay. Really did make all these things right. Synchronized together. Right. And put us here. Right.

3 (2h 21m 2s):
First of all, I'm grateful. Even if you're not, I'm very grateful. Like, like I'm very grateful. What an experience.

2 (2h 21m 9s):
Amazing time. Right?

3 (2h 21m 11s):
And if you take time and space outta things, right? Like the people that sold me Call of Duty right. Gave me a great experience that I've been enjoying for years and years and years. And the person that I am on that platform is the person that I would like to be all an experience has been delivered. It would be like saying, what was the thinking on somebody making an amusement park To amuse people so that they could have a full experience and, and be able to enjoy it.

3 (2h 22m 12s):
You, you know that because things happen, like the humor thing that I was telling you about and health, how important good health is over the opposite of that and how everything works without you needing to micromanage it. Your heart doesn't require you to count its beats and your, what's the percentage of brains that are working perfectly versus the ones that are not like all of the processes needed to run, you are just too well done to be thrown away.

3 (2h 22m 57s):
Like, not important. Because if you learn about it, you'll learn about the whole workings of the universe. And it's like that in too many different places for us to ignore. And the fact that we get a chance to have that experience while at the same time looking at a dog, right. And understanding that our life is 1 billion times greater than Fidos. And we can make sure Fido has a glorious life and ours is still so magnificent that we are in control of certain things and that we can not get things right and then get it right and not know things and then know things.

3 (2h 23m 48s):
And then, you know, it's, it's a wonderful experience that was created.

2 (2h 23m 55s):
It is a wonderful experience and we seem to have by far the most unique one on the planet. We seem very different than everything else. Very different than everything else purposely, even though we're a part of it. Yeah. Purposely. That's why I always wonder

3 (2h 24m 10s):
Super

2 (2h 24m 11s):
Efficient. What are we here for? What is, what is the purpose? Is it just to enjoy and be grateful? Which is great. Like, one of the things that terrifies people, it's a very interesting concept that terrifies people. People are terrified of living the same life over and over and over again. If you tell people that the the journey of your soul Yeah. Is that you will live your life over and over again until you get it right. And one day you'll get it right. One in one lifetime you'll achieve enlightenment, but you're gonna go through the same lifetime over and over and over again until you get it right. People are terrified of that. But I say why. Right.

3 (2h 24m 47s):
That would require a creator though.

2 (2h 24m 49s):
Sure it would. But what I'm saying is why would you be terrified of that when you're not terrified to exist right now? Why? Why are you terrified of existing right now? Forever. I don't find that terrifying. If you enjoy now, if you enjoy now, now's great.

3 (2h 25m 6s):
Whenever you die, it is forever. You know what I mean? So I so I know and I have known in my life that I'm going to live forever. I know I'll die, but I know I'm going to live forever until then and then live beyond that.

2 (2h 25m 25s):
Yeah.

3 (2h 25m 26s):
Right.

2 (2h 25m 28s):
Well that certainly is a better approach to life in that it gives you comfort and that's what

3 (2h 25m 34s):
No, that's what history shows us. History has shown us that

2 (2h 25m 38s):
In what way?

3 (2h 25m 39s):
That human beings are still here. Not because of our wise decision making. Like nobody's story says that we've gotten assistance along the way that we needed it and we have implemented it globally. This is why those one world people exist because it's a very powerful concept to have and far too lucrative and beneficial to not be attempted.

2 (2h 26m 21s):
Yeah. I mean if I was gonna run some global power organization, I would try to co-opt every single leader, try to suck 'em in, offer support, bring 'em out to wherever the fuck I have my big ass meetings, fly everybody in, in private jets. Talk about the climate crisis.

3 (2h 26m 38s):
All organizations have to follow the same rules. Yeah.

2 (2h 26m 42s):
That's wild.

3 (2h 26m 44s):
Recruitment is an important facet of all. Like

2 (2h 26m 48s):
We have to get some young global leaders.

3 (2h 26m 51s):
Well understand. This is the only reason that we can talk about these big illuminati like entities at this period of time. It's just because of time. Like they aged out. Like you can't Right. Get in new. So everybody got decrepit over there and they can't exchange really through this period of history. And so that's how we ended up with the Bob Lazars and everything throughout history. You could really, it was much easier to get people to not tell nobody.

3 (2h 27m 33s):
Right. As part of your job. You know what I mean?

2 (2h 27m 38s):
Imagine going to a world economic forum party. What did those freaks do when all the listening devices have been scanned out of the room? All their phones have been put into bags and locked away in a lead vault. What do those freaks do? 'cause you know it's not normal shit. You know, everybody's buttoned down like that and wants to control the world. There's something involved that's outlandish that they keep a secret. That's always been the case with secret societies. I mean that's the whole eyes wide shut thing. That there's some freak shit going on behind the scenes to anybody that really wants to control everything. You don't just want to control everything.

2 (2h 28m 18s):
What you wanna control everything. So he can get away with some freak shit too.

3 (2h 28m 23s):
Right. I'm saying but these Epstein like characters have existed throughout history. Throughout history. Whether they were kings or what like like human beings or human beings universally. So ev everybody is a supplier. Epstein Weinstein, like these guys knew what these extremists liked and provided it and provided the way for you to like, like to have a billion dollars and not create a fantasy island type environment has not existed throughout history.

3 (2h 29m 17s):
Right.

5 (2h 29m 19s):
Right,

3 (2h 29m 20s):
Right.

2 (2h 29m 20s):
And there's always been, those people can only kind of interact with those kind of people. When you reach that certain level of wealth and, and global success. Like you're a Bill Gates type guy, how many guys can bill Gates hang out with Bill gate? Bill Gates can't just go bowl and join the bowling team and make friends with the other bowlers. It's too weird. He's gotta hang out with his his kind. And the more you do that, the less you are in touch with what makes sense to say. And that's when you see them saying the most outlandish shit. 'cause they don't recognize how regular people are gonna react to what the fuck you're saying. You know what? Yeah, we're gonna own nothing and be happy.

2 (2h 30m 2s):
What the fuck did you just say? Did you just say I'm gonna own nothing and be happy? So, but there's things, so who owns the things and who, who enforces? Who owns the things and how do you do that when you take, take away everybody's weapons, you're the only one that has weapons and you get to decide who owns the things and no one owns the things and everyone's happy. Okay.

3 (2h 30m 23s):
Right. But part of what you're trying to do is you're trying to come up with something that allows you to have the power while also profiting simultaneously. Right. Right. So if it is modern religion, let's say, so in the teaching of Jesus time, right when they said pay the tithes, right, it was you had your whole farming plot. Let's say it was 40 acres and you had corn planted there. Right. You would just, you, when it came time to harvest, you would harvest everything except the rows that were on the fence. Right.

3 (2h 31m 3s):
And the rows that were on the fence, that was the 10% of your field that would go to people that didn't have it. So it wasn't just you giving the 10%, it was also the fact that human nature is, if you were going to give people some of your crops, you going to pick out the best crops for you and your family and then you'll put another pile for the giveaway. Right. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. And this took care of that where it was all equal and the person that didn't have didn't have to feel like they was a beggar. They could come and pick and see which corn they liked and get, you see what I'm saying?

2 (2h 31m 47s):
Well that's a smart move just for harmony in the community too. Then the people have a vested interest in this farmer of being successful with his crop. Right. Some of that crop is yours.

3 (2h 31m 55s):
But the decision to take it from that to God said, give me 10% in this plate is going to make a billion dollars a day for a billion people.

2 (2h 32m 14s):
Yeah.

3 (2h 32m 15s):
This is why Tesla has to go. Why? Because not what Tesla is saying about electricity. It's the fact that he's saying this should be free for everybody. Right. Everywhere.

2 (2h 32m 26s):
Yeah. He wanted to have aerial electricity free for everybody like radio waves.

3 (2h 32m 32s):
And the day that you say that,

2 (2h 32m 34s):
That's a

3 (2h 32m 34s):
Wrap, it's cheaper to keep her because we make 200 billion a day. Yeah. And we all agree universally, you should pay for this and we'll be in charge of selling it to you. Yeah.

2 (2h 32m 46s):
And we'll shut it off if you fuck around.

3 (2h 32m 49s):
So for for us to say, I think they're gonna do that with cars.

2 (2h 32m 54s):
Duh.

3 (2h 32m 55s):
This is how this goes in these a hundred percent processes.

2 (2h 32m 58s):
Yeah. That's the conspiracy theorist's biggest fear about electric cars. But it's not just electric cars. We found out it's an OnStar. It's on, you know, I have a Cadillac Escalade that that has an OnStar, the gov, if I'm driving the government wants to stop me, they could just shut my car off. It's crazy.

3 (2h 33m 16s):
And if you were in that business, what would you tell 'em? They need to do it in the next five years. Yeah. I mean 'em all like that. Get better at it. Yeah.

2 (2h 33m 23s):
Get better at that control where they go control the steering, wheel control everything. I want you to auto driving on all cars, auto driving on all cars with third party input.

3 (2h 33m 32s):
Is this, is this not what we would say to Tesla? Yeah. I mean to Elon If he said, I wanna make cars, right? When we say, okay, well these are the regulations and you have to make 'em like this and you,

2 (2h 33m 44s):
It'd be nice if you could just control that car here. This is how you sell it to people. If someone steals your car, we can get it back. And you go, oh, that's great. If someone steals my car, they can get it back. How are they gonna get it back? Well they control your car.

3 (2h 33m 57s):
You can make, you can make it, you can make it cheap enough to not be a difficult sale though, Joe. Yeah. Make it

2 (2h 34m 3s):
Cheap

3 (2h 34m 3s):
That that's what capitalism is about.

2 (2h 34m 6s):
Yeah. Well that's also like when you get free internet or free services through Google, right? It's free. But what you're giving up is your data, which is extremely valuable. So they're giving you something you, you can now use Google, but now they have all your data and you're just a big net that minds data. And because of that, they become one of the most powerful entities that's ever existed on earth. You know, there was a story that I

3 (2h 34m 36s):
Was trying find, we learned this from fishermen. Yeah. How a network works and how much it's important to get as much in as you possibly can and that that's where analytics live. Yes. And that's where I'm saying this is where the DNA industry is built off of is, is the fact of the future. Like, it it at that same point that you're saying that we'll have those cars that do that they'll be able to pre predict crime. Oh yeah. And step in before certain things even need to happen.

2 (2h 35m 10s):
Or they'll probably instigate you to a certain level of stress that they could indicate that you're about to commit crime. And then they come in and get you.

3 (2h 35m 19s):
They, they won't need to, they won't need to be that nefarious only because cer some of this, some of this stuff we know already, it just requires profiling that we are not comfortable with. Mm. Like worldwide, most terrible crimes are committed by, oh, this is 73rd time I get gas. Most crime worldwide is, is done by men with a micro penis. And Doctors know who they are.

3 (2h 36m 4s):
And so at some point they would be able to just focus where they need to focus and they would know certain things. And that's where, you know, this is why AI exists. You know, if, if you're, you're, you're a, your personal ai, you, you store your information, you make moves based upon what you've learned. So it's not a difficult process. All through history, they had these oracles and these heads that gave answers. Right. And this is where that whole occult conversation intersects is because at the end of the day, information is information and the universe is built on a yin yang thing that is replies to everybody.

3 (2h 36m 60s):
And

2 (2h 36m 60s):
We're slowly getting connected to that oracle slowly getting sucked into that black hole to the point where it will be inescapable.

3 (2h 37m 9s):
Right? Yeah.

2 (2h 37m 10s):
And those old billionaire dudes would love to be in control of all that.

3 (2h 37m 15s):
Look. What else are you to do with that type of money? Joseph?

2 (2h 37m 21s):
Buy a bigger yacht. Yeah. That's the problem. Right? It's like, what's the next game? You know, what's the real game

3 (2h 37m 28s):
As human beings? That's what our expectations are. Yeah. Of

2 (2h 37m 36s):
Always.

3 (2h 37m 37s):
Yeah. What can you do? And at the end of the day, no matter how much money you amass, it's only about either how you can help others. And if you do that, you're never gonna be fulfilled either. 'cause you're never gonna help enough people. And that's gonna be your whole thing is not being able to help enough people and just wishing that you could help more. Right. Or feeling like everybody is a commodity and that's the way this thing work. And find out who I'm going to take advantage of and do so. And that's a major part of a lot of things.

3 (2h 38m 18s):
Like

2 (2h 38m 19s):
Another major pattern that human beings fall into time and time again.

3 (2h 38m 24s):
Well, you know, the Jewish people are powerful people on this planet and a lot of that has to do with the process that they have in instilling in their young people a certain amount of information and wherewithal and conversation that does not happen with other cultures,

2 (2h 38m 49s):
Let's say.

3 (2h 38m 51s):
And that exists only in a few places around the world. But they're always important, especially if you look at things from a non-religious point of view.

2 (2h 39m 10s):
Again, it goes back to information at all points. Yeah. I mean all cultures exchanging informations with each other and the healthiest cultures are the ones that can Right. Both give the most freedom and allow people to innovate.

3 (2h 39m 26s):
Right. Helping ourselves and others. Yeah. And and the profit and the benefit and the, yeah,

2 (2h 39m 34s):
Yeah,

3 (2h 39m 35s):
Yeah. That's part of the process. Right. But that's no different than what everybody's religious story says. Like,

2 (2h 39m 45s):
What do you think ghosts are? You think that's real?

3 (2h 39m 52s):
I interestingly, I don't, I don't believe in Well,

5 (2h 40m 7s):
Okay,

3 (2h 40m 16s):
You, you either believe in the natural and the supernatural or you don't. And there are facets to everything. So if you don't believe in anything supernatural, then I would assume that means you don't believe in God either. It's like I was telling you earlier, I like, I don't, I don't don don't know how you could be a Christian and not believe in extraterrestrials. It's in your book it says there was a war in heaven and God was fighting Satan and threw him down here. That's, this is taking place. So

2 (2h 40m 58s):
Also when you get to the Old Testament Ezekiel's story, Ezekiel's story is essentially about a UFO encounter.

3 (2h 41m 7s):
I was really, I was really frustrated as a black person that we weren't included more in the Bible. Right. And so I was very, I felt very good when I found that some of the books of the Bible that were banned were banned because they had black guys in them.

2 (2h 41m 37s):
Really? What books of the Bible, this is the New Testament, is this, when they were, you've

3 (2h 41m 45s):
Heard the book Constantine, you've heard about the book of Enoch, right?

2 (2h 41m 48s):
Yes.

5 (2h 41m 49s):
Right.

3 (2h 41m 55s):
So if you know that book, it says that Noah was an albino.

5 (2h 42m 2s):
I

2 (2h 42m 5s):
I was wondered about like Noah's age. They talked about him being hundreds of years old. People

3 (2h 42m 10s):
Thought that ridiculous. and it tells everybody's story and

2 (2h 42m 12s):
Yeah, but here's my thought. If human beings become more, we're at one point in time more technologically advanced than we are now, which is possible. We are on the verge of taking human life and expanding it way beyond a hundred years. We're like real close to that. The people that are alive today will live to be 150.

3 (2h 42m 32s):
I'm not qualified to be having any of this conversation.

2 (2h 42m 35s):
I'm barely qualified this because I've talked to a lot of qualified people.

3 (2h 42m 37s):
Disclaimer. But, but understand we know more now. Like Yeah. Like we know that the earth is not spinning now the same way that it once was. We know that.

2 (2h 42m 51s):
But yet slightly different. Measurably different. Right.

3 (2h 42m 57s):
Know what I'm saying? The interesting thing is in all of those stories that we're talking about, it never says that they did anything different that got them to be in that position. It just says that they were blessed by God. So

2 (2h 43m 23s):
Now yeah. They were there.

3 (2h 43m 24s):
This is at a time when people were dying of some things that today we would call pretty easy. Yeah. You know, but it was wiping out whole groups of people. But yeah, it's interesting.

2 (2h 43m 45s):
Well it's fascinating because there's no way to go back there and see what the fuck was going on. Well, so no matter what you're not

3 (2h 43m 53s):
Yet. Well let's be fair though. They're not telling some wild story. Like if they say that a guy had that, that this guy lived 600 years, they're also telling you about the 346 children that he had and his 1500 wives. Right? Like he like Right. Like, hold on. These are numbers to back up.

2 (2h 44m 26s):
Right. If human beings do live to be 500 years old, that's a real possibility. That's,

3 (2h 44m 33s):
That would be the only way that you could show that.

2 (2h 44m 36s):
Yeah.

3 (2h 44m 37s):
Is by

2 (2h 44m 38s):
Talking about all the wives and all the children. All the, and if you do take what we know now in terms of like what they're capable of doing now with, with human beings and lengthening telomeres, there's a lot of different methodologies that they're using that they believe will extend human life use of metformin, NMN, hyperbaric chambers, there's a bunch of different things they're doing. And then there's crispr when they're doing genetic engineering on kids now and in China they've, they did a genetic engineering that would make the children more likely to be brilliant, more likely to be super intelligent.

3 (2h 45m 15s):
Sir. Sir, why are you acting surprised by key components of the breeding process?

2 (2h 45m 23s):
Right. True. Right. and it

3 (2h 45m 26s):
Extend, right? If if we're, if we're talking, if we're talking about, if we're talking about friesians or if we're talking about German shepherds or doberman pictures, this is perfectly fine. Right? Right. For me to say Right. That thanks to these reasons, this dog is the sheer example of the confirmation of the breed and that his attributes are his intelligence and his loyalty and his

2 (2h 45m 57s):
Right.

3 (2h 45m 58s):
Right. This is all part

2 (2h 45m 59s):
Of these. You could do that shit in a test tube for your kid. Why wouldn't you do it? That's what they're, I think they're gonna start off with normal stuff and

3 (2h 46m 9s):
It all starts off as normal stuff. The whole, because it's abnormal. So the first thing you're doing is, oh, okay. So we are in charge of like, how could you not, how

2 (2h 46m 20s):
Could you not

3 (2h 46m 21s):
Is more, is more the question to be had. And that's why in that profession they're allowed to do certain things and then tell you they're not gonna do it no more. Yes. That's a key component to

2 (2h 46m 35s):
It. Yeah. We're not gonna do that anymore. Katt we changed our mind. Yeah. If they're telling you that there's no clones, the guy telling you is probably a fucking clone at this point. I have no doubt that they've made human clones. They've made human, they mean they, they've made dog clones. You can get your dog cloned if your dog's gonna die. You can get the DNA from your dog, get a fucking puppy and it'll be eerily similar to your dog. They think including some personality traits, which is just very Bazar, very pet cemetery. Right. But if they could do that, why can't they do that to people? They can. Well

3 (2h 47m 11s):
Here's the thing, here's the thing. Before this goes off the rails, it's too late because there is a God the bar has been set so insanely high for your clone that you can't really get much usage out of it.

2 (2h 47m 34s):
So well if there is a God and you have a clone, the clone doesn't have a soul. 'cause You don't have a soul to give that clone that's or

3 (2h 47m 40s):
A personality or certain things like a subconscious, right? Like that's not available on the market. Lungs are heart is, arms are right. But subconscious, you still don't, we still don't have the understanding of that or how, how we're able to be as brilliant as we are in this world while only using a portion of the we we tho there are those of us that know what the pineal gland, what what medicine says it's four and what that would mean.

3 (2h 48m 23s):
And so those people's job is to make sure that there's fluoride in all the water. So your pineal gland will shrivel

2 (2h 48m 33s):
It calcified whatever happens

3 (2h 48m 34s):
To it's, that's all

2 (2h 48m 36s):
The fluoride thing is wild. The fact that people aren't up in arms about them putting fluoride in your fucking drinking water is so crazy. It's so unnecessary.

3 (2h 48m 47s):
It it's brilliant on the other end though. Oh yeah. So what what happened is the reason people have that relationship is they cleaned up the water the same time that they did that. You see what I'm saying? Yeah. So people at that time just remember the water not being that great and then all of a sudden the water is really great and it's got fluoride and it's good for your

2 (2h 49m 12s):
Good, for your teeth.

3 (2h 49m 13s):
Right.

2 (2h 49m 14s):
Despite the fact that there's direct correlations between high levels of fluoride and drinking water and low IQs, they think it lowers people's IQs. They think it's terrible for you. Fluoride's dangerous. You're not supposed to swallow toothpaste. Look,

3 (2h 49m 30s):
Whatever you're saying, people won't find out about that for a hundred years and I'm not even gonna be a hundred

2 (2h 49m 39s):
People.

3 (2h 49m 40s):
And most of these decisions are made like that. Yeah.

2 (2h 49m 43s):
Well that most people are terribly unaware of the fluoride thing and when you bring up, they always say it's good for your teeth. Like isn't don't you brush your fucking teeth? Like why do you need fluoride? Why do you need fluoride in your water? Are you sure that's what's why your teeth aren't falling out. It's

3 (2h 49m 58s):
The fact that people don't understand that it's a toxic thing. Yeah. That you can't buy or purchase or handle

2 (2h 50m 7s):
It in your drinking water. Like, and it's not doing you any good other than supposedly it's good for your teeth.

3 (2h 50m 14s):
Well even if it was, yeah.

2 (2h 50m 16s):
Even if it was, it

3 (2h 50m 17s):
Cost, even if it was great for your teeth and your bones you drinking it wouldn't be the way you'd be trying to get that. No, but, but

2 (2h 50m 28s):
Don don't even use fluoride toothpaste.

3 (2h 50m 31s):
I'm not gonna let you take me where this conversation is going. Where's it going now that we went to fluoride? Like I'm gonna, where's it going? I'm gonna have to cut no further than that because once you start having the, what they'll do like Yeah, yeah. You understand everything's a campaign and that's how you can approach e everything is find out

2 (2h 50m 54s):
Where, who's making money off this?

3 (2h 50m 55s):
Where's the profit? How does this make sense why? Yeah.

2 (2h 50m 59s):
Somewhere right now the fluoride plants are going, what the fuck are they talking about? Did somebody just introduce legislation to try to remove fluoride from some state, from drinking water people? Some people are waking up to it, they're realizing like this is so unnecessary and obviously not good.

3 (2h 51m 16s):
Well just understand that there are far too many places that don't have clean waters. So you know. True. Like

2 (2h 51m 28s):
Flint, Michigan. Still, still, still that water's fucked up. There's what about that place in Ohio? Where that

3 (2h 51m 38s):
Hold on, hold on, hold on. And why? Because it is, nobody wants it to be their fault. So nobody will take like Right. You understand how

2 (2h 51m 54s):
Well even the government

3 (2h 51m 57s):
Not even,

2 (2h 51m 57s):
There's plenty of money for

3 (2h 51m 58s):
Ukraine. Not, not even, yeah. Like how exactly, like how are we allowed to have a foreign policy when we are violating the policies here?

2 (2h 52m 12s):
Right.

3 (2h 52m 13s):
You see what I'm saying? Like, like what, what, what do you mean the immigrants are getting a check and we're putting them up in places that ha what you mean in the homeless people's face?

2 (2h 52m 30s):
Right. In the homeless people's faces.

3 (2h 52m 33s):
Like

2 (2h 52m 34s):
Right.

3 (2h 52m 35s):
Let us show you what we could have

2 (2h 52m 37s):
Done. Right.

3 (2h 52m 39s):
Wow.

2 (2h 52m 40s):
Crazy.

3 (2h 52m 41s):
That's not okay as a society.

2 (2h 52m 44s):
No. Well did you see the, the scam that they were trying to do in New York City where they were trying to give them debit cards with $10,000 but there's people getting cuts all along the way.

3 (2h 52m 54s):
That wasn't a scam. That was business that got uncovered. Yeah. And I'll prove it to you. When you go to, like if you go to jail in New York, everybody goes to Rikers Island. So I was in Rikers Island. So if you got, if you got money on you and you go in, they give you a card when you leaving and it's got money on it, your amount like systems are the system like Right.

2 (2h 53m 25s):
Yeah. There's a lot of money being made. Yeah. A lot of money being tossed around the system. And if you have a thing like an open immigration policy for sure someone's figuring out how to profit off that. Someone's figuring out something about that.

3 (2h 53m 40s):
No, no. You're looking at it the wrong way. There is no one who isn't profiting.

2 (2h 53m 46s):
Everyone's profiting.

3 (2h 53m 47s):
I'm saying how ridiculous is it for you to think you have the greatest country in the world and then it not be a big deal to get there.

2 (2h 54m 2s):
Of course.

5 (2h 54m 4s):
What do you mean

2 (2h 54m 5s):
Of course?

3 (2h 54m 6s):
This is the hunt. The the, the bees saying why do they love our honey so much?

2 (2h 54m 12s):
Well no one's shocked at that. What people are shocked at is that there's no effort whatsoever to stop the stem of illegal immigration. That's what people are freaked out about. Like it seems like it's

3 (2h 54m 22s):
On purpose. We're not freaked out about the loss of bees.

2 (2h 54m 26s):
I am.

3 (2h 54m 26s):
If all the bees are gone, we're fucked. We're going to die as a civilization because we didn't protect one of the most important insects in the whole ecosystem. Yeah. Right. So you know,

2 (2h 54m 40s):
And they think cell phone signals are fucking them up too.

3 (2h 54m 45s):
Well

2 (2h 54m 46s):
Can you imagine you've been a B forever and then all of a sudden someone introduces cell phone signals everywhere.

3 (2h 54m 53s):
Oh no. This is of the purpose of religion in society is to try to get you away from exploring all of the things you could be doing with your time and put it somewhere that's healthier.

2 (2h 55m 14s):
Look, what do you mean?

3 (2h 55m 17s):
Like principles of meditation and you know, believing that you should be trying to do a good job and being nice, you know, because it's not really that profitable. Right. But here we are talking about, you know, that's what really will help our country and civilization if we treated the downtrodden better. But the truth is there's very low money in that.

2 (2h 55m 49s):
Yeah.

3 (2h 55m 50s):
There's very low money in that. The truth is that the immigrants that come over here are, are generally super qualified at something.

2 (2h 55m 59s):
Yeah. And motivated

3 (2h 56m 1s):
And

2 (2h 56m 2s):
I mean shit. Yeah. If I

3 (2h 56m 4s):
Just walked here and that's, that's what's made all immigration important. It, you know what I mean? Like the, the Mexican people were the second or well they were their own jolt to the civilization of the fact that yeah you say oh they shouldn't come over. But anybody that comes over willing to work hard and succeed and those are people you want a part and they immediately help.

3 (2h 56m 44s):
Like you can look at the extremes Of course, but the benefit are astronomical and always have been since Pangaea.

2 (2h 56m 59s):
Yeah. The benefits are great, the side effects are crime. And that's what you have to be careful of. Especially when you got organized crime that's coming in to sell fentanyl. You got a lot of that. That's a, that's a wild one. 'cause that that's propped up by laws that's propped up by our drug laws And that that puts you in a real complicated situation. Like do you make drugs, legal, everything. Everything legal. The problem is you're gonna get a bunch of people that get addicted to drugs that probably wouldn't without that. And then you have to say, is that just a part of the process? We have to learn to deal with this new thing that's everywhere and then and readily available. And how many people are gonna try it just 'cause it's legal. Probably quite a few, but at least how many people are not gonna die from fentanyl poisoning? 'cause they're gonna get pure stuff.

2 (2h 57m 40s):
Probably a lot.

3 (2h 57m 46s):
Yeah, that, well talking fentanyl in specific, like, it's a very difficult conversation to have because most of the things that we will all agree are terrible drugs aren't being used at the hospital.

2 (2h 58m 3s):
Right.

3 (2h 58m 4s):
So until that part gets taken, like it's, it's a bad look all the way around but, but the bar has been set so high. Like everything that's called a drug nowadays is terrible. Like there's been no evolution. Like yikes.

2 (2h 58m 28s):
Well that's part of the problem with keeping drugs illegal and especially psychedelic drugs since 1970. It's like stymied, human evolution, stymied research, stymied growth.

3 (2h 58m 39s):
What did

2 (2h 58m 40s):
Keeping drugs illegal, keeping psychedelic drugs illegal. Look,

3 (2h 58m 43s):
If there was

2 (2h 58m 44s):
Specifically psychedelic

3 (2h 58m 45s):
Drugs, if there was a God, then he put a fail safe on the drug so that you would have a barrier.

2 (2h 58m 58s):
And that's Richard Nixon.

3 (2h 58m 59s):
That's o, that's ODing.

2 (2h 59m 1s):
ODing, right? Yeah. Right. With those

3 (2h 59m 3s):
Drugs. Right. So really what's happening is you're like okay, whatever you're on, do it to your debt. And so you know, statistically that's gonna happen. You gonna lose some people, but the people that's not doing it, they're not gonna start doing it like Right.

2 (2h 59m 21s):
They're gonna learn from the people that died. Like you learned to not eat poisonous plants,

3 (2h 59m 26s):
You would think, but if that were true, nobody in the world would ever do heroin. Like if you've ever seen somebody kick it like Right, you would never do it. Like it doesn't matter how it makes you feel if the end result is defecating and urinating in a puddle that you're laying in while being naked then being like you would like. True. You would just call that poisonous

2 (2h 59m 57s):
If you were smart. Yeah. You would learn, you would learn from other people doing it. And that's the thing, it's like we're reluctant to allow that factor into people's lives but we kind of have with a lot of other factors. Well

3 (3h 0m 13s):
A lot of these things were used sparingly and in context as well. You follow what I'm saying? Oh sure. So, so

2 (3h 0m 21s):
Particularly a lot of psychedelics, they were used in a ritualistic way

3 (3h 0m 25s):
But but that's like us saying, you know, well in that cooking show they were using herbs and spices like yeah that goes with it. Right? Like Right. If somebody tells you that when they used to come through with the ball and the smoke and the incense, that at one point it was marijuana Right. Understand that it was setting the mood of the room. Yeah. Like yeah. You know what I mean? Yeah. Like that's how you know there is an occult. How could there not be, there's another side to everything universally.

3 (3h 1m 11s):
So yeah. That

2 (3h 1m 14s):
Must have been a wild time at church. Everybody's just got contact high people walking down the aisles with balls filled with marijuana smoke.

3 (3h 1m 23s):
Well it understand this is not being consistently done. This is being done. Right. You know what I mean and so there's no such thing as you getting too much of it. You're not getting enough to do anything except relax. Right. And relax is what you should be doing as we discuss what we're discussing.

2 (3h 1m 46s):
Yeah. It'll humble you a little. Calm me down a little.

3 (3h 1m 49s):
It'll take the edge off. Yeah. You're not edge off, you're not getting enough to have the munchies and if you do, we'll probably have a little something for Yeah don don't know. But I'm saying all throughout history people have been searching for this connection. Yes. And and we don't have historically any evidence of any groups of people doing it, doing something for no reason. Right. There was a element to this. So when we have the stories of we went in this cave and crazy shit was down there and like we now know that a lot of that existed, like the air is not the same down there.

3 (3h 2m 40s):
Like it might have been a poisonous gas in there and we know that, you know, these were things that were not known then. So it's just fascinating to see the stories where we are now and to see how advanced they were on these particular subjects and that time weeded out the BS stories really well.

2 (3h 3m 11s):
Yeah, there's probably something to all of them. There's probably something to all stories from all cultures

3 (3h 3m 19s):
And

2 (3h 3m 19s):
There's a reason why they would want to tell them over and over and over again.

3 (3h 3m 22s):
One of the criteria for it to last over time. Yeah. Like that's what I understood when I broke the internet. I was trying, I I lemme see if you know like when you start studying quotes and where great quotes come from, you start getting these people that are known for their great quotes. Right. But the further you go back, you see who really said it first. You know what I mean and that's what brings it full circle to that Emerald tablet I was telling you about.

3 (3h 4m 7s):
Right. Because 70% of it is something you've heard somewhere else.

2 (3h 4m 20s):
Well I can't wait to read it. I wasn't even aware of it. but it totally makes

3 (3h 4m 25s):
Sense. Like there are things in it that are verbatim to the bible, verbatim to the Quran, like verbatim to,

2 (3h 4m 41s):
I'm gonna read it.

3 (3h 4m 43s):
It's a great thing.

2 (3h 4m 44s):
Katt. Williams, thank you for being here man. This is a lot of fun. Thank you. Glad we finally

3 (3h 4m 47s):
Did it. Happy to me Joe, you're glad

2 (3h 4m 49s):
I finally met you.

3 (3h 4m 49s):
Yeah, me too.

2 (3h 4m 51s):
I appreciate you very much man. And we, we talk well about you all the time. I think you're one of the best comics of all time and you know, I think you're, you're a fucking animal man. You, you get after it in a way that like the energy that you have. I, I appreciate you very much, very much. Thank you. So it was a lot. Likewise. Thanks for being here. Thank man. Alright, bye everybody.

Joe Rogan podcast. Check out.

1 (4s):
The. Joe. Rogan. Experience.

2 (6s):
Train by day. Joe Rogan podcast by night. All day.

3 (13s):
I didn't bring no motherfuck glasses though.

4 (15s):
Oh, do you need some? Yeah, I have some.

3 (17s):
Just in case. If you are gonna show me something interesting. Yeah. Thank you sir. Thank you, sir.

4 (24s):
So I started doing this red light bed. I started doing two things to help my eyes. One, I started taking pure encapsulations. They have this, what is it called? Macro support. What is it called? Anyway, it's a bunch of supplements that they put together to stop your eyesight from going bad. And it's legit. Macular support. Macular support. That's it.

3 (53s):
You like it? Legit.

4 (54s):
Oh, legit. It stop. Whatever the deterioration that I was experiencing where my eyesight was starting to go, it stopped. Just stopped it. and it made it a little bit better. And then I started doing this red light bed. So I had this guy, Gary Breck, on the podcast, he's explained to me how red light revitalizes your capillaries and helps your vision come back. And so I've been doing that now for about six weeks. And I've noticed an improvement. Like I don't need reading glasses as much. If I'm reading things on my phone, I can read some things that I just was not gonna be able to read. And more importantly, it's not getting worse. 'cause like it was like kind of every six months, eight months or so, I'd notice, my God, my eyes are worse.

4 (1m 37s):
Like, this is terrible. Like after like 46, it seemed like somewhere around 46, it was like it dropped off a cliff

3 (1m 44s):
And you did the right thing because you didn't submit to these. My mistake was to submit to these when I was like 43 mm, 44 By 44. I could see I was having problems already. and I submitted to these and this is worse for you. That's why I used to tell you glasses. Don't put the glasses on. Hold on. Yeah. Make your eyes muscle. That thing. It's like when you wear fucking hearing aids, like your hearing gets lost.

4 (2m 8s):
Well, they say with with vision. Like the problem is we're looking at things that are real close up all the time. And your, your eyes are supposed to do a bunch of different things. They're supposed to look at stuff in the distance. They're supposed to look at things up close. And if you don't look at things in the distance all the time, you lose that ability.

3 (2m 24s):
Well, I'm gonna be as honest as I can with you. I'm not trying to be cute here. Okay. I lost my eyesight when I stopped doing coke. 'cause when I was doing Coke, my eyesight was on point. Chad, I could see a light from fucking two miles away. That light's green. We gotta make it. Once I stopped doing Coke, my eyesight went right into the fucking shitter. So when I was snorting, I had 2020 vision. I could see coke, rocks and the carpet

4 (2m 46s):
And

3 (2m 47s):
Shit. Now I can't see shit if there's a Coke rock on the fucking floor.

4 (2m 51s):
So that, I guess it's blood flow. If you think about a blood flow to the brain, I mean doesn't Coke give you like a crazy amount of blood flow to your brain? I mean. I mean it must, it's a stimulant, right?

3 (2m 60s):
I have no idea. I have no idea where the blood goes. But Joey, thank God

4 (3m 3s):
I never got into that. No, thank God I

3 (3m 5s):
Never got into that. And especially now, like now I see these people that are snorting anything. Yeah. To snort anything today, you gotta be fucking crazy. Yeah. You could die heroin. These people who put the fucking test, like if you go into a bar in New York, they have tests. Yeah. Then you go in the bathroom and are you fucking kidding me?

4 (3m 21s):
They have to. If you don't want

3 (3m 22s):
Die, once you test cocaine, it's time to do something different.

4 (3m 26s):
If

3 (3m 26s):
You gotta test your Coke, it's time to do something different. You gotta fucking,

4 (3m 29s):
You know what's going on here? Ketamine, everybody's doing ketamine. They do nasal sprays. We had some lady go into a K hole in the middle of our Comedy show. She's fucking falling down like this. And the, they, they, they brought in the Narcan and shit. They were worried that she had overdosed. And her wife was like, no, no, no. She's just been doing ketamine. She just did too much. She did.

3 (3m 51s):
So I did a couple lines of that one time at the podcast studio. Yeah. and it was okay. I did the podcast, but whoever gave me the Ketamine left like a pile of it on the desk, you know, after we did a couple lines. So he left and me and Lee were talking and I go Lee, what are we gonna do with this fucking thing? And he goes, I don on. I'll throw it away. I go, fuck that. It was about 8 30, 9 o'clock at night. I had done three lines maybe. and I was buzzed, but it didn't take me over the top. I did those Now I lived six minutes from the podcast studio in la. When I got to the first light to make the left, I knew it was not gonna be a good drive.

3 (4m 32s):
It was not gonna be a good drive home. Okay. I had done too much. And then I got home. And when I put my foot outta the car, that was it. It was lights out after that. and I'm like, I am fucked up. I'm,

4 (4m 45s):
What do you mean? Like lights out? Like in what way?

3 (4m 46s):
Like I was fucked up. don don't know what was going on.

4 (4m 50s):
It's a different kind of fucked up. Right?

3 (4m 51s):
It's a different type of fucked up. And then I went in the house and God damnit, my wife is awake.

4 (4m 57s):
Oh

3 (4m 57s):
No. Now I gotta talk to her. So I ran in my office and I'm in there 15 minutes getting higher and higher. Oh no. And shit, my body's feeling weird. and I go, I better go out there before she comes in here.

4 (5m 13s):
Right.

3 (5m 15s):
And she was watching True,

4 (5m 17s):
True Crimes

3 (5m 18s):
Detective, whatever that on HBO. Oh, okay. and it was the dude from the Green book and the other guy,

4 (5m 24s):
The Green,

3 (5m 25s):
The brother, the, the guy who won the, he was book the Green book with the guy who drove him in the south. He played the piano player. Anyway, it doesn't matter. So, you know, I saw the Green book. I don't think I saw that's a green book. Good fucking movie.

4 (5m 37s):
Oh, we were talking about him yesterday. Marcal Ali. Yeah. Yeah. That guy's awesome, man. He's awesome. He was great in that Netflix documentary, the Netflix show. We were just talking about, about the end of the world with Julia Roberts and Ethan

3 (5m 49s):
Hawk. Oh, I didn't see that. It

4 (5m 50s):
Was good. Good fucking Giannis. Hated it though, huh? Yeah. He's trying to get me to hate it. I kind of went with him a little bit. Right. He influenced me. I was like, yeah, there was some parts I didn't like. Yeah, you didn't like the animals, the CG animals getting picky. Yeah. Bunch of CGI. Animals staring at people. I'm like, come on on. No You don't need to do this to me. No,

3 (6m 10s):
No. But I looked at him and then while I was watching tv, his head kept getting bigger, boo. And I'm like, I couldn't take it. I'm sitting there, I got no T-shirt on. I'm sweating

4 (6m 19s):
Diffusely.

3 (6m 20s):
She's kind of looking at me. I'm kind of looking at her.

4 (6m 23s):
Your wife is a fucking angel. And finally, she really is to deal with you. I

3 (6m 26s):
Couldn't take it no more. I couldn't take it no more. and I go, what the hell's going on here? And she's said, what? What? I'll change it. She didn't know. I told her the next morning, I said, lemme tell you something. I came last night. I was not doing too good. You know, people think that you, you fuck around. Like when I was living in la, people think like you fuck around and you don't have no, everybody always thinks like, I just got high and had no fucking consequences. I just never told you about what I dealt with. You know, one night I ate mushrooms and I went home and the fucking mushrooms hit. I didn't know. I ate like three little fucking things at the office. The mushrooms hit. And that's the day the Exorcist came on. and I had to watch it. And I'm like, what the, and I finally ran into the room and put the blankets over my head. It was too fucking real.

3 (7m 7s):
Like, I have horrible high stories. I just don't repeat 'em. 'cause you know, people won't believe them.

4 (7m 14s):
I remember when we were on a plane once and you were eating stars at death. And we were like almost at New York. and it was like an hour before the plane landed here. Joe Rogan. I almost fucking lost it. I almost fucking lost it. I was having a panic attack. I was, it was getting bad. It was getting bad. And then you go, but I'm back. And then you pop two more.

3 (7m 33s):
I

4 (7m 33s):
Like, how did you just fucking do that? Oh, you just had a panic attack almost,

3 (7m 37s):
You know, for three years I cried about this. Anxiety. Anxiety. I can't take it.

4 (7m 41s):
Yeah.

3 (7m 42s):
Fucking, I don't do edibles now.

4 (7m 46s):
Is that what it is?

3 (7m 46s):
Monday nights. So

4 (7m 47s):
It was edibles. It was giving you the anxiety. You

3 (7m 50s):
Said it yourself. You can't live on a 2000 milligrams of goddamn day. Yeah. Something's gotta fall apart eventually. Yeah. You know, that was kicking it up. And then

4 (7m 60s):
I would get, anytime I would get above 200 milligrams, the whole world was just like very slippery. Very slippery. I was like, this is like, I could see how edibles can get someone to legitimately lose their mind. That's why when I was talking to Alex Berenson, he wrote that book, tell Your Children, it's all about schizophrenia and about how there are people that get introduced to high doses of marijuana and introduces schizophrenia. We know people, we both know a couple of people that have had that happen to. I'm like, this is real. and I think marijuana is very beneficial in low to moderate doses. But you get above certain doses with certain psychologies.

4 (8m 40s):
Certain people, certain times of their life, you know, certain things they're going through.

3 (8m 44s):
You never know.

4 (8m 46s):
You could fucking crack.

3 (8m 47s):
You never know.

4 (8m 48s):
You could.

3 (8m 48s):
Yeah. and I can tell you that. That's the truth. Yeah, that's the truth. Because at times, you know, it

4 (8m 54s):
Gets marijuana at the high doses is not what people think it is. It, it gets to that very psychedelic place where it's like, this might as well be acid. Like the real high doses. There was some time where Eddie Bravo had these THC pills. One of his students had made his own pills, had like turned Keef into pills. I forget how many we took, but I was talking to this one dude. And like, I might as well have been in another dimension. Like my relationship to reality was very slippery. I was like, if I was losing my mind right now, if I wasn't in a good place in my life, my, you know, life is falling apart.

4 (9m 34s):
Maybe you're, you know, getting fired. Your house is repossessed, going through a divorce. Maybe you have cancer. Who knows. Whatever. It's, and then you get that dose, they could send you over the top.

3 (9m 45s):
Bro. I had a guy come over from Juujitsu one day. We just hanging out and he goes, I wanna do a bon here with you. I gave him two Ts of what I smoke. He puked in my yard. He was like, don, don't know how you do this every day. Two fucking bongas. Lemme get a light up up.

4 (9m 59s):
Well, yeah. Well it's also like when someone runs marathons, you try to run a marathon with 'em. I don't know how you run a marathon. Well, you fucking, you gotta build up to it. You're building up to that too. It's all building up. You know,

3 (10m 13s):
This new weed that's coming out now. These people aren't ready for it.

4 (10m 18s):
It's too strong.

3 (10m 19s):
And more people are smoking pot now than ever before. Whether it's vapor pens, everybody's doing something.

4 (10m 26s):
Is that like, because it's legal, right? I wonder what the numbers are. Because, because it's legal in, what is it now? Jamie? 19 states.

5 (10m 35s):
I feel like we're close to 20 in twenties. 23 million

4 (10m 37s):
Shitload of states. It's decriminalized in the city of Austin. But it's legal in a lot of states. Like New Jersey, New York, California, recreational use, Nevada, Colorado, Oregon. There's, I would imagine there's more people smoking it now just because of that. Because it's legal. Right?

3 (10m 57s):
Dog. You gotta come home from work instead of getting beer or whatever the fuck you get. You go in, you get one of these joints for 25 bucks, this'll last the regular person the whole weekend.

4 (11m 8s):
And it doesn't kill your body. and

3 (11m 9s):
It doesn't kill you.

4 (11m 10s):
It doesn't kill your body. That's the big one for me. Like when I was doing Juujitsu every day, if I was getting high and doing juujitsu, it, it actually made my juujitsu better. Like, I felt like my juujitsu was more smooth. I was more focused. But I never felt wrecked the next day. But if I drank the night before and then tried to go into class the next day, I always felt like 30% less. I was like, this is terrible. I was like, I gotta stop drinking. 'cause every time I would go out drinking

3 (11m 39s):
And

4 (11m 39s):
Then I'd go into class, I, I just get manhandled. Let's just get wrecked. Just couldn't, couldn't keep up. I know when you're hung over, it's the worst feeling. It's the worst feeling. What have I done to myself for just a few hours of fun?

3 (11m 51s):
You know, it's really crazy that we don't really know what alcohol does to our bodies. But it's not good. You know? But it's

4 (11m 58s):
Like, you know how you find out? Get one of those aura rings. Get a aura ring or a whoop strap. One of those whoop straps. I got one. Yeah. Okay. Check your whoop strap. Have a couple of cocktails. Oh, and then check your whoop strap. It's crazy. Like I don only it's got two drinks, two glasses of wine. Your recovery will be way down. The whoop strap is very beneficial for that because it, it tracks your heart rate variability and it gives you like a real accurate assessment of what happens when you fuck around with things. 'cause if you just do something different, like I just cut out sugar. Oh whoa, look at how much better my recovery is. You know? Oh, I stopped drinking alcohol. Whoa. Recovery's through the roof. I committed to drinking X amount of liters of water every day. Whoa. Look at all this recovery. Look, my body's functioning better.

4 (12m 40s):
You know, it's like, it gives you real feedback.

3 (12m 42s):
Well I was telling your buddy that when I got the whoop, it was for recovery purposes. I don't like being that fucking sore. You know what I'm saying? So I wanna know where I am throughout the day. Right. I got the whoop and I. Gotta be honest with you. You know what improved the best? What my sleep. Mm. Because when I got the whoop, we all think we sleep eight hours. Right?

4 (13m 2s):
Everybody

3 (13m 3s):
Thinks they sleep fucking eight hours. Get the fucking whoop and get back to me. Yeah. You'll see that you're sleeping 5 45, 6 10 and you're like, this ain't working. So I started doing things to help my sleep. Joe. Do you know I sleep eight now and at four o'clock, five o'clock I gotta go down for an hour every day.

4 (13m 22s):
Take a nap.

3 (13m 23s):
You know, when I took, I never took a fucking nap since, you know me take a nap.

4 (13m 28s):
Mm.

3 (13m 28s):
One hour get up, I feel tip top my goul. And that's when I start smoking weed and having a good time.

4 (13m 36s):
Yeah. I'm, I can function on five. I do well on six when I'm doing eight plus I'm at my best I. know the difference. Like there's days that I come in here where maybe I had a late show, got outta the club late and then maybe I had to take the kids to school in the morning. Or maybe I had an appointment or maybe I had something I had to do. So I had to get up early. So I only got like five or six. I can function, but I'm in my mind, I'm like, that's a check I have to pay. That's a bill I have to pay. So I have to make sure tonight I get like 10 or 11 Tonight. I really want to get, get some serious sleep. No booze. Hit the sauna, hit the cold, get, get my body prepped.

4 (14m 15s):
Sauna and a cold plunge before you go to bed. Oh my God. You sleep like really baby. You sleep like a baby. You sleep so good. Yeah.

3 (14m 23s):
I haven't worked myself up to the cold plunge yet, but I do the red lights now on it twice a week. Now.

4 (14m 27s):
You can do it right now.

3 (14m 28s):
Fuck

4 (14m 28s):
That red light sauna is great. I think any sauna is great. Even a hot bath is great. The whole idea is just warming your body up. Just getting your body. So it's uncomfortable. But the real studies are on the regular sauna. We got a, a salus sauna. I have that for here and that for my house. They're the shit man. That's, it's, it's the one we have here is so nice. It's set up. It's all Bluetooth. You set it up off your phone like so you're on their way to the gym before, on the way to the gym. Set the sauna one 90. Get here, come

3 (14m 58s):
On in. Yeah, it's ready

4 (14m 59s):
For, it takes a while. It takes a while to cook. But then you know, you're sitting in that thing. And if you do that on a regular basis, it gets, you get used to it. You get used to being uncomfortable, but god damn, you feel good. Like your joints feel good. All the stiffness kind of feels like it goes away. Your mood feels better. You sleep better. Sauna's the motherfucker. If I had to pick one over the two, I don't know which one I'd pick. But I love the fact that I could do both of them. I think sauna, I would pick. 'cause there's more data. There's, there's a 20 year study out of Finland with sauna patients where they, they use the sauna four times a week for 20 years. and it, depending about how many times a week they used it, they saw more improvement.

4 (15m 40s):
But the people that used it four times a week saw, I think it was a 40% decrease in all cause mortality. Its 40% decrease stroke, heart attack cancer for the people that did that. As opposed to the people that didn't do it.

3 (15m 51s):
Well your girl told me that if you doof Rhonda. Yeah, I love her.

4 (15m 55s):
She's the best. You know, I love her. I love

3 (15m 57s):
Her too. Like I watch,

4 (15m 58s):
Shout out to Rhonda Patrick.

3 (15m 59s):
I watch every video. I take what she tells me. Yeah. To heart and I think she's so fucking sexy. But she's so fucking smart. When she, when she just goes on the tail, like she's so fucking sexy. She's Genius Genius, but she's Genius. She was saying that 51 61 minutes a week in the sauna cuts your cardiac arrest rate by like fucking 60% or some shit.

4 (16m 22s):
Well, I'll tell you what else it does. Joey. It makes your cardio better. Like your cardio for working out, just sitting there, your heart rate gets jacked. So it's like a static form of cardio.

3 (16m 33s):
When before I go to the Tuesday and Thursday Juujitsu, I go to the red lights on it. That's my cheat because that's a heavier class and you gotta fucking be a little. So I always go in there in the morning, 34 minutes, come out, go right to Juujitsu from there. Fucking,

4 (16m 48s):
It's a good way to warm up before working out too. Get in there for 10 minutes, just sort of like get in there and stretch a little bit for 10 minutes.

3 (16m 55s):
I do yoga in there. I do a bunch ofs of OT goers, whatever the fuck they call. Yeah. There's a company

4 (17m 0s):
That makes a, a yoga room. Like they make a sauna. That's just for working out in, it's a bigger sauna. It's, I think it's, what is that company? But they, they have like chin up bars in there and shit and an exercise bike. And people work out while they're in the, in the infrared.

3 (17m 16s):
I breathe the five just work on my breathing. Just, you know, quick breathing in deep. And then I get up and I stretch a little bit. And then about the 10 minute mark is where I start doing Chagas. Mm. And which

4 (17m 30s):
One's a

3 (17m 30s):
Chaga? Chagas, when you go up, down drop, you could drop into a fucking whatever, crooked dog, whatever the fuck it is. But it's not big enough. Uncle, Joey and I fucked my ankle up, so I wasn't doing those. But I'll do a bunch of warrior poses. Warrior one. Warrior two

4 (17m 48s):
In the sauna. Yeah, in the sauna.

3 (17m 50s):
Yeah. And then I wait to the halfway mark, I go out, I take 30 seconds, I drink a little liquid IV and I shoot right the back, the fucking there. and I gotta tell you something else before I go on that sauna. I do it in the morning. I get as fucking grizzled as I can be. Yeah. I don't smoke. If I know I'm going to the sauna at 10, I won't do that. Eight o'clock bong hit in the morning. I'll hold off on that motherfucker till 10 and then I'll do like 18 bong hits when I walk in there. They even know it. Whoa. They're the nicest people in the world. They just wave. I go on the red light sauna. I am fucking stoned in there. When I walk outta there, I dry off. I put my socks on, I drink my water.

3 (18m 30s):
After about seven minutes, I go back in and smell in there. You could grow fucking weed in that motherfucker after I, the odors you smell in there. Fucking fungi, toenail sweat, fucking reefer sweat. It's, it's amazing. Is

4 (18m 43s):
This a place that the gym you go to?

3 (18m 45s):
No, no. This is a place called Chill.

4 (18m 47s):
Oh. So it's a place to set up just with saunas and cold

3 (18m 49s):
Plunges red light sauna. No cold plunge. But they have the cryo cryotherapy. So you could go right from the sauna to the cryo. They got so many things now. They got me beds that you sit in, it controls like whatever. They have so many things. The place is clean. Six minutes from my house, I could just call 'em and go, I'm on my way. We don't have a bed. We have a bed. It's tremendous. I love all that shit.

4 (19m 12s):
Yeah. I wonder what's better for you cry over the cold plunge. I think, I'll tell you what's harder to do. Cold plunge is harder to do.

3 (19m 20s):
Plunge is hard.

4 (19m 20s):
It's harder to do. and it feel, you feel different when you get outta there. Like you feel fucking chilled down to the bones. Whereas there's something about the, the cryo chamber. I think they're both super beneficial though. don don't know. If there's been studies done on what's better for you, but the, I get the same feeling after both of 'em. Like, woo. I recover a lot quicker after the cryotherapy than I would the cold plunge though. The cold plunge. I'm cold for a long

3 (19m 46s):
Fucking time. I only got one regret about cryotherapy that I didn't discover that when I was doing drugs. Because that, lemme tell you something. When you go into the cryotherapy, the first time you do the three minutes, when you walk outta there, you either have an idea what this is for you. Like for me, when I walked out, I go, where was this motherfucker when I was drinking? Because you could snort coke till nine in the morning, go to that red light on a quarter to 10, come outta that 10. You're brand new. I've never done it. But I know from the feeling of walking outta there that you're brand new.

4 (20m 18s):
So you mean the cryotherapy or you mean the, the sauna.

3 (20m 21s):
The cryotherapy. I'm sorry. Yeah. Japanese people invented cryotherapy. Correct? They did. Can we find out? Can they fact check me? You know,

4 (20m 29s):
I think I would like to know I mean. I think the Vikings did it. There's a thing they did like to just boost their manliness. Just get in the fucking cold water.

5 (20m 40s):
Technically Joey's right? Oh, okay. Developed in the 1970s by a Japanese rheumatologist. Sima Yamaguchi. But that'd be like the actual cryotherapy that we did like in la

4 (20m 50s):
Like the Okay, like the, with the liquid nitrogen stuff. The cold liquid nitrogen. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

3 (20m 55s):
Now,

4 (20m 55s):
But the Vikings were doing cold therapy. Right, right, right. That's thousands of years ago. I don't

5 (20m 60s):
Think they had liquid

3 (21m 0s):
Nitrogen. But the guy that invented this to people, it was Japanese people. And again, these motherfuckers like to party.

4 (21m 8s):
Yeah.

3 (21m 8s):
So as soon as I walked out there, that's what I said to myself. Absolutely. A Japanese guy invented this.

4 (21m 13s):
Look at this. It goes back to the ancient civilizations, ancient Egyptians, Romans and early Greeks were using cold temperatures as a form of therapy as early as 2,500 bc. Whoa. When I used to see Fedor do it, Fedor Emelianenko, one of the all time greats, he used to do the banya. So they would all get in the sauna together and they would like beat them with leaves. They would use leaves and beat them. And then they would jump in this frozen lake and I would like, these guys are just insane. There's no, I'm like, what the bene what's the benefit of that? I would think it was nonsense. But they knew. They knew, you know, this is early two thousands. People had weren't doing cold plunges and saunas. If they were, it wasn't like openly discussed like it is now.

4 (21m 56s):
You know, Dan, Dan Gable found out about it. He was telling me on the podcast, he found out about it when he was rush wrestling the Russians and the Eastern Europeans. He's like, they all use sauna. And he, he realized like, there's something to the, the actual, the the benefits for your cardio recovery blood cells. He said it's almost like a mild version of EPO. When you take, when you're in the sauna on a regular basis, it just really boosts up your endurance. Here's Fedor. Damn. When he was young, he was the motherfucker dude. And what a dad bo, that guy had, there's not a single photo of him out there with a six pack. And he's widely regarded as the greatest heavyweight of all time.

4 (22m 37s):
I mean he might be the greatest martial artist of all time. He's certainly in the argument, the arguments for the greatest martial arts of all time. If they're, they're in their prime. I always say this guy, because people leave him outta the conversation. You never should. BJ Penn, BJ Penn in his prime was one of the greatest I've ever seen. And then there's Anderson Anderson in his prime. I was just watching the Anderson documentary, the UFC just put together, holy shit, man. You forget, you forget. You forget those Rich Franklin fights.

3 (23m 9s):
I never forgot 'em.

4 (23m 10s):
You forget, but you forget the level of expertise and precision and just mastery he had when he was in his prime. I am telling you, I'm guilty, even though I'm a giant Anderson fan. I had to see it again. I had to see it again. I'm like, oh yeah, people forgot.

3 (23m 27s):
Well, we had a conversation after Theo fight. You're like, how to Sonya's the best and I go. Remember I said to you, bro, relax. Yeah,

4 (23m 34s):
No, you're

3 (23m 35s):
Right. It's Anderson and I. I love the rich fight. I mean the first time I ever saw this motherfucker. I'm about, I'm getting dressed, I'm getting dressed, ready to go do Comedy with you or anybody else. and it was a UFC fight night with him against Chris Leban. Yeah. I never saw this fucking guy. I heard you guys talking about him. Yeah. And when he came out, it was fucking mastery. I was like blown. Then he played the ukulele. I'll never forget that.

4 (24m 0s):
Well, I, I was a giant fan of Anderson's already. 'cause I became a fan of Anderson's in Pride. And then Anderson went over to Cage Warriors. And when he went over to, was it Cage rage? What, what was the organization that he fought for? That Anderson fought for in England. But in England he came, he became Anderson Silva. You know, there's, there's a, there's like Charles Oliveira. Charles Oliveira was a really good fighter. And then his daughter was born and then he became Charles Ra the assassin that everybody knows. But he lost a bunch of times in the C

3 (24m 34s):
Yeah, we went to, yeah, I don

4 (24m 35s):
Just, he would fall apart Anderson when he went to England. There's something about leaving Japan and going to England. Then he became Anderson. So what was the Cage rage? Right? Cage Warriors is the, the, the, that's like the top organization that exists now in, in the uk. So he fights Lee Murray in Cage Rage and Lee Murray was a fucking killer. Lee Murray was the guy who was involved in the biggest armed robbery in the history of the uk. He, he's in jail now. Like forever.

3 (25m 7s):
Yeah. I didn't

4 (25m 8s):
A real gangster, crazy dude Leo. So he fucks Lee Murray up in Cage rage, and then he comes back in fucks Jorge Rivera up in Cage rage. And when he fucked ho Jorge Rivera, he's standing in front of Jorge, who was a murderous puncher and letting Jorge punch him in the face. He was just letting him punch him in the face, just like, bitch, you ain't got shit. And then beat his ass. Then he goes over and fights Tony fricken in cage rage and hits him with that crazy upward elbow. Did you ever see that? Yeah,

3 (25m 36s):
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4 (25m 36s):
So he fucked Curtis Stout, fucked him up. Fucked Tony fricken up. And then by the time he was coming to the UFC, I was like, dude, get ready for this guy. and I was looking at the line, like the betting line, the betting lines back then were stealing. Sure. Nobody knew nothing. Nobody

3 (25m 54s):
Knew nothing. Nothing.

4 (25m 55s):
Nobody knew nothing. You a, a guy would sneak over a guy like Glover to Shera or someone would come over from Brazil. You'd be like, you don't, no one even knows yet. You don't even know how good this guy is. Like in the, the, you know, the, the line would be like in favor of the other guy. Be like, oh my God, this is hilarious. I think Chris Lieman might've been a slight favorite over Anderson. don don't even know what the betting line was. I don't think he was a favorite. I think Anderson was a favorite. But either way, I was like, dude, he's gonna light him up like a Christmas tree. Because Chris Leman was just such a murderous, marauding, attacking style that's perfect for Anderson. 'cause Anderson's the technician. So he is just gonna slide away. Pop,

3 (26m 34s):
Pop, pop. That's what he did. He basically just stepped away, punched.

4 (26m 37s):
It's a masterclass. Put that fight on. Put Anderson silver versus

3 (26m 40s):
Chris Lee dog. The fucking fight you took me to with Rich Franklin in Columbus. Oh yeah. When the, the Arnold thing was going on. We

4 (26m 47s):
Were in Columbus. Yeah.

3 (26m 48s):
That last array when he boom, boom. Then he hits him low with a leg kick and then he punches him again. Another leg kick. It's fucking Beau. I I was like, what the fuck? That's how you mix it. The fuck up.

4 (26m 59s):
And he did it like he was just playing. He did it like he was hitting a heavy bag. Just fucking around.

3 (27m 5s):
What about the night we did the hit of acid? And that's the night he decided to kick that dude in the face. This the one,

4 (27m 10s):
Right? Yeah. This is the one. Yeah. So this is Anderson's debut. And by the way, Chris Levan, one of the most murderous punchers, knocked out Vander la Silva knocked out a shit ton of dudes. When Chris Leban would connect on guys, they would go night night. And he fought like a fucking Wolverine. Man, Chris Leban would just charge at you. So like that style with that kind of confidence is per look at how Anderson's moving Baby. Look at that. Look at that jab. Look at that jab. Shucks him off to the side. I mean the footwork, bro. Look how elegant. Just no wasted movement. And leaving, just moving it for the kill Bink.

4 (27m 53s):
Oh gimme that volume sounded better. Real good at moving in and out. Changing timing. Oh, there it is. It's already beginning. Ping bing, bing. Yep. I mean leaving. Can't even land a shot on him

6 (28m 6s):
In and it do right here. Is he

3 (28m 12s):
Leman got back up though. Oh,

4 (28m 13s):
Le so, so tough dude. Tough as nails. And there's the knee. And that's a rap son

6 (28m 20s):
Is less than one minute. That's what I was talking

4 (28m 24s):
About. This is a different kind of Striker. Anderson Silva. Man, that was impressive. That was the big debut. That was like 2004.

3 (28m 33s):
Six six. I was fucking hypnotized by that. Hypnotized.

4 (28m 38s):
He was the man

3 (28m 38s):
Hypnotized I was like, what the fuck?

4 (28m 41s):
He was the man. He was the

3 (28m 42s):
Man. Because I watched, listen bro, I watched the UFC with you. There was a bunch of chubby guys that looked like me. I didn't want no part of that stuff. He took me to Florida one time to see Miami when there was like maybe 15 people in the audience. Shaq was there. Do you remember

4 (28m 57s):
That? It was a long time ago. Yeah. That was the early days.

3 (28m 60s):
That was two four. That was 2004. Because that was around the time of that man show. and it was Butter Bean was one of the fighters on that call.

4 (29m 10s):
No Butter Bee. Never fought in the UC.

3 (29m 11s):
Who was the chubby guy that fought on that card? There was somebody who was on that card that was like

4 (29m 17s):
Trey Teleman? No, Trey Te, no. Scott Oz was really big. Trey Teleman was the guy who was missing. Part of

3 (29m 23s):
Sha

4 (29m 23s):
Was there was the two guys that Vitor fought in his debut. But that was earlier than that. That was 97. That was

3 (29m 28s):
Shaq was there. I remember he was already in Miami and I was like, I'm like, man, they don't know about the UFC down here.

4 (29m 34s):
Yeah. Shaq trained martial arts a long time ago. He started training a long time ago,

3 (29m 39s):
Bro. I didn't know he was from Newark and I didn't know all the good things he did for Newark. That's a bad motherfucker.

4 (29m 46s):
He's a good man.

3 (29m 47s):
I've gotten a whole new level of respect for what I heard he's done in Newark. Oh yeah. One of my friends in Newark cop, couple of 'em. And they were telling me, bro, it never ends.

4 (29m 55s):
Oh, that's great. Yeah,

3 (29m 56s):
He's, he gave a lot back to his fucking community.

4 (29m 59s):
He's very smart. I mean he's got a shit ton of businesses. He owns a bunch of businesses. He's always got something going on. You know, he stays active. You know, guy, there's, there's a bunch of guys that do a real good job of like using whatever fame they got from athletics and then just like do everything after Shaq does everything. He's always doing commercials. He's always doing. So, yeah, he's always doing, doing something. You know, that's a, that's a big human being. Dude. You put your hands, like you shake his hand. It's like,

3 (30m 30s):
That's a big

4 (30m 31s):
Dude. He's so big. His hands are like, it's like a fucking breakfast tray.

3 (30m 35s):
I never said nothing to him. I never spoke to him. I saw him at the store a couple nights. He would come to the store after the games for a Fat Tuesday. But I never really spoke to him or anything. I just

4 (30m 47s):
Saw him, I did Fear Factor with him.

3 (30m 49s):
Oh, that's right.

4 (30m 49s):
Yeah, me and him. It was hilarious. It was, it was like my, it was like a 6-year-old and his dad that is like me standing next to him and he's so big. He's so gigantic.

3 (31m 3s):
So what else is happening? My brother,

4 (31m 4s):
Everything's good, man.

3 (31m 5s):
You know they have those ERs by me, right? Do they,

4 (31m 8s):
The Russian ones. Ari goes those in the city. They

3 (31m 10s):
Have a beautiful one in Freehold. Yeah. And the fucking place has a restaurant to die for.

4 (31m 16s):
Really? Yeah. Like

3 (31m 17s):
Russian. Yeah. You could stay there all fucking day.

4 (31m 20s):
A Russian restaurant.

3 (31m 21s):
I think it's everything. Oh, okay. It's everything. You get beat up with the leafs, the steam, the fucking cold plunge. They got a pool. They massage you, they have lunch. You could just go there and write. You just wanna write jokes. You go up there, they have a cafe in there. It's really fucking sharp.

4 (31m 38s):
That's

3 (31m 38s):
Smart. I just not in the mood to get beat up with fucking leaves at this point in my life. Yeah. When I used to go to the YMCA in Hollywood, the good one, they were Russians in there in the mornings with the, with the hoods on. They wear the hoods to keep the heating and then have the vodka there. I did this 'cause I used to, I was so heavy. I was embarrassed to go any other time of the day. So I would go at 5, 4 45 and I would sit in the fucking er with them, whatever the steam bat. And then I would go on the other one, the sauna, the steam bat. And then I would swim. and I just swam more and more every day. This went on for about six months. One day I get there about 5:00 AM I open up the fucking door and there's a dude completely balls ass naked.

3 (32m 21s):
Nah. Laying with a Russian sit. Okay. Balls ass naked, just on a fucking towel. Dick out. Didn't give a frenchman's fuck. I sat there for about five minutes and all I kept thinking was, these Russians ain't gonna like it when they come in here. Sure enough, the fucking three Russians came in, they asked the guy to move. The dude didn't fucking move. and it was not good after that. Right. In the YMCA,

4 (32m 46s):
They beat his ass.

3 (32m 47s):
They fucking choked him and threw him out naked. They picked him up by his fucking neck right in front of me. I just kept walking. don don't want no dog. I, I can't be around that shit. I got, I'll go to jail for 20 years, Joe. They grabbed him by the fucking truck. They asked him one time, can we sit here? Then he let him sit, but he wouldn't put a towel on. Mm. That's what it was. Yeah. The guy had probably come from, from fucking freaky spot and was trying to get his dicks up in there and I walked out. And so all I heard was a couple thrums. And then I saw the sauna door open and a homie went flying out. Like one of those fucking crackheads.

4 (33m 23s):
Eddie Bravo and I used to work out at 24 Hour Fitness. And one of the managers, they had just brought him over from the West Hollywood place and he was giving me the war report from working in West Hollywood. He's like, it's basically a gay pickup spot. That's all it is.

3 (33m 37s):
The 24 Hour Fitness. Yeah. On Santa Monica next to the,

4 (33m 40s):
I don't even know if it's there anymore.

3 (33m 42s):
Oh, that'll be there forever.

4 (33m 44s):
But is it there? Yeah. Back

3 (33m 45s):
In the, that'll be there forever.

4 (33m 46s):
In the day. Back in the day in, when Eddie and I were working out together, this is like 2001, 2002, this manager was like, dude, it's crazy. He goes, there's just JZ all over the sauna. You go in the sauna, you gotta hose it down. There's just loads everywhere. These guys are just fucking each other everywhere. They find places to fuck. And they would go there to look for other buff guys to fuck I mean. And you imagine the problem with guys is there's no women. There's no one to go, Hey, this is ridiculous. I don't wanna get pregnant. What have you been up to? You know, are we gonna use protection? There's no voice of reason. It's just two guys you wanna fuck. I wanna fuck. Let's fuck. And they're, they're all jacked up, right?

4 (34m 27s):
So they're, they're probably doing testosterone and they're lifting a lot of weights and they've got high testosterone. They're horny all the time. They're taking drugs and they're just fucking each other at the gym. He said the gym was barely a gym. He goes, it's so weird to come here and it's a gym. He goes, that gym was just a front for a gay pickup spot. These guys were just, I'm sure they were working out too, but they were just banging. They were doing a lot of banging.

3 (34m 50s):
Listen bro, when you go through Boystown,

4 (34m 53s):
Oh yeah.

3 (34m 54s):
I think you had a bit about it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Before we left LA people have to understand that when you go through Boystown, you have one at the end. By the time you hit Dan Tan and you're about to hit, you have, you have two things on your mind. Either I love gay people or I can't stand these motherfuckers.

4 (35m 11s):
They're outta control.

3 (35m 13s):
And with my world, I love these motherfuckers. The best being, this just happened like six, seven years ago, six, five before the pandemic we're driving on Santa Monica, me and my wife we're going to eat at fucking Dantana's. We got an early reservation, right? Fucking, we had a light. There's a bar on the right hand side. UFC is on, two guys are fighting. But meanwhile there's a hundred guys with leather dancing to the UFC. And me and my wife just look at each other and go, God bless them. Yeah, God bless. That's what it is about Boystown. They got the run of it.

4 (35m 50s):
Well they also don't have to pretend. No. Right? No. Like they don't have to pretend they want something other than what they want. Whereas like there's a lot of men that they feel like to pick up women in a bar, they have to pretend to be something different. They have to act a little different. They're, they have to play to what the lady likes. Well these guys are just fucking,

3 (36m 9s):
They

4 (36m 9s):
Just fuck. They just fuck. Listen,

3 (36m 11s):
Christie Miller, remember Christie Miller from Sure. New York? She's in New York. Sure.

4 (36m 15s):
She's

3 (36m 47s):
And they'll fucking take care of you in there. and I'm like, really? I tell you, I went in there maybe for three or four months before I signed up at the Y. 'cause the Y told me, you're too fat, we can't have you here. Really? The first time I went to the Y, the

4 (36m 59s):
Y told you, you're too fat to work out

3 (37m 1s):
Dog. When I went to the Y, the first time I signed up for a consultant thing, like somebody for free to help with you. I didn't want to come to you guys. I was too embarrassed. I thought I was gonna die. I got on a fucking treadmill. I didn't even make 30 seconds on level two. Mm. And he goes, listen this, you gotta go out and walk. He goes, come back here. When you lose 50 pounds. He goes, right now you gotta walk. He goes, do you ever walk?

4 (37m 28s):
Right?

3 (37m 29s):
And I was like, yeah. You know, to the store, to the drug dealers, you know, to the Comedy store, you know? Yeah. You know. But no. And he goes, just walk. He goes, I want you to do what Doce does with the tap the mailboxes. Go for a walk and tap two mailboxes one day and then three the next

4 (37m 44s):
Whatever as far as you go. Yeah. So

3 (37m 46s):
Christie gave me that thing and I would go over there at night. I knew little things, you know, from lifting as a kid. But every time I was struggling over there, some fucking hot guy came over. Dang. And he would always go, excuse me, can I help you out? And he would talk to me and yeah, maybe they wanted to fuck me, but I doubt it. I was 418 pounds. Yeah. You had to fucking get a, a fucking crowbar to get to my asshole at that point. So I mean these guys were fucking dynamite drawer. I would love to sit here and tell you that they hit on me. Not one time. In fact, they were very helpful. Would they hit on me? They were setting me up. You know, they're wolves. Don't ever think. And that's what shocked us.

4 (43m 22s):
Alman was an

What a song. Gimme that Jamie. That dude What? That dude lived. You hear his voice like that. You only get

0 (44m 30s):
Yeah.

3 (44m 32s):
The thing about him is the reason I called Jelly that day. About three years ago, after I heard that one song, I called him and I go listen bro, you are bringing back something that this country has not heard in 30 years. All these type of songs like these singers, Greg Allman. Yeah, a couple of 'em. Even the dude from Leonard Skynyrd, the way they sang it was deep. You felt their years. You felt what they

4 (44m 56s):
Had gone through. Yeah.

3 (44m 58s):
And I think that's what Jelly brought back to us. Oh yeah. That's what he brought. That little piece. That's what he brought back. Yeah. That type of, you know, I still listen to a lot of Eater Peach Almonds and I still listen to Live from the fucking Beacon. Whatever the fuck theater they do all the time.

4 (45m 14s):
You know we have that Green Room playlist. Midnight Rider's the first song.

3 (45m 18s):
That's the fucking, yeah. That gets me here. That's

4 (45m 20s):
The first song. Sometimes I switch it up. Sometimes it's I'm Your Boogie Man. That's another one. Depends on how we're feeling. Joey depends on how we're feeling. That's

3 (45m 28s):
Casey. I Shine Back. Yeah.

4 (45m 29s):

He still touring? Gimme some volume too. I don't know man. But this is the song when we would walk into the arena, when we do arenas, when we walk into the arena, like as we're walking into the green room, I like to play. I'm Your Boogieman. 'cause that's one of those one that, just listen to this. You're walking in, the Joint gets fired up. The ice cubes go in the glass, the whiskey gets poured. Cheers. Music goes up, everybody gets ready. Shows about to start.

3 (46m 26s):
You know who was here last night?

4 (46m 27s):
Who?

3 (46m 28s):
Motherfucker. Nobody told me. Cool. And the gang was here last night.

4 (46m 32s):
No way. At

3 (46m 32s):
The Moody Fucking theater.

4 (46m 33s):
No way.

3 (46m 34s):
When I got to the hotel room, I looked at the menu and it said, yeah, entertainment for the Month. Fucking,

4 (46m 40s):
That was the thing that I didn't realize about moving here. I thought I was gonna miss out on like big artists, like big acts. But then when I got in, I'm like, oh, they all come to town. They all come here.

3 (46m 53s):
This is, they all gotta stop. They all

4 (46m 55s):
Come here.

3 (46m 55s):

4 (46m 58s):
Mark Curry. Remember our got Mark Curry? Fuck yeah. Mark Curry's the man.

3 (47m 2s):
Mark Curry's a sweeter. I just bumped into him.

4 (47m 5s):
Do you have his number?

3 (47m 6s):
No, I, I gotta get his number. I got him into the Haha. And then he was working a little at the store before the pandemic hit.

4 (47m 14s):
My man, Willie d reached out to me the other day and he said that he saw him. He said Mark Curry was on fire. Mark Curry was open enough for Kad. He said it was insane talk.

3 (47m 21s):
It's 40 years of standup. What do you expect?

4 (47m 23s):
Oh, mark was so

3 (47m 24s):
Underrated. Mark was always a

4 (47m 25s):
Killer. So underrated. So when we'd see him at the store, he was so polished. But you know what? He just made a ton of money off that show. I was like, eh, I'm good. I'm gonna chill.

3 (47m 35s):
He's a great guy too. Yeah.

4 (47m 37s):
The best nicest guy in the world.

3 (47m 38s):
Nicest guy in the world. Always great to young comics. Yes. When I walked in the store, he was always very nice. Great

4 (47m 43s):
To everybody. You didn't have to earn you, you know, a conversation with him. He'd talk to door people.

3 (47m 48s):
So Mark Curry is opening for Cal Road. Yeah.

4 (47m 51s):
Yeah. At least that show in Austin.

3 (47m 54s):
And did they do the Moody?

4 (47m 56s):
I don't know what he did. Did a big place though. Cat's killing it. It's like his, his ticket sales went up like 800%.

8 (48m 6s):
Why did the HEB

4 (48m 7s):
Center? HEB Center. Yeah. So they did the big place. That's that 15,000 seat place. Look at that. Come on son. Come on son. Let's go.

3 (48m 19s):
I always love Cat. I

4 (48m 20s):
Love Cat.

3 (48m 20s):
So I don don't know. He

4 (48m 21s):
Did that interview. He said he, I wouldn't have mine. I'm like, what you talking about? I have a, I'll have Yon. Let's go two

3 (48m 27s):
Times.

4 (48m 27s):
Anytime I have Yon two times. Whenever you want to come by, call me. Call me. I'll fuck you. I'll fire this place up at three in the morning for you. I'll wake up. I'm always into doing something. I think we're gonna get a studio downtown. I think I'm gonna get a studio in one of them. Penthouses with a View. So I could do nighttime podcasts like after the podcast or after the shows. Like say if we do a seven o'clock show at the mothership, Hey, let's just go fuck around. Let's go do a podcast for a couple hours. Like

3 (48m 54s):
When we do at the Ice House. Exactly. Those are great

4 (48m 57s):
Days. Those are great days. When Red Band had that cool studio right there at the Ice house

3 (49m 1s):
And I could go in and out

4 (49m 1s):
And we would go onto the stage on Ice House Chronicles. We had a good time.

3 (49m 5s):
I wonder what the Ice House looks like now.

4 (49m 7s):
It's supposed to be nice. Really nice. It's very cleaned up. A lot of guys don't like it 'cause they missed the dirt. I get it. You missed like it was an old club. It was the longest running club in the country. The Ice House was, yes. Ice House was the longest running standup Comedy club in the country. It was older than the store. Ice House existed before the store and it was, it was originally an actual ice house where people would go to get ice. And then it became like some sort of a rock and roll club. And then it became a Comedy club in the early seventies. Been in a Comedy club forever. The longest running Comedy club, even before the store.

3 (49m 46s):
It really was a gem.

4 (49m 48s):
Oh, it was

3 (49m 48s):
Amazing place. That club was a gem. And I'll tell you why. 'cause it just took you outta that whole la shit for an hour.

4 (49m 54s):
Exactly.

3 (49m 54s):
It took you out there. People

4 (49m 56s):
Put you out in regular people.

3 (49m 57s):
Those people in the little, in that big room that would come on Friday and Saturday. I don't know why anybody didn't take their specials there. A lot of guys did. They, they just come to laugh there. Yeah, they came prepared.

4 (50m 7s):
Good, good people. It was a good place to be. Good

3 (50m 10s):
Staff. That's what I miss about la The Armenians.

4 (50m 13s):
I

3 (50m 13s):
Don't, I, they're up north. See New Jersey's got a lot of Armenians, but up north. Yeah. So when I moved here, the Armenian would call me all the time and say, you want to buy a gun my friend, he'll see you. But when I went to my hometown, I had Armenians up there growing up. Not a lot of them, like this one wrestler kid. But when I went up there about five years ago, I noticed I have an Armenian church in North Bergen.

4 (50m 36s):
Oh yeah.

3 (50m 36s):
So I was like, yeah, they got 'em up here. They're everywhere. But I don't have 'em down by me. Not like

4 (50m 41s):
Glendale.

3 (50m 42s):
No. I miss them. Were

4 (50m 44s):
Out. You were out next to 'em.

3 (50m 45s):
Yeah, yeah. No, no. and I just became

4 (50m 47s):
The last Manly men.

3 (50m 48s):
Yeah. They're fucking outta their minds.

4 (50m 50s):
Unapologetically masculine men,

3 (50m 52s):
Dog. That was still to the day. My best drug dealer. I miss him. We still talk once in a while. He's still fucking nuts. He still, I, I don't know how these guys could do it. I mean I was there with him 20 years ago for him to still, and he's still at that race, at that pace. I'm sorry. He's not at the pace. Like I go out fly the Saturday. No, that's it. No, no. You know, now he just goes to Vegas for the week.

4 (51m 20s):
Oh boy.

3 (51m 21s):
Now he just goes to Vegas. A hundred Xanax, a couple ounces. Blow.

4 (51m 26s):
Do you think you could ever do a residency somewhere? Like a Vegas type deal? Yeah. Where people would come to see you? Yeah. The thing about living in Vegas, Joey is one, there's great, it's great tax benefits, but two, you don't live in Vegas? No. You live in, you live in like Henderson.

3 (51m 39s):
Henderson. Yeah.

4 (51m 39s):
Yeah. Or somewhere. Nice. People

3 (51m 41s):
Like

4 (51m 41s):
It. Henderson's nice. People like it. What's that other place? There's another area of Vegas that's real nice that's out further away. The lot of people live in where Red Rocks is. Where's Red Rocks? I don.

5 (51m 54s):
I was gonna say that, but that's not what it's called.

4 (51m 56s):
Red Rocks is nice

3 (51m 57s):
In Colorado?

4 (51m 59s):
No, no, no. Red Rock Casino. Oh, okay.

3 (52m 2s):
I'm sorry.

5 (52m 2s):
That might be what they call it. I

4 (52m 3s):
Guess the area. Red Rock. Yeah. I mean it's, that's a nice area. The park, that's where the titas of that club. Summerland Red Rock. That's, I saw Dana White Gamble in there and he was down $600,000 playing blackjack. I was like, you fucking psychopath. What are you doing? Because I knew he did that, but I never went with him to do it till this one time. These guys are all gambling. Taylor Luan lost $120,000 in the first five minutes. And I'm fucking shitting my pants. I I, I am getting anxiety and I can't watch this. It's, this is insane. Taylor won up winning. He, he, I think he was up 60 and he quit. And Dana wound up winning. Dana was down 600 and he wound up being up 600.

3 (52m 42s):
Dana's good at

4 (52m 43s):
Card. Oh, he is a wizard. He got kicked outta the palms back in the day. He won like $7 million one night. And they, they gave him the boot. They said, you banned.

3 (52m 52s):
Do you play cards? No.

4 (52m 54s):
I mean I did with my wife. I went with my wife with Whitney and Lex Friedman. We went to Vegas a while back during the pandemic, Whitney had a corporate gig. So it was like a, it was a, she did standup at some lady's house. So I went to this, this rich lady had this house in Vegas and Dana Carvey and Whitney Cummings and I introduced Whitney. 'cause I was just there and I was drunk. We just went from Andrew Schultz's wedding. So we went to Andrew Schultz's wedding in Montecito. We flew in a jet with Lex Friedman hammered out of his fucking mind. Whitney and my wife, we all went to Vegas for like the day, like, so we got there at like 9:00 PM The, the gig is at 10.

4 (53m 35s):
She, she does her gig and then we go out, we would go and play cards. and it was, it was, it was a hilarious night. Lex Friedman got a pushup contest with David Goggins. I called Goggins and said we were in town. Goggins met us there. We hung out with Goggins and his wife and we played a little bit of cards. But I, I'm not good at it.

3 (53m 52s):
Did you ever play poker with five guys? Nope.

4 (53m 55s):
Nope. Poker to me was always the thing that killed pool action. Because you can't miss when you're playing poker, you can win or lose. So if you're a gambling addict, there's a lot of guys, so like the thing about pool is making the shot is like the, the nine balls. It's like, it's eight to eight on a race to nine. You're shooting the nine ball for all the fucking marbles. And that's what I like. I like these high pressure moments. I like the, the difficulty of like performing under pressure and cards didn't have any of that, but it had the gambling. So all the gambling addicts were just addicted to gambling. They didn't wanna play pool anymore. They wanted to play cards.

4 (54m 35s):
So we'd have all these gin games, gin rummy games. These guys would be playing all these card games when you couldn't get any pool games. So to me I was like, this is not good. I don't like this.

3 (54m 45s):
I can never sit with five guys all night. Like, I knew people who played two, three days. I don't know. I can't do that. I'm not a game guy. Even Monopoly as a kid, once you started buying hotels, I'm done.

4 (54m 56s):
Poker is a very skillful game and I'm sure I would love it. It's just like

3 (55m 0s):
Golf. Golf. Yeah. I think I would love

4 (55m 1s):
It. Like golf to me, like my friend's husband, he plays professionally. He plays poker. He lives out here and he goes everywhere. He goes to these tournaments. There's these card places. This one out in Round Rock, that's this big fucking card card place. And you know, like high level guys go there and they play and they play tournaments and he makes money. Like he's a real poker player. Those guys, Ari was a real poker player. Ari could play. Ari lived in la. He played a lot of like real poker. But to me, you know how I am, I can't, I can't get into another thing. I'm too crazy. I get into another thing I'm playing, you know, I got into archery. I'm shooting arrows three hours a day. The only reason I can't do it more is my shoulder gives out. I get tired. Otherwise I'd be there.

4 (55m 41s):
All day, I'm a psychopath. And if you gimme something like poker where all I have to do is sit there and do this and I and I get better at it, I figure it out. I'll be doing that 12 hours a day. I can't do it. I'm too crazy.

3 (55m 52s):
I don't have time for that either. I don't have time. I never, I never, don don't even know how to play dice. Like street dice on the street. I don. I walked by games all the fucking time as a kid. I didn't. I'd stopped for two minutes, said hello, but I didn't play.

4 (56m 5s):
There was a 30% chance that someone was gonna get punched or shot. If there's ever a dice game, there's a 30% chance. I, I always thought that was like, this is like a high level of potential violent activity. 'cause people get mad, they lose, they think someone's cheating. Someone's got loaded dice. Someone says they bet this, but they didn't bet this. They bet that. And it's just like arguments and shit. And

3 (56m 26s):
Doug, I used to go to this place, not used to go. I went twice with a, a crazy friend of mine, Chris, you fuck 180 first street. There was a parking garage, maybe six floors you just pulled in. There was a guy standing there and all of a sudden he'd open up the door and you pulled into a, a car elevator that put your car up. The car brought you up to the sixth floor. You fucking come outta your car, you walk outta the elevator. Joe, you thought you were in fucking Vegas. Really? Everything was dark. Poker, blackjack, all that shit.

4 (56m 60s):
Ooh, those are exciting. Cocaine,

3 (57m 2s):
Hookers. There, there was hookers on site. People snorting on site twice. I went down like, this is too much for me. Wow. One time me and Chris, we drove a girl outta there that we grew up with. And then we all went to a hotel and snorted coke till the next day.

4 (57m 16s):
So how did they get away with that? Did they make a deal with the cops? They pay the cops off. What do they do? Probably

3 (57m 22s):
Probably

4 (57m 22s):
Get everybody to keep their mouth shut. You can't get everybody to keep shut. This

3 (57m 25s):
Is, this is shut 30 years ago. Right. So this is a different, different

4 (57m 28s):
World

3 (57m 28s):
Mindset. Yeah. It was up one 81st

4 (57m 31s):
And all the cops were dirty back then. Yeah. You would always find dirty cops back then.

3 (57m 35s):
Yeah. You know, I mean, but don don't know how they do it. They figure it out. You play, you have to pay like the, the battalion chief. You know, it's just paying somebody. You gotta pay somebody. You gotta pay 'em good money.

4 (57m 47s):
Yeah. You gotta give 'em a piece. So they have a, a vested interest in keeping the place open. See,

3 (57m 51s):
I knew people who had that, but they'd have moving locations, everything. So the cops could never get ahold of you. It's like when you book numbers on the phone. Yeah. We had to get a new apartment every three weeks. Not our, not a personal apartment. Right.

4 (58m 6s):
To to book out of. To

3 (58m 7s):
Book out of. Yeah. So I would get a, my mom would get a, an apartment and then she would get three different apartments out of that apartment so nobody could read what you're doing. Then a month later, next door, then a month later around the block, then you're back to that fucking building. That's hilarious. So you pretty much pay rent on it. All those years. Rent was cheap. Now you get fucking you.

4 (58m 27s):
Isn't it crazy how much underground gambling there was with bookies And the numbers? And the numbers was a big one.

3 (58m 33s):
Numbers is big. You know, underground casinos, I'm, I used to go with my buddy Martin Perez to this judo school. I never wanted to go. I used, I was more of a karate guy, but I would go with him and it was like this old fucking Japanese guy and this old Cuban dude and they would throw each other around. There was a Russian guy there. This is the seventies and up the corner there was a place where people would play cards and I found out my stepfather would go there. And one day I went to Juah. On the way out, as I was walking towards the bus on seventh Street, I saw unmarked cars. I saw like two unmarked cars. And when I got home that night, my stepdad was getting ready. I go, where you going? He goes, I'm going to play cards.

3 (59m 14s):
and I go. You going down to eighth Street? He goes, yeah. I go, don't go down there. He goes, why? I go, because I was down there with Martin and I saw the fucking two unmarked cars down there. And he goes, what the fuck do you know? I go, what do I know that since I've been fucking five, I've been wanting to be a lookout. He says, I'm five. That's my job. To look right. To keep my fucking eyes open. and I would just pick up shit like that. I would just pick up two unmarked cars. He didn't go. He thought about it and he goes, okay, if you saw him, I won't go. Sure enough, the next day I woke up, he gave me 50 bucks. He's like, dog, how the fuck did you know? 'cause I'm telling you, I fucking know.

4 (59m 50s):
They got raided. They didn't

3 (59m 52s):
Know in those days. Yeah. The cops would go early and they park like two blocks away. 'cause they're fucking lazy. Right. You know, if you're gonna raid somebody, stay the fuck away from there all goddamn day. Yeah. Then come in at night. Don't fucking lurk. All day. We know Second Goodfellas, they were following them all fucking day with a helicopter. Just bust them cocksucker.

4 (1h 0m 9s):
Yeah. Well they want to terrorize you before they get you.

3 (1h 0m 12s):
Well they wanna see what they want to see how you respond.

4 (1h 0m 15s):
Well, if you're cracked out, you're gonna go to try to get rid of something or you're gonna go to try to hide something. And

3 (1h 0m 21s):
They got your phone tapped. They got everything. So they put a cop car in front of your house to see where you react, to see how your reaction would be. Yeah. For the day. And then you start cleaning the house. You know, you call people, get everything outta your house, whatever the fuck it is. And then they come in and you know, but it's a different world out there now. So don don't know nothing about that fucking world

4 (1h 0m 41s):
Now. Yeah. It's a

3 (1h 0m 42s):
Different world. and I don't wanna know. Yeah. Because now they'll shoot you just for being there. And that is, you know,

4 (1h 0m 48s):
It's a different world in terms of law enforcement too. Yeah. People getting outta jail like that now.

3 (1h 0m 53s):
And they still won't drop my warrant in fucking Seattle.

4 (1h 0m 57s):
You can't even get arrested in Seattle for what you did. You wouldn't even have a record.

3 (1h 1m 1s):
You cannot fuck. You could hit somebody with a stick and be out that afternoon. Yeah.

4 (1h 1m 6s):
You wouldn't have a record in Seattle

3 (1h 1m 7s):
Dog. They, I'm still going back and forth with these motherfuckers. That's why I look before. Because

4 (1h 1m 11s):
You still can't get your Your passport. No

3 (1h 1m 14s):
Passport. No. I just sent them the last day.

4 (1h 1m 16s):
If you get a passport and we go overseas, when we do gigs overseas, you will get a passport. Yes. We'll do this When you do this, we're gonna have to fucking fly in a day early. We're gonna make it so, because don don't know if you're even gonna be able to get in and over there. It might, it might be a hard time once you land

3 (1h 1m 31s):
Where?

4 (1h 1m 32s):
Anywhere. UK. Anywhere. Dog. Canada's a big one. Canada's not,

3 (1h 1m 36s):
Canada's not gonna take me. We're not gonna go to Canada. and I love Canadians. I got none against Canadian. But it's the way the country works. They won't let the nicest guy we know has got a DUI and he can't get into Canada. Yeah. But that you could pay a tax like Snoop Dogg. So you're telling me Snoop Dogg can't play Canada. There's a tax you could pay little heavy and then you get out. It's like everybody else, we could all settle this with an envelope.

4 (1h 1m 59s):
Well you get an, they get an envelope anyway when you do a gig in Canada. Yeah. You get a big tax envelope. You get that in the UK too. Do you do a gig in the uk? You you're paying,

3 (1h 2m 9s):
Lemme tell you something. Before nine 11, I was going up to Toronto two times a year. Okay. I had all these criminal charges, no warrants or anything. my friend from the Miami Improv dated a girl from Buffalo and he called her father to pick me up at the Buffalo Airport, take me to his house and then cross me over the border. Before nine 11 there was a casino they go to.

4 (1h 2m 33s):
Mm. And you

3 (1h 2m 34s):
Just drove in. Right. And there was no Id, no nothing. And he would drive me to Toronto. He would drive me to Ontario and I'd take the bus to Toronto and do the two weeks and then come back. But on the way back, I would come on the bus. I would drive those motherfuckers crazy dog. When I give 'em my license, they'd start look at me and they'd go, when did you come in here and I go? Last week you were the guy that was working. They would say, no I wasn't. I would've never let you come through. Well you let me the fuck out now

4 (1h 3m 6s):
'cause of your record. Yeah.

3 (1h 3m 7s):
They would hold me for like 10 minutes. Like how did you get into this country? Ah.

4 (1h 3m 11s):
I'm like, I'm fucking bus

3 (1h 3m 12s):
You guys let me in last week. No, it was a mistake. We could have never let you in dog. I would fuck with them all the time. I tried to do that cute shit during nine 11. They yanked me. Right. The fuck outta there. Yeah. We're not taking this shit. But to answer your question from before my plan is this. I'm doing 10 spots. Okay. I am up to number three. Okay. When I do my 10 spots, I'm gonna decide what I want to do. I'm not gonna travel no more. I'm not gonna get on fucking planes. That was brutal last night. That was brutal. Three and a half hours on a flight for me. I can't do that now. Really? Yeah. I'm good for like an hour and a half. I went to Nashville on JSX, the private plane, the semi-private 30 people on Tremendous.

3 (1h 3m 54s):
I recommend that to anybody if you don't like terminals. I fucking loved it. But they don't fly to Austin yet. They fly to Dallas. And you have to connect to Austin. My plan is this. Start doing some sets at the stand. Start going over and seeing Chrism at the Gotham Comedy Club. Do a couple of those. And when I'm feeling like I got 45 minutes, I'm gonna take a residency somewhere.

4 (1h 4m 15s):
Where do you think you're gonna go?

3 (1h 4m 17s):
AC or Parks Casino.

4 (1h 4m 20s):
Where's Parks?

3 (1h 4m 20s):
Philadelphia.

4 (1h 4m 21s):
Mm.

3 (1h 4m 24s):
I have no problems in Philadelphia.

4 (1h 4m 25s):
Philadelphia's great.

3 (1h 4m 26s):
Nobody's gonna ever walk outta my showroom. Philadelphia.

4 (1h 4m 29s):
No. They're fun. Yeah.

3 (1h 4m 31s):
Nobody will ever walk outta my shows in Philadelphia. Insulted.

4 (1h 4m 35s):
No.

3 (1h 4m 35s):
Nobody will get their feelings hurt if I say a joke that, you know, I'm on the spectrum. Somebody's not gonna cry after the show and say that their nephew's on the spectrum and the show hurt their feelings. Philly, that's never gonna happen.

4 (1h 4m 50s):
Animals.

3 (1h 4m 52s):
Animals and Atlantic City

4 (1h 4m 54s):
Animals. That's

3 (1h 4m 55s):
Never gonna

4 (1h 4m 55s):
Happen. Same people, animals. Same people. South Jersey

3 (1h 4m 58s):
People. That's why I belong. Yeah. That's why I belong.

4 (1h 5m 1s):
Yeah, you could easily do a residency. I

3 (1h 5m 2s):
Would love to tell you I'm gonna put a tuxedo on and go to Vegas, sing a couple songs and then talk and do an hour of material. I would love to tell you you

4 (1h 5m 10s):
Don't wanna fly. No, I get it. Do you think he'd ever live anywhere other than Jersey?

3 (1h 5m 18s):
Yes.

4 (1h 5m 18s):
Because if you lived in Vegas, you could do a a residence there. Listen,

3 (1h 5m 22s):
We're not fucking crazy here. That's a tough, tough state to retire to in Jersey. Do you know what I'm saying? It's not cheap, bro.

4 (1h 5m 32s):
Jersey's not cheap. It's not fucking

3 (1h 5m 33s):
Cheap,

4 (1h 5m 34s):
Bro. Jersey's

3 (1h 5m 35s):
Expensive. And that's why everybody from Jersey flies to fucking Florida. You know, I like to lean towards Nashville.

4 (1h 5m 41s):
Nashville's nice

3 (1h 5m 43s):
Outside of Nashville. Like get like, you know. Yeah. Something. and it, bro, right now you can pick up a house in Nashville for nothing. Well the ones I saw over the holidays, brand new. Not much Joe. You know, because it's gonna be just a spare house. It's just a property to retire it. Right. If I turn 65, you know how much money I'll save by having a Tennessee address by living in Tennessee. A lot. A lot. They don't tax your pension. Yeah, don't tax much, man.

4 (1h 6m 10s):
I've read about Dubai. See if this is true. Dubai, there's no tax, there's no income tax. None at all. They just have so much money. They're like, don, don't need your

3 (1h 6m 21s):
Money. Don't worry about it Next

4 (1h 6m 22s):
Year. And everything's clean. my friend will went over there, he moved over there. He said to, he goes, don, don't want get shot in America. He goes, I could live like in co be completely safe in Dubai. UAE does not levy income tax on individuals. However, it levies a 5% value added tax on purchases of goods and services levied at each stage of the supply chain. And ultimately born by the end consumer. That's not, yeah, but that's okay. If you know what that is. That's a big difference between that and income tax. Income tax is weird 'cause you don't get any say in where it goes. And when you see what's going on with Ukraine, you see what's going on with Israel. You see what's going on with all the different shit that the bidet administration spends money on.

4 (1h 7m 5s):
All the money they're giving to illegal immigrates that are coming into the country. All, all the money they're given for programs that are ridiculous. That's your money. And you don't have any say you, you can't argue about it. It's not, there's not in competition. So there's not a better company that's gonna come along and take care of the taxes in a better way. More efficient. There's no incentive to do it Better. This fuck you give me the money.

3 (1h 7m 30s):
We're not giving Ukraine any more money. Right? We're

4 (1h 7m 32s):
Giving 'em a lot more money. Yeah. That was one of the things that they were arguing about, that they have to do both. They were, they wanted the Ukraine budget to be lumped into the border fixing budget. Joey. It's

3 (1h 7m 45s):
Wild. That fucking border him. It's a

4 (1h 7m 47s):
Wild thing. It's a wild thing

3 (1h 7m 49s):
To do that bored him with Abbott is doing down there, telling those motherfuckers to step off and shit. and

4 (1h 7m 57s):
I met Abbott a few times. He's a good man. I like that guy a lot. You know the sending the buses filled with immigrants to the sanctuary cities is such a crazy move. s like, fuck you. You take care of 'em. You're just letting them in. Your policies are letting them in. You're encouraging people to go there, there. 'cause you're a sanctuary city. Good. We'll help you out. We'll help you out. We'll, we'll bring 'em right to you. And now the same politicians that we're running on this platform, this mystery, it's a fantasy platform. This is a fantasy. Like, come here, we'll accept you all. And let's say like the governor now, she's like, that's enough. No more. You can't come here. Go somewhere else. Go somewhere else.

4 (1h 8m 38s):
What does that mean? Go where they're already here. There's too many, there's millions. You guys have let millions in. There's more illegal immigrants over the last few years than our legal residents in like five states. If you put together like Idaho, Wyoming, you know, like them, them weird states with low populations. What's the number of illegal immigrants that have entered into this country over the last four years? Let's guess what do you think? It's

10 (1h 9m 10s):
Millions.

4 (1h 9m 11s):
Yeah, a hundred percent.

10 (1h 9m 13s):
Millions.

4 (1h 9m 14s):
10 million. Maybe 12. Maybe

10 (1h 9m 17s):
12.

4 (1h 9m 18s):
What do you think it has changed? I saw

10 (1h 9m 19s):
Those fucking lines

4 (1h 9m 20s):
Of people They don't even know, by the way. They're just guessing. They're just guessing. They're just guessing. They're not counting 'em all.

5 (1h 9m 25s):
Don don't know how to find that number. Even

4 (1h 9m 27s):
Just try to Google it. No, I get,

5 (1h 9m 28s):
I, I've tried this before. You can't, I don't know how to differentiate illegal versus legal and I. They don't really tell you either because they have to figure it out themselves. So you're allowed to cross.

4 (1h 9m 39s):
But they're trying to make everybody legal. That's part of the hustle. The hustle is make everybody documented. See,

5 (1h 9m 44s):
When I typed in illegal immigrants entering us 2023, this is what it says. It says there's arrivals of migrants without prior authorization. Which I guess that tech don don't, I don't know if that's even illegal. You know, don don't know.

4 (1h 9m 57s):
So in one year, arrival of ports of entry migrants, but that's ports of entry. That's not like coming through the border. Right?

5 (1h 10m 4s):
That's,

4 (1h 10m 4s):
I don't know, coming through the border. That's

5 (1h 10m 6s):
Like doing a homeless count in.

4 (1h 10m 7s):
How do you really know? Right? Why don't you Google this? How many illegal immigrants sneak through the border? Just Google that.

5 (1h 10m 13s):
How would you know that? I

4 (1h 10m 14s):
Don't know. Google it. How many, how many illegal immigrants? don? Don't think, but just do it in my language. Do it. How many illegal immigrants sneak through the border? Write that sneak, sneak

5 (1h 10m 28s):
Or stack

4 (1h 10m 28s):
Sneak, sneak, sneak through the border. Let's see what's up. Record numbers. Okay, this is real recent. December, 2020 fourth. Click on that. What's it say?

5 (1h 10m 42s):
It said something 50,000, but I don't It still is like

4 (1h 10m 46s):
How many per day?

5 (1h 10m 47s):
I don't know.

4 (1h 10m 48s):
50 th No, it can't be that much, is it? That's crazy.

5 (1h 10m 53s):
I'm not gonna see that number now.

4 (1h 10m 55s):
Does it say okay before I, oh, what happened? There was a number. There it goes. Okay. In just the last five days, border patrol processed nearly 50,000 miles. Whoa. Five days. Who entered the US illegally with daily apprehension surpassing 10,000 th rice up from the 6,400 average last month court of federal data obtained by CBS news. Roughly 1,500 immigrants are being processed each day at official border crossings under the bidet program powered by a phone app. But

5 (1h 11m 29s):
That's not sneaking across, that's why I was like, that's not answering the question you asked.

4 (1h 11m 32s):
It says, but they are, it says entering the US illegally.

5 (1h 11m 36s):
But they're processed. Right. So it's not

4 (1h 11m 37s):
Sneaking. Right. But they still made it across illegally. They entered in illegally. That's just what I'm saying. I'm, I'm saying sneaking in. But that's really what it's, they're processing anybody, but they're just letting them go. This is what's crazy. They're processing you, but it's bullshit. They don't, they don't sell. You have to go back. There's no going back. You go in and they give you a phone. They give you money.

3 (1h 11m 57s):
A phone.

4 (1h 11m 58s):
Yeah. Some places they're giving people phones. And so if it's, let's say if it's, go back to that past 10,000, it's a past 10,000 th rice. So let's just say it's 50,000. So 10,000 a day. If it's 10,000 a day daily, let's, that's the high end. Let's assume that they're not counting 'em all and a lot of 'em sneak through 10,000. That's 3,650,000 a year.

9 (1h 12m 29s):
That's a lot.

3 (1h 12m 31s):
Now how am IS you know, when I read all this shit that's a lot and I lot and I, all this shit. How am I supposed to feel

4 (1h 12m 35s):
If it really is 10,000 a day? That is fucking bananas.

3 (1h 12m 40s):
But think about it. How am I supposed to feel? I'm gonna immigrant.

4 (1h 12m 43s):
How am I supposed to feel? I, yeah,

3 (1h 12m 45s):
I gotta hear this shit All day long and I feel terrible about this shit. I would do it. But do you see the lines of the people that are fucking coming

4 (1h 12m 51s):
Through? It's nuts.

3 (1h 12m 52s):
And you know, listen, I don't know if a lot of people know this shit. Sanitation, police, all this shit in New York, there's no overtime because all that budget has gone to the migrants. Yeah. And the migrants are not happy. No. They they're losing their fucking mind.

4 (1h 13m 7s):
Well, they thought they were gonna get jobs. Yeah. Not enough. They were told they're gonna get jobs. They're trying to start families. There's nothing there for now. They homeless.

3 (1h 13m 13s):
Nothing. And

4 (1h 13m 13s):
You know, why do we come out here to be homeless?

3 (1h 13m 15s):
These sanctuary cities? No, I don't even know. New York City's a sanctuary city. Yes. Okay. Whoever made that didn't check with the people. No. You know what I'm saying? Like whoever said, we're in sanctuary city in New York City didn't check with the people in the community.

4 (1h 13m 29s):
Well, you know what it is. It's just letting everybody know you're not racist. You, you're not racist. You have no problem with immigrants. We're

3 (1h 13m 35s):
Not racist.

4 (1h 13m 36s):
We're not, of course

3 (1h 13m 37s):
We're not racist. But I see that my friend who's got two children that depends on overtime from the sanitation department, can't get it. He's a supervisor. He lost thousands in fucking salaries because

4 (1h 13m 50s):
It's all going to this

3 (1h 13m 51s):
To the migrant phase and cops no overtime. You know, so this is what this is doing. You know, and this just isn't New York. It's gotta be in all big cities.

4 (1h 13m 60s):
Chicago has a big problem with it.

3 (1h 14m 1s):
Texas, Houston, you know, and what comes from this? You don't know. Again, we're going back to the Elle thing. I don't know who the fuck is coming in. Yeah. don don't know if they raped 22 women. I don't know if they raped 22 boys. Yeah. don don't know if they're perfect fucking citizens. Right? We don't know these things. We don't know. So we're, you know, this was just something, listen, when I think of politics, I don't get involved Joe Rogan because it scares me. The only thing that doesn't scare me is how a man, how a man could have 20,000 indictments and still lead the presidential fucking in our country. This is why America's America, how can fucking somebody have 92 fucking indictments?

3 (1h 14m 43s):
He's in New York yelling yesterday. Yeah. But he still has 50% of the fucking country on lockdown. Right? Isn't that like a he has, he's beating Nikki Haley and

4 (1h 14m 52s):
The other guy. Yeah, he, well 'cause it appears that they're, they're prosecuting him for political purposes.

3 (1h 14m 57s):
Yes, they are. I mean I'm not a political guy. And I'm telling you, they're just throwing, they just keep fucking throwing things at this court guy.

4 (1h 15m 3s):
They're throwing things at him also that don't make sense. Like we talked about the Mar-a-Lago thing a bunch of times where they tried to say that he overvalued Mar-a-Lago. And the the judge said it's worth 18 million. Nobody thinks that. No, nobody thinks that. There's not a fucking human alive that thinks that place is only worth 18 million.

3 (1h 15m 18s):
Did you see her raise his hand this week? Who? Sammy the bull. What'd

4 (1h 15m 21s):
He say?

3 (1h 15m 21s):
Talking about fucking Trump. He's great. We can, we can never corrupt him. The mafia could never, the

4 (1h 15m 29s):
Italians love Trump. Who? The Italians. They love

3 (1h 15m 31s):
Trump. He's uncorruptible. He was saying it the other day. I'm like sitting there scratching my head going, fucking Sammy's a Savage. Yeah, he's a Savage.

4 (1h 15m 39s):
Yeah. This, this is a strange time because there's people that's trying to paint everybody that's supporting Trump as being a white supremacist or a racist or an an anti-immigration person or anti-human rights person. You wanna vote in a dictator. They're trying to say the most ridiculous versions of what most of it is. 'cause what most of it is, is people that are fed up, they're fed up with the open border, they're fed up with the increasing government scrutiny on things like social media. They're fed up with the influence that big companies have over the things you do and don't do in this country. They're fed up with us being in these fucking wars, constantly being involved in wars.

4 (1h 16m 22s):
And they know that Trump was one of the few guys that when he was in office, we didn't get into more wars. We didn't, you know, we, he actually, they did do a, a great job of stopping isis. They did a lot of things with the economy that seemed to been working. I'm not an economist. I'm not the guy to have this conversation with. You know, if you want to like talk about policies and what's effective, it's not effective. I'll tell you what's not effective. What's going on right now. What's going on right now is not good. And you wanna continue this, you're outta your fucking mind. You look at the just sheer raw numbers of dollars that we sent to other countries this year that you have to realize that if you wanted the country to be better, you would've spent that money here on us.

4 (1h 17m 3s):
And if you spent that money on us, and it stays in America, you got American jobs to make American cities better, you could have done a fucking substantial amount of rebuilding American cities with $170 billion. There's so much they could have done that could have elevated so many lives. And they didn't do any of that. We're

3 (1h 17m 26s):
Just talking about it. Buffalo. Yeah. Cleveland, Pittsburgh, yeah. All these cities up north, New York and all that. They need a boost up there, man. They

4 (1h 17m 34s):
Need something, man.

3 (1h 17m 34s):
Cleveland needs a boost. I went to Pittsburgh last year after the pandemic. Half the fucking town was closed. Brother. Yeah. Places had closed down. I'm like, come on, something close. Like a good restaurant closed down. How can they close down? Like,

4 (1h 17m 48s):
Think about the impact of you can't have any business for three years, no business. It's over. I mean. Tony Tiff's dad lost his restaurant. He had his, Tony Tiff's dad had a restaurant in Youngstown, Ohio for like 25 fucking years. And he couldn't, you know, he is getting by. He was getting by. He's doing well. Getting by, making money. Good restaurant. Like real Italian food. Fucking goes under, you know, it's like God damnit, you know, you didn't even give people the option of what they wanted to do. And you were wrong. And no one is punished for it. They were wrong. They shouldn't have had us locked down for that long. They were wrong. None of that shit made sense. All that six foot social distancing fauci now admits it's all bullshit.

4 (1h 18m 29s):
They just came up with that number. People just started saying that number. Remember those stupid stickers on the ground at the bank? You had a sticker. You weren't allowed to like stand here. And then the other person has to say six feet in front of you and you stand there. You're not allowed to get close. It's all nonsense. It was all nonsense. And they scared the fuck outta people. And they kept businesses closed. And they, they closed restaurants in Los Angeles. They closed outdoor dining just because of the optics of it. Because Covid started to surge. There was no evidence at all that it was causing outdoor transmission. And they close those fucking things down. They shouldn't be allowed to have that kind of power over whether or not you can make a living and the choices that you make.

4 (1h 19m 10s):
'cause they are just human beings too. And not only are they often uninformed, they're often misinformed. They're often absolutely victims of some sort of corporate propaganda that they've been used as a mouthpiece to promote. And they're affecting these people that have worked their whole lives for 20, 30 years. And it's such a selfish, shitty, fucked up way to run a city and a selfish, shitty, fucked up way to run a country. And you didn't listen to all the experts and you didn't take into consideration people's health, mental health from losing their jobs. How many people would've been fine? How many people need this fucking medicine that you're trying to push on 'em and how many don't? And who's making the money off of it?

4 (1h 19m 52s):
The whole thing was insane. and it was right in front of your face. Because we live in 2024 and the fucking internet is everywhere. You can't run these giant scams like this where you're just fucking over the whole country without everybody just being able to piece it together at the end of the scam and go, well now we know how they do it. Look at they all were working in cahoots together. They were literally paying media companies to shame people that were anti-vaccine. The government was involved in censoring social media posts, wild shit, Joey, wild shit. So to, for people to go through all that and lose their business and be on the other side. And then Trump comes along and he's like, that's enough.

4 (1h 20m 36s):
You can't just label all those people's white supremacists. You can't label all those fucking people as hateful bigots. 'cause that's not what it is. They don't want any more of this. They're tired of this nonsense that you're shoving down people's faces. They're tired of it. So that doesn't mean that they're evil. And this narrative is stupid. This narrative that, that everyone on the other side that disagrees with you, it doesn't see this. They're fundamental problems with the way things are being run right now. Everyone is hateful. Everyone supports a dictator. You guys are outta your fucking minds.

3 (1h 21m 13s):
And then we got Cuba and they're dying a starvation still. So what

4 (1h 21m 17s):
Are they doing now that Castro's dead is his son running it? Who's, who's running Cuba? They're not having elections. No elections. They should bring back the mob. That's when it was running smooth.

3 (1h 21m 26s):
Don't even have a fucking paper. That's

4 (1h 21m 28s):
When it was running. Smooth shit, man. They used to love going, people used to love going to Cuba. It used to be the place to go. They had gambling there. They would go in s like famous people used to go to Cuba before the revolution, right?

3 (1h 21m 42s):
Like what's the, what's the guy's, Kennedy, what's the guy's name you introduced me to today? He owns a company. Really nice sweet guy.

4 (1h 21m 48s):
Oh, Brigham from waste Towell. Yeah. Yeah.

3 (1h 21m 51s):
Me and him had a tremendous convers, 'cause he went, he went to Cuba and he had to get a visa as a student to something and he was blown the fuck away. But he was more blown away about going into those ballasts and those casinos. And they still have pictures of the people sitting where you were, you know, Sinatra and fucking Brando and Rock Hudson and all these, you know, we don't even know. We don't even know how like, how many planes would go down there a day with fucking people from here. It was amazing.

4 (1h 22m 22s):
I'll tell you one thing. You ask a Cuban in Miami who they're voting for you. You gonna get a red

3 (1h 22m 31s):
Wave

4 (1h 22m 32s):
Son? You wanna talk about people that vote Republican? You wanna talk about people that don't wanna hear no bullshit about socialism? Shut the fuck up. Cubans will yell at you if you wanna talk that nonsense. Woke hippie shit about Marxism, they will fucking yell

3 (1h 22m 48s):
At you dog. That is not the type of shit to talk about those people. Whoa.

4 (1h 22m 50s):
Those people have actually felt it, Dion, that they escaped it

3 (1h 22m 54s):
Beyond that. I'm sitting there Joe, and they're talking about Trump on something, CNN or something. and I had to stop and go. I could just imagine what Cubans in Miami are saying in Spanish. It is fucking hilarious. Yeah. You know they love Trump. Yeah,

4 (1h 23m 9s):
They love, they

3 (1h 23m 9s):
Love Trump. 'cause I just spoke to like a cousin of mine and he's like, you know, and I'm like, oh my God,

4 (1h 23m 15s):
They love Republicans,

3 (1h 23m 16s):
They love Trump. And this guy, I could just imagine them going, oh, and get by.

4 (1h 23m 22s):
Yeah.

3 (1h 23m 22s):
And get for a Cuban. They fucking love that shit. What I just said was, what other country tell me what other country can you have 30 indictments and still be fucking president of the United States? Oh yeah.

4 (1h 23m 44s):
That's it. It's only one I mean, maybe there's another country that could go.

3 (1h 23m 47s):
If you don't gimme that fucking can. I'm gonna stab you soon. Why open it? Because you keep, are you trying to open it? No, no, no. I can open. Oh my God. I'm like, no,

4 (1h 23m 55s):
My God, I can open it like that. Okay.

3 (1h 23m 56s):
I'm like, what

4 (1h 23m 56s):
The fuck? No, I'm just playing with it. Sorry, you thought I was struggling with it? I'm like, oh, that's hilarious.

3 (1h 24m 2s):
Now what is that?

4 (1h 24m 2s):
No, no, no. It's nicotine pouch.

3 (1h 24m 4s):
They good?

4 (1h 24m 5s):
Oh yeah, they're good. You want

3 (1h 24m 6s):
One? What flavor?

4 (1h 24m 7s):
This is spearmint.

3 (1h 24m 8s):
Am I gonna fucking get dizzy?

4 (1h 24m 9s):
Don't you? No. You get a little excited. Check this. Put that motherfucker in between your cheek and gum. That's six milligrams. You can handle it. Oh no. Take it in. Take it this side. There you go. Let's go. Joey.

3 (1h 24m 22s):
Woo. Right?

4 (1h 24m 23s):
Like right away you're like, Jesus. Yeah. The, the whole presidential election. The thing that scares me is if, if, if the Democrats stay in power and bidet stays in power, if you have the same administration, we're, we're headed in the same exact direction as we are right now. And if Trump gets into office, then people are gonna freak the fuck out. And then there's probably gonna be riots. There's probably gonna be some craziness, probably gonna be violence, probably gonna be organized stuff too. There's probably going to be nefarious groups that organize people to start civil unrest. That's a real thing. You know, whatever those groups are, whoever you wanna call 'em, that's a real thing.

4 (1h 25m 4s):
Whether it's Antifa, whatever you wanna say. Groups of human beings that will purposely start civil unrest in order to push a narrative about a political movement that the people are tired of Trump. They're evil. You know, they're hateful. You know what Jim Brewer has a fucking great bit about the women's march. He goes, remember when Trump was in office? The women's march every, the women's march? He goes, yeah, you knew who a woman was then. Isn't that a great joke? That's only 2016. 2016. He gets in the office, there's this giant women's march and now no one can tell you what a woman is. If you got a giant women's march today, be half guys.

4 (1h 25m 44s):
And you can't say, shit, there's, there's your sisterhoods. And then they'll, they'll hold an election that men will win. 'cause they're more aggressive. Then you got a man running a women's organization who says it's a woman.

3 (1h 25m 56s):
The crazy fucking world,

4 (1h 25m 57s):
Bro. You ever see this video? There's this lady in Chicago and this guy is trying to use the women's room and she's going in there with her daughter. And this guy has a full beard, just a full beard. And she's yelling at him. She's like, you are our whole, you are a whole man. And he is like, I am a woman. And like big deep breath. Like deep voice, big husky guy with the fucking beard. It's like, it's like, what the fuck man? Like what the fuck is this really? Is this, is this being kind? Is that what this is? Is this being open-minded and compassionate? Or is this opening the door to fucking psychopath? This is it. Yeah. Click this. Look at this.

4 (1h 26m 37s):
This

11 (1h 26m 37s):
Is don't get in my face. Do not get in my face. Don't get in my face. Don't in

4 (1h 26m 42s):
Face. What size that dude don't see

11 (1h 26m 43s):
My daughter right here. You know? No, no. You need to go over there to the meeting. You need to go over there to the meeting. Only here in Chicago. You is a man. A whole grown man. Grown for the last time. I'm not mad. I'm sorry, don. Don't know

4 (1h 26m 57s):
What Well you see this guy, this guy's a big dude. Yeah, he is with a beard.

11 (1h 27m 2s):
On my worst day. Okay, good luck. Good luck. Y'all have a problem with me using the bathroom? Good luck. Hey man, use another bathroom. Excuse me. Just

12 (1h 27m 11s):
Use another bathroom. There's a child in there.

11 (1h 27m 14s):
What? Man,

12 (1h 27m 15s):
That's a child. Just say

11 (1h 27m 17s):
What you,

12 (1h 27m 17s):
Huh? That's a child in there. A little girl. Like who's the men's bathroom? Okay,

11 (1h 27m 22s):
I'm a woman. What does it matter? What does it matter? That business. I need to mind your business. This is her world is coming to some type I. don know what

4 (1h 27m 32s):
That, that's a real thing. Now the people that want to deny that, that's a real thing. You are doing a disservice for everyone. You're doing a disservice to all the innocent women that have to go into those bathrooms and don't feel safe. And you're doing a disservice to real trans people. There's a, there's gonna be a bunch of people that game your system and there's gonna be a bunch of perverts with fucking beards who want to go where the little girls are shitting. People are out of their minds. There's a certain percentage of people that are outta their fucking minds. It doesn't mean that all trans people are bad. It doesn't mean that all trans people are outta their minds. It means that you have to know what's crazy and what's not. And that's fucking crazy.

4 (1h 28m 14s):
That's crazy. That's a mentally ill person with a fucking beard trying to get into a bathroom when a mother and her daughter are in there. That's crazy. I'm

3 (1h 28m 28s):
Surprised the cops weren't called.

4 (1h 28m 29s):
Well it's Chica Chicago, right? What happens and

3 (1h 28m 32s):
What happens if the cops come? Now what happens in that situation? If the cops come? There was no assault

4 (1h 28m 37s):
Shit. If that was in San Francisco, they might arrest that lady. They might arrest her for being a bigot. Who fucking knows man? It's Narnia out there. It's a fantasy world. People have lost their fucking mind. and I think it's engineered. I think that China has been toing these fucking people into a coma. I think all those little videos where, you know, trans awareness and you know, and maybe you're trans and there are no genders, just a hundred. And then psychos like that guy now think that the culture has moved to the point where they can kind of get away with it.

4 (1h 29m 16s):
Maybe the culture has changed their opinion on things. I think I can get away with this. I think I can wear my full beard with my dick out and and go around women and there's gonna be guys like that. Just like there's real trans people. There's gonna be guys that are crazy that take advantage of this thing that I think has been at least, at least partially engineered by other countries. I think the algorithm supporting that and pushing that out to people, people are super easily influenced, man. Super easily influenced. And if you make it this thing where you just have to accept everything that ha happens to be trans, everything is fine. As long as you call it trans. Well then what about perverts? Don't you think perverts are gonna game that system?

4 (1h 29m 58s):
This is a Willy Wonka golden ticket for perverts. That's what it is.

3 (1h 30m 2s):
Wasn't there a fucking Ted talk a couple years ago about some chicks saying that we need pedophiles?

5 (1h 30m 7s):
I'm looking through comments on this saying that this video we just watched is satire.

4 (1h 30m 12s):
Really?

5 (1h 30m 12s):
Yeah. I've seen other videos like this where there are people that, there's a don don't know who they are, but there are groups of people that will make videos like this that make them seem real and then

4 (1h 30m 21s):
Put them on Facebook, Instagram. God, that lady's a great actress.

5 (1h 30m 23s):
I don't, I'm not saying it is, but I'm looking at a lot of comments on TikTok saying this is staged, this is fake.

4 (1h 30m 28s):
Well they might be right, but that lady, if that's true, that lady's a fucking great actress. 'cause that lady really did seem like someone who was very flustered and was trying to protect her daughter.

3 (1h 30m 39s):
Yes she was.

4 (1h 30m 40s):
And if it is satire and you use that daughter, that girl was a really good actress too. 'cause she looked like a girl would respond if a fucking grown man was trying to get in the bathroom and her mother was fighting with this grown man like she was frozen. So that, if that's true, if that is fake, they're really good actors.

3 (1h 30m 58s):
I'll tell you, when I knew the world was going crazy, weight Watchers is offering fucking those shots.

4 (1h 31m 6s):
Oh, is that fake big

3 (1h 31m 7s):
Shots? Yeah. Yeah.

4 (1h 31m 8s):
Well there's a lot of money in those shots. Joey Diaz. I don't know if you know that.

3 (1h 31m 13s):
No, I didn't. Oh

4 (1h 31m 14s):
Yeah. Do you know that those weight loss drug shots, like these peptides, it's one of the biggest weight loss markets that's ever existed. That gets emerged. They're everywhere now. Everywhere. Like what are the, how much, how many people are on Ozempic and Wago V and all these other, like, what's the numbers?

5 (1h 31m 36s):
GLP one?

4 (1h 31m 37s):
Yeah, agonists or whatever they are. That's not a free ride either. Brian Simpson tried that shit and got wrecked. He, he's one of the few pe, like a certain percentage of people, they do it. They have a bad side effect. And he was one of those terrible gastrointestinal pain. Like he was in agony.

3 (1h 31m 55s):
Really?

4 (1h 31m 56s):
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He, he had ac quit it right away. One database that has,

3 (1h 32m 0s):
I'm still a little apprehensive after the vaccine. Yeah. 'cause you know, it was just another thing that just popped up. Yeah. If you have been talking about it for a few years, I would've jumped on it, but it just popped up. Well

4 (1h 32m 12s):
Some people, Brigham supports it. Brigham says it's like for people that want to lose weight, it is one of the only ways where you can like kind of guarantee that they can lose weight. But you know, there's the argument about that a lot of people are losing muscle mass and they're losing bone mass along with the weight. He's saying Yeah, but that's because they're not doing it right And they should, they're doing it right. Also do it with peptides. And he said they should do it with resistance training.

3 (1h 32m 41s):
Well the guy I really know that, that he even talked to me about it. He goes, Joey consider it.

4 (1h 32m 47s):
So look at this. It says 1.7%. 1.7% of people in the US have been prescribed a semaglutide medication in 2023 up 40 fold over the past five years. So it was I mean. I never even heard of it before. 2022. No. Okay, that's around since 2018. That's then, so 1.7% now. So somewhere around, somewhere in the neighborhood of 2 million people around it in this country.

3 (1h 33m 16s):
No, my friend said, if you do it correctly, he goes, what happened was doctors prescribed it to you and nobody did the fucking research on it.

4 (1h 33m 24s):
So they did the wrong

3 (1h 33m 25s):
Dose. I work out with a guy, Joe, for the life, Tom, this motherfucker. He's very smart like you, very like this is his thing. and I asked him once, 'cause he asked me, he goes, have you ever considered it? I go, I don't know. Do you recommend it? He goes, lemme tell you something, if you do it correctly, it'll work. He goes, I read into a bunch of studies. But he goes, what they don't tell you is you have to change your eating. Do you have to eat the protein first on your dish because you're gonna get too full by the time you get to your carbs. Mm. So he goes, people were eating it and eating salad and that's why they were losing the muscle mass and everything. Mm. That makes sense. 'cause you gotta double your pro, your protein intake now, like a bodybuilder needs 150 to 180 grams of fucking protein a day.

3 (1h 34m 10s):
Joe, I could squeeze out a hundred if I'm lucky buddy. Eggs, seven grams each. Right. Three eggs for breakfast. No steak. You know, I'll eat all that shit later. But how do you do 150 fucking grams a day of protein?

4 (1h 34m 26s):
All I eat is meat. That,

3 (1h 34m 27s):
That's fucking meals. That's five 30 gram meals.

4 (1h 34m 30s):
I'm sure I get close to that.

3 (1h 34m 33s):
So that's what he was saying, that people were not doing it right. It works 80% better with resistance training.

4 (1h 34m 40s):
Mm. I'm sure

3 (1h 34m 40s):
80% better. I'm sure.

4 (1h 34m 42s):
Okay. Anytime you're what you're, essentially, what it does is it kills your, your desire to eat right. It kills your appetite. Right. So you eat less. Right. It's basically doing the same thing as if you had a controlled diet and you decided that you were gonna eat less when you're going into starvation mode. So you're burning off more calories than your body consumes, your body's gonna start eating its tissue. You're gonna, you're gonna eat some muscle mass. You're gonna eat some because you, yeah. You're just not doing, but if you did do it with peptides and you did do it with weightlifting, I would imagine you'd probably ke I mean, I imagine a lot of that 35% they're talking about is like people didn't do anything.

4 (1h 35m 22s):
I bet a lot of people just took the shots. And especially they're overweight already and

3 (1h 35m 26s):
Drinking alcohol.

4 (1h 35m 27s):
They don't have a healthy lifestyle shit. No. Yeah. But I do know that some people get side effects and that, that was Brian. Brian got one of the bad side effects. They're, they're pretty common. You know? Enough, enough people get 'em to that. It's something you have to consider.

3 (1h 35m 40s):
You know, I called you about the peptide and then you turned me on. Thank you again for the stem cells today.

4 (1h 35m 45s):
It didn't hurt. I hope they, I hope they helped your knee

3 (1h 35m 47s):
Man. I didn't pass out good.

4 (1h 35m 48s):
Beautiful.

3 (1h 35m 49s):
I didn't faint.

4 (1h 35m 50s):
I had to leave you in the room. I was like,

3 (1h 35m 52s):
They were saying

4 (1h 35m 52s):
Joey, Joey was freaking out about needles.

3 (1h 35m 54s):
No, no, no. I wish you would've came in and talked to me a little bit. The nurses were great.

4 (1h 35m 58s):
They're great waist well's. Awesome. Listen bro, I

3 (1h 36m 1s):
Love that place. I could tell you. and I even told her to her face. I go, I'd love to tell you. I felt a needle.

4 (1h 36m 6s):
Wow. Well they're really good. They're really good. I

3 (1h 36m 8s):
Love to tell you, I felt a needle. I didn't even feel it. I put my iPod on Little Santa.

4 (1h 36m 14s):
Beautiful,

3 (1h 36m 15s):
Then I did the fucking iv.

4 (1h 36m 18s):
They have people black out all the time.

3 (1h 36m 20s):
He

4 (1h 36m 20s):
Was telling, they see the needle. They,

3 (1h 36m 22s):
He was talking about GSP. He was talking about GSP. Scared of needles.

4 (1h 36m 26s):
That's hilarious. Isn't that funny? That guy, I'm telling you

3 (1h 36m 29s):
That it is the weirdest fear that you could ever fucking have.

4 (1h 36m 34s):
GSP is so interesting 'cause he's such a man that he's not afraid at all to tell you what he is afraid of. You know what I'm saying? Like he doesn't put on any No, there's no bluster. There's no bullshit. What he is is what he is.

3 (1h 36m 47s):
Dog. I had a, my friend's parent when I was a kid, I brought a snake into his house. This guy was a fucking iron worker. They're tough as nails. Oh yeah. Drinking Irish. This guy was in the wall in the corner saying to me, Joey, I beg you. Get that out of my house. and I kept busting this ball. Come on. Are you really scared of this little, it was a little garda. Snake dog I mean he was ready to climb into a fucking corner

4 (1h 37m 11s):
There. That's a real thing. That's

3 (1h 37m 13s):
Phobias.

4 (1h 37m 14s):
Ohia phobia

3 (1h 37m 15s):
Dog. The best one. I was telling her, but I didn't tell her the truth. I told the nurse about a different story, but I, you know, when I went to prison, you have to do a physical, so here I am in prison, you know, like, you gotta fucking hold your own. Right? I go in there, they put me at a desk and I'm like, Lord, don't let me pass out. Not today, because I will wake up. These brothers will yank me, dog. Do not pass out. And Joe, I fucking kept it together. Whew. I went back into the holding tack. What up? What up, what up? Yeah. You know, we didn, next thing you know, I fucking put the arm down. I took the cotton ball off and there was a red dot on blood and I. Fucking, I have thousands of 'em.

3 (1h 37m 58s):
I never told anybody the truth of how I ripped my meniscus. Lemme tell you how I ripped my meniscus. Yeah. I was at acupuncture and I was like this on the 'cause at that time, she didn't lay me down. She sat me down and I was like this. And she started sticking needles into me. and I fainted. And the chair I buckled and I just fell off the chair onto the

4 (1h 38m 17s):
Floor. Oh no,

3 (1h 38m 18s):
I, I tore my meniscus at acupuncture. Who does that dog? I have a thousand. You know, you know how my wife had to stop when she was my girlfriend. She would send me down. I got a blood test. I wouldn't go. I wouldn't go. and I would be petrified. Petrified of needles, petrified.

4 (1h 38m 39s):
I used to date a girl and when she saw someone getting a needle in a movie, she would faint,

3 (1h 38m 43s):
Bro. I fainted in Pulp Fiction when they stuck the needle in the heart. I was on a date in Boulder and all of a sudden the girls putting raisin nets in my mouth and shit saying, I think you passed out. I did fucking pass out. Ah,

4 (1h 38m 54s):
She was trying to revive you with rai nets with

3 (1h 38m 57s):
Rai net. She didn't know. She said, I just passed back. Come on guys. I got 10. You know, I don. And it's always hit and miss. Lately. The last 10 years I've been very good, except for a couple IVs in my hand that didn't work. But beside that, I've been very good. Two, three months ago I did the PRP on my knee. They took six bloods of six tubes of blood out. That was no bueno for papa.

4 (1h 39m 23s):
You know my boy Tommy? Tommy Tommy's junior. Yeah. Yeah. Tommy just fell asleep behind the wheel, shoveling snow. All day, shoveling his car outta snow is driving and he's got dash cam footage. He just falls asleep, hits a fucking wall.

3 (1h 39m 40s):
Is he okay? Yeah,

4 (1h 39m 41s):
He's, he's banged up. He's banged up. Got some injuries, but

3 (1h 39m 44s):
He's, he fallen asleep.

4 (1h 39m 46s):
He just doesn't know what happened. He just blacked out. Just blacked out driving from exertion. You know, if you're a guy who's outta shape, snow is heavy. Right. Especially if it's melting a little bit. And you, you gotta do your whole driveway. That's a workout man, though.

3 (1h 40m 2s):
That's a workout. It's not healthy workout. It's not good after 50. Well,

4 (1h 40m 5s):
It's not good if you're not in shape. No, it's, it's great if you're in shape. It's a really good workout. Like you could, you could get a, like I could put a fucking chest strap on and set an app for a workout and shovel in snow. Oh yeah. And it's a real workout. We used to shovel snow when I was a kid. That was a great way to make money. I

3 (1h 40m 21s):
Shovel fucking snow when I was an adult

4 (1h 40m 24s):
For money.

3 (1h 40m 25s):
When I was 19. I shoveled snow in Aspen.

4 (1h 40m 27s):
They would knock on people's doors.

3 (1h 40m 28s):
No, I, the guy just, I was part of the building crew. It was 15 an hour and you went out there whatever hours you wanted. It was work your own hours. It was fucking fantastic. I loved it. I was also case in our joints, you know, because that's where all the drug dealers lived. So I was shoveled and casing.

4 (1h 40m 44s):
Yeah. When I was a kid, we would make a, a

3 (1h 40m 46s):
Ton of, ton of money. Now you can't get a kid to come out.

4 (1h 40m 48s):
No.

3 (1h 40m 49s):
In Jersey, nothing. Nobody knocks on my door. Crazy. I was out there last week.

4 (1h 40m 53s):
It was understood in the neighborhood. That's how people would make money. So like the moment, like it would start snowing. People would be showing up at people's houses, ask them if they wanted to get shoveled out.

3 (1h 41m 3s):
That was second. I used to go on the roads and push motherfuckers. That's a quick 20. Oh yeah. You push your motherfucker out of a hole. You do anything for you. Seriously.

4 (1h 41m 13s):
Oh yeah. There's always people stuck too

3 (1h 41m 14s):
Pushing and then shoveling them out. They got stuck fucking putting rocks off there.

4 (1h 41m 19s):
The thing is about like real cold places like that, people will fucking help you because they know you could die. Like if you see a highway and some guys it's snowing and some guy's over to the side of the road and his hood's up, let's pick this guy up. Like it's a dangerous thing to do. But a lot of people do it there. There, a lot of people do it. They'll pick people up in the snow.

3 (1h 41m 39s):
I would, Hey, listen man, I just was told when I moved to Jersey to be careful when I shovel that a lot of people drop fucking, oh yeah. Shoveling snow. Shit. You

4 (1h 41m 47s):
Get have a heart attack. It's real work.

3 (1h 41m 49s):
But it, is it 'cause of the cold weather or

4 (1h 41m 52s):
It's, well, the weather's cold, but don don't think that's fucking you up. I think it's just the exertion. It's a lot of working out. Like if you, let's say you have a hundred yard driveway, you

3 (1h 42m 1s):
Know? Yeah.

4 (1h 42m 1s):
You're done. That's crazy. That's

3 (1h 42m 2s):
Great. And you gotta play.

4 (1h 42m 3s):
Okay, let's, let's say it's 20 yards. Let's say a yard. That's a, that's a lot to shovel. If it's wet, if it's melting a lot. Let's say that every shovel full is 40 pounds. Okay. If you're doing every shovel full 40 pounds for reps. So you're essentially doing this for reps and then carrying it. You're doing 500 reps.

3 (1h 42m 28s):
That's a lot.

4 (1h 42m 30s):
For example, after only two minutes of snow shoveling study participants heart rates exceeded 85% of maximal heart rate. Which is a level more commonly expected during intense aerobic exercise testing. The impact is hardest on those people who are least fit. Duh. And that's unfortunately my boy Tommy. So he just fucking and just blacked out behind the

3 (1h 42m 53s):
Wheel. Yeah. I just sn it snowed two weeks ago. I got a two car driveway. I shoveled it with my wife. My daughter came out, threw some fucking salt. Yeah, I did the stairs. We didn't touch the sidewalk. 'cause nobody walks on

4 (1h 43m 5s):
'em. If you're fit, you should look at it as your workout. Dude, that's a workout. Get out there and fucking get after it. Do it. Do it like a workout, bro.

3 (1h 43m 16s):
Jamie Young. Jamie, can I ask you for a favor? Can you show Joe the people shoveling Buffalo Stadium last week? That was fucking work. And they pay you 20 an hour. They feed you and they give you two tickets for the game.

4 (1h 43m 30s):
Oh really? Yeah. Oh, that's not a bad deal.

3 (1h 43m 33s):
Fuck you should have

4 (1h 43m 33s):
If you're a kid, that's a good deal. You get to see the

3 (1h 43m 35s):
Game, bro. There were no kids out there. There was a bunch of fat dudes like me out there fucking laying back. Fucking

4 (1h 43m 41s):
He sweating tickets. Yeah. Lemme see what that looks like. James.

3 (1h 43m 44s):
Oh my God. Look at this. Look at the stuff.

4 (1h 43m 47s):
Wow. They're pushing all that snow down the chute. That's crazy. They couldn't

5 (1h 43m 51s):
Get it out. They just let, you could pick your seat when

4 (1h 43m 53s):
They did the game on on Sunday. So did they play in that snow? No. They would have. They

3 (1h 43m 58s):
Would've

4 (1h 43m 58s):
Did not. How would they know where the lines are? They

5 (1h 43m 60s):
Come out after every play and blow off the lines.

4 (1h 44m 2s):
Oh my God. That's hilarious. They only blow off the lines. So you're running through snow for the, what's like the heaviest snow they've ever played in? Yeah.

5 (1h 44m 11s):
I'll show you. Let's see.

4 (1h 44m 15s):
Look at that. That is crazy.

3 (1h 44m 17s):
And it ISS buffalo.

4 (1h 44m 18s):
That's crazy. You know there's something very American about that. That you have to play in the snow. I mean that is the game, right? Because baseball, they're like, oh, it's over folks. It's raining out. Can't have these players get wet. Not this. Why don't they play baseball in the rain? Play it in the fucking rain. What are you doing? Play the game in the rain. Who gives a shit? Nope. It's a rain day. We called it for rain. Fuck. Meanwhile it's snow wind. Last week it's zero degrees and those guys are playing football.

3 (1h 44m 55s):
Last week in Kansas City was the coldest football game of all time.

4 (1h 44m 60s):
How cold was it?

3 (1h 45m 1s):
Young Jamie minus

5 (1h 45m 2s):
Nine outside. I think the wind show was minus three.

3 (1h 45m 5s):
There was motherfuckers with no T-shirts on. I guess like 60 people went to the hospital.

4 (1h 45m 11s):
Audience members.

5 (1h 45m 12s):
69 people needed help from the fire department.

4 (1h 45m 14s):
Yeah. Do you know the one, one of the dudes that survived the Titanic? He was in the water for two hours and I think he was a chef. And the story was that he got drunk before he went in the water. He just got hammered. 'cause he knew he was gonna die. And somehow or another, because he was drunk, he survived. See if you could find that. Got it. I was reading this. I was like, how does that make sense how a baker survived the Titanic sinking by getting really drunk. God damn, I had boners. These motherfuckers do, do do. There we go. Okay, so can you go back up so I could read scroll? So it says, Charles, how do you say that?

4 (1h 45m 54s):
Johan, how do you say that? Jamie Joe JohE Johan was one of the disasters most unlikely survivors. And he did it thanks to industrial amounts of liquor. So this dude got super duper hammered before he went in the water. And somehow or another, it helped him survive. It was an almost physiologically impossible feat of survival. And according to the British Titanic inquiry is because the 33-year-old Englishman had the presence of mind to greet history's greatest maritime disaster by getting smashed. So he knew

5 (1h 46m 32s):
He was dying.

4 (1h 46m 33s):
He knew he was dying. So he just decided to get fucked up. But he survived. And survival situations, having all that warm blood away from the vital organs means that the drinker is at a greater risk of hypothermia. However, Canadian hypothermia expert Gordon Geis Gerich figures in the minus two degrees Celsius temperature of the North Atlantic. The water was cold enough to quickly tighten Jo, he's blood vessels and cancel out any effects of the alcohol. So then at low to moderate doses of alcohol, cold will win out. Says rack. The University of Manitoba professor has performed hundreds of cold water immersion studies with JohE would have had, however, is the awesome lifesaving power of liquid courage.

4 (1h 47m 21s):
Alcohol remains a leading cause of humans getting into fatal situations, including freezing the death. Nevertheless, the relaxing qualities of the drug have long been known to give humans an uncanny ability to survive trauma.

5 (1h 47m 33s):
This reminded me of the story. The lady that passed out in the, in the snow and her friend found her like the next day and they brought her in. She was still alive.

4 (1h 47m 41s):
Yeah. They're sitting right here in the er. Cold patients who are really drunk can walk in and they're conscious at a temperature that wish that they shouldn't be. So did being drunk keeps you alive. Keep scrolling down a little more. That's it. That's it. Yeah. No, no, no. Yeah. His actions might speak to a man unphased by impending disaster. Immediately upon hearing the collision with an iceberg, the chief baker leapt out of his bunk and began dispatching his staff to stock the lifeboats with bread and biscuits. This done, he popped back into his cabin for a drink before heading topside to help load lifeboats. Not, not only did Joaquin what, how, whatever, however I say his name, joking, refuse his own place on a boat.

4 (1h 48m 23s):
But he, and there's no men like that today. But he and a few other men became forcibly chuckling, chucking, reluctant women into empty seats, likely saving their lives. He said we threw them in. He testified later. Top deck of the increasingly listing Titanic was mostly cleared of lifeboats by 1:30 AM to most, this was a panic inducing sign that all hopes of rescue was gone, but to whatever his name is. It was a cue to head back to his cabin for another drink. So this dude's just getting fucked up. He sat down on his bunk and nursed it along. Aware, but now particularly caring that the water now rippled through the cabin doorway. Wrote historian Walter Lord.

4 (1h 49m 3s):
In a night to remember, Lord was in touch with the dude before the bakkers. 1956 death. He said The dude then splashed top side again where he took upon himself to begin throwing deck chairs overboard with an eye to filling the water with impromptu flotation devices so that people could float around on the chairs is perch. He then worked his way back to the pantry to get a drink of water. The baker was standing on the stern when the ship broke in half. And yet he remembered the violent catastrophic breakup only as a great list over to port. There was no great shock or anything. He told the inquirer. So he was just hammered, definitely moving through the swarms of people.

4 (1h 49m 44s):
He made it to the stern rail of the ship. Exactly. 2:20 AM he rode the sinking Titanic into the sea like an elevator.

3 (1h 49m 53s):
Woo.

4 (1h 49m 54s):
As with all surviving Titanic. Crew members 2:20 AM on April 15th, 1912 was also the exact moment at which the white star line stopped paying him. Oh boy. The first stage of cold water immersion is known as cold shock. Horrifying sensation of having the skin cool. The feelings with the Titanic. Second officer Charles Light Tower described as being like a thousand knives being driven into one's body. So this, how did this dude survive? What did he float around on for two hours? Did it say

5 (1h 50m 31s):
Paddling and treading water? He said

4 (1h 50m 33s):
I was just paddling and treading water for two hours. Oh my God.

5 (1h 50m 41s):
How come Leo couldn't do that then in the movie? He just sunk in the water after two minutes.

4 (1h 50m 45s):
But this Leo wasn't hammered and he gave up. This dude didn't give up. He, he paddled water for hours. I guess it took a couple hours for them to get someone to get to them.

3 (1h 50m 55s):
Yeah. He's after two hours,

4 (1h 50m 56s):
Which is pretty impressive that they got to them in two hours.

3 (1h 51m 0s):
Boy. Eventually hauled

4 (1h 51m 1s):
In 19, what? What was this like

5 (1h 51m 4s):
19 or somewhere around there? don don't know the exact. 1912. Somewhere. I don know

4 (1h 51m 7s):
It. The early 19 hundreds. So the, the fact they got to them in two hours is pretty amazing. 19. 19. 20. 19. 19. Oh no. Hundred seventh. Yeah. Okay. So 12. Yeah. 19. 12. Wow.

3 (1h 51m 22s):
Let go think real quick.

4 (1h 51m 23s):
Yeah, I'll go too. We'll be right back. Yeah. So she fell out of an airplane and she landed on an ant hill. How big was that fucking ant hill. and it was fire ants.

5 (1h 51m 39s):
Yeah. This one right here doesn't say the, it was a 19 99, 40 7-year-old woman, Joan Murray. Altitude of 14,500 feet. Second parachute also failed to deploy.

4 (1h 51m 51s):
Oh my God.

5 (1h 51m 52s):
Crashed into a fire ant mound at more than 80 miles an hour. Oh

4 (1h 51m 57s):
My God.

5 (1h 51m 57s):
Immediately started attacking her body, which kept her alive because of the adrenaline.

4 (1h 52m 4s):
Oh my God.

5 (1h 52m 5s):
And then she still survived. She was in a coma for two weeks, had operations, but she's still alive. I think

4 (1h 52m 12s):
Jesus, one of the, did they slower down at all the parachutes. 80 miles an hour is pretty fucking fast. Jesus.

5 (1h 52m 22s):
Yeah. don don't know what terminal velocity is if you don't have one. But

4 (1h 52m 28s):
The fuck parachutes bro. Huh? Oh fuck. Parachutes.

3 (1h 52m 31s):
I'd like to try it one.

4 (1h 52m 33s):
I can set it up.

3 (1h 52m 34s):
Really? Yeah. You have the guy here.

4 (1h 52m 35s):
Oh yeah. I got guys.

3 (1h 52m 37s):
Hi I. don, do you have to go?

4 (1h 52m 38s):
I don't do it.

3 (1h 52m 39s):
You wouldn't even consider it? No. For a

4 (1h 52m 41s):
Rush. You might not be able to. You might be too big.

3 (1h 52m 44s):
Too big. Yeah.

4 (1h 52m 44s):
Yeah. I think there's a number, like a guy was just telling us the other day on Kill Tony that he had to lose weight. I think it was it for, was it for parachuting? Yeah. I think you, there's a number. It has to be a number. Yeah. don don't think you'd be like above two 20 or something like that. No. I don two

3 (1h 53m 0s):
40. I don't think a parachute would hold

4 (1h 53m 2s):
Papa. No. And you have to have someone on your back too. The first time you do it. There's a person that's gotta do it with you. Oh fuck yeah. Fuck that. Joey. Diaz. Fuck that. I'm sure it's exciting. I don't need that in my life. My life is exciting enough. This

5 (1h 53m 20s):
Is Travis Pastrana. This is a long time ago. It's X Games promo.

4 (1h 53m 24s):
Did he go into the net?

5 (1h 53m 25s):
No. So he is, he is like the crazy, crazy guy. Jumps without, does all sorts of stuff. Motocross. But I don't know if you just noticed he jumped out without a parachute. Yeah, he is. Got nothing

4 (1h 53m 34s):
There. And he threw his can away. Shut the Red Bull. But the Red Bull can is gonna hit someone in the fucking head and kill him.

5 (1h 53m 40s):
I think it was empty.

4 (1h 53m 41s):
Yeah. If it's coming from space, bro, that Red Bull can't get fuck you up. So someone has to grab him.

5 (1h 53m 48s):
He, yeah, he ends up, it looks like that's all they did is just put his legs around him.

4 (1h 53m 51s):
Well, no, they gave him a parachute.

5 (1h 53m 53s):
No, he's just strapping. He's just locked. Got locked onto that guy. Oh. And they, they go all the way down and he's like barely

4 (1h 53m 59s):
Attached. Oh my God. That's so nuts. I'm sure it's exciting, but fuck that. Right. Come on, Joey. Every

3 (1h 54m 11s):
Once in a while you gotta do something outta your comfort range. Yeah. Yeah. That's like today I went and got, you know, I would've never dreamed of that shit. but it makes you a better person. You gotta do little shit like that.

4 (1h 54m 20s):
I guess. don don't know if you have to do that. That's not a little shit. Jumping out of a fucking plane with no parachute. That's not a little thing. I

3 (1h 54m 27s):
Mean. You gotta fucking get a rise outta something after a while, brother.

4 (1h 54m 30s):
I think that's a big thing. I would, I would advise you not doing that one. No,

3 (1h 54m 34s):
No, no, no. But you know, you gotta try shit. I get it. You know, I still remember going to Colorado when I was 19 and people go, do you want to go ski and I? Go fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you. I'll never ski skiing this, that you hurt your, you break your legs. Until I got up there, Joe, I was so lonely on Christmas day. I go, fuck it. Lemme go get some skis and go up there. Really? and it would change my life. And ever since that I'm like, you know, every once in a while, listen, it's not gonna work out. It's not like I could ski now in no fucking way, but at least I got to do it.

4 (1h 55m 8s):
The thing about skiing is everybody tries to go on harder courses than you can control. You have to really learn how to

3 (1h 55m 14s):
Dog. You gotta live there or you gotta go there every, it's like anything else. Yeah. You wanna get good at standup, you gotta show up and do the dance. You gotta, you gotta go jiujitsu. Whatever. Weightlifting, whatever. It's the same thing.

4 (1h 55m 25s):
Well also there's a lot of people that try skiing that don't do anything else athletic. No.

3 (1h 55m 28s):
And they, the, the worst thing is when people say to me, I'm going skiing, they haven't done anything. Yeah. They haven't done anything. First of all. You go to Aspen. I used to be a fucking security fucking driver up there. Okay. I'd see the people that would come in. The amount of alcohol, the amount of shit. Lemme tell you what happens after one day of skiing. If you're not skiing consistently, bro. You use muscles you haven't used before. Mm. don don't care how many squats you do in Kettlebells. Let's go skiing. Just three times down a medium hill. The next day you'll go, fuck this hurts in here. And my hamstrings hurt. Different things hurt. They use different fucking muscles for sure when you ski. So people go up there, dog. That's not a, you gotta prepare for that shit.

3 (1h 56m 10s):
But I lived in Snowmass, so it was like going to a summer camp. I got to ski every day. Whether it was two runs before work, or three runs after work. So you get good, you get used to it. The falls become easier. Next thing you know, you're up there with no winter jacket. Fuck. I don't even know. Fucking winter jacket. This'll do a hooded sweatshirt. It's great.

4 (1h 56m 32s):
Do you ski without a helmet?

3 (1h 56m 34s):
There wasn't even helmets for skiing when I was skiing. This is 50 fucking years ago. You went up there, you know, and then it was just something that I never thought I would do. Like whitewater rafting. That shit is great up there. You know, you go down from Aspen all the way down to Glenwood Springs and shit. I loved all that crazy stuff. Yeah. You know, that was, but don don't like camping. 'cause you can't wash your pussy. Okay. I'm not gonna sit with you in a tent for four days with a stinky asshole. That ain't an adventure for me. If you wanna go camp, I'm like a white camper. I wanna shower, I want a restaurant. You know what I'm saying? Right. There's something on the location and there's, there's those things. But I always wanted like bungee jump one time or something.

3 (1h 57m 18s):
Something out of a plane. Just something nothing. Have to be, you know, I've jumped off a cliff into water, you know, 20 feet, whatever. But just to, for somebody to say, you could jump off that cliff in Hawaii and land, and you got a hundred feet under you. Nothing's gonna happen to you. I'll fucking try

4 (1h 57m 39s):
It. You can, if you fuck up, you land wrong. I know. Someone will landed on their ass. They land on their ass instead of straight and they fuck their back up.

3 (1h 57m 47s):
No, you're done. You're done. But that's funny what you said before about somebody throwing a can up in the sky, it's gonna kill somebody.

4 (1h 57m 53s):
That Red Bull can that, that's 15,000 feet in the air

3 (1h 57m 57s):
Dog. I almost got arrested when I was like 10 for almost killing the dude in Puerto Rico. I went to Puerto Rico and my parents, my mom and the other parents left us alone and went out and we started throwing fucking ice and the balcony and shit. And we kept on throwing it and throwing it. And next thing you know, I heard an ambulance and fucking cops were knocking on all the doors. And they fucking, they knew it was us. The guy was on the floor fucking out guy with a little fucking ice cube from the sixth floor.

4 (1h 58m 24s):
Hmm. Yeah. Sixth floor ice cube hit you in the head.

3 (1h 58m 28s):
Sixth fucking floor.

4 (1h 58m 29s):
That'll fracture your fucking skull.

3 (1h 58m 32s):
Man. I used to do so many crazy things like that, Joe, when I was on 88th Street when I was like six or seven, I would play with these kids. There was 2 0 5 West 88th Street was on the corner, then there was a parking garage. It's still there. and I would play in there with the kids. And then when I would get a little bit of anxiety, I would go up to my apartment, to my bedroom. And my mother used to have the 40 fives from the record player at the bar. And she would gimme the one she'd take out and I'd go by the window and I'd just throw 'em out. And they would come out like Boomerang and come down and you'd hear, Hey, stop that. And I'd just throw like 50 of them out. And then you hear like the kids going, Hey, fuck you. They didn't know it was me. and I would come back.

3 (1h 59m 12s):
What happened? Some motherfucker up there throwing fucking things on me. One day I kid a kid with a thing, but it didn't, he just fell down for a few minutes. Now another time, there was a place when I was growing up in North Bergen called Dura Test. They just made light bulbs, But they made the long fluorescent ones. You know how many times I hit in the head with those. We would jump in that dumpster and take all the fluorescent bulbs out and light bulbs and just hit each other with that. That dust that comes out of a fucking fluorescent light bulb in the seventies. Oh

4 (1h 59m 47s):
My God.

3 (1h 59m 47s):
So we would have those light bulb wars all the time. And then we started having 'em from the roofs and people would throw light, light bulbs up at us and we would throw light bulbs back and I would put the light bulbs on the floor. And then I'd have, we call 'em spears, you know, the, the fucking, we'd throw the fucking long fluorescent lights at 'em. One day I picked up a light bulb. I didn't know I picked up a rock with that motherfucker. and I just drew it at the kid, nor the kids looking right at me. and I saw that rock just go. And he just went backwards. Now this was a pervert kid. His name was Ali. Him and his brother, like we were 10 or 12, and him and his brother were going to hooker houses. His father would take him, oh my God. In the city when he was like 10 or 11. And he would come back and tell us they washed our dick.

3 (2h 0m 27s):
It was tremendous. I hit that kid in the head so hard with that rock without knowing it wasn't no malice intended. But when I got down there, the lump had gone up off his head. Like one of those fights when the guy has a lump a tumor and it had like a little pimple with blood in it. It was already filled up dog. and it had ice on his head. and I felt so bad I was giggling inside. But he feel fucking bad when you do that shit to

4 (2h 0m 52s):
People. His dad took him to a brothel when he was 10.

3 (2h 0m 55s):
Every weekend. They were Cuban Ali brothers, Juan and Carlos Ali Juan was the brains of the operation. Carlos was a little bit on the slow brother. He was like the Lenny of the Squigy. How crazy

4 (2h 1m 5s):
Is it taking a 10-year-old to a brothel

3 (2h 1m 9s):
Boy? They were going every weekend into the city, sixth grade, seventh grade,

4 (2h 1m 14s):
Jesus Christ.

3 (2h 1m 15s):
And telling us about all the stories. Oh my God. On fucking Mondays.

4 (2h 1m 19s):
Oh my God,

3 (2h 1m 21s):
Bro. We grew up with some pieces of work. Not these kids growing up today where people didn't do anything with 'em. Hmm. You know, I look at my daughter, her little friends. It's not gonna be good for them.

4 (2h 1m 30s):
It's gonna be weird. That's for sure. It's

3 (2h 1m 33s):
Not gonna be good for

4 (2h 1m 33s):
Them. It's gonna be weird. It's gonna be a completely different world.

3 (2h 1m 36s):
I try to, but you know, you try the hardest and you talk to them and shit. Yeah. And that's the best you could do. But the world they're gonna grow up in is completely different than our

4 (2h 1m 46s):
Fucking world. Completely different.

3 (2h 1m 47s):
You know? And it's so weird that I had the, I had a shitty childhood family wise, but everything else was fucking ACEs with me, bro. Mm. I laughed my ass off. I had a great time. These kids, they don't, you know, one of the kids we took to the city for Jingle Bells told me, I never came to New York City before. She had never seen a cab before.

4 (2h 2m 6s):
Wow.

3 (2h 2m 8s):
Never saw a

4 (2h 2m 8s):
Cab. It's only an hour away.

3 (2h 2m 10s):
Hour away. 55 fucking minutes. You know,

4 (2h 2m 13s):
Different world jersey's. A completely different world. People have this idea that New Jersey is like real similar to New York, like the Bronx or something like that. New Jersey is very rural. Very rural. There's

3 (2h 2m 25s):
A lot of spots. But thing I found out, let's, let's have young Jamie check it.

4 (2h 2m 27s):
Yeah.

3 (2h 2m 29s):
Jamie, where's the most horses in the United States? A equestrian state.

4 (2h 2m 35s):
If that's New Jersey. That's nuts.

3 (2h 2m 37s):
That's fucking crazy. Yeah. Jer, listen bro, Jersey has Newark Bayone amboy. Don't get me wrong. You get fucking killed

4 (2h 2m 45s):
In Newark. Camden.

3 (2h 2m 46s):
Camden Pennsauken. Yep. You know, Jersey City's getting bad. North Bergen's not all good. Right. You know, they just had a couple murders in Hoboken. It's not New York City per se, but actions.

4 (2h 2m 57s):
Right. but it has cities

3 (2h 2m 58s):
Actions still fucking happen.

4 (2h 2m 59s):
Yeah. There's cities, but it's, it's a lot bigger than people think it is. What's that New Jersey? Fuck,

3 (2h 3m 5s):
Bro. I'm in shock.

4 (2h 3m 6s):
Yeah.

3 (2h 3m 7s):
I'm in shock how big it is. I never fucking knew to that. People

4 (2h 3m 10s):
Think it's real little. You drive through it real quick and next thing you know you're in Philadelphia. No, that's only one way. Like if you look at the, the entirety of the state and how much of it is actually rural, you know, I tell New Jersey has the most horses per capita. 10 horses per 1000 people. What I tell you, wow.

3 (2h 3m 28s):
I, I talk if you thought I knew that. I, I think it was Kentucky.

4 (2h 3m 32s):
You and know. You know what, also they have what? The highest population of Black bears. Who? New Jersey.

3 (2h 3m 37s):
New Jersey. Yeah. But that's up North Dog and they don't fuck around up there. Rabbit hole. The bears.

4 (2h 3m 42s):
Yeah. They're down south too.

3 (2h 3m 44s):
I haven't heard of it. They're

4 (2h 3m 45s):
Near Rutgers.

3 (2h 3m 46s):
My

4 (2h 3m 46s):
One of the students from Rutgers got killed by a bear.

3 (2h 3m 49s):
My daughter said she saw a bear one day and we were driving a little bear. Yeah. I, you know, who knows?

4 (2h 3m 54s):
Oh, they're there. Joey, far Rockaway. There's videos of them in Far Rockaway like fighting on this street. It's crazy. These giant bears. They're so big and they're fighting over like garbage cans. They're knocking each other over. They topple down into a fucking mailbox. They're out into the street. This guy's sitting in his car filming these like 400 pound bears going to war with each other in the middle of a, like a crowded suburb. Cars are stopped.

3 (2h 4m 21s):
It's,

4 (2h 4m 21s):
You ever seen this? No fi find that video. The video fucking bananas. Because you're looking at these giant predators that are fighting each other over territory in the middle of people's cities. And these people aren't freaking out. They've just decided, and this is like before they stopped the bear hunt, when the, when the new governor got into place, one of the things he was running on was he's gonna stop bear hunting. And he got in and he did. He stopped bear hunting. And they restarted it.

3 (2h 4m 47s):
Yeah, they restarted it.

4 (2h 4m 47s):
After a couple years. They're like, okay. Yeah, you, you're

3 (2h 4m 49s):
Not, they got the population got outta control for a while.

4 (2h 4m 52s):
Yeah. It was already outta control. You. Don't know what the fuck you're doing. Like look at these two Joe I mean this is someone's fucking yard. Look at the size of these fuckers and they're just duking it out in front of a mailbox while this guy's car is parked. I mean. This is nuts, man.

And that's where I went for my surgery one time when I was a kid. Margaret Hague? No, no, no, no. That's where you gave birth to kids. That's, I went to Christ Hospital. Margaret Hague was a, a hospital in Jersey City and they were all related. So I just followed that and I just started reading all that Philadelphia shit. Like there's a town by me called Highland. Highland, New Jersey. They just built a ferry to take you from Highland to New York City. That's where fucking veto Genovese lived.

3 (2h 9m 36s):

4 (2h 11m 32s):
Mm. Jesus Christ Joe. A little bit of olive oil.

3 (2h 11m 35s):

4 (2h 11m 49s):
No more. No.

3 (2h 11m 51s):
Too much of a sandwich, man.

4 (2h 11m 52s):
Well have you, what have you, what have you done, like when you've tried to manipulate your diet I know you did Weight Watchers for a while and you lost a bunch of weight. But then like, have you ever tried different kinds of diets? Have you ever tried like keto or low carb?

3 (2h 12m 8s):
I would do the keto, but I can't eat that much meat in a day. Like I could, like this morning I got three pieces of bacon I ate too. You know something.

4 (2h 12m 17s):
What about eggs? Do you eat eggs? Yeah.

3 (2h 12m 19s):
Like a motherfucker.

4 (2h 12m 20s):
Well if, you know, if you wanted to try something that would help you lose weight, just eliminate all the sugar and bread. Just eliminate all that stuff. Just eat only things that are either like vegetables or meat. Just only that.

3 (2h 12m 33s):
I've been working a lot on fasting.

4 (2h 12m 35s):
Yeah.

3 (2h 12m 35s):
It took me a while.

4 (2h 12m 37s):
How long do you do?

3 (2h 12m 38s):
I could eat at seven and then not eat lunch till four. I'm down to two meals a day in a protein shake. That's what I'm down to right now. I don't eat that. Lunch was huge. When your plate came, I was like, Ugh. I hope that's not my fucking plate. Ha. Yeah. I hope even though those ribs look fucking killer,

4 (2h 12m 56s):
They're good.

3 (2h 12m 57s):
Tremendous. I, I can't, I can't do it no more. I could get like an eight ounce, 10 ounce steak. Now. That's the most meat I could eat at night. You know, today I had Turkey and the brisket. It was fucking delicious. I ate avocado toast for breakfast. Three eggs, avocado toast, and a fruit bowl. That's my breakfast though.

4 (2h 13m 17s):
That's good. That, that's a good start. That's a good way to get going.

3 (2h 13m 21s):
That's in my world. That's great. Yeah. Where I come from.

4 (2h 13m 24s):
Yeah.

3 (2h 13m 25s):
Six eggs, white bread, a stick of butter and a pack of bacon. And then after an hour after I go to McDonald's before 11. Yeah. That's how I'd say that's a big fucking change my friend. Yeah.

4 (2h 13m 36s):
It's a big change.

3 (2h 13m 37s):
It's a big change.

4 (2h 13m 38s):
The the big one is if you can just cut the bullshit out instead of the avocado toast dude, go with something else. Just cut that bread out. I don. That'll help you a lot. I

3 (2h 13m 46s):
Like avocado. I'll eat avocado without the bread.

4 (2h 13m 48s):
Good. Eat the avocado. Avocado's great for you. But it's just bread is just never good

3 (2h 13m 53s):
For you. Not good. And that's why I said with now they're making these sandwiches, bro. And in Jersey they're like this. It's a fucking animal sandwich. Wet mo chicken cutlet. Yep. You know something else. And you know, Joe

'cause they brought some serious food into Jersey. Yeah. And I mean serious. There's a deli in Staten Island called Raw crime. Joe. Rogan. They're chocolate bread. When people, the lady brings the me up. Thank God they're not in my fucking bag.

My neighbor, one night I was in the basement getting high by myself and I'm like, man, I could eat something. and I something made me go outside and I saw a loaf of bread and I go, what the fuck is this?

4 (2h 16m 13s):
Yeah. They don't have any of that out here like that. Kind of an Italian deli yet. Not enough Italian. Yeah. I, you know, if those guys from g and r Deli opened up a shop out here, they'd fucking kill it. They made those same sandwiches out here and they import imported a lot of their shit from Italy. Anyway.

3 (2h 16m 28s):
But look at Rails just opened in Vegas.

4 (2h 16m 30s):

3 (2h 16m 30s):
Is that? Rails just opened in Vegas

4 (2h 16m 33s):

4 (2h 16m 46s):
They did. They just opened up a Peter Lugers in

3 (2h 16m 50s):
Vegas. Yes, yes. That's what it was. I'm sorry. It was Peter Luger.

4 (2h 16m 53s):
Oh yeah. Okay. That's a big deal that that place is the shit. If I'm ever in Brooklyn, I'm eating at Peter Luger's. I

3 (2h 17m 0s):
Always go

4 (2h 17m 1s):
That place. Rules.

3 (2h 17m 2s):
Last time I went, I went with Ari. Oh. Caught a four o'clock fucking dinner reservation. Like,

4 (2h 17m 7s):
Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's it, that place is great. They got a bad review in like the New York Times or something like that. And me and Ari had just gone there and we were like, what the fuck are they talking about? It was fantastic. It was so good. The steak comes over, it's crackling. The butter's dripping all over. It's cut all over for you. You take a slice of it, you're like, it's perfect. It's the perfect steak. And you're getting the smell from the plate, the plate's coming outta the oven where they finish it and you're just like, ah, don't touch the plate. It's hot. Okay. It's fucking delicious. Amazing. It's delicious. Amazing. Delicious. That place rules.

3 (2h 17m 42s):
It's right there. It's easy to get the rather go there.

4 (2h 17m 44s):
A video from city them. There's a video, like a documentary on how they pick their cattle and how they, there, there's like a vic, a documentary on steak. And the Peter Luger part is like a big part of it. 'cause these people are trying to figure out why the fuck are these stakes so good? Like people from other countries were coming to study how Peter Luger's making their mistakes. Yeah. That fucking place is tremendous. So this is a, they take you through the entire step, like how much they age it, what they do. And they, you go to how they treat it. So they get it down to the size and they trim it. I mean they, they've been doing this shit for a hundred years. Peter Luger is from the 18 hundreds, I think.

4 (2h 18m 24s):
Like when did that place open? Who

3 (2h 18m 26s):
Showed us that they had a credit card from Peter Luger. don don't know somebody. We hung out their dad.

4 (2h 18m 31s):
See look, they just put salt on it. That's it. And they get it in one of those broilers. So they have those broilers with a flame is above the stake, you know. So it, it's not like direct heat on the steak where the fat is dripping down. You get flare ups. No, the flame is above the steak. And then they flip it and then they slice it up and then they put it on a plate. And then once they slice it up and put it on a plate, then they put it in the oven and they finish it in the oven. And Oh my goodness. Dude. See they do it like that. They put it on a plate, finished it, motherfucker. And when they pull that bitch out, it's just, so that's her right now, setting it up and then they bring it out to these people.

4 (2h 19m 17s):
Look at that. They put the drippings on there. Come on son. Come on. Sensational. Should we get outta here? You done?

3 (2h 19m 25s):

And then you like, for sure they're gonna cancel. Look at the snow, they're gonna cancel. Like, and the snow stops and they're like, school's still on. Like you mother.

3 (2h 20m 35s):

3 (2h 21m 21s):
What happened? Something. Oh, I was getting shortness of breath. The fuck. So I went to the doctor first they told me I had a kidney stone. Then I went and got a scan for the kidney stone. There was no kidney stone, but they saw something else and they made me go in for a lung X-ray. And at the lung x-ray is where they fucking were. Like, you got a fucking pneumonia. I didn't know. It took like three weeks to find out. Mm. Bro. I couldn't walk to my mailbox, Joe. I'd walk to my mailbox and I'd be huffing and fucking puffing.

4 (2h 21m 54s):
How'd you get it rid of it?

3 (2h 21m 55s):
The blunts? No, that's not,

4 (2h 21m 57s):
Oh, the blunts were giving it to you. How many blunts were you smoking? Two.

3 (2h 22m 21s):
And those are really good too. Yeah, those are are good.

4 (2h 22m 23s):
Good. Oh yeah, it's good. It's good tobacco. But it's so that you don't have to finish a cigar. You just want a little puff.

3 (2h 22m 28s):
Those fucking cigars are too big. They get me dizzy. So

4 (2h 22m 32s):
Yeah. It's just a little puff.

3 (2h 22m 33s):
Don don't know. I, something was just bothering me. and I, what else can I be doing?

4 (2h 22m 37s):
Yeah. That's not good for you. You know, I would love for you to get healthier and I know at one point in time, like I said, you'd lost a lot of weight. You lost, what did you lose? I mean? You must have lost close to 80 pounds. Yeah. What'd you lose at one point in time?

3 (2h 22m 53s):

But there's one time with the Weight Watchers time where it was pretty quickly. Yeah. It was over like a period of 10 months. Yeah. Everybody was like, look how good Joey looks. Yeah.

3 (2h 23m 3s):
And dog, I still look good. Don't get confused. Motherfucker for 60. I still look fucking good.

Was 60, you know? Yeah. I didn't know what my life was about till I read that fucking, that. I wrote that book and then I read it and I was like, I gotta take a breather.

4 (2h 23m 28s):
Yeah. You've had an extraordinary life, my friend.

3 (2h 23m 31s):
And that's why when I moved to Jersey, I said, you know what, man, it's time for me just to chill. For a while. I wanted to get out of the train of thought. I had a Comedy. Yeah. That old mentality I had, I wanted to give that a breath. I couldn't get away from it. I couldn't get away from it. So for once I wanted to start fresh, man, I, I looked at it, what I needed to do. No. Everybody kept asking me, did you quit Comedy? I No, no. I'm just taking a fucking breather.

4 (2h 23m 55s):
There's nothing wrong with taking a breather.

3 (2h 23m 56s):
Just taking a fucking extended breather. I wanna know what the fuck happened the last 40 years. Is that okay? I started this journey in 1983 and all of a sudden 2020, I'm at the store with a bunch of fucking killers. I wasn't preprogrammed for this. I was preprogrammed to be in jail by now. What am I doing at the store with a bunch of fucking killers doing Comedy? And they're talking to me and we're laughing. It's not like I didn't earn it. It's not like my mother owned the fucking Joint and Right. She just gave me a spot there. We earned those things. You know what the fuck happened? I was a guy that was in prison. They told me the, it's not gonna work out for you. It, here we are today. So I had to go process this shit.

3 (2h 24m 37s):
You know, I had to go process a lot of fucking things. You know, when I was a kid and my mother died, I had to lie to myself. Joe, that's

4 (2h 24m 43s):
Right in front of you. In front Joey. Right in front of your thing. Now look. Look right in

3 (2h 24m 46s):
Front of you. Oh shit. Sorry. I got no glasses. No. You know, when I was a kid, I had to lie to myself. Yeah. When my mother died, I had to say, she's just leaving for a couple years. That's the only way I could deal with it. She's just going away for a couple years. I'll bump into her in a couple years. I'll bump into her in a couple years. When I went back to Jersey talking hit me like I lied to myself all those fucking years. Yeah. It's

4 (2h 25m 9s):
Just a coping mechanism. Right.

3 (2h 25m 11s):
It was a coping mechanism. I used just to, to soothe my fucking soul. Yeah. I got back to Jersey, I went up to the cemetery one day and I go, what the fuck is this? She never came back. And I was like pissed about it. Like retarded. Like she never made a comeback. And I'm like, Joey, what the fuck did you do? You buried yourself in that shit that she was gonna, you were gonna bump into her one day on Burg Line Avenue or some shit, you

4 (2h 25m 35s):
Know? Yeah.

3 (2h 25m 37s):
So that was hard. You know, a lot of things.

4 (2h 25m 39s):
It's good to take a break off Comedy, just to really try to figure out what your actual perspective really is.

3 (2h 25m 44s):
Listen bro, I was in an environment that I, I don't thrive in. I was in an environment with a lot of fake motherfuckers. I was in an environment where I did time. I grew up around people who were very dangerous. The people I was around in LA were more dangerous because I knew where I stand with these other people. Right. With these people in la these agents You don't know where you stand. Yeah. You have no fucking idea.

4 (2h 26m 9s):
Well, you kind of know what they are. You know what they are. You know, it's like, that's that old Mike Tyson expression. It's okay to have a snake in the room as long as you keep the lights on. You know what they are. You know, you just have to know who you are. and I think you were coming from this place where you almost felt like you didn't belong. You know? and I remember when I first met you, that was Joey criminal days. It, it was fun, man. Because I remember I met you and I was like, oh, finally there's someone, like people that I used to know, like you were like the first guy that I ran into like, oh, this is like Joey from the Pooh Hall. This is like Joey from the boxing gym. This is like, you were like the people that I knew from the East coast, the wild people that were fun, you know?

4 (2h 26m 52s):
And, and you know, people didn't like you. People were scared of you. I was like, that guy's great I mean, it's kind of funny over the years, 'cause I had arguments with agents about you where they're like, he doesn't have any talent. Like you're outta your fucking mind. I'm like, you're outta your mind. I go, I know what Comedy is and he makes me laugh harder than anybody I've ever seen. I so he's wild and crazy. Yeah. That's what you get. That's the kind of person that that does that kind of Comedy. Stupid. You don't even know what you sell. You're out here selling Comedy. You don't even know how it's created. It's created by wild people, whether it's wild intellectually, wild physically, just different group of people that are gonna create something that's gonna make you laugh that hard.

3 (2h 27m 34s):
You know? Man, it was fucking crazy those first couple years there and how people would look at me. I remember one day an agent stole The Check from me and I said, I'm gonna come down and get it. When I got there, the door was shut and he stuck. He stuck The Check on the fucking wall and said, don't come in here. And then 10 years later he signed me again. That's funny. I bumped into him in a vet place and we were talking. He goes, I'll come back.

4 (2h 27m 56s):
That's funny.

3 (2h 27m 57s):
I had a hard time there for

4 (2h 27m 58s):
A long time. Well, you were raw man. You were a raw dude.

3 (2h 28m 1s):
Gotta be.

4 (2h 28m 2s):
You reminded me a lot of my friend Johnny, you know, 'cause Johnny was like you. He was like a brilliant guy that struggled with substances. Brilliant guy. Johnny was like one of the smartest people I'd ever met. He was a pool hustler. And so like, I didn't know anybody, like, like just such a, just a dangerous dude. Just always doing wild shit. and I didn't know anybody like that over here until I met you. And then I met you. I was like, oh, all right. Because in Comedy, you're you, we were getting a lot of people that were essentially auditioning for sitcoms. They just, what they wanted to do is figure out a way to transfer what they're doing on stage into a lucrative sitcom. Everybody wanted that.

4 (2h 28m 42s):
That was the golden ring. Everybody wanted the sitcom and everybody wanted a development deal. So a lot of guys really only had 10, 15 minutes. And that 15 minutes was just them sort of like setting up their, their life for sitcom. It was almost like they, they told you where they were from. You know, I was born in Brooklyn, New York, and this and that. And they were basically like doing an audition for a sitcom on stage. We weren't doing that. We were doing a different thing. We

3 (2h 29m 6s):
Were doing

4 (2h 29m 6s):
A different thing. We were doing what we were doing, what our idols were doing. We were doing what Pryor did. We were doing what Kennison did. We were trying to find our path with what we think

3 (2h 29m 14s):
World. I didn't appreciate that when people said you have to present the set on stage, that the agents could see a network TV show. What, what are you talking about? I'm gonna tell you something else too. When I get this residency or when I start kicking with gas with Comedy, again, not podcasting no more.

4 (2h 29m 30s):
How come?

3 (2h 29m 31s):
Never again. I'm ending this career as a standup.

4 (2h 29m 36s):
But, but you can do

3 (2h 29m 37s):
Both. I don't wanna do both.

4 (2h 29m 38s):
You don't like it.

3 (2h 29m 40s):
I want to end this career as a fucking standup. But

4 (2h 29m 43s):
You are a standup. No,

3 (2h 29m 44s):
This all, all this other shit. No podcast ads and all this shit. No ads. Let's do the last two years. Yeah. Fucking standup motherfuckers. That's why I wanna do the residency. That's why. Because I'm ready just to do standup and my phone ain't ringing for acting.

4 (2h 29m 60s):
Listen, you just come here and do podcasts. My phone. Anytime you get a podcast.

3 (2h 30m 3s):
Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Fly out here. No, always.

4 (2h 30m 6s):
And if you wanna stay here and do a residency here, you could do that too.

3 (2h 30m 9s):
Absolutely. I was gonna talk to you about it. Maybe come once a month.

4 (2h 30m 11s):
100% do, bro. Do that little boy room. That room is mad.

3 (2h 30m 15s):
I heard. It's mad. It's fucking tremendous. It's magic. Jim Florentines it's magic. Loves that

4 (2h 30m 20s):
Room. That room's magic. It's magic. It's a magic little room. And that room tells you what's real and what's what sucks.

3 (2h 30m 26s):
Like the or?

4 (2h 30m 27s):
Yeah, just like the, or like the, or it's like a little bit of the or and a little bit of the belly room. Like, it's like the belly room had sex with the OR and it created the little boy and then the main room had sex with the OR and created the big boy or fat man. The big room is like a combination of the main room and the, or it's just intimate enough, but also big enough and because big laughs.

3 (2h 30m 49s):
What's the main room set?

4 (2h 30m 51s):
Two 50

3 (2h 30m 52s):
And the

4 (2h 30m 53s):
One 10.

3 (2h 30m 54s):
The, that's it.

4 (2h 30m 55s):
That's it.

3 (2h 30m 55s):
That's why it's looking

4 (2h 30m 57s):
Tremendous. Oh, it's so good

3 (2h 30m 58s):
Dude. See now it's a little party. A greedy motherfucker would've made that room. 400 seats like some other club chains and shit. Oh, 400 seats.

4 (2h 31m 7s):
Whole,

3 (2h 31m 7s):
We gotta sell tickets.

4 (2h 31m 8s):
The whole setup from the very beginning of this club was never to make money. It was always, I, if I can break even, I'm happy. I want to make the best environment for developing standup Comedy for both professionals and for amateurs. And the best place for people to see it. Where they can see like world class people coming in every weekend. Like this weekend is Joe DeRosa. He's there tonight and tomorrow we, you know, we've had Louis CK is the one that helped me design the place. Dave Chappelle came by the first week. We have Shane Gillis there all the time. Ron White's there all the time. Brian Simpson's there all the time. It's just killer after killer after killer. No, I see it. I know Tony's there every Monday night.

4 (2h 31m 48s):
I mean we got it. Do we got it cooking Exactly at the right temperature. It's perfect. The environment is super positive. Everybody's doing really well. All the door people are doing really well. Everybody's killing it.

3 (2h 32m 1s):
Now. Who's in the main room today?

4 (2h 32m 2s):
Tonight's Joe DeRosa.

3 (2h 32m 4s):
And who's in the little

4 (2h 32m 5s):
Room? That's a good question. But you could do a set. 100%. They already said, if you wanna do a set, come on down.

3 (2h 32m 9s):
Yeah, I'ma see what's going on.

4 (2h 32m 10s):
This because like a bunch of people stop by Tony Hinch. Cliff will do a set. He'll, he'll stop by and do sets. People are dropping in all the time. Like Giannis pos came up last night. Paul Shore was there on Tuesday night. Paul's killing it. Paul's killing it. Paul's killing it. Paul's killing Paul's loose and silly and having fun. Now

3 (2h 32m 27s):
He's having fun.

4 (2h 32m 27s):
He's having a lot. Dude. He came and he was on in the, on the stage in the little boy and he came off stage and I grabbed him and I, go do that. Is is funny, as I've seen you in a decade. I go, that was so good. And he was like, you see me at the store and I'm tense. There he goes. It's just like, 'cause it was such a part of my childhood and you know, they kind of pushed him out. Did you see

5 (2h 32m 44s):
This little thing?

3 (2h 32m 45s):
Yeah.

4 (2h 32m 46s):
Oh, he's playing Richard Simmons, right? Yeah. So they,

5 (2h 32m 48s):
They announced that he is gonna be in a full movie, but they also put out the same time. This little short, which is interesting. It's only a minute long.

4 (2h 32m 58s):
Paul. He's a different dude now. It's cool to see. He's he's a sweet guy. He's funny to be around. He's a sweet guy. He's sweet guy.

3 (2h 33m 5s):
I check in with him.

16 (2h 33m 8s):
Your weight doesn't matter. If you like yourself, you're gonna be fine. But I've been where you are right now.

5 (2h 33m 19s):
This came from a meme online.

4 (2h 33m 21s):
That's hilarious. I know

16 (2h 33m 23s):
Because I just love myself. Every part of myself and I think I can show you how to get here.

15 (2h 33m 30s):
Please welcome Richard.

5 (2h 33m 33s):
I think that's it for this one.

4 (2h 33m 34s):
Wow. So it's gonna be a real movie. Yeah.

3 (2h 33m 37s):
He does look like him.

4 (2h 33m 38s):
He looks a lot like him. Yeah,

3 (2h 33m 39s):
He does look like

4 (2h 33m 39s):
Him. And Paul can fucking act. Paul can act I know he is done like the silly movies like Encino managed shit. But you give him an opportunity to do something like that. A lot of comics can act,

3 (2h 33m 50s):
Bro. He's been around this game forever. 50 fucking years. Forever. He has it all covered. Yeah, he saw him coming. He's seen what happened to them.

4 (2h 34m 1s):
It's also, he's evolved as a person. He's like a fun person to be around now. He's

3 (2h 34m 5s):
Cool. He's very cool. Very

4 (2h 34m 6s):
Cool. And he's really comfortable at the club. He's been at the club a ton of times. Did a weekend there recently. And he was just there Tuesday. He was there Wednesday doing the, the little room and the big room. He having a good time, man. He's, he's like loose now. Like he did kill Tony on Monday night. He sang a song. He sang Bad to the Bone. It's fun. Were you

3 (2h 34m 27s):
There?

4 (2h 34m 28s):
Yeah, I was there. I, I brought Matt Lichtenberg. Okay. Down to kill Tony so I could check it out. We went to dinner and I took him to the club. Monday Night special there. That's a special show, man. Harlan Williams was on fire. Oh my god. Harlan was there last weekend and he was, he was there for Kill Tony on Monday. He was on fire. He was on fire. It's amazing. It's just the vibe of the club. It's so fun.

3 (2h 34m 54s):
I'm really proud of Tony and Red Band for what they did.

4 (2h 34m 57s):
Dude, they sold out Madison Square Garden two nights in a row. They sold out the HEB center here two nights in a row. They, they sold out big arenas. All they're gonna sell, they sell out in Los Angeles. They sold out a 7,000 seat theater in an hour. I mean. It's crazy. It's crazy. It's crazy. Crazy. They're killing it. They're killing it. And that show is different every night. Every night you can go to two shows in a row. You're not gonna see the same show. It's a totally different show. So like, you know, they can come into a town and do three, four nights. Easy, easy, easy. That's

3 (2h 35m 30s):
Really crazy. The fucking garden.

4 (2h 35m 32s):
Yeah, the garden. It's amazing. Two nights in a fucking row.

3 (2h 35m 37s):
I still remember Tony telling me this 10 years ago, eight years ago, that this is what he wanted to do. So kudos to him, brother. He

4 (2h 35m 45s):
Is the best at hosting that kind of a show. Nobody better. He's the fucking best. He's the best ever at it. He's so quick and he's such a mean little fuck.

3 (2h 35m 55s):
He's a mean little fuck.

4 (2h 35m 56s):
He's a mean little fuck. But he's also super supportive. If you're good, you know. and it, it's a great platform for standup because there's no woke bullshit. There's no ideology. There's no fucking playing and pandering. You got one minute. You got one minute, one minute. And the currency is funny. What can, can you be funny in a minute? It doesn't matter if you are white or you're black or you're trans or you're gay or you're straight or you're, no one gives a fuck. Are you funny? You have one minute. And they take everybody, anybody outta outta that fucking hat. You can't bribe your way into that hat. People have tried. I've seen it.

4 (2h 36m 35s):
I've seen people say, listen, could you get my ba My banker wants to come. Tony's like, Nope, nope. I don't care who is asking me. Donald Trump could ask him. They're like, Nope. Nope. That fuck. That's, that's a holy bucket. That bucket is 100% randos. Dig in there. Bob Wilson and Bob Wilson comes out and he had no idea. He's coming out and they're like, Ooh. And you see those people and they do one minute and the band's there and the audience is there. And like some of it's their first time ever doing standup.

3 (2h 37m 4s):
Could you do a minute?

4 (2h 37m 6s):
No. Could I? Yeah, I could. But I have never,

3 (2h 37m 9s):
We did three to get into the store. Yeah. I had to do three then 10, then she made me. Yeah. but it was three. How

4 (2h 37m 15s):
Long did you it take for you to get in

3 (2h 37m 18s):
Dog? I broke the record.

4 (2h 37m 19s):
Yeah. How long?

3 (2h 37m 21s):
I got to la January 29th, 1997. and I was a regular February 19th, 1997.

4 (2h 37m 31s):
Wow. That's pretty quick. That's quick.

3 (2h 37m 34s):
I didn't have to lick nobody's balls or nothing. Stan Hope, I'm gonna tell you who referred me. Stan Hope Mencia and somebody else. I forget who it was. And Scott called me and he goes, I've heard good things about you. I'm gonna showcase you, but it's gonna be in about six months. And I knowing me and my criminal, I go six months. I don't even know if I'm gonna make this six months. And he goes, okay, you gotta showcase. We'll let you know. When two weeks later he called me and he goes, I got a three minute spot that opened up. You wanna come down tonight? Yeah. Came down. There was petrified of Mitzi.

4 (2h 38m 13s):
She watched you first set.

3 (2h 38m 15s):
First set. Watched me, came off, shook her hand. Thank you for the opportunity. I thought it was gonna pass out. Wow. I thought it was gonna pass out. 'cause in my mind it was this while I was going back to being a criminal.

4 (2h 38m 27s):
Well what she liked about guys like you though is that you were raw. Yeah. She liked raw people. No, she liked it with talent. That was her favorite thing. She didn't like people when they had already made it. She didn't like, she told Seinfeld, this place is not for you. Seinfeld was too big already. She's like, nah, the place is not for you. She's a wild lady man in that regard.

3 (2h 38m 47s):
And that's what I do. Whenever I miss her, I think about it. I call Paul. Mm. Whenever I think of Mitzi, I call Paulie. I'm thinking about your mom brother.

4 (2h 38m 54s):
Love it. It's fun being in the bar downstairs that's named after his mom. So we're in Mitzi's and there's a photo of Mitzi just like that, like that painting that we have in the wall in here.

3 (2h 39m 5s):
She saved my life brother.

4 (2h 39m 7s):
She saved a lot of

3 (2h 39m 8s):
Her lives. I had no chance of being an adult, no chance of ever doing anything in my life. No chance until I walked into that fucking Comedy club. Yeah. And she made me a regular. And when I went back the next week and I had 10 minutes and she was like, you are a regular calling Monday for spots talk. I didn't know what to do. Yeah. But I knew that if I kept my nose clean, but I knew I only have like a year or two before something happens. I hit somebody with a chair. Yeah. Or I steal something. You know, that was my mo. Yeah. But her putting me in there made me go okay. You know, let's, and it was me, holtzman you. You know we had some fucking savages there in the beginning.

3 (2h 39m 48s):
But if you really think about my life, I got all the great things outta my life from the Comedy store, everything. My daughter, everything. Our friendship, everything. What didn't I get from the Comedy store?

4 (2h 39m 60s):
We had a family there. I

3 (2h 40m 1s):
Got a life man.

4 (2h 40m 2s):
Yeah. It was a, it was a very special place for all of us.

3 (2h 40m 5s):
You know, I look at the pictures at night 'cause they post 'em on Facebook of the club. The mothership from the night before when they show the, not when they show you fucking momos on stage. But when they show the staff working there, when I see that young staff, I remember the great times we had on New Year's Eve. Yeah. And Christmas. and it was a family. Yeah. Gave a fuck about a Christmas tree when you're regular at the store. Right. You know what I'm saying? Who wasn't at the, and now they closed on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. Yeah. But I still remember having a spot on Christmas Day and going people like, what type of animal are you? Fuck it's Comedy store.

4 (2h 40m 41s):
We both did spots on Christmas

3 (2h 40m 43s):
Day. I did. I always did

4 (2h 40m 44s):
One Thanksgiving quiet family. I always did spots on Christmas

3 (2h 40m 46s):
Dog. I ate a bag of mushrooms once in a on Thanksgiving and went up there and the fucking, the purple lights had me. Yeah. I mean, you know, I don't know how many sets I did in the original room, but now looking at it, if it wasn't for Mitzi Shaw, 'cause I would've left in six months And my job was, my goal at that time was if I fail in LA I'm driving back, I'm gonna make a pit stop. I'm gonna stab a few people in Colorado and then I'm going back to New York to hide. That was my plan. That was my plan. If failure would've came in LA and I would've got thrown outta there.

4 (2h 41m 19s):
Well I remember when you cracked the code and you're a guy that I've always said, you were the funniest guy in the parking lot. And there was something that was missing in translation between you being the funny guy in the parking lot and you being the guy on stage and you just figured it out one day. It's like one day you figured it out. It was very interesting

3 (2h 41m 39s):
Becoming yourself. Yeah.

4 (2h 41m 40s):
That's it. 'cause you were like trying to do jokes before you were like trying to do standup the way standups do jokes. And something happened and I think it was like a certain level of I don't give a fuck anymore. Like where too many agents had lied to you, too many auditions had fell through. Too many this, too many that. And you're like, what am I trying to make these people happy for? And you just were yourself on stage. Like you'd almost like given up hope of the the the bullshit. Yeah. Golden ring. You act what? Yeah.

3 (2h 42m 10s):
You know I never understood writing shit that had nothing to do with you. Right. You gotta write shit that's close to your fucking heart and your balls. Right? Yeah. You wanna, you want, I always wanted to be fucking somebody else sometimes. Right. I wish I wasn't dirty. I wish I was a better joke writer. I wish so many things. But what I was doing, a lot of those guys that are straight traditional standup, wish they were doing

4 (2h 42m 34s):
That guy that we keep forgetting with the dreadlocks. aj

3 (2h 42m 37s):
Jamal.

4 (2h 42m 38s):
JJ Jamal. AJ Jamal. That was it. Just popped.

3 (2h 42m 41s):
Let's look him up. Let's see where he's at.

4 (2h 42m 42s):
Yeah. That dude was funny.

3 (2h 42m 44s):
Aj, Jamal

4 (2h 42m 45s):
And I. Remember that dude, he used to bother you. 'cause he was so there he is. He used to bother you that he was so funny. Clean. He's still, wow. He's only got 1,400 followers. That's crazy. What was his last post?

17 (2h 43m 0s):
Let's see. He's doing

4 (2h 43m 2s):
Funny Fucking dude though.

3 (2h 43m 4s):
And great

4 (2h 43m 5s):
Guy. No, no, no. I mean his last post on Instagram

3 (2h 43m 7s):
And great fucking guy.

4 (2h 43m 8s):
That's not really his, I don't know. Looking for, yeah. That's him. This was over two years ago.

3 (2h 43m 13s):
Oh wow.

4 (2h 43m 14s):
Over two years ago. Great

3 (2h 43m 16s):
Guy. Great guy. I, not that I didn't like him.

4 (2h 43m 19s):
No, no, no, no, no. You were just, it bothered you that he was so clean that you weren't clean and made you self-conscious. I remember you to tell me about that. I, I hated going on after that guy. He would

3 (2h 43m 27s):
Bury me. He

4 (2h 43m 28s):
Would kill and he, he would bury

3 (2h 43m 29s):
Me. Him and Don Marrero made a habit of burying me. And Dom made a habit of rubbing it in my face afterwards. Dom was brutal to me in those days.

4 (2h 43m 38s):
Yeah. But he was just being dumb.

3 (2h 43m 39s):

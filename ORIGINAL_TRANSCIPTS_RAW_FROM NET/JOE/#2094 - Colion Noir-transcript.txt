Train by day. Joe Rogan podcast by night. All day,

3 (13s):
Bro. What's up? Not much man. Good to see you. Good to be back. We had a full Texas Day today, dude. Yeah. Full

4 (18s):
Texas. Doesn't, doesn't get more Texas than that.

3 (20s):
Shotguns ate barbecue. Went to the staccato range. How sick is that place?

4 (25s):
Man? Dude, you should have, like, I remember when I first went there, like, I called it the ghetto because that's what dude, but it like, there was nothing there. Just dirt. Just dirt. And like, they had some, they had some bays and stuff like that too. And we, you know, me, my videographer, we did some shooting out there and we filmed, but it was like nothing like it is now. Yeah. Now it looks like an entire little village. They're dumping of guns. A

3 (45s):
Ton of money to that place,

4 (46s):
Dude. Like Yeah, like when we were going around, he was showing us like the whole property. I was like, I don't know if you saw my face. I was like, what

3 (54s):
The fuck? I know. There's a lot. It must be a lot of money and selling really good guns. Yeah.

4 (58s):
Yeah. To say the least. 'cause I

3 (60s):
Like the lake. Like, you guys have a lake. Like, why'd you build a lake? It's like, we don't have a lake.

4 (1m 5s):
I'm not gonna lie. I've, I've, I, there's something about water. Like if I ever bought like property, like if I just get over this hole, like I have to be in the city shit. Like I buy property, I'd want some like body of water, something.

3 (1m 16s):
Explain to me that I have to be in the city.

4 (1m 19s):
I'm just a city rat. Like, I like you just always like it. Yeah. Just the buzz and the energy of the city is something that I just, it's in me. So it's like, like I can still, like, every year, you know, I'll go out to like Utah and go, go and do all of the, you know, eat, love, pray shit. And then,

3 (1m 35s):
But you just have to

4 (1m 36s):
Back in the city. I, I, yeah. I got, I gotta come back to the streets. Yeah.

3 (1m 38s):
That's crazy. Yeah. I like staying in cities. Yeah. Like when I stay in New York City, I'm there for a weekend, but by the time Sunday rolls around, I'm like, all right, get me the fuck outta here. Yeah. I don't like it. I've never liked it. Even when I lived in New York, I didn't live in the city, I in the suburbs. Ah. I lived, but that was 'cause I couldn't afford it. I couldn't afford an apartment. Gotcha. That had parking. Like it's parking in New York City.

4 (1m 58s):
Oh yeah, you're right. Yeah. It's crazy.

3 (1m 59s):
Yeah. Yeah. and I have to do the road. I travel a lot to do standup. I have to be able to drive to gigs. So I was driving to Connecticut and New Jersey and just to get a parking spot. I forget how much it cost back then was the nineties. but it was, it was outta my budget.

4 (2m 13s):
I'm honestly, like, I love cities, so anytime I go to city, if I travel to a different, to a state I've never been to before, I always wanna stay in the city. and I always go to their downtowns. New York is one of the places that I genuinely do not like in terms really? No, I don't know what it is. I, I genuinely did not like it. Which is weird because I like big cities, but for something about New York, I was just kind of like me. Really? I don't, dude, I, that

3 (2m 39s):
Doesn't make any sense. 'cause it's the I know most city, city. I,

4 (2m 42s):
I, I wish I could articulate it, but

3 (2m 43s):
It was just a feeling is not interesting.

4 (2m 45s):
And it wasn't even like, during a weird time. Like I didn't go like during Covid or anything like that. It was, it was pretty normal time.

3 (2m 52s):
During Covid, they made some weird law in New York City where you're allowed to eat outside. So they built indoor places outside. So they basically built like these, like, there, there were like little trailers that they set up outside and they put, you know, dining tables in and nice lighting and shit. You seen this one? Oh yeah. New York City drivers will have to pay $15 to ride through Manhattan.

4 (3m 19s):
Yeah. I did not know that.

3 (3m 20s):
You have debate money to drive through the city. Well, First

4 (3m 22s):
Of all, oh, this is new. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3 (3m 24s):
Oh, they're outta money.

4 (3m 25s):
Yeah. Well, yeah. This what happens when you make stupid politics decisions.

3 (3m 30s):
Yeah. You make terrible policy decisions and you say that you're a sanctuary city and then Texas goes, okay, great. And then just fucking, it's kind of a gangster move by Abbott I mean it's pretty gangster. If you're dealing with the border and the border is where you are and everyone's like, we are a sanctuary. Oh, are you? Yeah. Wonderful. Yeah. I got an idea.

4 (3m 54s):
What,

3 (3m 54s):
What is going on? Do you, have you been paying attention to this standoff between Texas and the bidet administration in terms of the border? Like Texas has put a barbed wire and the bidet administration wants the barbed wire taken down.

4 (4m 9s):
I, I, I'll be honest and tell you, I haven't been following it super close, which is odd. 'cause I'm Texas born and raised. And the weird thing is, is living in Dallas, you, you're almost still kind of disconnected from what's going on at the border a little bit. Right? 'cause you're so far north. Right. But even in Houston, 'cause you know, I'm in Houston a lot too. It's not something that you're confronted with daily. But, but anybody from Texas, usually at some point in time, some at some point in time.

3 (4m 33s):
What, what was that? Sorry,

4 (4m 35s):
I was

5 (4m 35s):
Checking a video and

4 (4m 37s):
At some point in time you're gonna go, you're gonna go towards the border. Yeah. And, and you're, and you're gonna see it for yourself. But what I do know of it, I mean at this point we I mean we're trying not to lose control of it. Essentially, from what I can gather, what

3 (4m 49s):
Is happening I

4 (4m 50s):
Know,

3 (4m 51s):
Whose idea is it

4 (4m 52s):
In terms of what,

3 (4m 53s):
Who's letting this happen? Like who's, it seems very organized. These people know the border's open so they know they can just walk through.

4 (5m 1s):
I think, I think there is, there's a lot of virtue signaling, I think involved in all of the whole, like, like you talking about with New York saying, you know, we're, we're a sanctuary city. Just yes. We accept everyone to come in, just not our state in our city. Right. Right. And so I think you have that combined with the reality of what happens when you have a border that honestly is not being checked. Right. So if you, if you have, if you have a situation where you have people who are able to just come in and leave as they, I wouldn't necessarily necessarily say leave, but coming into a state and it's a choke point. 'cause it's, yeah. A lot of it's coming in through Texas. So, you know, it's easy to have that philosophy of, oh, you know, leave the border, don't, don't make the border, get rid of the barbed wire, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

4 (5m 47s):
Because we wanna seem as if we are welcoming to everyone. and I don't think it's a matter of not wanting to be welcoming. I think it has a lot to do with the same reason why you have a front door with locks on it on your house. Yeah. Right. At least have a checkpoint to say, okay, well if you wanna come in, I need to know who I'm dealing with.

3 (6m 3s):
Well, did you see they had this one guy that was on video that he said, you'll see who I am soon. And then they found out he is on like, some terrorist watch list or something like that.

4 (6m 12s):
Yeah, I it. Oh,

3 (6m 13s):
Terrific. But

4 (6m 14s):
That doesn't surprise me though.

3 (6m 16s):
Well, it doesn't surprise me either. but it seems too convenient that it's happening with the numbers that it's happening and it seems organized. and I would like to know, like, how is it getting to those people? Or is anyone supplying them with resources? Is anyone telling them how to do it? Is this organized?

4 (6m 33s):
I think it is. I do I have any proof or data to back it up? No, it's a hunch. Yeah. Just because it just, it just doesn't really make sense. I don't think anybody who's honestly being hon like being honest with themselves. You're not gonna be someone who says, you know what? I just want an open border where any and everyone can come in at will without anybody checking who's actually coming into the country.

3 (6m 54s):
No, it's

4 (6m 55s):
Insane. It, it makes no sense.

3 (6m 56s):
It's insane. And it's not the case if you fly in. Yeah. Which is nuts. So if like, you're coming from some country and you, you know, if you want to immigrate to the United States, it's hard. Yeah. Like you have to prove that you have some sort of a exceptional skill. Yeah. There's some reason for you to be here and you, you have to, you get a work visa. Yeah. You have to apply for citizenship.

4 (7m 19s):
I mean, let's just keep it real. Like there are a lot of people who just don't like this country. Yeah. And they would love to get into the country and cause damage to the country any way they can. Yes. So I, I think for anyone to say that they don't, that they are for open borders

3 (7m 36s):
At least there's got to be a percentage of the people that are coming across that we don't want here. There has to be

4 (7m 42s):
I mean, that's just, that's

3 (7m 43s):
Just reality. Just reality. Yeah. Yeah. I mean as much as you wanna be a kind person. Look, I am the grandchild of immigrants. None of my family came from America. They all came from Italy and Ireland. They all came over here.

4 (7m 54s):
My parents are immigrants.

3 (7m 55s):
Yeah. So it's like, we're not anti-immigration. Yeah. but it just seems like, God damn, you gotta make sure you're not letting terrorists in. It seems so simple. Yeah.

4 (8m 4s):
But like I said, I think a lot of it has to do, I think there's some grandstanding and there's some virtue signaling going on as well. Yeah. I I I think, I think the administration honestly is trying to, trying to walk that walk that line of No, we're so progressive and, you know, while at the same time, honestly trying to stick it to Texas.

3 (8m 22s):
Yeah.

4 (8m 23s):
I I think, I think I mean we're, this is a, it's a, it's a dick swinging competition at this point. Why

3 (8m 27s):
Would you have a dick swinging competition about the border that seems so insane that you would want people to take down a barrier to

4 (8m 33s):
Entry. You know what, I think what, I think it has a lot to do with Trump. 'cause you know, when he was running his campaign, he was running a lot of it based on the idea he was gonna build able that wild and border. Yeah. And so that became, that became a, a separation point for a lot of people in the country with respect to what side they fell on. and I think there's a, there's a particular party in this country that utilized it as a, as a lightning rod to create that level of division. And so I think they're kind of trying to reestablish that again,

3 (8m 59s):
Which is one of the things that's even more gangster about Abbott sending people to Chicago, sending people to New York because in Chicago they're get these fucking people out.

4 (9m 8s):
It's people

3 (9m 9s):
Outta here. Right. And the people that live in Chicago, the poor people in Chicago, this is bullshit. These people are getting money. They're getting, they're they're getting all this help. They're getting food, they're getting all this stuff that we don't have.

4 (9m 19s):
Yeah. People literally in the place who live there

3 (9m 22s):
Their whole lives. Yeah. And then all of a sudden these people sneak in and they're getting this special treatment.

4 (9m 27s):
I think there's also a level of, of trying to pass the buck a little bit. Or, or kind of a mass distraction. Because when you look in, when you look at these major cities and you see the conditions that a lot of these people are living in, in our own country. Right. You start to ask yourself, okay, well why, why are these conditions, why do they exist? Right. And there are very particularized there and very particular places within this country. So it begs the question, it's like, what? Why can't we fix this issue? Right? Right. Like, they're talking about how we want to help these people. They're, they want to come into the country because they're running away from a shitty life. And in a, in terrible environments. I mean you mean the ones that are synonymous, the ones that we actually have in the country as well, but yet we haven't been able to address that issue.

4 (10m 8s):
Exactly.

3 (10m 8s):
Right.

4 (10m 8s):
Exactly. But I, I think it's a way to kind of push that to the side and, and sweep it under the rug and say, no, it, this is, it's a sexier problem to have when we're trying to deal with people coming from other countries. Right. And we want to help them because we're so noble and so brave. But I'm like, you haven't even taken care of what's going on in your own home.

3 (10m 26s):
And part of the reason why the place they are at sucks. Yeah. The reason why they come over here is 'cause of what we're doing to those countries.

4 (10m 33s):
They knew that.

3 (10m 34s):
Yeah. There's part of that too. I mean, it's part of like, when we shipped all those fucking jobs overseas and these people are making pennies on the dollar to make goods that we can buy here slightly cheaper. Yeah.

4 (10m 45s):
I mean

3 (10m 45s):
I mean destroyed unions and destroyed American manufacturing. And

4 (10m 50s):
You know, I I'm not gonna go so far as to say a little bit is a little, a little bit of that is our fault as well as consumers. Because when you do try to make stuff in America, right, yeah. They're gonna be more expensive. Yeah. You know what I mean? And so, and a lot of people aren't willing to pay that price hike in order to have stuff produced in America. So you, they basically, companies become incentivized to then go and have these things created elsewhere. Because I've seen companies where they struggle because they're trying to make everything in America. Right. But that, but that comes with the price that a lot of people aren't willing to pay. Right. And so I I wonder how much, you know, it's kind of like with climate change, it's like how much of that is affecting a lot of the manufacturing and so forth going overseas?

3 (11m 35s):
Some of it is, but there's enough people that want to buy American made products from people that get paid a fair wage. That if you advertise that and make

4 (11m 43s):
That a part, a lot of people say they do.

3 (11m 45s):
Well, a lot of people do look at Origin. Yeah. Origin can't keep clothes on the shelves. Everything's flying off their boots, their clothes, their hunting gear. They can barely keep 'em in stock. Everybody wants it. 'cause it's a hundred percent American.

4 (11m 56s):
Do you think that's the only reason why?

3 (11m 58s):
What do you think it's, I

4 (11m 59s):
Don't know. I'm not familiar. I'm not, I'm not that familiar with Origin, honestly.

3 (12m 1s):
Well, origin is my friend Jocko's company and I'm a part of it. And I know that what they're doing is very popular. Gotcha. and it's very popular because they've, that's part of their mission statement. Bring back American manufacturing, you know, put, take pride in the fact that these, these things that you're wearing, these things that you purchase, things you use every day is a hundred percent American. Made everything down to the buttons, the threads, everything. Put together all the cloth. Everything's sourced from America. A hundred

4 (12m 29s):
Percent. A hundred percent. A a hundred

3 (12m 30s):
Percent.

4 (12m 30s):
That's actually pretty damn impressive. Yeah. Pretty damn

3 (12m 32s):
Impressive. The only thing they don't have from America. There's a part of a boot that you can only get in South America. Gotcha. So even that's America. It's just South America, but not United States. But that's one piece. And they eventually are planning on figuring out a way to manufacture that.

4 (12m 46s):
Is that, is that where the name comes from? Origin? don

3 (12m 48s):
Don't know.

4 (12m 49s):
It fits.

3 (12m 50s):
It does fit, yeah. It does fit I don. I don't know the origin of the name,

4 (12m 54s):
But

3 (12m 54s):
The, but I feel like if you had an American made cell phone, I've been saying this forever. Yeah. Gimme a fucking iPhone that's made by people that aren't working for slave wages. Give me an iPhone that's not made in a factory where people have nets around the building to keep people from jumping off the roof because they hate their lives. Yeah. Give me a fact. Gimme me a phone that is not, that you didn't get sourced the materials by slave labor in the Congo. Can you fucking do that? Is it possible to do that? 'cause if it is, what, how much more is it? I wonder is it $300 more? I'll pay $300 more for a phone that I know I don't have to feel like shit about.

4 (13m 30s):
I I begs the question though, you know, you and I Yeah, I would do it.

3 (13m 35s):
I think enough people would,

4 (13m 35s):
But I have the monetary ability to do it. I wonder. Yes. I wonder how much of, you know, the, the people who can, who aren't necessarily in the economic position to pay like to them. That's, that's that's considerable markup, right? Yeah. and I wonder how much of that and I don't know. I wonder how much of that plays into a part of, you know, facilitating this kind of shipping, our manufacturing, everything overseas because they can build things cheaper and then people continue to buy it. So maybe I, I take a step back and I say, all right, maybe it's not just a, oh yeah, they say they want American but aren't willing to pay for it. Maybe some people, maybe a large part of people just can't don don't know.

3 (14m 8s):
Large percentage of people probably can't. The people that are living check to check can't. But there's enough people that are not living check to check. That's true. That would feel better about buying something. And maybe instead of buying an iPhone every year or a cell phone every year, buy one every other year or every two years, every three year. Like it's Yeah. It's feasible. It makes

4 (14m 29s):
Very feasible makes. Now granted I'm guilty.

3 (14m 31s):
I got a fucking iPhone 11. I keep, one of my phones is an iPhone 11. The motherfucker works perfect. Yeah.

4 (14m 36s):
I I'm, I'm literally the person you're talking about. I upgrade my phone on the day the new one comes out. Me too. To the minute

3 (14m 44s):
I got 15. I've no reason to have this fucking phone. There's no reason. And

4 (14m 47s):
Granted I live and die by my, like, this is, these phones do everything for me now.

3 (14m 52s):
Yeah, me too. I

4 (14m 53s):
Have reached a point now where I'm kind of like, I don't want to upgrade, but for no other reason than I don't wanna have to go through the like, update process. Like changing, like the changeover process is really annoying.

3 (15m 4s):
It is weird. And sometimes like phone numbers get all fucked up. Yeah. Or something happened where phone numbers got attached in iMessage to old emails of other people. Yes.

4 (15m 17s):
Yeah. It's, I've had some really spooky stuff happen on my phones and I'm like, what the hell's going on here? Yeah. Like I had a friend tell me, he was like, he's like, I called you and somebody else picked up. Yeah. I had that happen to my friend too. Okay. Okay. Good. Yeah.

3 (15m 31s):
I go, dude, is this your phone number goes? Yeah. I go, bro, a woman answered the phones. That's

4 (15m 35s):
Exactly what happened to me. Yeah.

3 (15m 36s):
Yeah. What's that?

4 (15m 37s):
I have no idea. Yeah. and I maybe I mean, I have don don't, I don't know. I mean at the end of the day, we are talking about devices Right. That are essentially super computers in our hands. Yeah. So maybe it's just the fault of the system that that just, it's bound to happen. Yeah. Where you get this kind of cross communication and it just can't keep up with it. I forgot who the comedian was. You know, he's talking about how impatient we are these days because, and it was one of my favorite bits because it's so true. He is like, we get these cell phones and then the moment it stops working a little bit, we get pissed off and it's like, it's sending message to fucking space. Oh, that's Louis. CK Louis CK. Exactly. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And so I was like, yeah, that's a very poignant point.

3 (16m 19s):
It's a very good point. And yeah, I mean it's easy to get annoyed at technology when it doesn't suit your needs. But it's just

4 (16m 25s):
You connect. Sorry. Yeah.

3 (16m 28s):
Yeah. The TRX. Yeah. My TRX has this system, this I love the, the truck. It's awesome. It's amazing. But that system is whack. You have one too, right? Yeah. I So you connect is whack.

4 (16m 37s):
I did a whole, I did a whole video on Instagram about it. I literally, I I it's the worst infotainment system I've ever experienced in a vehicle.

3 (16m 45s):
It sometimes just doesn't connect to it's CarPlay. It's possessed.

4 (16m 48s):
Yeah. It, I've literally driven 15 minutes and it has connected and disconnected. Oh yeah. Five times. Oh yeah. I'm like, this is if, and then I step on the gas and I hear that, that wine. Oh

3 (16m 59s):
Yeah. and I don't

4 (16m 60s):
About

3 (17m 0s):
It.

4 (17m 1s):
I don.

3 (17m 4s):
It's mine's at Hennessy right now. Yeah. They have replaced in the screen or something. Something is wrong with the screen. It just shut off.

4 (17m 11s):
I want to take my Hennessy. I haven't done it yet. Yeah. It's addictive. I wanna get the unnecessary thousand power,

3 (17m 16s):
1000 horsepower pickup truck is strip, but the one that comes outta the factory. 700. Yeah. I'm

4 (17m 20s):
Like, what is wrong with me? It's dumb. It's not. But I mean America, right? America. Yeah.

3 (17m 25s):
Yeah. They're making, you know how the Dodge Demon is a thousand horsepower? The new one. They're making a 1700 horsepower Dodge Demon. They're

4 (17m 32s):
Making nothing. I thought they, I thought it was gonna be the last one.

3 (17m 34s):
No. Hennessy is, oh, Hennessy.

4 (17m 35s):
So Hennessy, that's Tennessee. Hennessy does shit like that, dude. Psycho.

3 (17m 38s):
What a psycho. I love imagine just getting a thousand horsepower, two-door car and going,

4 (17m 43s):
Man, I need, it needs more power. But it's, it's amazing how accustomed you get to speed. Yeah. Like you can get like I mean it probably takes all in all with consistent driving. I'd say about three weeks before you're like, I can use some more power. Like, that's

3 (18m 3s):
The problem with Teslas. Yeah.

4 (18m 5s):
I'm,

3 (18m 5s):
That's the problem with Teslas. I'm still, you go I know you like engines, you like the sound. But if you go from that fucking car, go from the plaid, the zero to 60 in 1.9 seconds, silently like a fucking time traveling machine. I think

4 (18m 18s):
I feel disconnect. I feel, I think it freaked me out a little bit. 'cause it just, without the sound and the noise, it's, it's kind of like the, have you driven it?

3 (18m 25s):
Have you

4 (18m 25s):
Tried it? I've driven a Tesla, well not a plaid, but I've driven one of the earlier model Teslas. There are aspects to it. Like, I'm not anti electric. I'm just anti get rid of ice engines in order to bring in electric. Right. That's my issue. I want a choice. Well,

3 (18m 41s):
Toyota's not going that way. It's really interesting. 'cause they get a lot of pushback because of that. Toyota is embracing hybrids. They're like, this doesn't make any sense. Like what? Like you want range. Yeah. And with hybrids you get all the range of a re vehicle, but you get a lot of fuel economy. So you get more range and then you get also the option of extra power. And that's one of the things that Honda did with their last NSX, which was Yeah. One of the most underappreciated supercars that's ever existed. That fucking last nx. NSX was a monster. I

4 (19m 12s):
To the life of me cannot understand why it didn't do well

3 (19m 15s):
Because it's an Acura.

4 (19m 17s):
Yeah. But even, but but everybody, everybody wets their pants over the older NSX and

3 (19m 21s):
It was Yeah. But only car dorks like us. That's true. Like the average person does not with their pants over an old NSX. That's true. Like what is this fucking old Honda?

4 (19m 31s):
We're so, we're so brand

3 (19m 32s):
Identifying. Oh, people are so brand on. Like if you pull up in your Lamborghini Right. That sick Lamborghini that you have, that thing is like, God damn, if you're gonna spend that kind of money, that's the response you want. but it

4 (19m 42s):
Pull but's still just an Audi.

3 (19m 45s):
It is an Audi. Yeah. Yeah. It is an Audi kind of. But that makes it better because now it's actually reliable.

4 (19m 51s):
Which is true. I think the marriage, I think one of the best marriages between car manufacturers was Audi and Lamborghini. Yeah. I, because everybody knew Lamborghinis were this, this unreliable but fantastically fun, beautiful pieces of shit. Right, right. And then you get the, you get the German engineering of a Adi and then you combine that with the flair and the pomp and circumstance that you get with the Italians. And it's just a beautiful marriage.

3 (20m 15s):
It's just Lamborghini is like 10% too much. Douche

4 (20m 20s):
I know that. It's just a, that's, that's why I, it's just, I, I literally, I literally decided to get one just for that. I, I bullshit. It was something I said I I like, I had, I had some investments go well and I was like, you know what,

3 (20m 33s):
Let's go fuck it. Let's swing it. Yeah. Look at that. Look at that. Nex I mean that is a fucking amazing car

4 (20m 39s):
Also. It's, it is. But I also think they've take, they took too many parts. 'cause inherently I think the silhouette is gorgeous. Right. But I still think there's a lot of it that screams Acura.

3 (20m 50s):
Mm.

4 (20m 50s):
At that I know this sounds counterintuitive 'cause it is one, but I,

3 (20m 54s):
I like it I know what you're saying. Like it's not quite exotic enough. Exactly.

4 (20m 57s):
Yeah. At least for the price point. If they, if they brought it and came in at a price point sub a hundred, they wouldn't have be able to keep 'em.

3 (21m 3s):
They're still selling the R eight. That's a fucking monster car too. You know, it's also a car that's not appreciated enough. don don't believe

4 (21m 10s):
I am a little kind of indifferent about the art.

3 (21m 13s):
Really?

4 (21m 13s):
Yeah. I drove one once and it just, I couldn't help but feel like, now keep in mind, in all fairness, it was the early, like first generation R Oh, okay. I haven't Dr I haven't driven any of the, the newer generations. my

3 (21m 23s):
Friend Everlast had one of the earlier ones. It was pretty dope. But that was back when it was new. Is this the newest one? This

6 (21m 29s):
Is the one I'm on is a 23.

3 (21m 32s):
God damn that thing's sick. What is that? That's the next one. Oh yeah. Oh. It'll be fully electric. It's after the Rh

6 (21m 39s):
Next supercar.

4 (21m 40s):
Don don't know about this one. Fully electric shit. Yeah. Now you know what I'm full of shit. 'cause there is one car I drove that I was like, I actually want this.

3 (21m 48s):
What's that? The

4 (21m 49s):
Ty can.

3 (21m 49s):
Oh yeah.

4 (21m 50s):
Ty can I was like, okay.

3 (21m 52s):
All right. That's amazing that,

4 (21m 53s):
That I can, because it gave me, it was still lacking on the, the sound aspect. However, what it did do, it still gave me all the driving dynamics that you were used to with Porsche. Yes. You get what I'm saying? And

3 (22m 6s):
The interior. Exactly. Yes. Yeah. The driving dynamics are, I've driven one. Jesus. It's amazing. Amazing,

4 (22m 11s):
Amazing.

3 (22m 12s):
Like,

4 (22m 12s):
I literally, like my blood pressure just dropped the moment I got in the car.

3 (22m 15s):
Look at that thing. I mean. They, they just know how to do interiors. They know how to do ergonomics. Yep.

4 (22m 19s):
Without, without being overboard.

3 (22m 22s):
And you can also get the Jetson sound. Do you know the, what is the mission? E I know. Is that the two door one? Oh shit. Oh, they're, that looks like a four door to

4 (22m 31s):
Me. Wait, what was that? Maybe that was the concept. I think

3 (22m 32s):
They're coming up

4 (22m 33s):
With a two door. Oh, was that the concept for the, the original tie cam? I believe

3 (22m 35s):
They're coming out with a two door tie

4 (22m 37s):
Cam. Oh, mission. Okay.

3 (22m 39s):
But the sound, you can get Jetson sounds So when you hit the gas, the one I was in is like, I don't like that. Yeah, you say that until you drive it. It sounds awesome. I like

4 (22m 53s):
My car. Sound like they're farting everywhere they go.

3 (22m 55s):
Look at that. Alexa, electric sports sound off. Yeah. So it just takes off silently and then sound on. Come on man. That sounds amazing.

4 (23m 9s):
All right. All right. It wasn't see the sound you made. Yeah. And then that sound are two different things. Right. Right.

3 (23m 15s):
That's my fault. Come on. That sounds insane. That sounds like you're in a goddamn spaceship. It's a different kind of sound. Yeah. But even like the Porsche Turbo doesn't have the best sound. It

4 (23m 27s):
Doesn't 'cause I daily drive one and I love it.

3 (23m 31s):
It's so crazy fast.

4 (23m 32s):
I I, I even, I got rid of the GT three to get it, which is sacrilegious the

3 (23m 38s):
Difference in sound. Yeah.

4 (23m 39s):
Yeah. Because that, the way that GT three whales, it's, it's awe inspiring. Yeah. It's,

3 (23m 45s):
It's part of the fun.

4 (23m 47s):
And, but the turbo. But nothing can be, I think, and I'm gonna do a video on this when I start my second, my second YouTube channel. I think the Porsche Turbos is the greatest daily driving supercar on the planet ever created.

3 (24m 1s):
And they have that marriage with Volkswagen. Yes. Which is also kind of similar. Kind. Similar. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But Porsche has always, but

4 (24m 7s):
P'S always been, they they've always been Porsche. They've done,

3 (24m 10s):
They've always been reliable. Yeah. In terms of like supercars, they're like the most reliable by

4 (24m 14s):
Far. The most boring supercars, but the greatest, well not the

3 (24m 17s):
GT three or G.

4 (24m 18s):
Okay. Yeah. I'm not, I'm I'm not factoring in those, those, I look at those in more like track weapons.

3 (24m 23s):
Yeah. But they're still willing to make a six speed GT three. Yeah. And then the gt the St. Which is the, like the new one that's six speed as well. I like the

4 (24m 31s):
Sports classic. Yeah.

3 (24m 32s):
Sports classic. That, that's nice

4 (24m 33s):
Too. Yeah. With the six speed. Six speed with the, with the ducktail. Yeah.

3 (24m 37s):
They're still willing to make some driver centric cars. And there's a giant market for 'em like that GT three touring. They can't keep that in stock.

4 (24m 45s):
Yeah. Even though I think the GT three touring is kind of maybe 'cause I'm, I like, I like the wing of the original GT three. So I, the last thing I want is one without the Wing. I'm like, if I'm gonna do it without the wing, just gimme a turbo spoken

3 (24m 58s):
Like a truly Lamborghini driver.

4 (24m 59s):
I mean pretty much. Pretty much.

3 (25m 2s):
Yeah. There's a bunch of cars that just don't get the, their their deserve what they deserve, you know?

4 (25m 8s):
Yeah. I mean

3 (25m 10s):
I went down a rabbit hole last night. Well, okay. Okay. That's amazing. I went down a rabbit hole last night with the Lexus Elsie 500.

4 (25m 19s):
Ah. See you say that. I hear LFAL.

3 (25m 22s):
FFA is amazing. Yeah. But there's people that are doing wild shit with the lc 500 where they're putting wide body kits on them and straight pipes and they sound insane.

4 (25m 30s):
Well, I think it's because of the L ffa because I think, I think once the LFA didn't do as well as they expected it to do. Yeah. Because again, I think they just overpriced it because the, the, the market just wasn't ready for a fucking, what was it, like $200,000 more? I was like 300 more. Well now it is. Yeah. Because now it's like collectively.

3 (25m 47s):
But I think even out of the box, I think it was three.

4 (25m 49s):
Oh, it was like three. Yeah. See, and that for, for Lexus, that's still pushing it. Like that's the thing

3 (25m 53s):
Is a label thing. Right. Like if you want to pull up in a $300,000 car, it's gonna be a Ferrari.

4 (25m 58s):
Exactly. It's how they it's how they got away with selling you yours.

3 (26m 1s):
Yeah. Look at that.

4 (26m 2s):
The es

3 (26m 2s):
Look at that motherfucker.

4 (26m 4s):
Okay. That's, that almost looks like an eight 12.

3 (26m 6s):
Look at that fucking thing. That's with the Y body kid on it. Yeah. That's amazing. That is pretty bad ass. Yeah. But you can only get that up to like 550 horsepower with a lot of modification.

4 (26m 15s):
Are they, are they

3 (26m 16s):
Turbos? No, it's a V eight. but it sounds incredible natural

4 (26m 20s):
Aspect.

3 (26m 21s):
Yes. Oh, okay. Yeah. It sounds incredible. And the interior I know natural. The interior is insane. Lexus

4 (26m 26s):
Has always done interior.

3 (26m 27s):
See you find a video of one with a wide body because there's some awesome videos of them. 'cause they, there's a lot of people doing these now. 'cause they've been out for like, what, like six, seven years now. Yeah. There's a lot of people doing wide body kit with them. That's

4 (26m 42s):
Kind of a nasty setup.

3 (26m 43s):
That's a nasty looking car man. Ew. But with the wide body setup, you know, you're getting a wider stance. You're getting wider fat tires.

4 (26m 51s):
Not a fan of the Wing.

3 (26m 53s):
The Wings.

4 (26m 54s):
Wings a work. It's

3 (26m 55s):
Polarizing.

4 (26m 56s):
I think wings are 50 50. They either work or they don't. I think it looks

3 (26m 58s):
Great on the black cars. Yes. I think if you get it on the white car, it looks a little sus

4 (27m 2s):
Yeah. It's a little too disjointed.

3 (27m 4s):
But I saw one that was matte black with a wing and it looked fucking insane with the wide body kit. And then he had it set up with a remote control for the pipes. So you could have it even more silent than stock. You could have it like in his stock or you could have straight pipes. Oh yeah.

4 (27m 20s):
I've never ever put, I've never done aftermarket exhaust on any car I've ever owned. Really? No, I never get to it. 'cause all that hap like I'm a car horse. So So

3 (27m 30s):
You swap

4 (27m 30s):
'em out. Yeah. So by the time, but the thing is, I do a bunch of other stuff. Right. Like I'll tune them, I'll wrap 'em, I'll put all types of security features, I'll put that, all that crap. Radar detectors, blockers, all that nonsense. But then when it's time to get ready to do the aftermarket exhaust. Yeah. I'm like, Ooh, what's that?

3 (27m 47s):
There's some California fucking politician that was just trying to pass a bill to make it so you can't go more than 10 miles an hour over the speed limit in a car.

4 (27m 57s):
Yeah. He should be fired.

3 (27m 59s):
He's also one of the same guys that was a part of, there was this very controversial LBG, this guy. This is just the, is this it California Bill calls for tech to make new cars unable to speed. Now who is the guy? Who is the, the, the, the, the guy who's at the head of it? Yes. Wiener.

4 (28m 24s):
Wiener. He would be

3 (28m 25s):
Called that. He, but this guy is also the same guy that was pushing for some very controversial law about the di So there's a difference between what they're trying to, they're Yeah. Scott Wiener, he's, he's kind of a freak. Scott Wiener's kind of a freak. Like there's pictures of him, like a dog collar

4 (28m 44s):
On the

3 (28m 45s):
Name. The name is

4 (28m 45s):
Sophia at, at a gay pride parade. Oh, I know who you're

3 (28m 47s):
Talking about. Exactly. Yeah. That

4 (28m 48s):
Guy.

3 (28m 49s):
So that guy was also a part of some very, that's him. He looks like

4 (28m 52s):
A skin version of Jerry from

3 (28m 54s):
Subway. Yeah. So he is got like a leather vest on with a, with a, a tie with no shirt at the gay pride parade, which is, you know, have a good time.

4 (29m 1s):
Do you

3 (29m 2s):
Who care have a good time, but

4 (29m 3s):
You pushing it with this over 10

3 (29m 5s):
Years. But he was a part of some very, it was a very controversial bill that people were trying to misinterpret. but it was, it was about age of consent. And they were saying that age of consent, that there was some part about the way the law was structured that was discriminating against LBGT people.

4 (29m 27s):
Okay. Yeah.

3 (29m 29s):
Yeah. That's what I thought I was like, what are you trying to say? Yeah. So like, apparently there's some discretion with age gaps when it comes to heterosexual couples. So, so like say if like a girl is 16 in California, she'd be underage and a boy's 18. Well what if they started dating when the boy was 17, the girl was 15 and the guy turns 18. It's technically illegal. Yeah. So if they go to go to a judge, like a judge could say, listen, this is not a pedophile, this is a young couple, but if the guy's 40 and the girl 16, now you got a real problem.

4 (30m 3s):
So that's interesting you say that. 'cause I got, I got in, I got into kind of a little bit of shit in my law school class when I was in law school one time where we were talking about statutory rape and it, so statutory rape is a strict liability crime, basically. There's no excuse for it. She can have a fake id. She can look 30 years old and give you all the signals that she's of age. And if she's underage, you're fucked. Right. Regardless. Right,

3 (30m 25s):
Right. Even if they lie.

4 (30m 26s):
Yeah. and I didn't think that was fair. Personally. and I, there are very few people in my, in my law school class who agreed with me with respect to that. I understand the base, I understand the reasoning behind it, but I mean at that point, that person's life is done. Yeah. Especially considering if, if, and I I've known of girls and women who have gone to great lengths to mask their age and to be deceptive about it and lie about it to people. And then if somebody succumbs to that now, not only do they go to jail, now they're a sex offender Yes. For the rest of their lives. Right.

3 (31m 1s):
Well, to to your point, I have a friend and his sister's friends, they're in California, his sister's friends are 15 and he's got this giant issue because the 15-year-old friends are using fake IDs and going to LA clubs. Yeah. They're fucking sophomores in high school and they're getting into LA clubs with fake IDs.

4 (31m 22s):
And you wouldn't be able to tell

3 (31m 23s):
Just by that. You cannot tell when they're, they've hit puberty and they're wearing makeup and they're wearing sexy clothes and they're going out, sorry to say sexy about 15, you know what I'm saying? Pro provocative from

4 (31m 33s):
A stereotypical aspect of understanding what sex clubs look like. Exactly.

3 (31m 36s):
Yeah. Like that. And if you're a guy and you don't know any better,

4 (31m 40s):
It's

3 (31m 40s):
That's crazy. Yeah.

4 (31m 41s):
And we're not even talking like they're 15 and they look 17. Right. They look like 25.

3 (31m 48s):
Yeah.

4 (31m 49s):
And it's, so it's,

3 (31m 49s):
You can, you know, you can be very deceptive as a young person if you're properly dressed and if you have good genetics. Yes. You know,

4 (31m 58s):
At the same time, I still understand the basis behind Oh yeah. The strict liability aspect of law as well. Because it's like you're, you, you wanna go above and beyond to protect the youth. 100%.

3 (32m 7s):
Yeah.

4 (32m 7s):
So at the time, I guess I didn't articulate it the right way. Yeah. All I was saying was like, that doesn't seem fair. I understand. It still does. I wish like there needs to be some type of discernment given with respect to the context, the entire context of the situation.

3 (32m 23s):
Well there's some wild unfair laws in California, and one of them has to do with whether or not you are the father of a child. So I know a guy, and he unfortunately had a, a good friend who fucked his wife and he did not know this was happening. And this good friend got his wife pregnant and he raised that kid as his, his daughter. And he didn't know until after his friend was dead. His friend died. Yep. And then after his, after his friend was dead, he was stuck paying child support until that kid was 18, no matter what, even though he got a paternity test, he, he was like, something's going on.

3 (33m 6s):
Yeah. Got a paternity test, found out it was his friend's kid. Dofasting. Right. Your friend's dead. He was your best friend. Now he's dead and you're raising his fucking kid and you have to pay for it. So he tried to appeal. Nope. Fuck you, you have to pay. Welcome to go for it. But listen, but part of me is also like, listen, you don't have to be a biological father to love a child. and I have a stepdaughter. I love her. Like my daughter, if I was in that situation, I would want to still pay for that girl. I wouldn't want to give any fucking money to that woman though. Yeah. So if you have to give that woman money and then she distributes it, like that's where it gets weird. Like Yeah. Because it's up to their discretion when you pay child support.

4 (33m 45s):
Oh yeah. It goes straight to them.

3 (33m 46s):
It goes to the mom. Yeah. The mom can buy shoes. Yeah. She can go buy a purse. She doesn't have to do anything with the kid. Like, especially if she has a job already. Yeah. So the idea is you're compensating her for the fact that you have a child together. But it's up to her discretion.

4 (33m 58s):
If we're just gonna be honest, it's it like child support by and large is it's, it's a business relationship between the mother and most times between the mother and the state. Because it's not like the child support office doesn't take a portion of the money that's being paid. Right. Right. So they, they're incentivized to have as many people on child support as possible, regardless of the context and the situation. So the state is not your friend in that respect. So understanding that, it just, it just blows my mind that you can have a situation like that where he doesn't even have a choice in the matter. Right. Right. Because there's some, there I know, there, there'll be a good number of men who would say, you know what, I don't like it.

4 (34m 39s):
I'm done fucking with you. Right. As far as the mother. But you know, I still want to do what I can to help Yes. With the child. But when you put him in a position where he doesn't even have a choice in a

3 (34m 50s):
Matter, well, the dude that we're talking about was struggling too. Mm. My man was struggling. He was not. And he's gone too now, so I can talk about this, but he was struggling. He was not doing well. Yeah. And he had a monthly nut that he was obligated to pay. And he tried to, you know, his career was in the shitter. Yeah. It wasn't, it wasn't going well. And he had monthly and, and he could get jailed. That's crazy.

4 (35m 12s):
Like,

3 (35m 12s):
It's, it's, everything's crazy about it. It was his friend. Everything's awful about

4 (35m 16s):
It. I'm laughing to, I'm laughing to avoid getting pissed.

3 (35m 18s):
I'll tell you who it is afterwards. Okay. Because it's gonna blow your mind. But remind me. Okay. But the, the whole story behind it is so sad because the guy loved his friend and then after the friend's dead, he finds out the friend fucked his wife and got her pregnant, and then he was raising that kid as his own. So much of it is awful.

4 (35m 40s):
Yeah. And then nothing I think, I think don don't know. I, I think if that's the, I think the woman should be forced to, should be forced to pay alimony to the husband. Well, in that sit, in that situation,

3 (35m 56s):
Don don't know.

4 (35m 57s):
I mean, I,

3 (35m 57s):
I don't know about alimony, but I just don't,

4 (35m 60s):
I just think there should be some level of punishment as a result of it. If you're gonna force him to pay child now, it's probably end up canceling itself out. Right. Because it's, it's kind of backwards. It's just me wanting some type of retribution for him. Right. Because it's like she just gets away with this scot free. Like there's nothing like, it's, it's so she didn't

3 (36m 16s):
Just get away with it. She enforced it. She went to court for it after the

4 (36m 19s):
Fact. Come on. Like

3 (36m 20s):
After the fact, she went to court and won.

4 (36m 22s):
Come on.

3 (36m 23s):
I know. It's so awful. And meanwhile, this guy is living with the heartbreak of his friend's. Betrayal, his friend's death first, then his friend's betrayal, and then his wife's portrayal, and then the financial obligation, obligation that he has oblig that he can't afford

4 (36m 37s):
That.

3 (36m 38s):
It gets even worse in Canada. Dave Foley was my friend from news radio when he was married. His wife and him got divorced when he was at the peak of his career. Yeah. So he is making the most money he's ever gonna make. He's on a sitcom. It's his sitcom. He's doing really well. And he had a certain amount that he had to pay. And in Canada when his income dropped substantially because, you know, you just can't have a fucking sitcom all the time. Yeah. If you're lucky, you get one your whole life. Yeah. The, the judge said to him, your ability to pay has no relationship to your obligation to pay. So this exorbitant amount of money that he was paying, because at one point in time he was doing really well.

3 (37m 23s):
Yeah. That is how much you have to figure out how to make forever

4 (37m 27s):
Or what?

3 (37m 28s):
Or you go to jail. You see how like you couldn't go to jail. You see,

4 (37m 31s):
See how stupid that is? It's crazy. It's dumb. So if the point of the, the point of the, if the point of, God, I'm blanking out here. If, if the point of child support is so that the child is in the, supposed to be in the best interest of the child and making sure that the child is provided for. Yes. Why would you then create the very circumstance that would inevitably end up ripping the father away? Not only just the father, but then also the money that could be going to the child, whether or not it's the actual amount you established beforehand or not. Right. Right. Just lower the damn payments. If you have justification for determining, you know what, he can't make these payments anymore, let's lower it to a payment he can make while still allowing your father to be in a child's life. Yeah. And have some type of money going in.

4 (38m 12s):
Do that shit. Yeah. Like, just arbitrary idea that no, we set a million dollars for you to pay every month to this child. You can't pay for it. We're gonna throw you in jail because it's in the best interest of the child. Don't get me started on this. It's don't get started on this, Joe. Well

3 (38m 25s):
It's like there's a lot of aspects of the law that were written in good faith that like child support is one of them. Yeah. Like if you're a father, fuck yeah. You should pay for your kids 100%. But then when you get into situations like that, wait, wait a minute. How much? A hundred thousand a month. Yeah.

4 (38m 41s):
That's, you don't need that to reach, retire,

3 (38m 42s):
Whatever it is. Like that's crazy. You don't need that to reach child. Well, that's the weird thing about alimony as well. You have to maintain the lifestyle. So like someone becomes accustomed to a lifestyle. Like say if you're married to Bill Gates, if you get divorced from Bill, say if you're only married to Bill for a year or two, if you get divorced, like you're entitled to a large sum of money. Unless there's some sort of prenuptial agreement, which I'm sure there is. But if there's not, you are accustomed to a lifestyle. She's used to caviar and private jets.

4 (39m 9s):
Now you know why I live in Texas, brother. It's a man state.

3 (39m 15s):
Well, it's a it's a great state. Yeah. A lot of ways. and I was having the conversation with Ari today where I was trying to convince Ari to move here when we were at the range

4 (39m 22s):
With him. But wait, hold on. Was it really Ari's first time ever shooting?

3 (39m 26s):
I don't know if he shot guns before. I don't know. Because

4 (39m 31s):
I think that's, I think I remember him saying that

3 (39m 34s):
It seemed like it was his first day at first.

4 (39m 36s):
And then you, you're fucked up, dude. If that's his first time shooting and the first time he shoots is with staccato, you're fucked up.

3 (39m 43s):
Oh yeah. I know. Right. You're fucked up, bro. You so spoiled. You're so spoiled that the smoothest shooting gun that's ever existed. If that's what you have, that's all I've

4 (39m 53s):
Ever shot.

3 (39m 54s):
That's true. Sad. Jamie's ruined.

4 (39m 56s):
You

3 (39m 56s):
Know, Jamie has a staccato. You have a a Yes. Right. I didn't get it yet. Oh, You didn't get it yet. Whatcha

4 (40m 1s):
Are you doing, Jamie? Oh, Jesus Christ. You Christ. Gotta get on. You gotta get on it, man. I thought you got

3 (40m 3s):
One. No, we were gonna, but okay, listen.

4 (40m 6s):
You what? You

3 (40m 7s):
Carry remedy. Whatcha

4 (40m 8s):
Are you carrying your little fanny pack? Cs? You carrying CC? Yeah. See I carry Cs. I'm carrying Cs right now.

3 (40m 12s):
CS is nice. Yeah. So small and so light and I. It's amazing.

4 (40m 17s):
It and it shoots so much bigger than Oh yeah. What? It actually is so

3 (40m 21s):
Flat. Yeah. and it, the, the recoil is so non-existent. It's so smooth in the hand. I love that. Damn they, when we went to the factory today, so we should tell everybody we went to the staccato factory and we toured it for an hour and I didn't even know we were gonna tour the factory. I thought we were just gonna go to the range. Yeah. But they wanted to show they're so proud of their manufacturing process.

4 (40m 38s):
Yeah, yeah.

3 (40m 38s):
That they wanted to show. It just, it's amazing. See how much effort is into each gun, how much, much engineering,

4 (40m 43s):
The enthusiasm they had for you today is the same enthusiasm when they were in that little tiny spot. Because I did, I went, I did the tour when they were at the older building. I

3 (40m 52s):
Did too. Oh, okay.

4 (40m 52s):
Okay. Yeah, yeah.

3 (40m 53s):
Yeah. and I basically saw the same thing twice. Yeah. But now I see the big version of it. Yeah. Yeah. And it's, it's pretty fucking amazing. It is. It's amazing. I

4 (40m 60s):
I know, I really genuinely love staccato. It's inherently

3 (41m 4s):
Well I love engineering. Yeah. I love when someone just does something to the best they can do it when they're explaining that it's 24 hours of work. Yeah. Just to port one piece. Just to, and and that they're, they're literally down to the tolerances. One third of the width of a human hair. That's crazy. That's their tall, anything more than that, they throw it away. That's crazy. That's wild.

4 (41m 27s):
My brain can't even really fathom that shit.

3 (41m 28s):
And when you see all the computer controlled machinery and all this, this shit. Yeah. This is, this is the manufacturer. This is the old one. That's

4 (41m 37s):
The, that's the, is it, is it? Yeah. That's the old, that's the old shop.

3 (41m 40s):
I think it's the old shop. Yeah. That's What year is this? What year is this video from a year ago. Go

4 (41m 43s):
Pull my video up. I did, I did a video on it. Okay. Yeah.

3 (41m 46s):
Put the, I think the video, I think my put Cole

4 (41m 52s):
On wire GT three staccato. It should.

3 (41m 58s):
Okay.

4 (41m 59s):
So Oh no, no, no. Go back. Go back. No. Type type GT three. Because what I did is I drove from Dallas to Georgetown, the

3 (42m 7s):
Xc. There we go. Well you were just saying the xts your favorite. That's my favorite too. The xd iss insane. It's so good. So that's when you went to that's when it was. Yeah. Just, that's just the loop. That was the beginning of it. Yes.

4 (42m 19s):
Yeah. That's when they Yeah. 'cause we drove down there with Dallas, Porsche Park place and

3 (42m 27s):
Yeah. So this is little

4 (42m 28s):
C Yeah. No, that's the old

3 (42m 29s):
Place. Oh, that's the old, that's

4 (42m 30s):
The old place. Yeah. Yeah.

3 (42m 32s):
It's like, looks exactly the new place. Yeah. because I can

4 (42m 34s):
Remember when I did this video. It was like two years ago, two and a half years ago. A year ago. Okay. Yeah. But yeah, no, I love, I love the xe. I was, when it came out, I, I think I was one of the first people to do a video on it. I went to the, that's when I, that's when I went and shot at their facility when it was still a ghetto. And I remember I was like, thank God for this because I love the shoot for me, when I carry a firearm, comfort and shoot ability is, are major, major. and I'm not saying other guns I can't shoot. I can shoot them well. But these 20 elevens just does such a great job of bringing out the best shooter in you. Right. Because people like to say that there, it's that a gun, a high speed, a high expensive gun can't make you shoot better.

4 (43m 17s):
I disagree.

3 (43m 18s):
Yeah. It's not true. Yeah.

4 (43m 19s):
I think, yeah. Whatever your skill level is with, with a non 2011, I think a 2011 will raise it in terms of shoot ability because they're so easy to shoot. I call 'em cheat codes.

3 (43m 30s):
Yeah. And with a red dot.

4 (43m 31s):
Exactly. You throw red dot on there and it's just game over. Yeah. and I

3 (43m 34s):
Mean we're shooting those plates. It's just dink dink dink

4 (43m 36s):
Dink dink. So now think about a self-defense situation. Think about how revved up you're gonna be, your adrenaline. Exactly. The last thing you need to be worried about or you're shooting fundamentals. Right. You just wanna feel comfortable and know I can do that with this gun to protect myself. Yes. And that's it. And call it a day. Yeah. And that's why I really love, love. So I carry it majority of the time, unless I can't because of what I'm wearing. 'cause I have a whole rotation of guns that I carry for based on what I'm wearing. But, but by and large my, if I'm gonna go to something initially, it's gonna go to that first. And then if I can't, then I'll go to something else.

3 (44m 8s):
Have you seen that concealed carry holster? It goes deep under your pants and it, you have like a leather strap. Yeah. And you pull it up and it raises up. What do you think about that?

4 (44m 18s):
I, I'm not a fan, so I'm, I've tried so many variations of different ways to carry, I've even done your way with the fanny pack deal and I do I like that for when I'm running. Right. And I know, I make, I poke fun at it, but largely the reason why I don't like it day to day is because I don't really like having a lot of stuff on my waist. I like to just have one single thing and especially if it's kind of big. So I like to minimize the footprint because like, I'm usually like, I'm in, I'm in sweats 90% of the time. Right. So like with these sweats that I'm wearing right now, like they're designed for that. And so I just take, I have my gun, I have the belt, dump 'em in the pants, I'm good to go.

4 (44m 58s):
And they're comfortable as

3 (44m 59s):
Shit.

4 (44m 59s):
Yeah. And so for me that's generally how, that's 99.9% of the way that I carry unless it's like in a bag or something.

3 (45m 7s):
It's funny that this conversation is so normal with you and I, but if you have this conversation with people from California, they'll look at you like you're fucking insane. Like what? You carry a gun. Yeah. Well it's also like there's a reality. Like here's one thing like, like constitutional carry. When, when my friends from California found out that constitutional carry was passed in Texas, so anyone can conceal, carry as long as you're not a criminal. Yeah. When they saw that, they're like, what? Yeah. Are you crazy? But wasn't that recently just passed in Ohio? Yep. And crime went down, down.

4 (45m 40s):
I did. Video went. Yep.

3 (45m 42s):
Yes. Yeah. Which is interesting because it's,

4 (45m 44s):
It's, it's, it's a counterintuitive logic, right? Because if your, if your starting point is if you make guns illegal then nobody will have guns then. Yeah. I guess you could, you could make the argument that Yeah. If

3 (45m 58s):
Nobody broke the law ever.

4 (45m 59s):
Right.

3 (45m 60s):
Including criminals. Exactly.

4 (46m 1s):
What

3 (46m 2s):
A fucking naive perspective.

4 (46m 3s):
But people think like that.

3 (46m 4s):
Right. But if you think you're gonna rob anybody, and then now all of a sudden there's constitutional carry and anyone can have carry a

4 (46m 10s):
Gun on them. Can carry a gun. That means your job as a criminal has become substantially harder. Substantially. Yeah. Yeah. 'cause like criminals, criminals don't wanna die either. Right? Right. And so, and criminals are largely looking for easy targets. Like if you're gonna go into the business of crime, you don't want it to be hard, because if you did, you would just get a normal job. Right. Right. So from that perspective, if they don't know who's carrying Exactly. It makes your job substantially harder as a criminal to find actual victims. And then not only that, and I just did a video recently where it's not even the person you're trying to rob or do something to, you have to worry about. You have to worry about the people who may see it. Because in this particular situation, it was at a gas station, guy runs up on him, starts pistol, whip him, pistol whipping him, and the guy in another car saw it happen and started shooting at the guy.

4 (46m 56s):
But he didn't shoot, shoot. He, he killed him. And so now you have to start thinking shit. I'm like, I gotta find either a different place to go to, to start looking for, for victims, or I gotta find a new career path. I mean, it just is what it is. Yeah. It's just logic. Now I'm not saying all crime's gonna go away. I'm not gonna say Right. You know, I'm not saying that. But if

3 (47m 15s):
Everyone's heavily armed, you're way less likely. It sounds so, but

4 (47m 21s):
It counter, it sounds counterintuitive.

3 (47m 22s):
It sounds not just counterintuitive, but it also sounds like anti progressive in terms of like society and, you know, people being civilized. Yeah. Sounds anti civilized idea. Yeah. But

4 (47m 34s):
What does that, what

3 (47m 35s):
Does that mean? Everyone having a gun? What does,

4 (47m 37s):
What does, what does that mean? Who said that pacifism was supposed to be the definition of civility? Right.

3 (47m 41s):
Well, that's also like, if you're not able to protect yourself, that doesn't make you a more virtuous person. It doesn't, and a, a virtuous person with a gun Yeah. Does not have different objectives. You're still the same person. Exactly. You're still a good person, but you also are protected protection. You have something that if the shit hits the fan,

4 (47m 59s):
That you can protect yourself. Now, that's

3 (48m 1s):
My perspective.

4 (48m 2s):
I, I do think that there are a lot of people who are anti it's projection. I've seen this. And what the projection is, is largely because inevitably we talk to 'em long enough, they'll tell you, I don't trust myself with a firearm, so why would I trust you? Mm.

3 (48m 16s):
Yes. That's it. Right. They don't want other people to have guns. Yeah. I've heard that before. Yep. By the way, those people, when the shit hit the fan in LA those were people asking me for guns. Guns. Yeah. I had friends asking me, can I borrow a gun?

4 (48m 31s):
Yeah. That don't surprise me at all. I

3 (48m 33s):
Go, well, if you lived in Texas, I just give you one. I just give you one. I just give you a gun. Exactly.

4 (48m 36s):
But I can't because of the loss. Yeah, yeah,

3 (48m 38s):
Yeah.

4 (48m 38s):
But I mean it's, it's, but I think it's, yeah. I mean it's easy to call it delusion. But that's essentially what it is. It is delusional. It's delusion. Right. And we have it too easy. Yeah. You know, we live in, we live, we live in probably the best times that you could possibly live as a human on earth right now. Right. Yeah. I agree. You know, we've lived in maybe

3 (48m 56s):
Like five years ago was better. Yeah,

4 (48m 58s):
Yeah, yeah. Okay. That's true. That's true. but

3 (49m 0s):
It pretty pre covid, pre dichotomy crash.

4 (49m 3s):
We, we live in relative, relative peace.

3 (49m 6s):
Relative pe I mean on a curve. It's pretty I mean. If you look at a graph of over the history of the Mongol invasion.

4 (49m 12s):
Yeah. About the shit we were doing like back then. I'm like, dude, don don't wanna live in a different era. No.

3 (49m 17s):
Don

4 (49m 17s):
Don't wanna live in different era. Like I love the eighties. I love the eighties to death. I'm an eighties, I'm an eighties boy. I would not wanna live in the eighties.

3 (49m 25s):
Fuck that. Imagine driving those stupid cars. Oh my God.

4 (49m 28s):
They had personality though. They had personality.

3 (49m 31s):
The fuck outta here. Cars

4 (49m 32s):
Had personality.

3 (49m 33s):
Bro. If I lived in the eighties, I'd have a 1960s car. 100%. Because the 1980s I had a 1960s car. 100%. I

4 (49m 42s):
Always talk myself out of getting one of those old school muscle cars every time I want one. But I always talk myself out of it, bro.

3 (49m 46s):
Bro. Drive one of mine next time, next time you come into town, drive my Camaro. Okay. Yeah. Which you want is a Resto mod. Okay, Jamie, pull up

4 (49m 55s):
Money rest of, I pull

3 (49m 57s):
Up my 1969 roads to shop Camaro. Lemme see this shit. Let me see, let me, let me let you see this. Murdered out. 1969 Camaro with 850 horsepower.

4 (50m 8s):
Oh

3 (50m 9s):
Nice man. and I modern suspension and big ass fat tires. Jeremy Gerber Co-owner of That's my car. Oh God. Volume. Volume. Jesus. That's my car,

4 (50m 18s):
Dude. That is literally how I would do it. Yes.

3 (50m 22s):
That's how you do it.

4 (50m 23s):
That is that,

3 (50m 24s):
Listen to that motherfucker. We

4 (50m 27s):
Oh yeah. That is

3 (50m 28s):
Sexy. And that car drives like a modern car. Like that car has incredible brakes, incredible handling

4 (50m 33s):
Six feet.

3 (50m 34s):
Yes. What am I a communist?

4 (50m 36s):
Look at that bitch.

3 (50m 37s):
Come on man. If you're gonna get one of those cars, I mean I don't hate one of those cars in an automatic Yeah. But I always like, ugh,

4 (50m 44s):
I mean. I get it. I think if I had, that is beautiful man.

3 (50m 47s):
Yeah, man. You could drive one of these, dude.

4 (50m 49s):
You would love it. HR HRE

3 (50m 50s):
Wheels. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Oh

4 (50m 52s):
Yeah. Joy and Fat tires. Then again, this is cheating all. I don't get any other color car, but black. So you can usually make me happy if you murder anything out.

3 (51m 2s):
Don't make me pull up my 1970 silver Barracuda. 'cause you change your tune on that.

4 (51m 6s):
Let me, let me see that. Okay.

3 (51m 7s):
Yeah. Lemme see that

4 (51m 8s):
Jamie,

3 (51m 9s):
Go ahead. Because I got another Roadster shop car that's really 19. Yeah. I have three Roadster shop cars and one of 'em is a 1970 Barracuda. This is my barracuda. Wait till you see this motherfucker. Come on son.

4 (51m 22s):
That interiors

3 (51m 23s):
Nice. Listen to this.

4 (51m 33s):
Oh, that is some real resto my shit that, yeah. Yeah. I see what you're

3 (51m 38s):
Saying. That has a mercury Racing engine in it that goes to 9,000 RPM. Yeah. Yeah. It sounds like an exotic. Yeah. Okay. All right. Okay.

4 (51m 53s):
Pass.

3 (51m 53s):
Could you see it on the road? Lemme see it driving. Gimme some volume on this also. It has a, it has a rear transactional, so it's 50 50 weight distribution.

4 (52m 11s):
Oh, that sounds

3 (52m 11s):
Beautiful. Don't tell me you wouldn't drive a silver car. Come on bro. I

4 (52m 15s):
Would. I would just wrap you drive that

3 (52m 16s):
Car. I would just wrap it. Well, it would look,

4 (52m 18s):
I would just wrap it black.

3 (52m 20s):
Listen, I love that car the way it is. But if that car was in matte black, it would be fucking sick. Matte black.

4 (52m 27s):
I'm black. I'm not black. Everything. Yeah.

3 (52m 29s):
Matt Black is

4 (52m 29s):
Nice. I'm not black. Everything. It's nice. It's the only color I like.

3 (52m 32s):
Yeah.

4 (52m 32s):
Matt is, I do like white. I like white with black wills.

3 (52m 34s):
Did you map black? You Lamborghini?

4 (52m 36s):
Oh, not yet. It will be.

3 (52m 37s):
Is it shiny right

4 (52m 38s):
Now? It's shiny right now.

3 (52m 39s):
Still nice. Shiny.

4 (52m 40s):
I

3 (52m 40s):
Probably won't have

4 (52m 40s):
At nighttime in the city. I probably won't have it longer than a year.

3 (52m 42s):
Really?

4 (52m 43s):
Yeah. I mean that's what I do. I, I had to get rid of it and that's like, basically drove it for free and then get it up. Get something else. That's

3 (52m 48s):
Good too. So you don't, you don't experience the bullshit. Yeah.

4 (52m 51s):
I didn't realize that till like, like I was always think like cars were just kind of like all, you know, depreciating assets. Not if you buy 'em.

3 (52m 57s):
Right. Not exotics.

4 (52m 59s):
Yeah. Not exotics. Yeah.

3 (53m 0s):
You actually make money if you buy Ferrari. Like, look at that. Is that yours?

4 (53m 3s):
Yeah. That's my, that's my turbo s Oh yeah. God. That, that's before I wrapped it black right now. Right now it's gloss black. Yeah.

3 (53m 10s):
But look at that thing. Yeah. My

4 (53m 12s):
God. I just love the stance, the stance association.

3 (53m 14s):
Well, it's also as fast as you can get an internal combustion engine car. It's like basically electric car speeds

4 (53m 20s):
Pretty much with,

3 (53m 21s):
But with superior handling. Yeah. The way that thing handles is like, it's a cheetah running up a tree.

4 (53m 27s):
But like I told you Yeah. How quickly we get used to, I'm already talking about tuning it. Mm. I want to tune it. And that's, that's nuts. It's, you know, it's dumb I mean I did, the last time I came, I came to Austin. I think it was like on a day. I know a recent freeze. Well it was supposed to be a freeze. Yeah. and it didn't really happen the way everybody thought it was gonna happen. It wasn't like freeze Armageddon. So I came, why did I come to Austin? I forgot. I came here for something. Oh yeah. It was to look at the car, to look at the Lambo or whatever. Oh. And so I, I drove in the middle of the night and I and I drove from, from Dallas to Austin. and I think I averaged speed wise. 'cause there was no, don't

3 (54m 6s):
Say it over the air. Huh?

4 (54m 7s):
They're

3 (54m 8s):
Gonna, you're gonna get in trouble.

4 (54m 9s):
I prove it.

3 (54m 12s):
Yeah. He, he's lying right now. So go ahead and lie. Alright.

4 (54m 15s):
So let's just say I maintained a really exciting amount of speed that was within legal speed limits. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. From Dallas to Austin in the most beautiful way possible. Yeah. And, and it was what blew my mind. And the beautiful thing about the turbos is even if it did start snowing or raining, whatever, it's all wheel drive. Yeah. So, but for like ice, right. Because nothing I mean ice is ice. There's nothing,

3 (54m 41s):
It's not so good. Good with snow either with those fat tires. True.

4 (54m 44s):
But I still have all wheel drive. Yeah. So I could, man, you can get around. Yeah. Yeah.

3 (54m 49s):
You get I'm worried about other people. Yeah. Especially people in Austin. When we had the freeze here two years ago, I was watching people slide around. I was like, you don't know what the fuck you're doing. As a kid who grew up in Boston, like I drove, I used to drive every day 'cause I delivered newspapers. Yeah. So I had to drive 365 days a year. So I I know how to drive in snow. Like I really know how to drive in

4 (55m 9s):
Snow. Mm. Did I tell you my story about the first time I ever had to drive in snow, ice? No, I never told you. No. Oh boy. This was like, this was, okay. So this was back when I was with the NRA. Right. And so this, you know, the NRA had their agency of record, which was Ackerman McQueen. And so I was working through them and they made one of the main, they remained in the offices in Oklahoma City. So we had, so a lot of times they would have us go down to Oklahoma City for meetings and stuff like that. And so outta the Dallas office. One time we went, we went, I, I had like a 2000, I think it was 2010 Range Rover, HSE. Right. Supercharge. So we drove down there and you know, Oklahoma, they get real winters.

4 (55m 51s):
Yeah. Right. Not like Dallas. Dallas gets like half real winters and then Houston gets fake winters. So we finished the meeting early and we were like, we just didn't wanna stay in Oklahoma City. Me and my coworker at the time, he and I were like, we don't wanna stay here in Oklahoma City. We just wanna get back to Dallas. So how far is the drive? About two and a half hours, three hours. Oh, okay. So we were getting ready to get to checking out our hotel and then we were getting ready to get back on the road. And then the lady's like, you know, they closed the freeway down. You know, the, they like salting free or whatever. They closed whatever freeway down. So we're like, we're cool. We'll just take the back roads thinking we were being smart. So we took the back road.

4 (56m 31s):
You know, they don't salt the back roads. Yeah. So I'm in and I'm like, I'm in the fucking Range Rover. I'll be all right. So I'm in the rear range Rover and it's ice. It's just, it's not even snow, it's really ice. It's just, you just like, the whole roads are just sheets of ice. Right. So I'm like, if I drive slow and careful, we'll be good. So we're driving, we're driving and at a certain point I realize it's probably not the smartest idea in the world. 'cause now you know, like usually it's kinda like patch of ice, regular road, patch of ice, regular road. No, this was at a point now where it was like straight ice. Remember they're not, they don't salt the back roads. Yeah. So we're driving and there's like this embankment. Ooh. Like, yeah. And I'm like, as long as I go slow, I should be good.

4 (57m 11s):
Keep in mind, I'm a novice at this. I've never driven in any, in this con this type of condition ever in my life. Right. So I'm just thinking, I have a Range Rover I wanna drive. You know, I don't, not realizing your tires are what matter at the time. And so at this point, we go on there and I can feel the car kind of shake a little bit. And I'm like, okay, that's not good. So just slow down a little bit. and it keeps doing, it keeps doing it. And then it snaps, car starts spinning on the embankment. So now we're heading straight into the ditch so the truck is spinning. We're we're heading into the ditch and we hit the ditch and I come in backwards. Oh. And so you, you know those moments when shit happens and you just kind of have to sit there for a second to take it in and then figure out what the hell's going on.

4 (57m 52s):
That's what happened. And in that time period, 'cause in my mind I'm like, how the fuck are we gonna get out of this? This isn't like something I can drive out of. Right. You freeze to death out there. Exactly. And so we're sitting in there and I'm like, I don't know how we're gonna get out of this. And before I could finish the thought and process it, I looked to my right and there's a big ass tractor coming down the road. and it was a guy who, who owned the farm, who was basically sat there and saw what happened. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I thought he was slid in. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. He was coming to help us to pull us out. Oh. So he comes over and he's like, looks like y'all are in a bit of a pickle. And I was like, yeah, something like that. And he goes, ain't this fancy truck.

4 (58m 33s):
Four wheel drive. And I was like four wheel drive with sport tires. Exactly. Yeah. He was just giving me shit. Yeah. And so I was like, yeah. And he just started laughing. He's like, I'll have you out in five minutes. So he hooked us up, pulled us out, he's like, stay at the very top. Ride that and you be good. So he did that. But the thing is, the ice was still there. So that three hour trip took us 10 hours. Oh my God. I literally, we, I think we did 10 miles an hour. 10 to 15 miles an hour the entire way. Lucky you didn't run outta the gas too. Exactly. And the funny thing is, I, when we got back into that, I dropped my coworker off at his place and then as I was pulling up to my building, my brakes went out.

4 (59m 16s):
Just died. They just, yeah. I get, because I was riding them the entire way. Oh wow. Yeah. And so I guess they were just like, we're done. Like, and it, when I tell you they couldn't have gone out at a more perfect time. I pulled into my building, got into my parking spot, and, and as I was trying to pull into the parking spot, they get, they just went out. Now I had enough friction to get it to slow down because I was at a slower speed. But at that point it was so basically I had to use the hand brake.

3 (59m 40s):
Wow.

9 (59m 42s):
Did you see this video over the, a couple days ago?

3 (59m 44s):
Missouri Fire truck? No. On an icy hill. Oh no. Oh my God. Oh, I did see this. Yeah. Oh shit. Oh shit. Look at her smoking. Oh my God. Just

10 (59m 57s):
Smashed a car though. Luckily

3 (59m 59s):
That hit a car. It just hit

10 (59m 60s):
This parked car. That blue car right there. Oh.

3 (1h 0m 2s):
Oh.

10 (1h 0m 2s):
Didn't hit anything else. It's a different vid

3 (1h 0m 5s):
Angle. They got lucky. Yeah. Very

4 (1h 0m 7s):
Lucky.

3 (1h 0m 8s):
Look at that thing. Spin dude. And there's nothing you can do. Nothing. Nothing, nothing. When I was a kid, I lived on a hill in Newton, Massachusetts and me and my sister's boyfriend sat on the roof and watched people slide down our hill and crash. We called the cops, we said, Hey man, you should probably close the, close the sister down. Yeah. Because there was like five cars in a row, spun out, bounced off the curb, went into ditches. We were just watching people try to come down the hill and just slide completely outta control.

4 (1h 0m 39s):
Dude. It's, and that, and you made a good point. It's when you're like, now I feel like I'm, you know, with all the traveling I do, you know, I, we've driven from Dallas to Utah to New Mexico. I've driven in ice, driven in snow. Yeah. So I'm pretty comfortable with it now even though I still don't really like it. There's

3 (1h 0m 54s):
Nothing you could do about ice

4 (1h 0m 55s):
Though. There's nothing. But there's also, what you pointed out was other people. Yeah. So now that's what makes me nervous because I'm like, I remember when we had the, the freeze apocalypse or whatever in Dallas. Yeah. I got in my truck and went out there and started kind of driving around. 'cause I kind of, you know, I kind of knew what I was doing. Yeah. But I was always, I was always constantly looking in my rear view mirror because I was like, there's gonna be some dumb ass who's going way too fast and doesn't realize that you can't stop at the same distance on ice patches and they're gonna just Right. Ride right into me. And so I was like, this isn't fun anymore. So I just went back and

3 (1h 1m 26s):
Inside when Austin, they don't even have plows. They don't because now you say that shit, but that's crazy. Like, you should have a few, it seems like it happens. Look,

4 (1h 1m 35s):
Lemme tell you that, that Texas arrogance sometimes 99% of the time it's a great thing. There's that other 1% where it's like, alright, stop being stupid.

3 (1h 1m 43s):
I think it's a funding issue. Yeah. They think so. Yeah. They think they can't justify buying. Yeah. Millions of dollars worth of snowplows for the city when, you know, snows once every three years.

4 (1h 1m 53s):
But I mean it's also a one time purchase. I mean, right. I mean main maintenance and keep can't be that expensive for a

3 (1h 1m 58s):
Snowplow. Well, I bet there was some conversations about it after the big freeze.

4 (1h 2m 2s):
Oh. A couple

3 (1h 2m 2s):
Years ago. But yeah, I have that, that Land cruiser, that thing was awesome during the snow. I was loving it. What kind of,

4 (1h 2m 9s):
Do you have those? It's

3 (1h 2m 10s):
1995. What kinda

4 (1h 2m 11s):
Tires do you have

3 (1h 2m 11s):
On it? This is all, all

4 (1h 2m 12s):
Terrain. All terrain. Okay.

3 (1h 2m 13s):
Yeah. Okay. So they're great. You could drive over anything in those fuckers. Yeah. It

4 (1h 2m 17s):
Look, I saw it when you pulled in. I was like, yep. It looks about right. Yeah.

3 (1h 2m 20s):
That thing's hooked up. That thing's hooked up. That was, that was the, the truck that I bought, I had made, when I was nervous about living in la I'm like, if something happens Mm. Like an earthquake, fire flood. Yeah. I wanna be able to go over these hills. I don't wanna be stuck on these roads. Yeah. Because there was a road in Northern California where there's a major fire and everyone on the road burned to death because the fire storm swept through the road and they were trapped in bumper to bumper traffic and they all got cooked. No. Yeah.

4 (1h 2m 52s):
And that's another thing, that's another reason why I, I will always, always have a truck with that. That has off-road capabilities.

3 (1h 2m 58s):
Yeah. Well that's the TRX, right? Yeah.

4 (1h 3m 0s):
Trx. Even though some people would argue that it's not an off-road

3 (1h 3m 4s):
Truck that motherfucking go off road.

4 (1h 3m 5s):
Yeah. I know I've driven my off road. I've driven, I've taken mine offroad. I have the scratches on that bitch to prove it.

3 (1h 3m 9s):
Yeah. They can go offroad. Those things are capable. Yeah. It is kind of ama like, like a raptor that is essentially a Baja Racing truck. Yeah. For the street. Pretty much. They, they have amazing travel in terms of like, you could bounce on things. You could go over giant bumps. It's

4 (1h 3m 25s):
Stupid. It's, but it's the most giddy experience ever. You just sit in, you just, this is how you, this is how you drive A TRX or Raptor.

3 (1h 3m 32s):
We,

4 (1h 3m 33s):
That's how

3 (1h 3m 33s):
You drive 'em. Yeah. The whole time the TRX does come from the factory with some fucking janky ass brakes though. Oh

4 (1h 3m 39s):
No. Oh no. Oh. Don't, don't get me started on that

3 (1h 3m 42s):
Shit. They're not good.

4 (1h 3m 43s):
That shit is a liability,

3 (1h 3m 44s):
Bro. Yeah. They're not good.

4 (1h 3m 45s):
They're not. I changed them. I put the, will I put the Wilcox on? That was the Wilcox. Yeah. I put

3 (1h 3m 49s):
The, whatever Hennessy puts on Ah,

4 (1h 3m 51s):
Gotcha. Which I forget what he uses. And then now Yeah. Breaks are

3 (1h 3m 54s):
Phenomenal. Yeah. Mine too. Phenomenal. Big difference. Yeah. But not good.

4 (1h 3m 58s):
No. The, the stock, the standard, like anybody who keeps anybody who has a TRX with standard with the stock breaks on there. You just saying you are rolling liability. Well,

3 (1h 4m 6s):
You have to realize like your stopping distance from 60 to zero is twice what a car is.

4 (1h 4m 12s):
It's, it's in. and I learned that the hard way when the

3 (1h 4m 14s):
First guy I don know it's twice. But whatever it is, it's a, it's definitely not like, if you have a Tesla and you have to stop at 60 and then you have a TRX, you have to stop at 60. There's no way you're winning that competition. Not, and I,

4 (1h 4m 25s):
It's not even close.

3 (1h 4m 25s):
Not even close. Like I,

4 (1h 4m 26s):
I remember when I, I was like

3 (1h 4m 27s):
Many car lengths. Exactly. Many. I

4 (1h 4m 30s):
Had the car, I had the truck for like a week. and I was in, I drove to Houston and I, remember when I was in Houston, I forgot there's like this, I forgot the name of it, but there's a road where it's kind of, it's not, it's kind of windy. Not like sports car, windy, but just, you know, kind of does things. And you can get some get up to speed. So I'm just, you know, driving to X and then I like, they were like outta nowhere. I come around the corner and there's like eight cars sitting at the light and I'm like, oh fuck. I never thought about how bad this thing is. That's stopping. Yeah. and I remember standing on the brakes. And then you, when you hear that err and you're like, please

3 (1h 5m 8s):
Stop, please

4 (1h 5m 9s):
Stop. Please stop. Please stop. Please stop. and it did. But after that, a week later I got, I got the brakes upgraded. Yeah. I did a big break, hit on it

3 (1h 5m 16s):
And called it. Well I noticed a giant different, 'cause I had a Hennessy Raptor before that reg, the regular Raptor before the R was out, which is a great car. Yeah. And then with, with great brakes, Hennessy upgrades the brakes too. And then I went to the standard TRX after that and I was like, oh my God, these brakes are dog shit. Dog shit. What is this stopping distance from 60 to zero on a stock TRX. 'cause I know they have to give you the stats on that. It's probably like barely what it should be. And you'd be able to drive it. One thirty, a hundred thirty feet, 130 feet. Jesus. So, okay, now what is the stopping distance from? and it came out 60 to zero in a Corvette Stingray, a 2023 Corvette Stingray, keep

4 (1h 5m 57s):
In mind that's with no weight.

3 (1h 5m 58s):
No weight. Right. We have a backfill with cement. Exactly. Or whatever the fuck you're carrying back there. Five people in the car. Yeah. 130 feet is crazy. 93 feet. Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ. The same for Viper. That is nine 11. Think about that. That's almost,

4 (1h 6m 14s):
That's what you said, 160.

3 (1h 6m 15s):
Yeah. 130 feet versus how much? 90 feet. Yeah. Pretty much. 93. Jeez. That's a giant difference. That, that's a giant difference.

4 (1h 6m 25s):
They gotta do something about those brakes and they have to do something about the fucking onboard security system because the way they're able to steal these trucks is insane. Really?

3 (1h 6m 34s):
What? Yeah,

4 (1h 6m 35s):
Dude, they still d they still rap. They's not rap us. They steal anything. Mopar anything Mopar. If you don't have a kill switch on it. If you don't have, oh man. If You don't have whatever the neutral thing is to stop them from being, throw it in neutral. If You don't have a GPS on it or Apple Air talk, your truck will be gone. I have dudes in my building who've bought it. TRX went to dinner with their wives to come back out and their truck was gone. You can look it up online. They will steal these things in a second. They're easy to steal. They're easy as fuck to steal. It's insane.

3 (1h 7m 7s):
Really interesting major vulnerability to steal Dodge Ram trucks. Fuck.

4 (1h 7m 14s):
Oh yeah. They, they have the, like the repeaters. They'll come outside your house Mm. And then, and then boost the signal and basically

3 (1h 7m 19s):
Oh, that's crazy that they can do that. So that's the thing they do with these wires. Yep. So they can find that you have a remote control inside and then they mirror the remote control. Yep. They just boost signal. They boost the signal and then just start your car. Crazy. Yep.

4 (1h 7m 32s):
They I mean they steal 'em like that. Like it's like clockwork. Wow.

3 (1h 7m 39s):
Yeah. That's not good.

4 (1h 7m 40s):
No, it's not anything. Mopar Hellcats, t RXs

3 (1h 7m 44s):
Hawk so much electronics and cars. Another thing that's freaking me out is that they're trying to put kill switches in all cars. Yeah. Where, you know, if you're driving and the government wants to stop you, they'll just stop your car just like

4 (1h 7m 55s):
That. Yeah. I said I like that's said electrical shit.

3 (1h 7m 57s):
Yeah.

4 (1h 7m 58s):
I don't, I don't, it's

3 (1h 7m 59s):
So sketchy. I'm not for it, man. It's, look, it's great if someone's stealing your car. Yeah. And you can call, you know, whatever it is on OnStar. Yeah. And then say, Hey, someone stole my car and they can shut your car off.

4 (1h 8m 9s):
That's the thing about convenience. Right. It's a gift and a curse. And then you, you're giving up something to gain something when it comes to convenience. Right. So it's like, how inconvenient do you wanna live in order to have absolute autonomy versus massive amounts of convenience. But now you're kind of at the mercy of the government more or less. Yeah. Or whatever corporation. Well, do you remember is providing the convenience.

3 (1h 8m 33s):
Do you remember that story? There was a story about a journalist, and this journalist was writing a piece for Rolling Stone and he went overseas and he was embedded with a troop. And it was in Afghanistan, I believe. And while they were over there, the volcano erupted in Iceland. So because of that, there was no flights for like two weeks. You couldn't fly out Jesus because they couldn't see. Yeah. So until that, you know, volcanic dust settle. So they were stranded. So this, this Michael Hastings, is that what his name is? So this guy was around these people and they got a little comfortable with him and they started talking shit.

3 (1h 9m 13s):
And then he printed everything they were saying and talking shit. Including this general, this beloved general who's talking shit about Obama. Yeah. So this guy comes back and he's getting mad death threats and he's fucking terrified for his life. And he's saying, listen, if, if I fucking die, I did not kill myself. Just let, there's threats on my life. And his car was going down. Was it LaBrea? Yeah. There's video of it. He had a a, a brand new Mercedes. This car was going down LaBrea at like 120 miles an hour. Went straight into a tree and exploded. And exploded in a crazy way where the engine ejected from the vehicle where they're like, this is indicative of a, like an explosion.

3 (1h 9m 56s):
Like there's like rigged, like something was

4 (1h 9m 59s):
So basically something that forced this conspiracy forced accelerator all the way down. Had the car flying that Exactly.

3 (1h 10m 4s):
The conspiracy theory is that that's what happened. Yeah. You know, the, the problem is there's no way to know. No. And they also said that he tested positive for amphetamines. Oh, Of course. But the problem with that is journalists all take amphetamines is the dirty secret of journalists. Yeah. I have friends that are journalists and they said that Adderall use is ubiquitous.

4 (1h 10m 26s):
I mean, that's how I wasn't lost. I I was apparently the only person in law school, not on Adderall. Like it

3 (1h 10m 31s):
Was crazy. It's apparently amazing. Yeah. I have not tried it. But everybody wants to be productive, says Jesus Christ

4 (1h 10m 37s):
I know what coffee does to me. And coffee is just a minor form of fucking Adderall if you ask me.

3 (1h 10m 43s):
It's the most minor. Yeah.

4 (1h 10m 44s):
And I know what that does to me. Yeah. So if, if I ever took Adderall, I'd become Superman. Yeah. and I would like that shit so much. Exactly. That. I don't ever want to touch it

3 (1h 10m 55s):
My exact feelings. I don't want to try it. Yeah. Because

4 (1h 10m 57s):
I I know I have a DHD

3 (1h 10m 59s):
My friend Duncan has a great bit about, I don't even know if that's real. my friend Duncan has a great bit about it. He goes, it's like a scientist did cocaine and went, I can fix this. And that's Adderall.

4 (1h 11m 15s):
Okay. So you don't You don't think a DHD You don't know if a DH ADHD is real I know. I don't know either. I, I, I haven't looked into Its a think

3 (1h 11m 20s):
It's a super First of all. I think it's a superpower. I think if you have it, it's a superpower. Think and I think I most certainly have it if I have it. Look, I have an ability to focus on things. That's, it's very unusual and it's a, a obsessive focusing on things. And I use it to my advantage. Like to, it helps me get good at things. It helps me. It helps. It's for sure. It's helped me in my career for sure. It's helped me with martial arts for sure. It's helped me with everything I do.

4 (1h 11m 44s):
I think you're right. and I and I say that because I remember when I was in law school and I, remember I had a professor, a professor, professor Moore I know if she goes actually wanted to say her name, but whatever. Loved her, loved her to death. and I remember she was talking to me about, you know, me possibly having a HD or whatever. And she, which she, she was like, you don't think linearly like you the way, which makes you great at a lot of things. But then kind of he hampers you. Like, I am not a standardized test taker. I'm not good at it.

3 (1h 12m 12s):
Right. You're not good at things You don't want to do.

4 (1h 12m 14s):
Bingo.

3 (1h 12m 15s):
That's what it is.

4 (1h 12m 16s):
But I am not, if I'm not stimulated. Right. I am miserable. Yeah. Like, I don't want to do, I don't want to look at it. I'm like, I'm, I'm just, alright, let's,

3 (1h 12m 24s):
By the way you align with like most of my friends, maybe that's why we're friends. I mean, I feel like most of my friends are kind of like fucking psycho about certain things that they love.

4 (1h 12m 34s):
It's, it's, you, you start, you start talking to me about cars. Yes. Start talking to me about guns, guns, guns. Yeah. You start talking to me about the law. Law. Yeah. Like anything like that. I'm actually have a passion. Like you can't stop me from being focused on it.

3 (1h 12m 46s):
Right. And you can rattle off information that's at your fingertips all the time. Exactly. Because you store, it's in a file in your brain. You just open that bitch up and it's there. I

4 (1h 12m 53s):
Always say I have a terrible memory, but I have great recall. Mm. You know what I mean?

3 (1h 12m 57s):
That's good. I have a convenient memory. Yeah. My, my memory is really good. Like it's stunningly good when it's things that I'm interested in. Gotcha. But if it's something that I don't give a fuck about, it's like I throw that right out. It comes in, goes out for

4 (1h 13m 10s):
Me. It's names. It's bad

3 (1h 13m 11s):
Dude. Oh, it's bad with names. It's

4 (1h 13m 12s):
Bad.

3 (1h 13m 12s):
It's bad, bad. Well, the thing is you're a public person, so you meet a lot of people.

4 (1h 13m 15s):
Okay. I'm glad you said that because I had thought that, and I'm like, no, you're just making excuses for

3 (1h 13m 20s):
Yourself. No, that's real. Because I'm

4 (1h 13m 21s):
Like, I am inundated with new names all

3 (1h 13m 24s):
The time,

4 (1h 13m 24s):
Constantly. And so I'm just kind of, and I'm forgetting, I'll forget names. I'm like, why am I forgetting people's names? Right. And it's, it's almost like it's just overflow. Like there's exactly names that'll drop off and then I'll be able to recall it. But then another name will drop off. And then it's like,

3 (1h 13m 36s):
Well it's Dunbar's number. Do you know what that is? No. Dunbar's number is this principle. That's based on the idea that we came from tribal societies. So all human beings came from groups of like 50 people. 150 people. And the idea is that there's a circle of people that are close to you that you're very close to. And that's that whatever that number is, five to 10, whatever it is. And then there's a circle of people that you really like but you don't see as much. And that's like 20 or 30. Yeah. And then it gets further and further out to like acquaintances and people you barely know. So this is Dunbar's number. Oh, okay. So five very close friends. So, and then it gets to close friends. It gets like 15 to 50 and then it gets to friends that you would invite them to a party that's 150.

3 (1h 14m 20s):
Then it gets to acquaintances. It's 500 people who you remember how you met. And then it's 1500 people that you could put a name to a face. Now imagine how many people you meet compared to the average person that works in the same place and he sees the same friend group and goes to the same church or whatever. You're around the same group of people all the time. You don't have to remember that many names. Yeah, that's true. You, you might meet, over the course of 10 years, there might be like 300 people that you interact with. That's most folks. Shit.

4 (1h 14m 50s):
You shit, I was just at Chacho.

3 (1h 14m 52s):
Right. Okay.

4 (1h 14m 53s):
We're talking hundreds and hundreds of people in the course of three days.

3 (1h 14m 57s):
There's no way. No. Like, there's no way you gonna remember all those things. And people get mad at you. I know they get mad. Especially

4 (1h 15m 3s):
Women. Yeah. Ah, well

3 (1h 15m 5s):
People get mad if you don't remember the names. They get mad if You don't remember that you met 'em. It's like, I can't do it. You don't understand. I don't have, my hard drive is full. It's, I can't, there's no room in there.

4 (1h 15m 14s):
It's, it's nuts. I mean, I hell even remembering the send messages that I was supposed to respond to sometimes. Oh

3 (1h 15m 20s):
Yeah. No, it's impossible. Like, look at my phone, like when you see like how many messages that I, I haven't

4 (1h 15m 25s):
Answer. Oh, let's compare. 'cause I always do this and I, how many you got? I'm usually a, I usually win this battle. How many you got? So right now, text messages, I have 1,152 unopened text messages. I

3 (1h 15m 36s):
Have 1 75.

4 (1h 15m 39s):
1 75. Dang. Yeah. So I have Gotcha. Now here's where it insane. Okay. My emails.

3 (1h 15m 46s):
Okay.

4 (1h 15m 46s):
440,000 124. Whoa.

3 (1h 15m 51s):
I think you got me there. That's crazy. That's

4 (1h 15m 54s):
Now, in all fairness, I have like five different emails attached to that. But

3 (1h 15m 58s):
I have, oh, wait a minute. I might have you maintenance there. I have 168,485.

4 (1h 16m 10s):
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. See I'm, I've, I've surpassed you.

3 (1h 16m 13s):
Yeah, you got me, you got me beat on that. Yeah.

4 (1h 16m 16s):
It's,

3 (1h 16m 16s):
But I also have five email addresses. I

4 (1h 16m 19s):
Have 1, 2, 3, 4, have four attached to this. Yeah.

3 (1h 16m 24s):
It's crazy, man. Yeah.

4 (1h 16m 26s):
It's, it's, it's, it's pretty bad. It's pretty bad.

3 (1h 16m 29s):
Very bad. Yeah. But I mean, it's, it's also, it's like the nature of being a public person. Yeah. And especially if, and I also have four phone numbers. So it's like, see

4 (1h 16m 37s):
I have two.

3 (1h 16m 38s):
Yeah. and I, I have to change mine now. It's like I've started getting text messages from people I don't know. and

4 (1h 16m 42s):
I, I I I'm this close to being at the point where you are where I'm like, too many people have my number. Exactly. Yeah. And so I'm like, I'm like, I really, I've had this number for ages and I'm like,

3 (1h 16m 54s):
Yeah. It's a kind of a gross conversation for other people. Like, why? What's your problem? Why? What's the big deal, man? but it is unmanageable. You have to understand it's unmanageable. And when you're a person like you or I, people are always looking for something from you. Like, All day long, it's, can you do this? Will you come to that? and

4 (1h 17m 11s):
I have a very hard time saying no. Mm. I haven't. I've I've I've started mastering it now. Yeah. but it took a long time because I would feel guilty because I, you know, I, I feel blessed to be in a position that I'm in. So if I'm in a position to help where I can help, I'm gonna want to do it. But I'm started realizing I'm giving too much of myself. And what ends up happening is I start fucking myself essentially. Yeah.

3 (1h 17m 33s):
It's the pros and cons of connectivity. I think ultimately, like we were saying before, it's the best time to be alive. Yeah. The benefits way outweigh the negative negatives. Yeah. But there's a lot of weirdness to it. And one of the things that we were talking about at lunch today was that there's this statistic now where they did the survey of these women and they found that 50% of married women have a backup boyfriend. Yeah. Meaning if this fucking husband falls apart, if he talks too much shit, if she gets tired of his bullshit, she has another guy that she's been in contact with that she can kind of get ahold of. And that guy could be the new boyfriend.

4 (1h 18m 8s):
Yeah. I've been to

3 (1h 18m 9s):
Back up and that. I'm sure you have. And that is, and

4 (1h 18m 13s):
Then they realize that's a terrible fucking

3 (1h 18m 14s):
Idea. But it's like 70% of women in relationships have this. Yeah. I doesn't, seven zero. When I,

4 (1h 18m 19s):
When I read the article, I'm like, oh, y'all just found this out. I swear to God. I promise you. I I've always known that. Well,

3 (1h 18m 25s):
Especially women on social media who take thirst trap pictures. Like, my God.

4 (1h 18m 32s):
It's a beautiful way the social media has provided a beautiful avenue to have a roster. Yeah. So it's like they, they have a, they have a, they have a bench, they have a starting five and then they have a bench. Right, exactly.

3 (1h 18m 46s):
And all you have to, you have number one draft pick. Exactly. He's the guy that you every now and then, how you doing? But they all

4 (1h 18m 51s):
Serve a different

3 (1h 18m 52s):
Role. You looking good. Yeah. They

4 (1h 18m 53s):
All serve a different role. There's a, there's a, there's a, he's nice. He listens to me. Wax poetic about nothing guy.

3 (1h 18m 59s):
He'll go out on a date with me. Even though I have no romantic interest in him, interest him whatsoever. He take me out, me and the husband are

4 (1h 19m 4s):
In a fight. This guy makes me look really good. So I'll kind bring him out. This guy has really good sex. So I'll I'll call him over in the middle of the night after I finish with the guy who takes me out. Oh.

3 (1h 19m 14s):
50% of married women have a backup lover. Ooh.

10 (1h 19m 17s):
Well, so when I google this thing that like 50% have a backup, this article pops up as a story every two or three years.

3 (1h 19m 26s):
Well, probably true

10 (1h 19m 28s):
I know, but I mean that had, maybe it doesn't have anything to do with social media or anything. 'cause 2014

4 (1h 19m 31s):
Happening.

3 (1h 19m 31s):
Well, 2014,

4 (1h 19m 32s):
That's when social media was really social media.

10 (1h 19m 34s):
I know. But that's just, this is just the first page of searching and I back and check like 2009. Would it say that when I wrote Cosmopolitan articles from 2000?

4 (1h 19m 41s):
I think it's, but you gotta remember too, you gotta remember women are social creatures. So that's usually probably based on a survey. Right. Generally speaking, I think it's a lot higher because they just, well,

3 (1h 19m 52s):
Probably a higher now. Yeah, that's true. They wouldn't admit it. But probably a lot higher now because of social media. Yes. Because of direct messaging. I agree. I agree. There's so, so much of that going around.

4 (1h 20m 2s):
I tell people, I tell my friends this all the time, you know, some of, some of 'em are married, you know, some I'm still out here. And back in the day, you could only touch who you could actually touch. Right Now the game's changed. Yeah. You can touch anyone If a girl's like, oh my God, and I and she lives in central Kansas. Yep. And she loves Michael B. Jordan. Right. Slide into dms. Yep. Like it's it, and then he may read it, he may not.

3 (1h 20m 29s):
And if he goes to her page and she's going and

4 (1h 20m 32s):
She's not, woo well, let's go. Hello Sarah in Central Kansas. How's it

3 (1h 20m 36s):
Going? What's up? Y'all

4 (1h 20m 36s):
Fly. You get what I'm saying? So it's, it's taken, it's taken the game to a whole new level where it's like you everybody, and it goes both ways too. Sure. The only difference is, is a guy reaching out to say some like super famous actress is

3 (1h 20m 53s):
Good luck. Yeah.

4 (1h 20m 54s):
That's not gonna work because it's like 900 of you doing the same thing. Yeah.

3 (1h 20m 57s):
Not only that, it's like women don't want that. They don't, like if a woman's a super famous actress, she doesn't want some random carpenter slide into her dm. Shit.

4 (1h 21m 6s):
I disagree a hundred thousand percent. Really? Yeah. She likes the attention.

3 (1h 21m 9s):
Okay. Yeah. That's crazy. But she's not thinking of as a guy that she's gonna bag No, no, no. She happens to be in Kansas.

4 (1h 21m 14s):
Yeah, no, no, not at all. Like, you know, you don't say any chance in hell. Right. But, you know, to, to pick up her phone, it's like another one

3 (1h 21m 21s):
That they liked.

4 (1h 21m 22s):
But to get that dopamine spike and then it's onto the next sale.

3 (1h 21m 24s):
Yes. Yeah. It's wild I mean, look, I, I'm complaining, but I like to look at it, you know, like if women put thirst traps on their Instagram, like, ooh, look at that. I always, I like to look at it so I'm not complaining in the sense, don don't want you to stop doing it. I want you to do whatever you want do. But I think psychologically the temptation and also just knowing that you have that many suitors that are waiting in the wings, it makes arguments very different. Yeah.

4 (1h 21m 49s):
I'm, one thing I always, I'm never gonna apologize for being a man ever. At the same time, I can't I mean if they have the access to the ability to do it, it is what it is.

3 (1h 21m 59s):
Yeah. And also, like a woman's window of opportunity is smaller than a man's,

4 (1h 22m 4s):
I'd say that much.

3 (1h 22m 5s):
It just is unfortunately what, for whatever reason, it's not fair if a, a woman has between the ages of like, you know, whatever age of of age, you know, where they're legal till they're, you know, if they're really hot and they work out a lot late forties,

4 (1h 22m 22s):
That's pushing it, but Yeah. Yeah. but

3 (1h 22m 23s):
It gets, I can see that. but it, and when women are single in their late forties, guys are like, why is she single? And she's in her late forties, you know?

4 (1h 22m 29s):
Well, I think at, at the, it's life is kind of cruel in a way that they've, they've created an inverse peak for men and women. Right. Right. So when we were younger, didn't nobody want us. Right. Nobody wanted I mean, we, because you broke. Yeah. I'm broke, dude. You Oh, it's cute. You're in college, you got your little dorm room. Yeah. Right, right. Because when I was in college, all the girls were dating, either they were dating older dudes, they were dating the drug dealers, the ball players. I didn't judge 'em. I always told my friends, I was like, dude, you're boring. Right. Like, I'm, I'm, I I'm boring.

3 (1h 22m 55s):
You have no

4 (1h 22m 56s):
Resources. I, I wake up, I go to class. Yeah. and I come back home in my, come back home to my dorm room. Yeah. Where you have a, you have a whole guy here who has his own, his own apartment, own house, own car, can fly you out, do all this stuff. You fun. Go on trips. Exactly. Yeah. The problem is, is at a certain point of flips, the best time of my life, it started at 30. Mm Right. Right. 30. You can't tell me shit.

3 (1h 23m 20s):
You

4 (1h 23m 21s):
Can't tell me shit. Right. Whereas when, when a woman starts hitting 30, which she, now she's, she's had her fun. Right. She's, she's on boats. She's doing all that stuff. She's having a great time.

3 (1h 23m 32s):
Yeah.

4 (1h 23m 33s):
Have at it. Yeah. Problem is, is she's, that switch flips and now she's looking for something more serious, more stable. Unfortunately, when you're 30 and I'm 30 and I'm like, you can't tell me shit. And she's 30 and she's like, I'm ready to be in something serious. You're gonna have this, you're going to the, the lines start crossing in ways that aren't conducive to Right. You get what I'm saying? So it's like that's when you start kind of having these age gap relationships where you start having individuals, you start guys who are 30, 40 dating 24, 23 year olds. Right. Because it's like, well, I've, I finally got to a point where I'm making money. I'm in the, I have, I have the resources to do what I want and have fun. So now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna start enjoying that life that I wanted when I was younger.

3 (1h 24m 14s):
And so a lot of times they'll date women who aren't looking for serious boyfriends. Exactly. Because they're looking to have fun as well. Exactly. So they're not putting pressure on you to have a family and settle down. Yep.

4 (1h 24m 23s):
So that's taking those guys essentially off the market for the women who are now at a point where they're like, okay, I want something more. Yeah. I want something more steady. Right. And so, like I said, life is cruel. Life is just kind of cruel like that. Yeah. So it creates this dynamic where it's like, now they're looking at like, where are all the guys Right. That are my eights, because they're not looking to date younger guys and they're not looking to date super old guys either. Whatever the hell that means. But,

3 (1h 24m 46s):
Well, Jordan Peterson talks about this too. There's also this disproportionate thing that happens where men who have resources and who are attractive, it's such a small percentage of the population. Yeah. And those men have access to a much larger percentage of women. So the amount of men today that don't have girlfriends and haven't had sex in a long time, it staggering. It's staggering. Staggering. You can call 'em incel, you can call 'em whatever you want. But unfortunate gentlemen is what I like to call them.

4 (1h 25m 18s):
And that is not good for

3 (1h 25m 20s):
Society. Not good I mean that's what's happening in China. Yeah. Right. China had that one child policy, which was disastrous. You know, like when someone was saying, all these Chinese men of military age are entering into this country. I'm like, okay, maybe they're a terror cell. Let's, that's the worst case scenario. Or maybe they're guys who are in China who are fucked. There's no girls there. So like, if you want to, and also you're trapped in a communist society. Yeah. You know, you're trapped in a dictatorship.

4 (1h 25m 46s):
But here's the irony behind that. There's also a segment of men in America who are like, I wanna go abroad and find a woman. Right,

3 (1h 25m 54s):
Right. It's

4 (1h 25m 55s):
The weird

3 (1h 25m 55s):
Right. Finding women with lower standards.

4 (1h 25m 56s):
It it's, it, it's the weirdest thing. Yeah. Well, I mean lower standards are a different environment.

3 (1h 26m 1s):
Well, lower standards. 'cause I've been paying attention to these guys go down to like Columbia and these is like, ugly dudes go down to Columbia and get these bombass Colombian chicks.

4 (1h 26m 8s):
Now, now you gotta make the distinction. There's a distinction there. There are some who kind of go in there. They're just, they're really honestly going in there to have fun. Right. Right. And then there are some who are honestly kind of looking for something more traditional because these places tend to have more of a traditional structure. Right. So the, that like, I think you kinda have to split that dynamic a little bit. Yeah.

3 (1h 26m 27s):
There's a lot of variables there. Yeah.

4 (1h 26m 28s):
Yeah. but it, but it, at the same time, like you said, then there's guys from other countries, from countries when they come to America to get women. Yeah. It's so, it's so weird how you kind of have this like, crossing of the seas in order to get the same thing in different places. Yep.

3 (1h 26m 43s):
Right. Yeah.

4 (1h 26m 44s):
But I don't don don't know. I'm, I,

3 (1h 26m 47s):
And this

4 (1h 26m 48s):
My grand, my grand, my grandma, my mom, my mom's hitting me up for grandbabies every other day. Oh. So I'm the last person to be talking to about this. Are you

3 (1h 26m 55s):
Ever gonna do it?

4 (1h 26m 57s):
I mean, if it happens, it happens.

3 (1h 26m 58s):
So it's like you just have to find the right combination of woman circumstance.

4 (1h 27m 3s):
Yeah. I mean, the thing is, I'm obsessed with my freedom. Right. And it's, and it's to a fault. Yeah. And so, and I'm not against it, but,

3 (1h 27m 11s):
But it's also served you well.

4 (1h 27m 13s):
It has, it has. and I and I guard it viciously. Right.

3 (1h 27m 17s):
Because we've all seen men that got trapped. Yeah. Hence my conversation about my friend earlier that has to pay child

4 (1h 27m 23s):
Support for Exactly. Yeah. And, and I usually don't even talk about this because largely when you do speak about it publicly, nobody ever tries to see that from your perspective. Right. Right. It's, it's just like what are

3 (1h 27m 36s):
Doing, you're a woman hater.

4 (1h 27m 37s):
Yes. Exactly.

3 (1h 27m 39s):
You're a player.

4 (1h 27m 39s):
Misogyny. Misogyny. Yeah. You're a maan. Yeah. Whatever. But, which is fine. I've, I've, I have, I've kind of built up walls that don't really, that doesn't really bother me. You can't really shame me that way largely because what I'm doing is I'm protecting my piece.

3 (1h 27m 54s):
Yeah. And also you've seen the other side of it. It's not like you don't know what the negative consequences are.

4 (1h 27m 59s):
I've definitely seen the other side of it. We've

3 (1h 28m 1s):
All seen horrific relationships. Yeah.

4 (1h 28m 3s):
And that's why I think it's

3 (1h 28m 4s):
Largely men emasculated. Oh, controlling. And this other thing that happens in those controlling relationships that I was watching this conversation, this woman who was a psychologist was having with this other podcaster, I forget who it was, but she was saying that essentially one of the problems that happens with women is that they have this desire to control their environment and control men. But then as soon as they control men, they stop being des they stop being attracted to that man.

4 (1h 28m 29s):
I never listened to what women say in terms of what they want. Really? No, I I

3 (1h 28m 34s):
You just always assume there's some

4 (1h 28m 35s):
No, I just watched the actions. Mm. Because actions are there. Yeah. Right. Because you gotta remember, like, women are, women live in a very socialized reality. Right? Like, you don't, when you think lone wolf, you don't think lone woman, you think lone. You think lone man. Right. So they're conditioned, and I'm, I'm speaking general, like there was always exceptions. Right? But generally speaking, they're social creatures, so they're gonna say what they're supposed to say. Right? Yeah. Because 'cause otherwise they're gonna be judged. Because if a woman, if you ask someone what does she want, she was like, oh, I want a nice guy who's, who's stable. Who's, who's sweet and so forth and so on. Because if she says, no, I want, I want the bad boy. Right. Rocker who does, you know, whatever.

4 (1h 29m 16s):
People are gonna judge her for that, for that desire. Right. And but then again, at the same time, she still actually may want both.

3 (1h 29m 23s):
Right.

4 (1h 29m 24s):
Right, right. And, and in, in many ways think she can have both. 'cause remember that roster Yeah. With all the different guys. That's her different purposes.

3 (1h 29m 31s):
That's the backup man.

4 (1h 29m 32s):
Yeah. So, you know, there's that aspect to it that I think I I understand it. I do, but I don't make decisions off of what I don't, I won't make decisions off of it because I understand what somebody does versus what they say can be two totally different things.

3 (1h 29m 48s):
Yeah. Well that's a lawyer in you too. Very much so. But there is also, there's another problem. And the other problem is media depictions of relationships. And that these media depictions of relationships are not based on actual relationships. They're based on playing to these desires that people have for this perfect thing.

4 (1h 30m 9s):
Yeah. and I think it creates a, i I think it creates an unattainable standard because what I've learned from my friends that I know who are married and are in good marriages, but from what I can gauge, shit's hard. It's not always fun. It, it isn't. and I think a lot of people look at relations and even just relationships in general, they're not, it's not an easy thing to do. You're talking about two different people. You're talking about people who are totally different. They may come together in some commonality, which is why they're attracted to each other. But you're still talking about two different personalities who have to come together and live with each other. Right. And so that's not an easy thing to do.

3 (1h 30m 47s):
And it's also why people are attracted to each other. They're not attracted generally to the same type of personality generally. It's true.

4 (1h 30m 53s):
Yeah. Which is absolutely true.

3 (1h 30m 54s):
I think those media depictions of reality, they fuck us up in so many ways because people look to movies and and songs and they look to that as their model of what life should be, including other aspects of your life outside of relationships like retirement. Like people have this like idea like, one day I'm gonna retire and I'm gonna have a great, no, you're gonna die earlier. You're gonna be disinterested and unengaged and you're not gonna be stimulated and you're gonna fucking die.

4 (1h 31m 20s):
That's funny you said that because I'll be honest with you, I had that like sometimes like 99, all I do is work. You know that about me. Yeah. You know, I'm always working. Yeah. Which is why I think I'm also so passionate about the things that have nothing to

3 (1h 31m 32s):
Do with, and also why you're so passionate about freedom. Exactly. Because you don't want anybody to get in the way of that. Exactly.

4 (1h 31m 35s):
Yeah. and I always have this fantasy that I thought I would reach a point where I could just do nothing and I would do nothing and I would just enjoy the rest of my life doing nothing. Right. The more I talk to people who are further along in their life than me, further along in their career than I, people who've retired, they all say the same. Same thing. and it echoes the sentiment that you just said. The last thing you wanna do is do nothing. Yeah. Because you will die

3 (1h 32m 6s):
Early. Yeah. You don't wanna sit on the porch. Yeah. I might wanna sit on the porch for a few hours. Three

4 (1h 32m 11s):
Hours. Yeah. Exactly.

3 (1h 32m 12s):
Yeah. It's nice. It's nice to relax. I like watching TV occasionally. Yeah. Sit down and when I know that I've done a lot and I can just chill and watch some stupid shit on tv. Yep. Great. I like it. I've figured out a way to enjoy that. But the idea of doing nothing, I may get to a certain point where I don't work anymore. Yes. But I will always be doing stuff. I'll always be bow hunting. I always be working out. Always be playing pool. I always be following hobbies. Yeah. I always be doing things that I'm interested in. Yeah. But the, what I'm lucky about and I think what you're lucky about as well, is that the things that we're interested in are also the things we do for a living.

4 (1h 32m 49s):
And I. That's why I feel so blessed. Oh,

3 (1h 32m 51s):
We're so lucky. Yeah. We're so lucky. We're, there's so many people out that that's that tho quote that most men live lives of quiet desperation. And when you're doing what you actually enjoy doing, you are so much better off than someone who's insanely wealthy. Who's miserable. 'cause they don't like what they're doing and they're just making money.

4 (1h 33m 9s):
I like working for every, like I said before, investments that I've made, that I've done really well. I like working. Yeah. For each and every dollar I mean you

3 (1h 33m 17s):
Like creating good content. Yes.

4 (1h 33m 19s):
And I, like I genuinely Yeah. Love it. Yeah. Like it's, and and it sucks sometimes, I'll be honest. Sure.

3 (1h 33m 25s):
It's, it's difficult. Yeah.

4 (1h 33m 26s):
Barry. Yeah. The pressure you put on yourself. Like it's, it's, it can be maddening, but

3 (1h 33m 31s):
It's also rewarding. Exactly. Yeah. I mean, that's, that's part of the journey of what makes things interesting and intriguing and I think the way human beings evolved, we evolved trying to solve complex puzzles. And in initially it was, how do I get food? Yeah. How do I protect my village? How do I protect my family? How do I avoid plague and fucking predators? And all these, so people had to solve complex problems. So it's a natural human reward system that's built into the organism in order for this organism to survive. So this idea of like complete sedentary lifestyle, providing you any enjoyment is just fucking nonsense.

4 (1h 34m 9s):
It's, it really is. And the funny thing is, I, I wanna say about a couple months ago, I was flirting with burnout every other day, like straight up. And then I, I realized the reason I'm flirting with burnout is because the way I'm approaching it, I'm approaching it like, I wanna finish this so I can get to nothing. Instead of, I enjoy doing this. This isn't it's work, but this is, this is what I'm doing. Right. and I don't wanna say, no, I did it. That feelings that, that kind of, Well call it transient, but that feeling of burnout or almost flirting with burnout every other day essentially kind of went away because I just threw myself into what I was doing instead of looking at as something i, I gotta get done so I can get to nothing.

4 (1h 34m 59s):
Because what was happening was I would do something, finish it, and then there's something else, and then there's something else. And I'm like, God, I just wanna take a break. I just wanna be able to take a break and just do nothing for like a month. Yeah. But do I really? No. Because within three days if that Exactly. I'm gonna be like, what can I create?

3 (1h 35m 17s):
Well, I enjoy vacations now, but I enjoy it as a time that I can spend with my family and we can hang out together. and I can have 24 7 time with my kids because when my kids are in school, yeah. They're in school. All day, they have friends, they have sports, they do, they have activities. It's hard to spend like a lot of quality time when we go on vacation. If we go on vacation for a week, it's one week of just hanging out and I try to get as many laughs in Yeah. As many fun things to do. But it's, it's sort of activity driven. Yeah. We, we enjoy time together, we do stuff. The idea of just like Jordan Peterson talks about this as well. He talks about this imaginary thing that people have.

3 (1h 35m 58s):
One day you're gonna be on the beach drinking margaritas, like staring at the sunrise.

4 (1h 36m 3s):
You know what's funny about that? Yeah. When I have that fantasy in my brain, you wanna know what I'm doing? What I'm sitting on the beach, I'm drinking a margarita and have my computer and I'm working on a script. Yeah. That is, that to me is my fantasy. Right. It's like, yeah, I don't like the, like I want to be able to do what I want, but I've just end up doing what I'm doing. But you enjoy. Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah.

3 (1h 36m 29s):
But you know, a day or two of that is fine.

4 (1h 36m 31s):
Yes. I'll binge watch. Little bit of that is fine. Yeah. I'll spend a day and I'll binge watch a show for like a day or two.

3 (1h 36m 36s):
And then you start feeling guilty. Yes. Yeah. Well, that's a sign of someone who loves what they do. Yeah. So it's like, it's not like a a like what you're doing is something you actually enjoy. So getting away from it is not enjoyable.

4 (1h 36m 48s):
Yeah. It's not, it's not

3 (1h 36m 50s):
Really not. That's the key to a happy life is surround yourself with people that are very fun to be around. That you love, that you enjoy, you like seeing them succeed. You love spending time with them. You all have fun together. Yeah. And then generally it's birds of a feather. So like, my friends all love, like to a person, they all love what they do. Yeah. To a person, the people that I enjoy being around. And that's, to me, when they do well and they're happy and they, and they can tell me about this thing that they're doing and how excited they're, it makes me excited. Yep. and I wanna do more stuff.

4 (1h 37m 25s):
Yeah. Like people's passion for thing is very infectious. Very infectious. Very infectious. Man. Fuck. I

3 (1h 37m 30s):
Love watching dudes make tables. I've been, the last like few days I've been on this YouTube rabbit hole watching dudes make tables. I have zero desire to make a table. Yeah. But I was watching these dudes make this fucking dope desk for this guy, and it was like resin and wood and they're putting it all together and it had this cool design to it. I was like, damn, that's badass. And the passion that these guys had for making sure that all the joints fit perfectly together and sanding them down and it's all precise and they, they're taking you through the process as a narrator talking about how time consuming this is, but this is the way to do it. Yeah. Because then the end, end result is so worth it.

3 (1h 38m 11s):
And then they're standing there when they deliver this desk. I'm like, damn, that's pretty dope.

4 (1h 38m 15s):
No, it's freaking awesome. Yeah. You know, the funny thing is, is like I've started realizing I might be into decor may that more than I'm willing to admit to myself. Really? Yeah. Not so much like I wanna style houses or stuff like that. But like, I think that's why I like hotels so much. Mm. Like I'm a hotel snob. Right.

3 (1h 38m 32s):
Like a dope hotel. When you go in there and you like, you feel good.

4 (1h 38m 36s):
Nothing makes me happy, man. And it's like, especially when you're traveling. 'cause the process of traveling sucks. Traveling is fun. The process sucks. Right. Mainly just the airport shit. But I love, like even when I come here, right when I come to Austin, like I look forward to coming to Austin because I, I have hotels I really enjoy out here. Like I stay at the proper, I stay at the Thompson. I love those place, I love those

3 (1h 38m 57s):
Hotels. Right? Yeah. Those are dope hotels.

4 (1h 38m 58s):
Yeah. Yeah. And, and it does wonders just for even just revitalizing you and just kind of pulling it out in, because where I live now, I love where I live. I love it. But there's just something different about being in a hotel. Yeah.

3 (1h 39m 9s):
Stylish bar, beautiful restaurant that you go to that's in the hotel. I almost

4 (1h 39m 13s):
Want, I travel so much and spend so much time at hotel bars. I almost wanted to start a blog where I just talk about my experiences at hotel bars. It's

3 (1h 39m 19s):
Not a bad idea. A lot of people love them. Yeah. And then a cool lobby. Yep. It makes you excited about being there. Exactly. It's good. Yeah. Yeah. It's a cool environment. Yeah. Someone's that's got like a really cool environment in their home that's conducive to lec, to a creativity is Rick Rubin. I was watching this tour. Rick Rubin's a friend of mine and he's fucking brilliant dude. I mean just legendary producer. Right. But I'm familiar

4 (1h 39m 42s):
With him.

3 (1h 39m 42s):
He wrote this book on creativity. It's really good. It's really fascinating, but about like what he does to foster creativity. And it's all, it's a lot of it is also environment. I mean his home show. There's like a, a tour of Rick Rubin's Malibu home and studio. So he's got this house and when you, you see his house the way is this it? Yeah. Yeah. So

10 (1h 40m 8s):
Another house. But this is his most famous house. The shame

3 (1h 40m 10s):
Of law studio. Yeah. Yeah. So the way he has everything set up in his house. So this don don't know if this is what I saw.

10 (1h 40m 17s):
This is also like 10 years old. I don't

3 (1h 40m 19s):
Know if Yeah. I think, I think he's got a new one now. Yeah. This is a long time ago. Rick is kind of a wild man, but he sets things up so that they make him feel a certain way when he goes into rooms.

4 (1h 40m 33s):
Remember how I told you I'm a city rat and I just love being in a city? Yeah. So I, I initially had more of kind of a traditional style house prior to that. I lived in high rise,

10 (1h 40m 45s):
Maybe this room

4 (1h 40m 46s):
I'll that see, yeah. See that. This is where the decor in me starts coming out. I'm like, yeah, I can, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm an appreciator of good decor, I guess is the best way to put it.

3 (1h 40m 55s):
Yeah. I mean if you like the way you set up your environment, like the things that excite you. Yeah. Like when you are walking around the things you see.

4 (1h 41m 3s):
And that's the thing was like, like aesthetics inspires me. Like they do beautiful things inspire me art.

3 (1h 41m 9s):
Yeah. Obviously when you see this studio and you walk around, like, I'm a big fan of art.

4 (1h 41m 13s):
Yeah. and I love it. And that's, and you know what the, the weird thing about me is in my place now, there's maybe two things on the wall. My house looks unlived in. And the reason is, is because I'm so specific, like, I can't tell you art-wise what I want. I have to see it. Oh, okay. And when I see it, I know it. I won't be able to explain it. I know it. So, and it's not like super deep shit. Like recently I bought this big gigantic canvas of a top down view of a nine 30 Porsche turbo. Mm. Right. So you can see the hips kind of flare out a little bit and stuff like that. I saw it. and I like, and I was just online. I was just at home just hanging out on the couch and I saw and I was like that, that Yeah.

4 (1h 41m 56s):
Because it evoked, it, it evoked a certain emotion in me that I'm like, when I look at that and I see that that's gonna ins, that's gonna inspire me. Yeah. To a degree. Right. I'm sounding very like Harry Fairy. But nonetheless, it's, it is what it is. The problem is, is like, I don't run across things visually or often enough where I'm like, okay, I wanna put that in my home. And when I do, it's usually like something that somebody already has so there isn't another one. Right. You, you get what I'm saying? Yeah. And so, and I will not just put anything up for the sake of just putting it up because I, I want it, I wanna walk into my place and I want it to mean something to me. Yeah. When I see it.

3 (1h 42m 32s):
Well, a lack of things is also something true. You know, like sometimes there's a lot of serenity in an empty room, which is like a couch in the table. You know, there's something about that too. And maybe one piece of art on the wall is better than five by pieces of art or a wall filled with art.

4 (1h 42m 50s):
That is true.

3 (1h 42m 51s):
Yeah.

4 (1h 42m 51s):
But there is something. But then there's also that, that mental playground, when you do have, and I and I think that's what you have here. Yeah.

3 (1h 42m 59s):
Right.

4 (1h 42m 59s):
Because I walk in, it's like nothing. Every time I look, something looks different. Right. Yeah. And, and it, and it works. It's like this beautiful controlled chaos that just works because it's chaotic, but yet uniform, if that makes any sense.

3 (1h 43m 16s):
Yeah. It's cultivated chaos.

4 (1h 43m 17s):
Yeah.

3 (1h 43m 18s):
Yeah.

4 (1h 43m 18s):
And I and I and I love it. And lighting. I'm big on lighting. So it's like everything here is, I can, I may be wrong about this, but I feel like everything here is designed to kind of lull you. Like relax you essentially.

3 (1h 43m 31s):
Yeah. In a way that the idea is to make it comfortable, but also stimulate conversation. Exactly. I want a lot of different weird shit on the table. Yeah. Like this, this symbol. And

4 (1h 43m 40s):
I've been looking at the back of the spine, the station since

3 (1h 43m 42s):
We got here. Yeah. Well this, this is actually a, how old was this again? This is, this is a piece of moose bone that was taken out of the Alaskan tundra.

4 (1h 43m 56s):
That's,

3 (1h 43m 57s):
That's from the boneyard in Alaska.

4 (1h 43m 59s):
How do you say moose, plural? Moose. Moose, okay. Yeah. So moose and elk. Fucking beautiful creatures, man. Yeah. Like you have to see them in person. Right. You have to. Yeah. They are stunning in person. Like, I just, that's all I wanted to say because you know, I was did my L cut not too long ago. and I remember we came across twice. So, and when you come face to face with them in the wild Yeah. It's just different.

3 (1h 44m 28s):
It's amazing.

4 (1h 44m 29s):
Yeah. They're beautiful man. Yeah. They are absolutely stunning. And I've never seen a moose in person, but I can,

3 (1h 44m 35s):
Bro. They don't even look real. Really. The first one, first time I saw one was in British Columbia and the first time I saw it I was like, it was like the scene in Jurassic Park where Jeff Goldman gets outta the Jeep and he's like, what the, they're so big, they don't look real. They're so big. They don't look real. Gotcha. It's double the size of an elk.

4 (1h 44m 54s):
Really?

3 (1h 44m 55s):
Double damn, double easy.

4 (1h 44m 57s):
And I was, and I was blown away by how the word I'm looking for is a like so agile and light footed LR Yeah. Because we stumbled on my hunt. We accidentally stumbled on one. He didn't know we were there. We didn't know he was there until we knew each other was there. Right. I've never seen anything move so fast through, through thick brush. Yeah. Without making a sound.

3 (1h 45m 22s):
Also with giant antlers. Yeah.

4 (1h 45m 24s):
It made

3 (1h 45m 25s):
Joke. Yeah.

4 (1h 45m 26s):
I'm talking thick

3 (1h 45m 28s):
Brush

4 (1h 45m 29s):
Didn't make a sound when it took

3 (1h 45m 31s):
Off. Yeah. I was

4 (1h 45m 32s):
Like, what the fuck? Yeah. I was like, okay, okay. This is real. So I was

3 (1h 45m 35s):
Like, they're designed for it. Yeah. Yeah. And they're, they're also designed to get away from credit the size of that moose I lived in. What does it say? Oh, I lived in London for most of my life, so I've never seen a real life moose. Look how much bigger it is than those cars. God bro. They're so big. You can't believe they're real's. Huge. There's, and they're aggressive. Really the difference between a moose and other animals is like, if you see a deer, they'll run away from you. Yeah. You see a moose, they might stomp you to death if you're close enough. They don't like it. Yeah. They'll come at you. Yeah. 'cause they're used to fighting off wolves. They, they're so, they're

4 (1h 46m 6s):
Stompers. Gotcha. Gotcha.

3 (1h 46m 7s):
They're stompers. Okay.

4 (1h 46m 9s):
You know, I saw an elephant take on a, what did it, what was it going on? I think it was a rhino.

3 (1h 46m 14s):
You

4 (1h 46m 14s):
Saw it live? No. Fuck no. I saw, no, I saw it on the internet. Yeah. and I'm like, I'm like, and I, I've started to realize elephants are not to be messed with,

3 (1h 46m 22s):
Not to be fucked with

4 (1h 46m 23s):
Like at all. No. Like they seem kind of passive. They're not.

3 (1h 46m 27s):
Well, they're passive if they don't need to

4 (1h 46m 30s):
Be. That's aggressive.

3 (1h 46m 31s):
Here it is. Elephant fucks up this rhino. I mean there's so much bigger I mean it's like a sumo wrestler versus high school, fucking 134 pounder.

4 (1h 46m 40s):
But when I first saw them face off, I thought the rider was gonna get the best of 'em. 'cause of the long ass horn. Nah,

3 (1h 46m 45s):
That horn ain't shit. Clearly. And that's also an elephant with small tusks. Yeah. I know. Which by the way, the sad thing is elephants genetically, they're starting to have smaller and smaller tusks because of the evolutionary aspect of the fact that people want them for their tusks. So they're, they, they're tusk are actually growing smaller

4 (1h 47m 5s):
Ah, to be less desirable. Yeah.

3 (1h 47m 8s):
Which is crazy that that's how evolution works. That it works over that small of a period of time.

4 (1h 47m 14s):
That is kind of nutty. Yeah. That is actually really nutty.

3 (1h 47m 17s):
It is. It's, it's, there's a documentary that I watched from the BBC once on the Congo. And it's so fascinating because the Congo at one point in time was grasslands and then a rainforest emerged as the climate shifted. And when the climate shifted, these Savannah animals got trapped in this jungle. So you have like gazelle and antelope and

4 (1h 47m 40s):
Inside of a

3 (1h 47m 41s):
Jungle there's an antelope, I think it's called a dyker that swims underwater for like a hundred yards and eats fish

4 (1h 47m 49s):
Antelope.

3 (1h 47m 49s):
Yeah. Little tiny antelope swims underwater. They've, they're evolving to swim underwater. There's fish that come out of the ground and they walk till they find the next water. So like, they're literally like evolving in front of our eyes. They're changing their behavior characteristics. And then what's, or is that radio a natural advantage radio? Is

4 (1h 48m 10s):
That radioactive?

3 (1h 48m 11s):
No, I

4 (1h 48m 11s):
Don't think I'm dope. I'm big.

3 (1h 48m 14s):
Yeah. That, that's in some places,

4 (1h 48m 16s):
You know, another thing's beautiful to watch move in their environment. Snow leopards. Oh yeah. Oh

3 (1h 48m 22s):
Yeah. Isn't it wild? There a cat that lives in the snow? You think of cats, you think of the jungle. Right.

4 (1h 48m 27s):
And then the funny thing is, it's like, you think, like, they call it a leopard, but I'm like, that thing is like a lion. It's weird. Like not a lion a tiger. Yeah. Yeah. I was like, think it's like a tiger

3 (1h 48m 35s):
Crazy big paw like snowshoe so they can run through the snow easier.

4 (1h 48m 39s):
And then watching them just chase the mountain goats all up and down the mountain, like, and do it with such fluidity. It just like, it's insane to me. I

3 (1h 48m 47s):
Saw Lynx in Canada once in the wild, this wild looking thing. Man, lynx are crazy looking. They just don't look like they belong there. And they make the nuttiest noises. They stand in front of each other and they scream at each other. They'll like get face to face and they're screaming at each other. What? Yeah. There's videos of these links that are standing in front of each other. That's a, they get like real close to here. You

4 (1h 49m 12s):
Know, they're gonna become a meme, right? Yeah.

3 (1h 49m 17s):
Look at these guys. Look, they just scream at each other's faces. Then they just get real close to each other and they don't do anything. They're like, bitch, this is my spot.

4 (1h 49m 34s):
Who runs into this?

3 (1h 49m 35s):
Isn't that what? Isn't that nuts?

4 (1h 49m 41s):
You know what this reminds me of?

3 (1h 49m 42s):
What?

4 (1h 49m 43s):
Okay, there's this video. Look

3 (1h 49m 44s):
At their feet, man, look at their feet.

4 (1h 49m 46s):
Oh, Jesus.

3 (1h 49m 47s):
Don't get too close, bitch. I'll slap you. But they don't fight. Look. 'cause they know that getting injured is so fucking dead

4 (1h 49m 53s):
Deadly. It's pretty much, it's a dead sentence.

3 (1h 49m 54s):
Yeah. You break your leg or you get your eye cr scratched out. That's it. It

4 (1h 49m 59s):
Reminds me of this video I saw on Instagram where it's like all these women at like some retreat and they're like moving crazy and screaming

3 (1h 50m 6s):
And like, ah, one, those women in Powerment retreats. Yeah. I was like, what the fuck did I just watch? Yeah. What the fuck did

4 (1h 50m 15s):
You just watch? And then I watch it again. Yeah. And then I watch it again. I could take my eyes away from it.

3 (1h 50m 18s):
It's, that always seems like someone's got some scam running. Like I mean,

4 (1h 50m 22s):
I'm

3 (1h 50m 22s):
Gonna show, show you how to be powerful. You just kind screaming.

4 (1h 50m 24s):
To me, it just demonstrates how

3 (1h 50m 27s):
Imagine men doing that getting together. I'm sure they do. I'm sure they dos some, some male retreat, like probably organized by a gay guy trying to fuck these dudes and get up the all together in the fucking jungle and just yell. We're gonna yell, we're gonna yell naked.

4 (1h 50m 44s):
I think it's the, the most brutal demonstration of how good your life is. Right.

3 (1h 50m 50s):
Right, right. And you don't have to do that.

4 (1h 50m 52s):
Like Yeah. That's, that's the extent of your problem.

3 (1h 50m 54s):
Yeah.

4 (1h 50m 55s):
But I mean

3 (1h 50m 57s):
There's so many men out there that don't know how to be a man. They don't know what to do, and they feel lost and disconnected and they wish they were something. They, they're not. So those guys are like super susceptible to these, like how to be a man, like

4 (1h 51m 10s):
Things Yeah. It's, it's definitely, you know, there's, there's a fine line between, you know, what it is to be a man and in the caricature of what it is to be a man. Right, right. I like, I was raised by a single, I was more or less raised by a single parent, mother, but I can tell I know now as an adult, she overcompensated in a lot of ways because she knew she was having to raise a man. Mm. And the way she did it was, she wasn't, she wasn't hard on me brutally, but it was brutal. It was enough where I, she forced me to do things on my own. But then also what she did is she made sure that she had male influences in my life Mm.

4 (1h 51m 51s):
That I would take after. Now at the time, I didn't understand what was going on. I'm like, why do you want me to go see Dr. Johnson? I don't wanna go talk to Dr. Johnson. Right. Right. And Dr. Johnson was this cardiologist who she would force me to go talk to and be around.

3 (1h 52m 4s):
That's very wise of your mother though.

4 (1h 52m 6s):
Yeah. She's I mean, she's freaking phenomenal at that. Like, I should be inherently fucked up, flat out. Mm. But because of her, I'm not.

3 (1h 52m 14s):
That's amazing. Yeah. That's amazing that she was wise enough to see that and to recognize that and to, to act on it, you know? Yeah. Yep. Because if you don't, it's too late. Pretty much. Yeah. You let that guy get to adulthood and you can't influence him, then it's very hard to take a fucked up, grown adult and then turn him around. and I think

4 (1h 52m 34s):
The beautiful thing I think I'm glad she didn't do with me that I've seen sometimes with single parents sometimes is she didn't baby me in a manner in which like she understood her limitations as a woman. Right. So she knew she had to have male influence to some degree. Yeah. So she was very cautious about like, if my, like for instance, like if my mom happened to be a hoe, I would never know because she did such a phenomenal job in curating whoever it was that was gonna be around me, that was a man and that influence and how much that played a part in me growing up. Mm. Because I think she understood I can only do so much as a woman to teach this guy how to be a man. And now when I think about things and how I compose and how I handle myself, I subconsciously think about those individuals who I interacted with.

4 (1h 53m 19s):
And that's what I pulled from growing up. And so I thank her for that. At least knowing her limitations from that standpoint and then figuring out a way to, to provide that example for me that I Yeah,

3 (1h 53m 31s):
That's very important. It's very important. I got very fortunate that when I was young, I got involved in martial arts when I was really young.

4 (1h 53m 37s):
Same here. I did too. I didn't continue with it to the degree that you did, but I definitely, and for me, what that martial arts, martial arts turned into basketball for me. Mm. And that's what that was.

3 (1h 53m 47s):
Well, it's anything that's difficult to do. Yeah. Yeah. Things are difficult where it's undeniable that the work you put in equals how much better you get, period. Yep. There's, if I mean, there's certain genetic advantages, but even with those genetic advantages, the more work you put in, the more results you will get. And there's other people with genetic advantages too. Yep. And then when you're competing, then you're competing against a bunch of people that are driven and they have a much higher standard. Yeah. And that's what athletics provides a lot of people, people

4 (1h 54m 14s):
Under, like, to this day, I pull from my experiences playing basketball because when I was younger, like, like it's funny to say now because like as an adult, it's like, like you're not going to the NBA colleges. Like that's not happening. But nobody could tell me that I wasn't. Right. No one and I worked like I would, that's what I was gonna do. I put in the effort, I put in the work, no one was gonna outwork me for that. Mm. And because of it, all of the struggle, everything I did from that point to now, I still pull from that because it set, it set a pattern of behavior in me. So all I did was when I, when I realized your hoop dreams aren't happening, I just transferred that, that drive, that that consistency, that discipline and I just transferred over to what I was doing next.

4 (1h 55m 3s):
Right? Yes. And then, and, and I, I just continued to do that. Whatever I changed or I switch up to and start doing next, that's what I put it into. Yeah.

3 (1h 55m 11s):
That's what I was taught. I was taught when I was young that martial arts are a vehicle for developing your human potential. And if you could figure out how to get good at this, you could figure out how to get good at pretty much everything. Yeah.

4 (1h 55m 22s):
I think that's the one thing I have a regret. I regret is not living longer in martial arts because I think I have, I have a, a brutal, brutal amount of respect for any individual who can perfect their craft in that space. I think fighters are some of the toughest people on the planet because,

3 (1h 55m 43s):
Which is by virtue of what they do, they have

4 (1h 55m 45s):
To be. Yeah, exactly.

3 (1h 55m 46s):
That is what they do. They do one of the toughest things to do. You're going against willingly going against a trained individual who has spent time preparing for you.

4 (1h 55m 56s):
Literally.

3 (1h 55m 57s):
Yeah.

4 (1h 55m 57s):
Like, it's not like, oh, I'm out and about and I got caught off guard and no. and I can take advantage of the fact that he doesn't know. This is like, I'm coming to kill you. Not literally, but I'm coming to kill you. You're coming kill

3 (1h 56m 6s):
Me three months. You got press conferences. Yeah. You, you're talking shit to each other. Getting all ramped up emotionally. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's I mean. That's also why it's so exciting to see. Yeah. Because you know, you're seeing, you know, seeing like, oh my God, these guys have been getting ready for this forever. Here we go. When you see two dudes just looking at each other across the octagon, they're staring at each other getting ready to go. Fuck. Yeah. Just the tension in the air is so crazy.

4 (1h 56m 31s):
And what, and what's crazy is the co like you can be on top of the world, 1, 2, 3 fights in and then Yep. In two seconds just like that. Yep. Everything comes crashing down. Yeah. And so then now you have to figure out how to pick those pieces back up because there's very small room for mar there's very little margin of error to come back from a loss.

3 (1h 56m 55s):
And the crazy thing is, a lot of times fighters are at the peak of their ability and then they have one loss and they fall off, fall off a cliff. That's like Tony Ferguson is the greatest example of that. He was the scariest fucking guy in the 155 pound division until he wasn't. Yeah. And then he loses to Justin Gaje and then he's goes on like a seven fight losing streak. It's crazy. 'cause for years no one can touch him. For years, he was literally the boogeyman. Everyone was scared of him. Scared of that dude.

4 (1h 57m 24s):
And, and the crazy thing is, is like with UFC fighting, like you, there's, there's no one way to be the best. Right. Because like, there's so much going on in a fight. Yep. That like one lapse in focus. Yeah. That split second lapse in focus fight done. Yep.

3 (1h 57m 41s):
Done, done. Right.

4 (1h 57m 42s):
And you could be perfect in everything else. Yep. Just like

3 (1h 57m 46s):
That. That's Kamar Usman and Leon Edwards kamara's dominating for the whole fight. And then in the fifth round with like a minute to go, gets head kicked into the shadow realm and it's crazy. And then Kama loses the next fight and then he loses the fight after that. So Kamar iss this like unbelievably dominant champion. Yeah. And then just like that one head kick. Yeah. Yeah. That's

4 (1h 58m 9s):
Man. I mean he's still

3 (1h 58m 10s):
On the hunt. I mean he could still come back. He had a really good fight in his last fight against Hamza, AYA. But you know, he lost, and then here you are three losses in a row.

4 (1h 58m 21s):
What you do with that loss is, is everything. It's, it's literally everything. And it's probably way harder than any fight that you've actually been in.

3 (1h 58m 29s):
And then there's the reality of your body. Your body can only take so much of that before it just starts to fail. And Kamar, one of the things that I really admire about him, he's so open and honest about his injuries. Like he's, his knees are so fucked up. He can't run. He can't, he doesn't walk downstairs. He goes backwards downstairs.

4 (1h 58m 49s):
We need to send him to Ben

3 (1h 58m 51s):
To Ben knees

4 (1h 58m 52s):
Over toes.

3 (1h 58m 53s):
Oh yeah. Yeah. I'm sure that would help a little. But I'm sure he is probably doing that stuff. He has no cartilage in his knees. Mm. His knees are destroyed. Gotcha. I mean they're destroyed. They're bone on bone. He's, he's resigned himself to this thing that at one point, if you look at Kamara's body, his upper body looks like a fucking superhero. But he has these small legs. Gotcha. He, he is got their, his legs are so small compared to his upper body. And part of that is 'cause his knees are destroyed. Gotcha. There's only so much he could do with his legs.

4 (1h 59m 23s):
The funny thing is, is like, I'm the opposite. My legs are do damn big. I hate 'em, dude. What

3 (1h 59m 28s):
You mean you hate your legs? They're too big. What are you talking about? They're too big. How?

4 (1h 59m 31s):
They just like, I have big legs. I have big calves. I've always been like, ever since like I was young. I was like used to call me calves. Like, 'cause my calves are so big. That's

3 (1h 59m 39s):
Great. Genetics, man. Yeah. I mean you should have been a kickboxer. I mean it's a giant advantage. I

4 (1h 59m 43s):
Mean, probably so. but it a little too late now.

3 (1h 59m 46s):
It's not too late to train. Yeah.

4 (1h 59m 48s):
No. And and I did, I was doing, I was training, I was training at Fortis for a period of time. Oh, were you really? Yeah.

3 (1h 59m 52s):
I mean

4 (1h 59m 52s):
Me and Safe were really good friends.

3 (1h 59m 53s):
Oh, that's great. I love that dude. Yeah. I love that gym too. That's a great fucking

4 (1h 59m 57s):
Gym. Oh yeah. Honestly, during Covid it was my refuge. Yeah. That gym was my refuge during Covid. Dude. I mean and I. I was going, I was in with some dark, I was going through some dark times. And that gym hell safe. I like that gym. Was was my refuge. Shout

3 (2h 0m 10s):
Out to safe ou. Yeah. He's awesome. He's a great coach too. Yeah.

4 (2h 0m 14s):
No, he is fucking man. Like, should I see him? Should I see him doing the gym? Man, it's

3 (2h 0m 17s):
Freaking amazing. He's so good. In the corner, there's like a, a sign of a great coach is the way they give advice in between rounds. And that guy is precise. He's technical, he's motivating, he's intense. He lets you know's not stacking with the, he's not gonna sugar coach shit. It's not

4 (2h 0m 31s):
The it's not just the ring, bro.

3 (2h 0m 33s):
I'm sure. Yeah.

4 (2h 0m 34s):
Like, like when we meet me and safe talk.

3 (2h 0m 37s):
Yeah.

4 (2h 0m 38s):
We're we're talking. Yeah. Like, like he's Yeah.

3 (2h 0m 41s):
He's intense. Yeah. But that's how you become a great coach. Yeah. You know, you understand things for what they really are. Yep. And this is what you have to do. And there's no if fans or whats about it? You

4 (2h 0m 49s):
Know, you know what's funny? We actually, I don't know if he wants me to tell this story, but sorry bro. I mean it's not that big a deal. But like the, the way we met, I met him at a gun range. So I, I met him at a gun range and then I figured it was a good time for me to get into fighting again. So I said, I called him up, I was like, Hey, I'm good. I'm good with the gun stuff, but it means nothing if I can't work my hands. Right. So I called him, went to the gym, kind of did the first, you know, showed me the lay of the land and then he got a notification on his phone that his alarm was going off. And like somebody was breaking into his house. And he was like, and we just met. And, but he knew who I was in the space that I'm in.

4 (2h 1m 29s):
And he was like, dude, something's going on in my house. I need to figure out what's going on. He's like, he's like, you gonna roll with me?

3 (2h 1m 36s):
Oh

4 (2h 1m 36s):
Shit. Yeah. So we hop in, hop in his truck, we drive to his house and we cleared his house.

3 (2h 1m 41s):
Oh shit.

4 (2h 1m 42s):
Don don't know if you tell a story or if I did, I'm sorry. But yeah. Like we, and, and then from there we just became best friends. Like a, after that it was like we went shooting together. But

3 (2h 1m 51s):
Dude is willing to come clear your house with you.

4 (2h 1m 54s):
I mean

3 (2h 1m 55s):
That's a ride or die right there. I mean that is real. The scariest situation ever. You don't know what's in your house, You don't you go, any room could be filled with a guy with a gun. Yep. You literally don't know.

4 (2h 2m 5s):
Literally don't. Now was it the smartest thing to probably do? No, but I think it was one of those, one of those situations you don't think you just go, yeah. You just go and I've done it in my house before where like I've gotten home and it, this is a little on the lower end of intensity, but you know, sometimes you, that that garage door is cracked open Right. When you get back and you're like, what the fuck? And you're like, I know I close that door. Right. And, and then it's like, all right, let's figure this out. You know, now I'm clearing my house. Right. Well,

3 (2h 2m 30s):
The, the reality of crime and the reality of violence is something that you can't just fucking bury your head in the sand about. It doesn't mean you have to be a violent person or a terrible person. And you're clearly not. You're a very nice guy. But you, you are very well trained. You know what to do with weapons. Yeah. And that will, if if the shit hits the fan one day, that will serve you well. Yeah.

4 (2h 2m 53s):
And I mean, and it, and God forbid that ever happened and I pray, God forbid ever happens. and I pray. Look, I carry a gun every single day as long as I can legally

3 (2h 3m 2s):
Praying that you never have to use it.

4 (2h 3m 3s):
Praying I, if I ever have to Of course dude, if I ever have to use my gun of self-defense, I'm gonna have to get therapy. Yes. Period. Right?

3 (2h 3m 11s):
Probably.

4 (2h 3m 11s):
But that, that's just it. don don't want to have to. Exactly. But I, I much more don't wanna find myself in a situation where I have to, but I can't do anything about it 'cause I don't have the thing I need to

3 (2h 3m 23s):
Do it. Or you can't protect someone you love, which is even more even

4 (2h 3m 25s):
Worse. Terrifying.

3 (2h 3m 26s):
Exactly. You watch something happen, there's nothing you could do about it. Like, bro, kind of unrelated, but did you see this fucking thing that happened in California where this woman stabbed her boyfriend 108 times and they let her go with community service? They said that she was psychotic from smoking marijuana. Which is so I don't

4 (2h 3m 48s):
Smoke

3 (2h 3m 49s):
By the way. Don't smoke. I haven't been smoking in a long time. I ain't never thought about stabbing one person. Ever. Forget about someone that you're in a relationship with. 108 times.

4 (2h 3m 60s):
Yeah. That's, that's

3 (2h 4m 1s):
Something else. They, the judge said that the defense was that she had a psychotic break from I think it was one hit.

4 (2h 4m 9s):
So I had a bad panic attack from one hit.

3 (2h 4m 13s):
Yeah. You could have a panic attack with some strong, especially if you're not a regular smoke.

4 (2h 4m 17s):
No,

3 (2h 4m 18s):
I wasn't. Was it a bong hit or a joint?

4 (2h 4m 19s):
It was a joint. What what it was, was, was it was my first time actually inhaling

3 (2h 4m 25s):
When Bill Clinton the way before.

4 (2h 4m 28s):
No, seriously. and I just all I remember, I couldn't stop coughing. Oh. Not realizing each cough is just sending more to routine to my system. Yeah. And that was the real, like, that was me really smoking for the first time. Yeah. And let's just say all I remember, I'm sitting on a couch having a massive panic attack watching Eddie Murphy raw. And, and, and how, and how I knew I was fucked up was I've watched raw multiple times and never have I not laughed my ass off. and I remember sitting there watching you were freaking out and I was like, this is not funny. Is not freakout. I was like, oh dude, something's wrong with you dude. I was like,

3 (2h 5m 2s):
So you were just freaking out. Yeah. You can freakout man. Yeah. So this is the story. Well,

10 (2h 5m 7s):
Yeah. I mean, it just said that this New York post said there was just really strong weed, 30%

3 (2h 5m 13s):
Weed ever. Whatever one hit, she stabbed her boyfriend 108 times. I don't care if she took 18 bong hits

10 (2h 5m 19s):
And herself and the dog.

3 (2h 5m 21s):
What? Well, maybe there's something wrong with her and she shouldn't get fucking community service. Oh yeah. That's insane.

10 (2h 5m 28s):
And then herself,

3 (2h 5m 29s):
She stabbed her dog and then repeated, stabbed herself repeatedly after deputies were called to their apartment. Okay. After the I mean First of all, when people kill people, they often kill themselves. This happens to men who kill their girlfriends or their ex-girlfriends. They oftentimes, they'll shoot themselves. It happens all the time.

4 (2h 5m 45s):
She found out he was cheating.

3 (2h 5m 46s):
Well, whatever it was, the whole thing is she received just two years of probation. A hundred hours of community service and no prison time.

4 (2h 5m 55s):
I would believe that more if it was alcohol.

3 (2h 5m 57s):
E even alcohol doesn't make any.

4 (2h 5m 59s):
Yeah, but that's what I'm saying. It would would've

3 (2h 6m 0s):
To be like crystal meth mixed with t with fucking angel dust pc. Yeah. Just the lawyers were asked to describe the difference in her case in a fatal drunken driving crash was Goldstein chalked up to awareness, noting that, I don't know what her, how you say her name, whatever her last name is, did not know she was what she was getting herself into as Amelia provided the pot, but did not show her the warning on the label. What, as far as the DUI is concerned, that person knowingly and consciously drinks to excess and decides to get behind the wheel of a car and Mrs. Whatever her name is case, she took a hit of what she believed to be a legal consumer product in the sanctity of Mr.

3 (2h 6m 41s):
Elia's home as they sat on his couch with no plans to go drive home later that evening

10 (2h 6m 47s):
For that 43 times in her neck, she stabbed

3 (2h 6m 49s):
Herself. She stabbed herself 43 times in the neck. Oh my God. Well that's the marks on her neck. I don think she really tried that hard. Well, listen, people try to kill themselves after they kill somebody. Look, if you're, if you're lying there and your, your boyfriend is got 108 stab wounds and you're like, oh my God, my life is over. I'm gonna jail for the rest of my life.

4 (2h 7m 9s):
But why the dog?

3 (2h 7m 10s):
Because she's fucking just an angry lady. I mean, why did she,

4 (2h 7m 14s):
I I think she just had a psychotic break and I don't think it was the we,

3 (2h 7m 17s):
Who knows,

4 (2h 7m 18s):
But I think she found out something she did not want to find out. It could she snapped.

3 (2h 7m 22s):
But it might not be that I mean she might be fucking legitimately crazy. But either way, two hour or a hundred hours of community service in two years of probation is fucking nuts. I mean she just killed somebody. Imagine the rules reversed. Imagine it was a man who stabbed his wife a hundred or his girlfriend 108 times and stabbed the he'd he'd under the jail. He'd be under the jail. Yeah. Death sentence. Experts for both the defense and the prosecution concluded the pot she smoked caused her to slip into a psychotic state. Now here's the, the story. You can have psychotic breaks for marijuana. It is possible. It's possible to have schizophrenic breaks for marijuana.

3 (2h 8m 2s):
It's well documented with certain people that have preposition. Yes. So, but either way, nobody, it doesn't make any sense. Marijuana is not a violent drug. Oh yeah. It's not the kind of drug that makes you wanna hurt somebody.

4 (2h 8m 15s):
And keep in mind, I'm, this is coming from somebody who does not like marijuana. Yeah. At all. I don't believe that.

3 (2h 8m 22s):
It sounds insane. Yeah. I don't believe that's, it sounds insane,

4 (2h 8m 25s):
Don don't.

3 (2h 8m 25s):
Yeah. There's probably a lot more to that story. Yeah. Very

4 (2h 8m 27s):
Much so. Very, very, very much so. She stabbed

3 (2h 8m 29s):
Herself with a neck like Jesus.

4 (2h 8m 31s):
That's crazy. So the

10 (2h 8m 33s):
Deputies used a sun gun on her four times and another deputy hit her with a metal baton multiple times before knocking the knife out of her hand

3 (2h 8m 40s):
While she was stabbing herself. Or him,

10 (2h 8m 43s):
I guess herself. I mean, just didn't say who she was stabbing. She

3 (2h 8m 45s):
Might have started stabbing herself when the cop showed up too. Like, who knows.

4 (2h 8m 49s):
Yeah. Yeah.

3 (2h 8m 51s):
I mean the whole thing is nuts. I

4 (2h 8m 52s):
Mean. But then again, like I've seen, like I've, I watched a video on the way up here on the way up here. I didn't watch it. I was listening to it while I was driving on the way up here. And like, it was this girl, I guess she was drunk or something and the cops were trying to arrest her and she completely lost it. I mean screaming at the top of her lungs. Like I mean complete psychotic breakdown. Yeah. Just to avoid accountability of the fact that she was driving drunk. So I mean it's,

3 (2h 9m 19s):
There's some people that are outta their fucking minds. Yeah. But I just don't think two years of probation is enough for that.

4 (2h 9m 25s):
No I mean, I think that's, that sounds insane. I think that goes without saying.

3 (2h 9m 28s):
It sounds so insane. That goes without saying that the judge said that. Yeah.

4 (2h 9m 32s):
But it, I wanna see the judge. I wanna talk to the judge. Whoa.

10 (2h 9m 35s):
Hold on too. They were only dating for three weeks.

3 (2h 9m 39s):
Oh my God. So even if you cheated on her, the fuck, fuck

4 (2h 9m 41s):
Yeah. That wouldn't, that doesn't even, that wouldn't warrant that each

10 (2h 9m 43s):
Other for about three weeks. Wow.

3 (2h 9m 45s):
She worked as an audiologist. What is that?

10 (2h 9m 48s):
Sound?

3 (2h 9m 49s):
Sound? And the dude was an accountant. Maybe she stabbed him 'cause he was boring. It's a horrible tragedy all the way around. Schwartz said it's a tragedy for the victim in his family. It's a tragedy for my client and her family. Yeah. Well it's certainly a tragedy. That's No, but high potency, marijuana should put you in a place where you are terrified of everything. Just

4 (2h 10m 9s):
Want to everything. Yeah,

3 (2h 10m 9s):
Exactly. Not that you have the ability to grab a knife and stab a guy 108 times. That sounds nuts. That sounds so nuts.

10 (2h 10m 18s):
And it said in September they got the murder charge dropped to involuntary manslaughter after was determined she lost her cognitive abilities because she was in the throes of psychosis. Mm.

3 (2h 10m 29s):
Yeah. Maybe. But I mean, I, I just don't think that absolves you of responsibility. You know, the the thing about it is you, there's no way to know what was going on in her head. Yeah. Which is the thing like, you know, a friend of mine sent me a video. Tim di sent me this video of these schizophrenics in downtown la It's so crazy. There's so many of 'em. And these, these, all these different people are walking on the street just screaming at people who aren't there and just yelling into the sky.

4 (2h 10m 56s):
I had my old place in Dallas. I, I had a guy, I call him Richie, I don't really know his name. I just call him that 'cause he likes to stand outside my door and just have loud conversations with himself. Like he would do It wasn't like, like all the time. Yeah. But it'd be like once every like three or four months and he would just be standing don don't know why he picked my door to do it. don don't know. I never engaged with him or interacted with him. I would just hear my open window. I'm like, there goes Richie. But yeah, man, the

3 (2h 11m 25s):
The mind is so weird. It is. You know, it's, it's like just the fact that a human being, forget about under the state of marijuana, PCP, whatever, just the fact that there's something, if you've never stabbed any before, anyone before, something that someone can give you that makes you, that can motivate you to do that. Where you've never done that before. You never stabbed anybody. And then all of a sudden you stab some guy you've been dating 108 times. The mind is just so weird. Yeah. You know, we were talking today earlier, while we're at the range about Instagram and about the shit you see on Instagram these days. And when we were talking about how we were kids, faces of Death was the wildest thing we'd ever seen. Yep. and it was nothing

4 (2h 12m 4s):
Compared to what you see on Instagram. Nothing. Nothing. You can go on Instagram and see 1,150. I'm about to, you know, I'm about to get in my soapbox. Right? Yeah, please. You can go on Instagram and watch 1100 50 million people get stabbed, shot, killed, thrown off buildings and it'll show up on your explore page. Right. I post a picture of a gun. I'm throttled never, I don't show up on explore

3 (2h 12m 25s):
Page. Never seen a gun on my explore page.

4 (2h 12m 27s):
It's, they, they,

3 (2h 12m 29s):
The

4 (2h 12m 30s):
Level of, it's not even don don't even call it shadow banning anymore. They tell you they're doing it. Like, I can't post, I even not post against this is the responsible way to handle a firearm. Throttled. Yeah. No. Wow. Throttle. Like, it's insane on Instagram. Like what, what Instagram is doing to the gun community is monumentally insane. So you know what the fucked up part about it is? Because of the way they are about that. The only representation of firearms that you're gonna get exposed to, generally speaking, if you're not already following 'em, are the negative representations of firearms. Yeah. Or the unsafe way to handle a firearm. Yeah. 'cause those are making it, but the shit that we post, post the responsible shit that doesn't.

3 (2h 13m 9s):
Bro, how many videos have you seen of dudes in like, traditional Arab attire shooting the guns off in the air and then, then they accidentally shoot their friend? Dude, there's so many,

4 (2h 13m 20s):
Many, many of those you can do. You see way more of those.

3 (2h 13m 22s):
They're just dancing, da da da da bang. Dude gets it in the head.

4 (2h 13m 27s):
Dude. You wanna know how I,

3 (2h 13m 28s):
I've seen so many of those. You wanna

4 (2h 13m 29s):
Know how I learned gun safety when I got into guns?

3 (2h 13m 31s):
Sure.

4 (2h 13m 32s):
Fucking YouTube. Because there were so many examples of people when I started, when I got into guns. Oh, and I got into gun community. There were so many people who were reiterating over and over and over again. Check your gun, make sure it's clear, never pointed at something you're not willing to destroy. Guns are always loaded at all times. Don't matter what it, it became ingrained in my brain. Yes. Like they almost shamed you into gun safety.

3 (2h 13m 54s):
Well, one of the things today was a very good representation of that. Everyone today had responsible gun safety habits. Everyone today, everyone was pointing the gun at the ground. Everyone's clearing the gun. No one ever pointed a gun in the direction of someone. No. People were constantly checking even after they cleared the gun. There were

4 (2h 14m 15s):
Literally probably 25 guns out there. Yeah. And magazines all over the place. All over the place. But like I said, but it, that's, it's it's establishing that safety dynamic. Yes. And you can't, and they, and they talk about, oh man, I'm getting on my soapbox.

3 (2h 14m 30s):
Get on. They

4 (2h 14m 31s):
Talk about the other side talks about this idea of gun safety, firearm safety. And the way they go about doing it is by blocking off all the people who are teaching the safe way to handle a firearm. I don't understand this. If you want to have a population, there are 400 million guns in this country. The guns aren't going anywhere. So if you wanna minimize the number of kids who accidentally shoot themselves, if you wanna minimize the number of adults who handle firearms incorrectly and up accidentally shooting someone, what you need to do is allow the information of how to safely handle a firearm, be spread to the public so that they understand it. It works. Because that's how I learned it. No one came to me and said, this is the safe way to do it. I went online, I was learning about firearms and I learned from the people who were handling 'em responsibly, how to responsibly handle a firearm.

4 (2h 15m 17s):
Yes. And as a result, I could, I started creating videos and I started teaching people how to responsibly handle firearms. And then those people who start making their own videos and teaching people how to responsibly handle firearms. But instead, what we're getting with the dynamic of social media nowadays is they're trying to shut down all the people who are demonstrating how to handle firearm responsibly. Or even just talking about the law aspect of it. So do you want people running around out there who don't understand the legal aspect of owning a firearm? Or how when you actually decide to carry a firearm, when is a good time not to shoot? When is a good time to shoot? No. Instead they shadow, ban and block all of our content and only leave the negative representation out there.

4 (2h 15m 59s):
And then wonder why all of these accidental shootings continue to happen.

3 (2h 16m 3s):
And the negative ones find their way into my feed all the time from people that I don't

4 (2h 16m 9s):
Follow. Exactly.

3 (2h 16m 11s):
So they must know what, like there's a, we were talking about today about that thing that you click on that says, do you still wanna watch this? Yeah. This could be disturbing. So they know.

4 (2h 16m 20s):
No, they know about it. They

3 (2h 16m 21s):
Know. Yeah. I watched the guy get cut in half by a train today. They were fucking around on the train station. The guy pushes his friend and the train comes and his friend goes in between the train and the crack and gets ripped apart. The guys grab his arms, they pull him and it's just, and it just guts out of a torso. Jesus. And everyone's screaming, it's horrible. and it just showed up on my he

4 (2h 16m 43s):
So bunny feet. Yep. I see it all the time.

3 (2h 16m 44s):
So if they have that warning, they must know what that is. Does, does TikTok? I don't, not on TikTok. They ban

4 (2h 16m 51s):
Me.

3 (2h 16m 52s):
But does they ban you

4 (2h 16m 53s):
Just for showing guns? Wow. Just for showing guns.

3 (2h 16m 56s):
Does TikTok show violence? Do they have that kind of violence?

4 (2h 16m 59s):
I don't know. Honestly. Because you're banned. Because I was And the the fucked up thing about it is, is this, like when I started the TikTok page, and you remember TikTok is a younger audience, so what's

3 (2h 17m 14s):
It skew towards? Like

4 (2h 17m 15s):
It's skewed to teens. Teens,

3 (2h 17m 17s):
Yeah.

4 (2h 17m 18s):
So, but the thing about it is, is I can go on TikTok and, and watch girls engaged in sex, in, in, in suggestive, suggestive sexual behavior. All day long on TikTok. Right, right. And I'm like, but anything with a firearm, regardless whether it's safe or not, they man, they just banned me just flat out. and I'm like, what did I do exactly here? Is

3 (2h 17m 45s):
There any, is that anyone on TikTok that chose firearms or is it everyone gets banned?

4 (2h 17m 49s):
I'm assuming so. I don't know because I, I can't really, I can't scroll. I can't peruse it and figure out Right. What else is on there. Because even when I try to, I try, I try to, what you call it, I tried to appeal this decision and then it just reaffirmed it. And so it's, it's one of those things that's very frustrating. The funny thing is, is like x which I know You don't like it. You can call X, but you know, X don't have that problem.

3 (2h 18m 15s):
They don't. Well they, they let porn on. Yeah.

4 (2h 18m 17s):
Yeah. There's that,

3 (2h 18m 18s):
That's the wild west over

4 (2h 18m 20s):
There. Yes. Puts me freedom. My speech, it's

3 (2h 18m 23s):
I mean. Listen, I'm not against it. You do whatever you want. I, I I like the internet. Yes. I like the actual internet. I like people being able to show what they're interested in. Yeah. As long as you're not victimizing someone. As long as you're not doxing people threatening all that stuff. Yeah. But other than the things that are illegal and should be, it's, you should be able to show whatever the fuck you want. If there's an active gun community, and especially someone like you that promotes responsible gun use and shows people how to handle things correctly, it says

11 (2h 18m 53s):
That you can, on TikTok, this is their policy on guns.

3 (2h 18m 55s):
They do not allow the trade of firearms or explosive weapons or content showing or promoting them if they're not used in a safe or appropriate setting. What does that mean? That

4 (2h 19m 5s):
Means, what does that mean?

3 (2h 19m 5s):
TikTok can be a place that educates people on the responsible use and ownership of weapons. No,

4 (2h 19m 9s):
They, no, no. They do not

3 (2h 19m 10s):
A lot True shit.

4 (2h 19m 11s):
Nope. That's

3 (2h 19m 11s):
Not true at all. Because everything you do is responsible. Exactly. I've seen, I've seen 50 of your fucking videos. I've never seen one irresponsible video.

4 (2h 19m 19s):
It's insane.

3 (2h 19m 19s):
Firearms and explosive weapons can cause severe injury or death. Especially when used in an unsafe manner. Exactly. But though, but what you were saying is so important to hear that if you don't see the responsible use of it from someone who knows how to do it and also knows how to teach people that, how is that message going to get out there? That's how people learn how to use it correctly.

4 (2h 19m 38s):
Exactly. And but here we are. Here we are you know, irony is, is at least like YouTube has its problems, but they're getting better, they're getting better with it. At least YouTube will will guide you on, okay, this is what we're okay with and this is what we're not okay with. And then even if they get it wrong, they'll fix it.

3 (2h 19m 55s):
So does YouTube demonetize any of your videos? Yeah.

4 (2h 19m 58s):
All time.

3 (2h 19m 59s):
All the

4 (2h 19m 59s):
Time. Now I can appeal it, right? And, and submit it for a manual review. And then sometimes, like I have two videos. Right now they're under manual, manual review. And sometimes they're like, yeah, sometimes they're like, no. And

3 (2h 20m 12s):
What is their objection to what's in those videos? It's,

4 (2h 20m 15s):
It's, it's all over the place, honestly. It can be like display of extreme violence. Right? So, like I do, I have a series called Defensive Gun Use where I talk about stories where people who conceal, carry, use guns to defend their lives, right? Because one of the narratives on the other side is that not that many people use guns in self-defense when we all know that's absolutely not true. So what I've started doing was aggregating a lot of those stories and talking about them, and in whatever, whatever context or angle I have to talk about whatever aspect. Like for instance, there was a guy at the gas station recently who, who shot the robber, who robbed another guy at gunpoint, right? And so I talk about it from that standpoint in that, you know, with Texas, Texas, you can shoot some, you can, you can defend a third party's property with lethal force under certain contexts, right?

4 (2h 21m 4s):
And so I go and explain those contexts, the point of me doing that. And then in the same video I said, but be careful not only in the defense of third party's property, but also in defending third parties. Make sure if you're gonna do something like that, you understand, you truly understand the context of what's happening because you may think somebody is the aggressor when in reality they're the victim, right? Right. So you, if you're gonna do that, you need to be absolutely positive. Right. You know who the

3 (2h 21m 30s):
Aggressor is. Like you stumble upon someone who's beaten someone's ass. Exactly. That person might have attacked that person. Exactly. And the person might know how to fight. Then they've got the guy on the ground, they're pounding on 'em, and then you shoot

4 (2h 21m 39s):
'em. Shoot 'em. Exactly. And a lot of people don't think about those things. Not because they're stupid, but because they just may be new to carrying a firearm and they don't understand that that could be a context that they find themselves in. Well,

3 (2h 21m 50s):
That's context of arguments too. It's like you can stumble into an argument Yeah. In the middle of someone screaming at someone and you are like, Hey man, fuck you, fuck you. But you don't know what happened before that. You

4 (2h 21m 59s):
Don't. Yeah. And so, but, but for us being able to have those type of conversations in a safe place like online beforehand. Now when somebody who watches a video like that, they can look, they can watch the video, and then they go out and they go, oh, I remember when so and so did a video on this. Okay. Maybe before they may have jumped a gun, had they not watched that video. But watching the video, they took an extra step to say, okay. And assess the situation for what it is. And didn't realize, oh, I read that wrong. Mm. Or I had another, I had a, a follower of mine. He actually, he, I had him on my, I had him on my podcast, my virtual podcast that I do for the gun side of things. And he told me I saved his life. My video saved his life.

4 (2h 22m 39s):
And he said, the reason why my video saved his life is because he, for the longest time, he didn't carry with a round in the chamber. And a lot of people, I know, don't carry round in the chamber. A lot of my friends don't carry with a round in the chamber. and I started off carrying a gun without carrying a round in the chamber because I felt unsafe doing it. and I understand that dynamic because it's, it's a, it's a, it's a loaded gun that you're putting in your, like God forbid you carry appendix like I do, it's pointing at your dick. It's pointing at your dick. Right. But I, and I, I, I expressed that look, if you're not gonna carry it around the chamber, the at least understand the limitations that come with it, because there's some limitations that come with it. You're not gonna be able to get your gun as fast if a situation happens quickly.

4 (2h 23m 22s):
So you need to understand it so that, what does that mean? That means that when you're out and about, you need to be more situationally aware, probably a little bit more so than say someone like me. 'cause I can get to my gun in under a second. It might take you two or three. So it's talking through those type of dynamics. And so after he watched the video, he, he, he kind of did a, an experiment that I said, I said, carry without a round in the chamber for a period of time, and then see how often that gun is accidentally engaged. And you'll start to realize that as long as you have a couple of things, you'll be fine. A good holster and a good belt. If you carry in that manner, you like to carry in your fanny pack, that's a different story. But, but like for instance, like not always. Yeah. Okay. Exactly. Yeah. So, so like, and, and then with how dynamic life is, right?

4 (2h 24m 6s):
There's so many different ways to carry, right. But not a lot of, lot of people know how to do this. So for instance, like I'm in, I'm in sweats a lot of the time, right? So I, I've over the, my experiences, because I have access to so many different guns and so many different holsters, I'm able to experiment. So I'm like, okay, I'm in sweats a lot, I'm in joggers a lot. What can I do to carry a firearm in a relatively secure way safely and not have to worry about it flopping around, for instance. Right? So like for instance, like these joggers I'm wearing now from neighborhood tactical. Right?

3 (2h 24m 35s):
That's what I was gonna bring up. Yeah. That company, that

4 (2h 24m 38s):
Company, yeah. They make, they make joggers specifically for concealed carry. Yes.

3 (2h 24m 41s):
I have some of those.

4 (2h 24m 42s):
Exactly. I know and I love 'em. Like, I'm trying, I'm trying not to do shit now. And you wouldn't know about that otherwise. I know people who carry in sweats and they just stick the gun in there. Right. And they don't know any better. Right? Right. So it's that type of information that our videos are providing, but at the same time, how

3 (2h 25m 1s):
Did it save that dude's

4 (2h 25m 2s):
Life? Oh, gotcha. So as far as saving his life, what he said was after he watched the video, he started carrying with the round in chamber and I, I can't remember if he said a couple weeks ago, a couple weeks later, he's a jeweler. And so as a jeweler he was, he was, he was selling some jewelry to someone. And then it was actually a setup. And there were guys were coming, they were trying to rob him. So the guys came to rob him. And because he had a round in the chamber, and the other guy did it when he was getting ready to pull out, when he was pulling out his gun, his gun was already pulled. And he had a round in the chamber. So he was able to shoot the guy, neutralize him and get gone. Wow. Yeah. And so I did I mean I had him on my, he does a better job of explaining

3 (2h 25m 39s):
A split second difference.

4 (2h 25m 41s):
I mean.

3 (2h 25m 41s):
Exactly. And boom.

4 (2h 25m 42s):
Exactly. Yeah. It's, it's, and and fractions of a second is what matters in self defense. S

3 (2h 25m 46s):
If you're a jeweler. Jesus Christ. Yep. Yeah.

4 (2h 25m 48s):
Yeah. And so, you know, he was like, your video saved my life. Now I'm not gonna take the credit for that I mean, I just, all you did, you made the decision yourself that you felt comfortable with and that's what you did. But the information he had to get to that point is what was important.

3 (2h 26m 3s):
What do you know about the reality of accidental discharge with a P three 20?

4 (2h 26m 12s):
So here's, here's my understanding of the P three 20, because I've heard different things. Right? Me too. Because

3 (2h 26m 20s):
There's so many stories on,

4 (2h 26m 21s):
On there are, because I, because I carry a sig is in one is in the lineup of my carry rotation of guns. Right. So I clearly Which one? The P 365.

3 (2h 26m 31s):
Okay. The smaller one. No,

4 (2h 26m 32s):
Actually the P three. Yeah, the P 360 macro. Or the macro? The macro. The one with

3 (2h 26m 35s):
The larger handle, the more rounds. Yes.

4 (2h 26m 37s):
So I carry, I still carry that one. It's a great gun. Yeah. Love it.

3 (2h 26m 41s):
It's so small. It's so

4 (2h 26m 43s):
Perfect. It's so small, but it big. Yeah. Yeah. Right. It's like, yeah.

3 (2h 26m 45s):
It's a nine millimeter and it has all those rounds. Yep.

4 (2h 26m 48s):
Yeah. And I'm big on capacity. Yes. That's, that's me. I'm a capacity whore. You

3 (2h 26m 52s):
Carry it with a dot.

4 (2h 26m 54s):
Yeah. That one. No, all

3 (2h 26m 56s):
My other so slim. Yeah.

4 (2h 26m 57s):
'cause I carry that. I carry that one. I carry the Springfield Hill Cap Pro that has a red dot on it. And then Of course similar size. Yeah. And then I carry the cs.

3 (2h 27m 5s):
The 365 is literally smaller than my hand.

4 (2h 27m 7s):
Yeah. But yet has 17 rounds. Yeah. It's crazy.

3 (2h 27m 10s):
It's crazy. It's crazy. When I put it in my hand, it's smaller than my hand. Yeah.

4 (2h 27m 14s):
It's nuts. So that, I call that my flight gun. I have guns for everything. So I have my, like my, my my BTech case that I have for flying, you know, when you fly with a gun, you have to have it in a TSA approved case. So that stays in that box. It stays in it. So anytime I travel, 'cause I travel a lot, I already have it there. It's already set up where I need to go throw it in my suitcase and I'm good to go. So that's where I keep, that's the macro is designated for that gun. And then my go-tos are the CS from CCA or the Springfield Hill Cap Pro.

3 (2h 27m 47s):
But the, the three 20, does it have the same firing pin set up as a 365?

4 (2h 27m 53s):
I don't think so. Right. I'm only positive it doesn't. So the now they changed it too. They changed, they changed it on the three twenties after whatever those incidents that they said happened. Happened

3 (2h 28m 2s):
How recently?

4 (2h 28m 3s):
It was some time ago. Actually. It was some time ago. Now I hear, I hear different stories because for every story you hear about the gun going off, there's another story about the person who's claiming it went off, actually caused it to go off because they did something inappropriate. Like when they were holstering it, they had a floppy holster and it got into the trigger guard and it touched the trigger and it went off. Right. Right. There is one story I hear, or there is a story of it dropping, landing a specific way and then gun going off. And that's when I think now, when that first happened, I think that's when they made the change to the three twenties.

3 (2h 28m 40s):
One of America's favorite handguns is allegedly firing on its owners. Sig Sauers P three 20 pistol is wounded more than 80 people.

4 (2h 28m 47s):
Again. Again.

3 (2h 28m 48s):
So they didn't pull the trigger.

4 (2h 28m 49s):
But who are those people?

3 (2h 28m 50s):
Right? Well, one of 'em, I watched, there's a video I remember of a cop. Yeah. The cop is in the precinct and he's bending over and it goes off.

4 (2h 28m 58s):
So I, I read into that, please. and I think, and I remember reading and I can't get it confirmed, but I remember reading something to the effect of he had, 'cause one of the things with, with carrying a firearm, when you're coming in and out of a holster, you need to make sure there's nothing impeding the entry of that gun into the holster. Because what can happen is your shirt can get caught in the trigger. Right. And when you're putting it in your, when you're putting it in a holster, it creates enough pressure to have the gun go off. It can happen just like that. That's why anytime I go to Reh holster, I remove my shirt all the way, and I pull it out, I pull my holster out and I make, I watch every second of that gun going into the holster. I'm never in a rush to put my gun in the holster. There's no point. Right. Because if you're putting the gun up, that means there's no more threat.

4 (2h 29m 38s):
Right. So I'm, I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm making sure everything is clear. Sometimes I'll go so far as to take the holster out, put the gun in, then put the holster back on because I'm not, 'cause Right. Like I said, I'm, I'm not,

3 (2h 29m 51s):
This one went off in the holster. It was a duty holster, so it was outside. And so it didn't shoot him, it shot the ground next to

4 (2h 29m 57s):
Him. The ground. Right. But you could still, I'm not saying this is what happened, but you could still have fabric that gets caught in the outside waistband holster as well.

3 (2h 30m 4s):
But it didn't seem like that was the case.

4 (2h 30m 7s):
Say again? I only read, I read into a little bit and that was a theory that somebody had posed or someone saying that that's what happened. I couldn't confirm whether or not that's true or not. Hmm. Yeah. But don don't, there's

3 (2h 30m 18s):
Also guys do things to triggers. Huh? They put different triggers on it. They,

4 (2h 30m 23s):
You can

3 (2h 30m 24s):
Do that things up. If

4 (2h 30m 25s):
You modify your trigger, you can definitely modify it so too far where you can cause the gun, not necessarily to go off on its own,

3 (2h 30m 31s):
But some guys like very light triggers.

4 (2h 30m 33s):
Yeah. But that would just cause a gun to be accidentally automatic, full automatic. Right. Right. Yeah. And that, that's very illegal. So Yeah. So from that perspective, but it, I don't, I don't see, but for something getting caught in that trigger guard, this is just me being a gun guy. Right. And understanding holsters and how they function. So there's a couple of things that can take place here. Either that holster is not the right holster for that gun because the holsters are specific to the gun. Right. Generally speaking. Or some piece of material clothing got caught in there that he wasn't aware of. I just, my mind doesn't know how I can justify or explain how the gun just goes off.

3 (2h 31m 12s):
It was also a physical movement that the guy did. Like, he bent forward.

4 (2h 31m 16s):
Okay. Yeah. I remember, I remember seeing that video when he bent forward. and it, that's what makes me think. There may have been a piece of material in the actual holster

3 (2h 31m 23s):
Or a janky holster or something. Possibly something funky. I'm,

4 (2h 31m 27s):
I'm, I remember 'cause I remember raking my brain and I'm like, how could that, what could cause it just to go off on its own? Right. Because it's not even like the movement he engaged in was like aggressive enough to cause the gun to just jolt and go. Like for instance, like if it dropped. Right. Like I just can't see how that could be the case. Right. In all of my years of carrying firearms and I'm pushing 15, 15 years now. I just don don't see it. I don't, but it's so crazy dropping it. If it's dropped, then I can see that.

3 (2h 31m 59s):
But what's crazy is it's one gun.

4 (2h 32m 3s):
That's a good point. Now that gun is also used in a lot of police departments.

3 (2h 32m 7s):
Right. But you don't hear about it from Glocks.

4 (2h 32m 10s):
No.

3 (2h 32m 11s):
Right. It's weird.

4 (2h 32m 11s):
That's true. That's very true.

3 (2h 32m 13s):
Yeah. Yeah. It's weird. It's what?

4 (2h 32m 15s):
Well, well, well

3 (2h 32m 16s):
I've never heard of it.

4 (2h 32m 19s):
I have

3 (2h 32m 20s):
Accidental discharge without touching the trigger.

4 (2h 32m 22s):
Yeah.

3 (2h 32m 23s):
Was anybody doing anything weird with the gun? 'cause it Glock has a two stage too.

4 (2h 32m 27s):
Yeah. And so it's, so it's a P three 20. Right. So the weird thing about accidental discharges, they're not accidental, they're negligent. Because generally speaking, 'cause I've heard guns, I've heard, I've heard cops say the gun just went off. No, you pulled the trigger. You didn't realize you pulled the trigger, but you did. Oh,

3 (2h 32m 48s):
You mean in a fight or flight situation?

4 (2h 32m 50s):
Even just normally, because you gotta think about it. If you take, I've done this test before and men and women, it doesn't matter. You give a gun to somebody who's never actually handled a gun, what's the first thing they do if I just handle a gun? The trigger. Exactly. Yeah. It's a very natural instinctive thing to do. Yeah. It's not, it's very unnatural to keep your finger trigger finger off of the gun. Right. Your brain's not wired to do that. It's like, this is the thing that makes a gun go put your finger there. Yes. And so a lot of, I'm not gonna say I hesitate to say this because I don't have hard data, I just have anecdotal data. But a lot of cops aren't necessarily gun people. A lot of them never shoot their guns outside of the qualification.

4 (2h 33m 33s):
So outside of that, I can see situations where a lot of cops think the gun went off on their own, but they just have bad manipulation skills of a firearm because they haven't ingrained it into their self. You give me a toy gun immediately, my index finger's going on the side. It's not touching that trigger. You gimme a staple gun because I've ingrained it, it's something I've ingrained because I handle firearms so often. Yeah. And a lot of cops don't handle firearms as much as people give them credit for. Right. Yeah. 'cause they're not all gun guys.

3 (2h 34m 3s):
That's the scary thing. Right? Yeah. If guys are on the job and they don't train. Yeah.

4 (2h 34m 9s):
I've, I've heard, I've, I've known cops that don't like guns, they only carry it because they have to for their job. How crazy. Right. But then the person, like the person who taught me initially how to shoot, he was a cop, but he's a gun guy. Right. You get what I'm saying? Yeah. So big difference. Yeah. If, if if he told me the gun went off, I'd believe him. Right. Right. But I have a hard time believing. And like, to answer your question with Glocks Yeah. I've had, I've heard cops say, oh, the gun just went off. And I was like, no, it didn't. You put your finger on the trigger. You didn't realize

3 (2h 34m 39s):
It. But there's way less and there's also, there's not like P two 20 sixes that

4 (2h 34m 44s):
Happen. Yeah. It's very specific to the two, three twenties, which I agree with you. Yeah. I, I have two or three of 'em. P three 20. I have one. Yeah. Have one

3 (2h 34m 55s):
That I got from Dave Mods. It's nice. Yeah. I love it. But every time I touch I'm like,

4 (2h 35m 1s):
No, I've never, I've never, I've, I have four actually I have about four of them and I've never had issues. But I'll be honest and say that's not saying, that's not saying a lot because don don't shoot them often. Right. So me saying I haven't had issues doesn't really give much credence to anything. But I I am more inclined, like you make, you bring up an excellent point that it's so specific to a specific model and

3 (2h 35m 26s):
Of, and they did a change.

4 (2h 35m 27s):
Yes. From

3 (2h 35m 29s):
That's also very specific

4 (2h 35m 30s):
From a drop standpoint.

3 (2h 35m 32s):
Right. But there was something going on with the way it coxed with Cox.

4 (2h 35m 36s):
Yeah. I'm trying to remember what, what it was. I

3 (2h 35m 40s):
Complain it, has it caused accidental fatalities?

4 (2h 35m 43s):
Not that I'm aware of. Not that I'm aware of. But I'm trying to think.

3 (2h 35m 52s):
Most people that I talk to, I should say this. For sig stake for sig stake for the sake of the company, most people that I've talked to are very skeptical. That are actual

4 (2h 36m 1s):
Gun people. That's I mean. You can, you can hear it in my voice.

3 (2h 36m 3s):
Yeah. And then everybody I talk to, yeah. Jack Carr, all those people that are fans of SIGs,

4 (2h 36m 8s):
You do make, 'cause I'm a massive fan of sig.

3 (2h 36m 11s):
They make great

4 (2h 36m 11s):
Guns. You, you bring, you bring a great point though, the fact that it's exclusive to that to one model. Yeah. It's, it's interesting that said, I don't know. I'm still skeptical enough that I would still, I'd still carry it through 20.

3 (2h 36m 26s):
Right. but it, and it's also a thing where it's like, if it really was happening, how was it only 80 people? Right. How many three twenties are out there in active duty just with cops. Yeah. How many three twenties do people have for home defense? That's

4 (2h 36m 40s):
What makes me think how many

3 (2h 36m 40s):
People carry three 20. It's a common gun to carry.

4 (2h 36m 44s):
But that's what makes me think. And and if you, if I promise you, if you look into those numbers, the vast majority of those 80 are cops. I'm almost positive the vast majority of 'em are gonna be cops.

3 (2h 36m 56s):
Well, and I and I look at it the same way. The way you look at guns, the same way I look at martial arts with cops. There is nothing that drives me more fucking crazy than cops that don't know how to defend themselves and have zero knowledge of grappling and get into exchange with someone. And then they're on their back and they don't know what to do. Like how did you sign up for this without a rudimentary understanding? At least of grappling. You don't know what the fuck to do, how you're engaging with someone physically and You don't know how to control them. You hoping they listen. I,

4 (2h 37m 25s):
If I was a cop, I'd be in it like my friend at Tommy how to shoot, he's, he's a fighter. He fights. Yeah. I mean, that's

3 (2h 37m 32s):
Gotta be part of the job, man. You know, that's one of the things that Andrew Yang proposed. You know, he was talking when he was running for president, he was like, I think that all cops should be at least purple belt level of jiujitsu. I'm like, preach. Yeah, preach.

4 (2h 37m 45s):
But realistically,

3 (2h 37m 48s):
Right.

4 (2h 37m 49s):
Purple belt's

3 (2h 37m 50s):
A long fucking road. That's

4 (2h 37m 51s):
Road jack. Long road. That's

3 (2h 37m 53s):
A long road,

4 (2h 37m 53s):
Jack. Yeah. And we can barely get enough cops now as it is

3 (2h 37m 56s):
Just to not be fat. Right. Yeah. How many cops do you see are just morbidly at beast? Which

4 (2h 38m 1s):
I think think is insanity.

3 (2h 38m 2s):
It's insanity. Yeah. Like literally part of your tools Yeah. For your job is for you to be able to use your body to defend yourself and others and to be able to detain someone. Yeah. And you can't do it

4 (2h 38m 15s):
Couldn't be me. I would be in the, I'm just, just because I'm like, like at any moment you could be getting shot at bro.

3 (2h 38m 21s):
Yes. At

4 (2h 38m 21s):
Any moment. At any moment.

3 (2h 38m 22s):
Or someone will trying

4 (2h 38m 23s):
Your

3 (2h 38m 24s):
Gun from you or you're gonna to Yeah. You know, I mean if your gun is in your holster and your hands are on me and you don't know how to fight, you're never getting to that gun. You're not gonna get to that gun. How are you gonna get to that gun? You do it. You don't have a chance in hell. Nope. I'm gonna over hook that right arm. And that's a wrap. It's a wrap. That's a wrap. Now you're helpless.

4 (2h 38m 46s):
And I learned that the first day I started doing, especially

3 (2h 38m 49s):
If you're wearing lows, you're wearing clothes and someone has a good over hook and they fucking cinch that bitch down. That's a wrap. You ain't going nowhere. You're going nowhere. And then you get tripped and now you're on your back and then some guy rotates so he can grab your gun. You can't even grab it.

4 (2h 39m 5s):
Yeah. You better have a retention level 10 on that

3 (2h 39m 8s):
Motherfucker and you better. Yeah. Yeah. That's an interesting thing. Right? Yeah. The retention holsters where people have holsters that are, there's a very specific

4 (2h 39m 17s):
Way to get it out.

3 (2h 39m 17s):
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. That scares me in a high pressure situation.

4 (2h 39m 21s):
Yeah. I mean, it's, it's one of the things you can train too, because the same thing can be said about 19 elevens. 'cause they have a safety. Right? Like,

3 (2h 39m 28s):
But doesn't your thumb always go on there? Yes.

4 (2h 39m 30s):
That's the thing about 1911. So safety's, safety's on like polymer style guns aren't necessarily the same as the ones you have to click it. Yeah. Yeah. Because they're a lot smaller. They're not very intuitive and you ah,

3 (2h 39m 40s):
Click. Yeah.

4 (2h 39m 41s):
But the, with the 1911 drone speaking, if I were to draw the gun right now, your thumbs on I'm naturally, it's just already on it. It's on it. So it's gonna drop. Yeah.

3 (2h 39m 46s):
Yeah. It's on it.

4 (2h 39m 47s):
Whereas with polymer guns, you're kind of fishing for it. Like, where's this thing? Oh, there it goes. Yeah. Right, right. But yeah, it's, it's, man, I, I'm trying to think. 'cause I remember I had a Beretta I was doing a, a shooting course training house. And one of the scenarios was I was supposed to clear this house and it gave me a Beretta and it had a safety on it. and I remember, remember going to clearing the house and then it was a, it was a a, a blue gun. It functioned like a gun, but it didn't shoot bullets. And a guy popped around the corner, I was like, oh, sh pulled the gun. The gun wouldn't go off. Mm. I forgot to take safety off. Ooh. Yeah.

4 (2h 40m 27s):
So, well, that's what training's for. Exactly. So same thing with the retention holster, right? It's like you want to train,

3 (2h 40m 33s):
How does a retention holster work?

4 (2h 40m 34s):
Exactly. So there, so there are different levels, right? So there's like 1, 2, 3, 4 level four level one, level two, level three, level four. Right? So like the, the, the lowest amount is just you have a gun in a holster. Right? And then you literally turn it upside down, it'll fall out. Then you have the kind of like the cox holsters where you put it in. You hear that click that kind of like click. So all you need is just a good tug and it comes out. Then you have other ones where when you come down on the holster, there's a button because there's like a little, there's like a little like, like a little thing that goes over the back end of the gun. So even if you pull it out, it's not coming out right. And so when you come down on the holster, you push the button and it flips out of the way so that you can pull the gun out. And then I think there's another level that's even more than that.

4 (2h 41m 16s):
It's like there's a, there's that, there's like the little ring on it and there's like a hood and you gotta remove that. and it, they're, they're designed where if you, if the gun's on you, it's one motion. But if it's a gun that's not on you, you're g like, you're gonna be in such an angle. You're not, you're gonna have a hard time getting to that button, to that thing to be able to get the gun out. Right. And so, and like I said, they start at like level one all the way up to like level four. Then anybody can get 'em, you can go to a store and get 'em. Right. But, and so like if I carried open, like if I open carried, I don't open carry generally, I don't actually really open carry at all. I use, the only time I've ever open carried is like when I'm like out like in like the country or something like that.

4 (2h 41m 59s):
Or like rural, like some rural environment. But generally speaking, if I were to open carry, I would have a, at least like a level three, level four retention holster. Because I've seen too many videos. I've done too many videos on people who are like in the gas station and they're open carrying and then somebody comes up behind him, grabs a gun and runs.

3 (2h 42m 21s):
Oh yeah.

4 (2h 42m 21s):
You know what I'm saying? I saw

3 (2h 42m 22s):
A guy at a convenience store in a video. A guy had it in his lower back. Yeah. A guy snatched his gun just ran out the door.

4 (2h 42m 28s):
Yep. Yep. And that, that you

3 (2h 42m 30s):
Can't even chase him. Can't

4 (2h 42m 31s):
Shit. Whatcha gonna do whatcha need to do, gimme back my gun.

3 (2h 42m 34s):
Yeah. Unless you got one in your ankle

4 (2h 42m 35s):
Too. Exactly. Yeah. And you know, and it, it's one of those things and it's, that's a hotly contested debate in the gun space. Should you or should you not open carry? What are the benefits and what are the drawbacks? Because there are some, the one mindset says if you open carry, you're gonna be the first target for a criminal. But then another person comes up and says, if you open carry, you're gonna be the last target. Because criminals are like, I wanna, I want a weak target. I don't want somebody who already has a gun. I see he has a gun. I'm gonna find somebody else to run.

3 (2h 43m 3s):
Especially if they have situational burn.

4 (2h 43m 5s):
Exactly. And that, that, that is, and it's so easy to say, because situational awareness can get you out of a lot of shit where you never even have to go to your gun. Yeah. It really can. Like, you know, like I had a situation where I was followed or dudes were trying to rob me.

3 (2h 43m 22s):
Well, you told me about that. Yeah.

4 (2h 43m 24s):
And I only, I really believe, if not for my sational awareness, I call it paranoia

3 (2h 43m 30s):
Sometimes. Paranoia

4 (2h 43m 31s):
Help. Oh, I don't, I don't, I do not discount my paranoia. I accept it full. I accept it full because when I'm right. It's my best friend. Well

3 (2h 43m 39s):
It's also crime is reality. Yeah. And the idea that you won't come across crime because you're a good person. Yep. That's nuts. You zig when you sit z. Exactly. You you're around the wrong people.

4 (2h 43m 48s):
Yeah. Because if I didn't pick them up, they, they would've caught me slipping. Mm. Because I would've been Yeah. Would've been a rap and it wouldn't been nothing I can do about it. and I could have, I could have 15 guns on me. It wouldn't have mattered. Right. Wouldn't have mattered at all. The thing that sucks though, is in the moment for someone like me and just goes to show you, and this is pretty pervasive in all the guys in the gun community, in that moment when they were chasing me the whole time, I'm thinking through not only I want to get outta this situation alive, I'm literally thinking what are the legal ramifications for every action I might engage in? Right. Right, right. And so, because I know the standard of responsibility for me is exceedingly higher.

4 (2h 44m 32s):
Right. Because one, I'm a known gun gun guy, but purely just me having a concealed carry. Right. My burden of responsibility is 10 times higher. Even that of the criminal. Right. Because you're should have known you're a concealed carrier. Right. Right. So there's so many things that like when you, when you are a concealed carrier, someone who just carries a gun from you are already behind an eight ball. All a criminal has to do is wake up and decide, I'm gonna go engage in some criminal shit. I'm gonna find somebody, I'm gonna attack 'em. They know exactly what they're gonna do. They know exactly what they're gonna bring. I'm just living my life. and I have to react to this. So not only do I have to react to the fact that somebody may try to rob me, I have to react to, I have to be thinking about what did, at what point can I, will I be justified in even using my firearm to protect myself?

4 (2h 45m 18s):
Right. Because in that, at that time when I was in the car and they were following me, chasing me in the car, yeah. Technically they were chasing me, but I couldn't stick my gun out the window and start shooting. Right. Because they hadn't technically broke a law yet. They hadn't done anything to warrant to justify me shooting. They could have just been chasing me just to have fun. Right. I don't know. And so I have to think about those things as a legal responsible gun owner. Criminals don't. Right. So it always pisses me off that these politicians make laws that make it even harder for legal gun owners to exercise that. Right. Like, these laws don't do anything but make it harder for us because we obey laws. Like what

3 (2h 45m 57s):
Laws specifically? Like

4 (2h 45m 58s):
Just even the process of acquiring a firearm. Like why are you First of all like in California, why would you limit my round count to 10 rounds? Yeah. Like you're making it harder for me if I'm being chase in the ve I don't know how many people are in that car. Generally speaking, when people, when criminals are engaging in, in, in criminal activity, it's not by themselves. Right. There's multiple, I'm largely gonna be by myself dealing with multiple people.

3 (2h 46m 18s):
Yeah. What is the logic to limiting round capacities?

4 (2h 46m 21s):
It's purely, purely based on mass shootings. They figure the less rounds you have in a gun, the less people die. That's what they think. Because they see every, because every mass shooter that they see, they say, oh, they had this 30 round magazine, which is a standard capacity for a lot of these guns. It's because they had so many bullets that they were able to kill so many people. That's not true. Generally speaking, when you have a high body count in a mass shooting, it is the contents context in a context. Context in the circumstance of the shooting that caused it.

3 (2h 46m 48s):
Well wasn't the Virginia Tech one of the most horrific mass shootings? Yes. And the guy had 36

4 (2h 46m 55s):
People he killed 36 people with pistols. With pistols. Right. And then they'll go on and say, he

3 (2h 46m 59s):
Just kept reloading. Yeah. That's

4 (2h 47m 0s):
All he did. But, and the thing is, what made him so deadly with people don't talk about is he chained the doors. He chained them. So he had free reign of that school for who knows how long. And so all those people can do is hide in corners and he literally walked in classrooms just start picking people off. Where were they gonna go? Right. Right. He's the only one with guns. He just starts shooting people one by one. One by one. And the cops who were outside trying to get in, they can't get in the building 'cause he chain locked the door. So it wasn't the fact that he had a 30 round magazine in his gun. It was the fact that he chained the door and nobody can get in to stop him. Right. Right. And so, and then those were with handguns. Yeah. But they talk about, oh, it's the, these deadly assault rifles and so forth and so on.

3 (2h 47m 43s):
Did you see those ladies on the view talk about ar like hunting a deer with an ar There's not gonna be anything left of it.

4 (2h 47m 50s):
Some people shouldn't just be part of

3 (2h 47m 51s):
The conversation. But imagine having that conversation and being that ignorant openly and not even understanding that that 2, 2 6 is not even, it's

4 (2h 47m 60s):
Not, it's that you, you could barely hunt ethically a deer with a 2, 2, 3 round. Yeah. It's,

3 (2h 48m 5s):
It's 2, 2, 3 or five. 5, 6, 6. Yeah. Yeah. It's, they're not big rounds. They're

4 (2h 48m 9s):
Not at all. They're actually really small. Yeah. That's the crazy thing. That's crazy. They're actually really small.

3 (2h 48m 14s):
Like somehow or another they think you're shooting a cannon. No, it's so dumb.

4 (2h 48m 18s):
But it's, it's, it's ignorance. Right. and I wouldn't have a problem with it if they were open to having a conversation. Honestly.

3 (2h 48m 25s):
Well, they're just, they're they're pushing a narrative that is based entirely on ignorance. Yeah.

4 (2h 48m 30s):
And I. and I. But that's, that's, that's mainstream media for you.

3 (2h 48m 34s):
Yeah.

4 (2h 48m 35s):
I've been dealing with it for 10, 10 plus years that when it comes to the conversation about firearms in this country, that is the mainstream media narrative. and it doesn't change.

3 (2h 48m 44s):
And it's also the idea that you wouldn't hunt with one listen hunting with one, especially in a 3 0 8, an AR and a 3 0 8. It's a good ethical move because you need a follow up shot sometimes. And you don't have to go, you don't have to reload it. Exactly. Like there's a lot of people in the hunting space that don't like semi-automatic weapons for hunting. But I'm like, why?

4 (2h 49m 5s):
It's the dumbest thing to me. It's,

3 (2h 49m 7s):
If you wanna, if you wanna shoot an animal ethically, having the ability for a follow up shot instantaneously is a benefit to ethics.

4 (2h 49m 16s):
I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that they grew up with those hunting guns and are not comfortable with the semi-automatics. 'cause they don't really know about 'em very much. Yes. Yeah. And so they're like, nobody needs that like this.

3 (2h 49m 26s):
Well this is the two groups, right? The fuds Fuds. Yeah. Yeah. Which Elmer Fud. Fud Yeah. The hunters and then people who are gun fanatics.

4 (2h 49m 32s):
Exactly. Yeah. And you know, it's like I said, I I wouldn't have a problem with the ignorance if they were willing to have the conversation. Right. At least be open to say having someone like me or somebody else from the space to come on. But usually when they have the conversations, they're just,

3 (2h 49m 46s):
They to yell at you and talk over you. They're

4 (2h 49m 48s):
Just chicken boxing amongst each other. Yeah. And they're not really getting anywhere.

3 (2h 49m 50s):
They don't know what they're talking about. And on top of that, they demonize anybody that has a differing perspective and they, they won't have an actual, won't good faith conversation about it. And if they did, they would find out that they're solely uninformed. Yeah. And they, they're unwilling to accept the narrative that some people do save people's lives with guns, save

4 (2h 50m 7s):
Their own ton of people, A ton people of, to the tune of 1.63 million every year. People use a gun in self-defense. Nobody talks about that. Yeah. Nobody, they talk about the, they talk about the 40,000 people who die every day for die every year from gun violence. But even when you break those numbers down Yeah.

3 (2h 50m 25s):
Reality, it was also the mass shooting numbers are are severely distorted too, because people don't understand most of these mass shootings are gang violence.

4 (2h 50m 32s):
Dude, I did a video where I remember there was a, I forgot the actual shooting. There was a mass shooting, a legit one, a legit mass shooting. It was like a couple weeks ago and it, about three weeks ago. And they were saying, and, and the report was, there have been five mass shootings since 2024. We're only a week into 2000. I think we were only five four days into to 2024. And they was like, there have already been five mass shootings. So I said, that don't sound right. If there were five mass shootings within five days of 2024, I'd know about it.

4 (2h 51m 12s):
So I was like, okay, so it's a scene. It was a scene in article. So I go and I look at the, at the, at the, at the, the hyperlink that they used to quote that stat and it was like gun violence archive or something like that. So I click it and so they list the, the five incidents. So I was like, all right, the problem is they don't expect people to go three, four layers deep into the rabbit hole. Right. They expect that you just see the link there. Oh, that that solidifies it. That I don't even need to look at what the actual incidents were. Right. That they're correct. So I click it and I go to the first incident. It was like a drive by. I go to the second incident, it was a fight at a party, next incident drive by next incident New Year's Eve party LA drive by No, a dispute between two group of people and then turn out.

4 (2h 52m 1s):
and it was a shooting basically street shit. The only one that was actually the mass shooting, like a legit mass shooting was the one that the initial article was about. So basically what they did is they took four of these street violence shootings and then clustered them in and called them mass shootings. Right.

3 (2h 52m 21s):
And by the way, you're never gonna stop street violence until you stop disparage communities. You're never gonna, it's not happening. You're never gonna stop street violence until I mean. I've said this so many times, but I'll say it one more time. Think about the money we've sent to Ukraine. And imagine if they put that money into cleaning up inner cities and making them safer and

4 (2h 52m 41s):
I. Do they, do people really think that motherfucking kids who grow up in these environments really wanna live like that? Exactly. Like they really wanna live their life looking over their shoulder. Exactly. And having, having to worry about who's trying to kill them. What type of, do they really think people wanna live like that? Come

3 (2h 52m 58s):
On. It's a convenient narrative. Like it's a convenient narrative. And it's also like they do nothing to fix those spots. Nothing.

4 (2h 53m 6s):
Nothing. And who are those places run by

3 (2h 53m 10s):
Democrats?

4 (2h 53m 11s):
All of them. and I and I hate. I hate the fact that I even have to say it. It's so true. But the only reason I say it's because when I look at who was pushing the narrative for gun control Yeah. It is always a democrat. Always. Yeah. Which is fine. Okay. If that's, if that's the way the party wants to lean, cool. But what I have a problem with is when the vast majority of gun murders in this country are coming from inner cities that are all ran by Democrats, that's where I have a problem. Because you're pushing legislation and you're pushing policies that do nothing to address the root cause of the issue.

4 (2h 53m 51s):
You're u you're literally using the deplorable conditions in these environments to justify more gun control policies that will do nothing to fix these environments, but give you more control over people

3 (2h 54m 4s):
And put responsible gun owners in danger.

4 (2h 54m 6s):
Exactly. Or turn us into criminals. Right. Because you're making it's convoluted laws. Nobody knows shit. You not many people call and ask me, I'm going to this, I'm going to this state, I'm gonna California, can I carry this? Can I bring this? Can I do? It's so convoluted and all over the place. Nobody knows how to not break the laws when it comes to guns. So it begs the question, are you trying to create criminals? Right. Because that's what it seems like. 'cause you're clearly not trying to stop any of it because you have an entire environment over here that has the same consistent problem. It's not like the inner city in like Chicago is so different from like the inner city in like Louisiana. Right.

4 (2h 54m 46s):
It's the same shit. The same problems. So if we understand that and they're happening in these very specific areas, why the fuck are we still talking about gun control? Why there are so many people in, out in the, there are so many people who have more guns than food who live in other places in this country. And there Aren, they don't have this gun violence problem. They don't, when's the last time you saw a black dude who lived in the suburbs doing drive-bys in A BMW. Right. You don't see it. Right. So we does that tells you that's a totally different issue here that's going on and you're not willing to address it. And if you're not gonna address the real issue, shut the fuck up about guns 'cause you don't care.

4 (2h 55m 30s):
And you have a totally different motivation for why you're pushing it. and it has nothing to do with actually saving lives.

3 (2h 55m 35s):
Right. It has to do with a narrative that your ideology accepts openly, which is that guns are the problem.

4 (2h 55m 41s):
Yep. And that's

3 (2h 55m 42s):
It. And it's a, it's a juve it's a a childish perspective.

4 (2h 55m 46s):
Exceedingly childish. Yeah. and it, and it, and it's not only, it's not only childish, it's getting people killed. Because at the end of the day, that violence has to go somewhere. It has to, you can only rob the people in the environment that you're in for so long before you have to start spreading out. So now what's ending up happening is you have people who are now forced to confront this type of violence without any means to protect themselves. So your policies are actually hurting people and causing more lives to be taken. So as far as I'm concerned, anything they have to say about the issue until they're willing to talk about the root cause of the issue is bullshit.

3 (2h 56m 25s):
You couldn't have said better. It's, it's as good as anyone can say it. I think it's a good way to wrap this up. Yeah. 'cause I think that, that, that narrative is not being discussed openly and I. Think it's logical and I think you're dead. Right. and I think the root cause of it is these crime infested gang infested neighborhoods where people don't have hope and no.

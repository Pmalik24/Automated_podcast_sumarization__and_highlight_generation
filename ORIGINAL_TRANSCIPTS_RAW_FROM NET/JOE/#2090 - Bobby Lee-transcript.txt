Oh yeah. It's

4 (1m 58s):
Like they have a real production staff. Yeah. There's all these people running around with clipboards and it's like,

1 (2m 4s):
I went to Burt's house the other day. He had eight people behind computers. Yeah. Just typing a i what the fuck they're doing? Emailing what?

4 (2m 19s):
It. I don't want it.

1 (2m 19s):
You have white guy? Yeah. Just some average white guy. Not no offense, but you're not, you know, with

4 (2m 25s):
All due respect, Jamie does take the place of like, at least two regular people, if not three. Yeah.

1 (2m 31s):
He's great. Dude.

4 (2m 32s):
How many people don don't know? You tell me. I say at least two, maybe three. It might, Jamie might take the place of three people.

1 (2m 40s):
Wow. What

4 (2m 41s):
You got there? What are those? These

1 (2m 43s):
Are pouches. They're coco hagans. Oh, okay.

Tobacco. It's, yeah. This, it's the pouch.

4 (2m 52s):
Those are tobacco. Yeah. They're tobacco.

1 (2m 53s):
Yeah. Spit. Yeah. Okay. And, and it, when I get blisters, I stop.

4 (2m 57s):
Okay. but it birds through your cheek. I money. Mine was telling me that. No. Yeah, yeah. It made his gums recede. Yeah. Chewing.

1 (3m 5s):
Yeah. But then when you take a break, they grow back. It's like, oh, nice. It's like a plant. Your

4 (3m 9s):
Gums. Oh, like a little plant. Yeah. Yeah. You're trimming it. Yeah. Trim.

1 (3m 12s):
Yeah, yeah,

4 (3m 12s):
Yeah. Like a bonsai. So when it,

1 (3m 13s):
Yeah, like a

4 (3m 14s):
Bonsai. So then you get better gums that way. Yeah.

1 (3m 15s):
But I quit smoking two years ago, so it's like, you know, that was tough. Was

4 (3m 20s):
It cigarettes? Yeah.

1 (3m 21s):
Well, I did, I quit drugs and cigarettes.

4 (3m 24s):
Well, you went clean. You were clean for a long time.

1 (3m 27s):
17 years.

4 (3m 27s):
And then what was the first thing you did?

1 (3m 31s):
Well, I relapsed twice. So after the 17 years my dad died. and I, you know, he, you know, I, he died and then my mom goes selfie. So I took a selfie with my mom and the family. And my dad was dead. Yeah. and I decided, that was so weird that I took a gummy. I brought one just in case.

4 (3m 49s):
How many milligrams?

1 (3m 50s):
At that time? It was like 10 milligrams. Okay. But then I had other stuff in my mom's house. Oh. You know what I mean? and I took the rest. And then I went, I, I relapsed for like four months, then I got sober again. And then when things got crazy in my life, I did it again.

4 (4m 8s):
What did you go with again? Did you go with just weed?

1 (4m 11s):
Weed and drinking? Mm. And it's fine at first. Like, I remember like taking edible, going to Hawaii. 'cause I was shooting Magnum Pi or something. And it's fun for like a couple of months, but then I just, I overdo it and then it's like 24 hours a day and I'm drinking 24 hours a day. And then like, people are like Andrew, you know, Santina was concerned. Like one time he knocked on my hotel room and I walked out and I had poo all over my body. Whoa. Yeah. and I was in a blackout drunk. And he goes, you had poo all over your body.

4 (4m 41s):
That's a good friend. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Did he clean you up? Yeah, he cleaned

1 (4m 44s):
Me up. You know what I mean? Aw, yeah. He

4 (4m 45s):
Is like I. don Andrew's the best. He's the

1 (4m 46s):
Best. He, well, he was mad. You know how he gets mad? Of

4 (4m 49s):
Course shit fucking

1 (4m 51s):
Bastard. You know what I mean? Yeah,

4 (4m 52s):
Yeah, yeah. You're covered in shit. He didn't abandon you. Like I would've.

1 (4m 55s):
I don't think you would've.

4 (4m 56s):
I probably wouldn't.

1 (4m 57s):
You would've cleaned it, but you would've said clean up and then 10 minutes I'll see you. I

4 (4m 60s):
Would've chucked you into the tub.

1 (5m 2s):
Yeah. Like a cold plunge. Yeah. Just

4 (5m 4s):
Hose you down. So it got bad.

1 (5m 6s):
And then what happened was Bob Sackett died. Mm. And then Louis died.

4 (5m 13s):
Mm.

1 (5m 14s):
And for some reason I was drinking and doing, and also when I was, I was coughing up blood. Oh. I had these chunks. Chunks of curdled blood. Oh, right. Like a ball. and I and I had convinced myself that I had fucking cancer. Oh. and I. and I always, I go, death comes in free. Not that I'm that big like those guys, but in my mind it's like I'm next. Oh shit. and I couldn't sleep. I couldn't eat. It was fucking terrible.

4 (5m 37s):
Oh

1 (5m 37s):
Fuck. But then I got sober and things are fine.

4 (5m 40s):
Whew. What was the blood, did you ever find out then

1 (5m 43s):
I got an X-ray done. and it is like, it's fine. I just, when I, I smoke so much weed and cigarettes at the same time. Oh my God. You made your lungs

4 (5m 50s):
Bleed. That's so crazy. Yeah. Yeah. That

1 (5m 53s):
Chunk of blood would

4 (5m 54s):
Come out. Oh my God, that's so

1 (5m 55s):
Crazy. and I, remember I would cough and do it like a, like a towel or something. and I would send it to my ex Kilah.

4 (6m 4s):
Just the photo or the ex actual Just the photo. Okay. Okay. Yeah.

1 (6m 6s):
Yeah. It's less, it's photo I don. Yeah. And I'd be like, I have cancer. Because

4 (6m 9s):
If you send her the whole thing, that's like bio.

1 (6m 11s):
That's rare. Oh, really? don Don't think so.

4 (6m 14s):
Yeah. No. I mean, if you thought you had like some crazy disease, like you, oh my God. Did you see these ladies in, in Denver today? They took a live Ebola vaccine. There's not even Ebola cases here. It's only like,

1 (6m 26s):
It's in Africa. Right.

4 (6m 27s):
But this doctor was encouraging people to take this Ebola vaccine just in case Ebola hits. Why does everybody wanna freak me out?

1 (6m 35s):
I know.

4 (6m 36s):
Why does this lady wanna freak me out by taking this thing? Like, who knows what the fuck is gonna happen to you now? And why does everybody wanna freak me out at the fucking possibility of some new disease coming along and killing everybody. But,

1 (6m 47s):
But Ebola's old school, it's a scary one. Hot zone. and it liquefies your organs. Right.

4 (6m 53s):
Denver Health medical team receives Ebola vaccine. The team became some of the first people to receive the live Ebola vaccine for preventative measures in case of a future outbreak. The first people,

1 (7m 4s):
Wait a minute. Oh my God.

4 (7m 5s):
Wait a minute. Is it a new, is the Ebola vaccine new? Did they not have a vaccine before? And now they do.

1 (7m 11s):
I don't, I don't know

4 (7m 12s):
What the fuck people,

1 (7m 14s):
But back in the day when they had it, they just bombed a village, right? Or

4 (7m 17s):
That's a good question. What did they do? What

1 (7m 18s):
Did they do? I don't know what they did. I

4 (7m 20s):
Don't think it's that easy to spread, I think. but it has to be spread by bodily fluids if

1 (7m 24s):
It's not airborne, right? Yeah. Yeah.

4 (7m 26s):
But they could fix that.

1 (7m 30s):
You think the Chinese get in that lab? Chinese guys

4 (7m 35s):
A little bit of this. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. A little bit of that. And look, now it flies through the air.

1 (7m 40s):
Oh, man. If, if it was like covid, like that easy. Yeah.

4 (7m 43s):
But Ebola we're fucked.

1 (7m 44s):
But that's,

4 (7m 45s):
That's what scares the shit outta me, man. They keep talking about it. These fucking creeps of the World Economic Forum. They all get together and take, talk about preparation for disease X. They're calling it virus X or disease X. They're scaring the shit outta me.

1 (7m 59s):
But do you think it's, let me ask because I don't know. Okay. Can I just ask you something? don don't you know me? I don't know much. Okay. About nothing. Right, right. But do you believe that it was like manmade

4 (8m 9s):
Covid? Well, it was definitely manmade. Okay. Yeah. I wouldn't say definitely because I'm not really an expert. Yeah. But every expert that I have talked to that examined the virus itself, the, the cleavage sites, the way it, it's skipped all like animal forms. Like you can't find that virus out in the wild. And then all of a sudden it made a leap to person. It apparently has all of the earmarks of being engineered.

1 (8m 36s):
Wow.

4 (8m 37s):
This is, but this is something that they do. This is not like science fiction. Like, so when we say that, it's not like we're just making up some story about some lab where they're making viruses. No, no. They fucking 100% absolutely do it. And they lied about funding it. That was the big thing with Fauci and the NIH. They lied about funding gain of function research. And Rand Paul grilled them. You could watch it on YouTube. And then they lied about whether or not they fund this First of all was happening, whether or not they were doing gain of function research. And whether or not they funded it, it's, they funded it through another organization. So they fund another organization. Another organization funds the Wuhan lab, and there's a bunch of labs.

4 (9m 18s):
That's not the only lab. There's a shit ton of 'em. I visited one with Duncan. We went down to one in Galveston, Texas. It's fucking terrifying. and don don't know if they're doing gain of function research there, but I know they have some of the most deadly viruses and diseases known to man all with these crazy ventilation tubes. And everyone's walking around these hazmat suits and shit. And they let Duncan and I there. Why? Oh, and by the way, we hadn't slept so Duncan and I, this is when we were doing Joe Rogan questions, everything for Sci-Fi Duncan and I, we flew together. So we had to fly together to go to Texas. And both of us got barbecued.

4 (9m 58s):
I mean we took like 500 milligram edibles and totally missed our flight in the airport. We were just talking for like hours. We're like, oh my God, what time is it? Like that bad? And they're like, this flight's gone. The flight's gone. Yeah. Like, oh no. Yeah. So the next flight we had to take place was like five in the morning. and it got us there right before we're supposed to film. So we literally stayed up all night. Flew. I think we got a hotel for one hour. I think we actually got a hotel for one hour. Yeah. And then we flew, woke up in the morning and I I mean, just got up, got in the car rather, and just went straight to this lab. So we're delirious. We're still probably high. And we're in this crazy bio lab where they have Ebola.

4 (10m 41s):
Whoa. They have everything. They have, you name it, they've got it. Everything that kills everybody. And it's, it's all like these big thick plexiglass walls. Like, oh my God. Wow. It was freaking me out. Wow. And me and Dunk were both like, oh my God. Dude, are you in a suit too? Are you in a suit? No. Oh, no, no, no, no. We only went into like, the administrative offices. We did, they did not let us onto the floor. We didn't go anywhere near any diseases. They just let us through the, but the doctor scared the fuck out me. Because what he was saying to me is he, 'cause our, our spec, our piece was all on bio weapons. And one of the things that I, I intro interviewed this guy who was formerly from the Soviet Union.

4 (11m 22s):
I believe he Soviet, it might have been Ukraine, I think it was Soviet Union. And when he left, he was saying that they, at one point in time had literal vats of anthrax. Just like, like a, a giant fucking swimming pool filled with anthrax. He said they had so much of it, they had. So they like bio weapons were a, a big part of the strategy. Like if everything goes fucked, if we just decided to start killing each other, if we decided to start nuking each other, that was one of the things they were gonna do. Did,

1 (11m 54s):
Did they use anthrax and nom?

4 (11m 57s):
I don't believe

1 (11m 58s):
So. What's Agent Orange? The same thing?

4 (11m 59s):
No, no. Agent Orange is a defo. Defoliation. Oh. It's Agent Orange. They would spray on the plant so they could find the people in the jungle. Is is,

1 (12m 8s):
Is it orange?

4 (12m 9s):
That's a good question.

1 (12m 10s):
Like if I saw it right.

4 (12m 11s):
That's a good

1 (12m 12s):
Question. By orange right? Or not yellow

4 (12m 14s):
I. don know what it looks like. There was another word for it, right? What was the other word for Agent Orange? What's There's like a technical term because if

1 (12m 21s):
They use it in Vietnam, they should just call it agent yellow B. No,

4 (12m 27s):
Ba cut.

1 (12m 28s):
Cut that. Cut that out.

4 (12m 31s):
I've always said that like, Asian people take jokes better than anybody. You know why, why all emojis are yellow? No one complains.

1 (12m 39s):
It's true.

4 (12m 39s):
They don't complain. Yeah. Yellow thumbs up. Yellow Smiley face guy. Yeah. Yellow girl. Everyone's yellow. No one complains

1 (12m 46s):
Can ask. People get mad at me because I le I allow comics to do Asian accents in front of me. and I laugh at it because I think it's funny. But then people think that I'm like a, you know, you know, like an Uncle Chang. You know what I mean? Right,

4 (12m 59s):
Right, right. Listen, First of all those people are all your friends and friends mock each other all the time. Yeah. my friend, my friends mock me for being short. They mocked me for being bald. They mocked me for being old. It's fun. It's fun. If they mock me from being, see the thing is mocking me for being Italian. It doesn't work. Like no one cares. Yeah. It's not a bad one. Yeah. That's why you can call Italians guineas. Mm. And nobody gives a shit. They, they'll call each other guineas. You can call 'em guineas. No one cares. Because people don't really hate Italians. Yeah. They find 'em annoying. Like the a little gold chain ones

1 (13m 30s):
Or something.

4 (13m 31s):
Those guys, they get, some of 'em are a little, but that's also part of the flavor of that culture. It's fun. You know. But with, but Asian hate is a different kind of hate. 'cause Asian hate, like legitimately people will walk up to Asian people and punch them after Covid. I've, you've

1 (13m 48s):
Seen Oh yeah, I saw it. I saw it. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

4 (13m 50s):
It's fucking

1 (13m 51s):
Wild. Wild. Yeah.

4 (13m 52s):
Just I mean that's just strict racist hate walking right up to someone and punching them. Just because like an

1 (13m 59s):
Old man,

4 (13m 59s):
Old men, old ladies. Yeah. It's wild. And you don't even, they don't even know what kind of Asian, it's, it could be someone from the Philippines. It could be someone from China. They have no fucking idea. They're just, just hitting

1 (14m 10s):
People. It was fucking terrible. Yeah.

4 (14m 11s):
Terrifying. Yeah. That shit's real.

1 (14m 13s):
Yeah. But when it comes to like comedy, like back in the day, like you're backstage with a bunch of comics, we see all kinds of fucked up shit. We

4 (14m 20s):
Try to make each other laugh and it's hard to make us laugh or shock. Yeah. Or shock. Yeah. Yeah. Well, shock to make you laugh. Yeah. The shocking thing is just so you go, what the fuck is wrong with you?

1 (14m 31s):
How many times

4 (14m 31s):
Are we in the green room? And Joey Diaz will say something like, what the fuck is wrong with you? Yeah, yeah, yeah. And we're on the ground

1 (14m 37s):
Laughing. Yeah. Yeah. But

4 (14m 38s):
That's what he is trying to do. He's not a bad person. He's trying to make you laugh.

1 (14m 43s):
And then we do it, you know, publicly around, you know, on podcasts and stuff. Yeah. And people just get fucking crazy.

4 (14m 49s):
Well, you know what it's like, it, it's, it's like being around any person that's used to a certain thing. Like, have you ever been around soldiers? Like, especially like special operator guys, like Navy Seal type dudes. They, they, they get a couple of drinks in 'em. They start talking war stories. Yeah. Yeah. Holy shit. Yeah. They're funny. They, they're funny stories about people getting blown up. Yeah. Like they have funny stories about it. And you guess what? You can't bring that up at the fucking PTA meeting. You know, you can wait. Where you gonna, where are you gonna, you have to be around like-minded people. Yeah. That understand those kind of experiences to people. Talk about that. Cops, some of the cops I know, have the most fucked up senses of humor. Yeah. They've seen so much.

4 (15m 29s):
They need a release valve, man. They need fucking something to let out all the gunshot victims and all the deaths and highway act, all the things they see, man. They see so much. Yeah.

1 (15m 39s):
And also these port cities back in the day. Right. You'd have different races and stuff and they didn't speak the language. Yep. And the way they would connect is make fun of each other. Yeah. And people's accents. and it was a, it was this, you bonded that way, you know. But

4 (15m 53s):
That was the nicest thing they could do to each other. Back then, those poor cities were just filled with

1 (15m 57s):
Violence. Yeah. Probably. Yeah.

4 (15m 59s):
Violence. It's all gangs in New York.

1 (16m 0s):
Yeah. That's

4 (16m 1s):
What it was like, man. Yeah. That's real. Yeah. That's when people came here from other countries. Like my ancestors came here, or my grandparents came here in the 1920s. Wow. They came from Italy. And on my father's side, they came from Ireland. One, one from Ireland. He was from Ireland. The mother's from Italy, they're all immigrants. Everybody's an immigrant. Those people that came to that place, they all were so wild. They were willing to get on a boat with their kids and travel across the ocean. You didn't know if you had a job, you didn't know what it looked like. Yeah. You had to look at a drawing of it.

1 (16m 36s):
Yeah.

4 (16m 36s):
Yeah. I mean you had to, somebody had to tell you, you had to get an a, a letter from Uncle Pete. Yeah. That, you know, I made it to America. I got a job in the shipyard. It's great. I'm making, you know, 50 bucks a month. And then they're like, oh, 50 bucks a month. Yeah. And then they get in their boat with their babies.

1 (16m 52s):
Yeah. Those,

4 (16m 53s):
Those were wild people. And wild

1 (16m 55s):
And like the Chinese. Right? Oh yeah. Back in the, they had three options. I could do laundry. Right. Dynamite, detail, railroad. Right, right. Opium, then restaurant. Oh, restaurant. I'm opium then. Yeah. Back in the day. Yeah. You I've

4 (17m 9s):
The best one. Opium. Yeah.

1 (17m 11s):
You's rain. Right. I'd laid them down on a nice, like, you know what I mean? Felt mattress. Oh, you'd have cool light. You had a great lighting. Yeah. Yeah. Ride. Right. Ride the dragon. I would stick it in their mouth. Yeah. Light it for them. Yeah.

4 (17m 23s):
Right. And then touch their head as they're going over there.

1 (17m 25s):
Right. Just

4 (17m 26s):
Like,

1 (17m 26s):
Right. Right. Whoa, whoa. Wow. Yeah. Like in that movie, once Upon a Time in America.

4 (17m 33s):
Yeah.

1 (17m 35s):
Dero was like fucked up on o opiates. But are everybody

4 (17m 39s):
Got fucked up on it once you did it? Yeah.

1 (17m 41s):
They

4 (17m 41s):
Get fucked up. That's what's wild about social media. Social media is addictive and it doesn't even feel good. Opium. At least you feels feel great.

1 (17m 52s):
Yeah.

4 (17m 53s):
You feel great. Look at all those dudes in the Opium Den.

1 (17m 55s):
Oh my god. Mine would look so much better than that.

4 (17m 58s):
I had Peter Berg on, you know, Peter Berg did that. You know, he's amazing. He's done a million things. He's, that guy's the shit. But he did that Netflix series painkiller. The one on the Sackler family didn't

1 (18m 9s):
See it. And the

4 (18m 10s):
Holy shit,

1 (18m 11s):
Dude. I see. Okay. I'll see it. The

4 (18m 12s):
Opioid crisis. But he, he told me that he tried it once. He said, I tried, I tried Oxycontin once recreationally. Yeah. And he was like, oh my God, get this the fuck away from me. Yeah. He goes, it was

1 (18m 22s):
Great. Yeah.

4 (18m 24s):
It just makes you feel so good. That's the problem. That's the problem. Those goddamn things.

1 (18m 29s):
Well, when I was on Mad TV and I re I relapsed because I had 13 years and I got on Mad tv. All I, I got addicted to the Vicodin and I was taking 30 or 40 a day. Ooh. Jesus Christ. And when I got off of that shit, dude. Right. Oh God. It was the worst detox I've ever fucking felt. And then I had to do a Connie Chung sketch on mad two days into fucking detoxing and I shit, my pants on, on camera. And they didn't air it

4 (18m 54s):
Because you shit your pants.

1 (18m 55s):
Yeah. I went, good evening. I'm con I play Connie Chung. Right, right. I'm shaking. Oh boy. Good evening. I'm Connie. As I said, Connie, I, food and I had stockings and then I had a wardrobe wipe it. Oh, it was fucking terrible. It was fucking terrible. Oh boy. and I got sober then. But it's like, yeah, Vicodin opiates at the worst.

4 (19m 12s):
What other job can you do that? And they're like, just clean him up. I know. It's

1 (19m 17s):
Really good at McDonald's. Yeah. You're

4 (19m 19s):
Out. You're out. You're gone.

1 (19m 19s):
Yeah. Yeah. You know, we try to finish

4 (19m 22s):
Working for Apple. That's a wrap. That's a wrap.

1 (19m 24s):
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Even on stage

4 (19m 26s):
During the Genius bar, you shoot your pants. Yeah. That's it.

1 (19m 29s):
Bobby. Yeah. No more even on stage. Like you can go up to a guy and go Fuck you. Yeah. Like in comedy, like, you don't get fired for that. It's fucking amazing. It's amazing. If you did that at like Jamba Juice, you're done. Right.

4 (19m 41s):
But the, the the, I remember you telling, I remember you telling me a story how you had been up all night and you, you got back to Mad tv, had to get there for something for some, like was it a table read or what? And you had a giant knife on you, your superpower and tweaking.

1 (19m 57s):
Oh yeah. You said you had a, he said you

4 (19m 60s):
Were carrying like a Bowie

1 (20m 1s):
Knife. Yeah. Bow. And sometimes a cling on one of those Cling guys. Gotta love Star Trek. Yeah. So I had a Klingon knife one the Curves. How pick was it? It was like this long. I still have it by my bed. Right. They'll stick it right here. Right. And an open Hawaiian shirt. This and I, I was breaking out and they Yeah. That's what it looks like. That's what it looked like. Yeah. Oh, that's pretty dope.

4 (20m 19s):
Yeah. Yeah. That is actually pretty dope. That's what clingons we carry on.

1 (20m 22s):
Yeah. And then they would,

4 (20m 23s):
Isn't that crazy? They have spaceships, so they still need knives. It seems. So like you don't have a better

1 (20m 29s):
Weapon. I've never thought about that weapon.

4 (20m 31s):
But First of all, they didn't even have the fucking internet. Right. It's the dumbest show ever. And they had walkie talkers. They hadn't even figured out phones yet.

1 (20m 38s):
I never thought of that. Like Kirk

4 (20m 39s):
Out click. You'd have

1 (20m 40s):
To hang up. Right. You'd have to hang up. You think they would've like a nothing. Yeah. Something. Yeah. But yet

4 (20m 44s):
They could beam you up. But you literally take your body and recon

1 (20m 48s):
Just, it's still a good show. It's a

4 (20m 50s):
Great show.

1 (20m 50s):
It's a, it's still a good sci-fi show. Listen,

4 (20m 52s):
I love Star Trek.

4 (21m 2s):
I'm not wrong. Yeah, yeah,

1 (21m 3s):
Yeah. Can I just say something? I can't be

4 (21m 5s):
Wrong for liking something.

1 (21m 7s):

1 (22m 5s):
No, the concept is great. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I

4 (22m 7s):
Believe

1 (22m 8s):
You. Okay, good. Thank you.

4 (22m 9s):
I like the old one just for nostalgic purposes. Yeah. 'cause I'm old and because when I was a kid that was on television and I, remember watching Star Trek, captain Kirk, like, oh my God, he's

1 (22m 18s):
The coolest. Yeah. It was

4 (22m 19s):
The best. You know? And, and it was also, it's so corny. Like if you watch it today, it's gone to this point where it becomes funny. It's parody. Yeah. Like, there's a, there's a scene where Captain Kirk has a fight with like a lizard man.

1 (22m 34s):
Yeah.

4 (22m 35s):
On a, on a planet. Yeah. I

1 (22m 36s):
Remember that. Have seen it. I remember that. Yeah. It's

4 (22m 38s):
The dumbest fight scene. I know

1 (22m 39s):
Ever.

4 (22m 40s):
It's right up there with the six, $6 million Man versus Bigfoot. That's the dumbest one. Yeah. This one. But this one's pretty dumb. Look how handsome he was so handsome. First of all this lizard is so goddamn slow. I would fuck this lizard up. I would fuck. Look at this. I would fuck him up, dude. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I would, fuck. Look how slow he is. Look, look at up is, bro. I would fuck him up. I would be leg kicking him right now. W wh I'd take them knees out. Oh, that What a shitty body kick.

1 (23m 6s):
Wow.

4 (23m 7s):
He

1 (23m 7s):
Just, he fights, he fights like Brendan Shaw a little bit,

4 (23m 9s):
But all he did is throw 'em. Brendan s Shaub was a good fighter. I'm kidding. I'm mouth knocked out. Merko Kco.

1 (23m 15s):
I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I love him.

4 (23m 17s):
So look at this. He's right next to you and he's not even biting you. Yeah. Yeah. This, this is the biggest pussy lizard of all time. He's not even biting. Yeah. He's not biting. The neck is right there. He's got a giant mouth filled with teeth easily. He could bite. There's no restraint. Keeping him from biting.

1 (23m 33s):
Yeah. Oh, that was a good ear move. He got Captain Kirk.

4 (23m 36s):
He he hit him with the ears. Yeah. Yeah. Now he's Oh, he hurt him with the ears. Yeah. So what does he do? He runs away like a pussy. Now he's gonna throw rocks at him.

1 (23m 46s):
Yeah.

4 (23m 47s):
You gotta hit him in the ear, bro. Get close. The guy's slow as fuck. Look at him. This is so dumb. This is so dumb. This is so dumb. It hurts my feelings.

1 (23m 58s):
But imagine shooting that that day. It's so hot. Hot. My god. That guy in the lizard suit. Oh my God. Oh,

4 (24m 2s):
He's sweating his dick off. Yeah. Yeah. He's having it rough. 'cause that's probably Burbank or somewhere. Yeah. Those stone. Like that Totally looks like it could be California, doesn't it?

1 (24m 10s):
Yeah. They, they must have shot it.

4 (24m 12s):
Oh, he is gonna pick up the rock. Look how fake that rock looks. What? He's gonna throw that rock. All you have to do is just get outta the way. Now don't stand there. I. don. Wait for the look. Get out of

1 (24m 21s):
The fucking

4 (24m 22s):
Way, bro. Oh Jesus.

1 (24m 25s):
Oh Jesus. Oh, that was good though. Jesus

4 (24m 26s):
Christ. How casual did he get outta the way? Because he knew it wasn't a real rock.

1 (24m 30s):
Yeah. It runs away. When, remember that guy threw the shoe at Bush.

4 (24m 33s):
This is picture perfect. Terrible acting. Yeah. Picture perfect. Terrible choreography. Everything about it is hilarious. Does it end? That was it.

1 (24m 41s):
Yeah.

4 (24m 41s):
He doesn't kill him.

1 (24m 42s):
He ran away. No, that's it. He ran away. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

4 (24m 45s):
How dumb Throwing boulders at him. You gotta get that. I love that show. Yeah.

1 (24m 48s):
It reminds me of old Godzillas.

4 (24m 49s):
You remember when Captain Kirk hooked up with that green lady? It was a big deal.

1 (24m 53s):
Would you have, yeah. So if I would've

4 (24m 56s):
Fucked the avatar

1 (24m 57s):
Lady. So if you and I had a, like a, the

4 (24m 58s):
Avatar ladies, that lady's

1 (25m 0s):
Hot on Pandora. I don't know. It looks blue.

4 (25m 3s):
The one I look gives a fuck. The one that he eventually winds up with. Yeah.

1 (25m 8s):
Oof. She's hot. But you know how like the creatures connect with the tails or whatever, then they communicate. Yeah. Does that come outta the vagina too? don don't know. don don't

4 (25m 14s):
Think they have a

1 (25m 17s):
Oh,

4 (25m 17s):
I think you just link up like that and come in your mind. Oh.

1 (25m 19s):
Oh, you come. Oh yeah. I'd love to come In my mind. Who

4 (25m 21s):
Knows how the babies even get

1 (25m 22s):
There. Yeah. I can't, you know, can I ask? They don't

4 (25m 25s):
Have I mean They, they have things over their dicks. So they must have dicks. Right. They all had loincloths. Yeah.

1 (25m 31s):
But I'm 52. Joe and I. I can't. I can't. I can't. I come.

4 (25m 35s):
You can't come.

1 (25m 36s):
I come every other time.

4 (25m 37s):
Every other time. Yeah. That's good.

1 (25m 39s):
That's good enough. But you know what I like, I like edging.

4 (25m 41s):
But how much are you fucking, are you trying to fuck every day or jerk off every day? Maybe you're running outta jizz. Maybe you just have a small factory, you know, and you're just demanding too much output. No,

1 (25m 50s):
My factory's pretty big. Dude, your

4 (25m 52s):
Balls are big

1 (25m 53s):
For my size. Yeah. Yeah.

4 (25m 54s):
But like for normal humans, when you hit 52, like how often are you coming

1 (25m 59s):
Every other day.

4 (26m 0s):
That's

1 (26m 1s):
Reasonable. That's reasonable. But when I'm in the sack with a woman, oh. Psychologically I can't do it. So do

4 (26m 5s):
You just fake it?

1 (26m 6s):
I I pull up spit on her. No. Oh, I make it, I dim the lights. Yeah. and I do it back. I go back. You go back. So there's, yeah. So I go, ah, good. and I, go back. Good. Move back to the back of the wall. Good. Move in the dark.

4 (26m 18s):
Oh. And act it out. Fall around.

1 (26m 20s):
Act I act a good actor. Right. Epilepsy.

4 (26m 22s):
Right,

1 (26m 22s):
Right. Seizure and I. Go straight to the bathroom like I'm washing it. Whoa. Okay. So they can't see the cum.

4 (26m 27s):
That's a good move.

1 (26m 27s):
Thank you.

4 (26m 29s):
It's a good move. You wanna be deceptive?

1 (26m 31s):
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

4 (26m 32s):
I guess that's a not a terrible thing to deceive people about whether or not you come.

1 (26m 37s):
Yeah. I mean, but I feel bad. Girls

4 (26m 38s):
Are all guilty of

1 (26m 39s):
It. Yeah. But I don't want them to feel bad. Like they're not hot. It has nothing to do with them. Right. I get it. Right. I I'm just being like a nice guy, not a sensitive person. Yeah. I'm,

4 (26m 46s):
That's so sweet

1 (26m 47s):
Of you. Yeah. I'm super sensitive. Yeah. But it's like, because I was in a 10 year thing and now I'm like single. So I'm just experimenting, you know? I

4 (26m 52s):
Get it. Yeah. I get it.

1 (26m 54s):
You do. Yeah. Yeah,

4 (26m 55s):
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1 (26m 56s):
It's still fun though. Yeah. You're

4 (26m 57s):
Having a good time, Bobby. Yeah. I am. As long as you're enjoying life, that's what you should be doing. You should be enjoying

1 (27m 3s):
Life. You know, Joe, may, may I say Yes, I am.

4 (27m 6s):
That's beautiful. Because when you weren't enjoying life, it bothered me. It bothered me because I love you and like, you're such a nice guy and you get weirded out by so many different things.

1 (27m 14s):
And I. Like what? Like, like what? How would you, you were

4 (27m 16s):
Just always paranoid that people didn't like you and you're, you know, you were always weirded out by stuff.

1 (27m 22s):
Well, you

4 (27m 22s):
Know, even me and you. Like, we hadn't seen each other for six months. Like, do you still like me? I'm like, I love you. Whatcha talking about gimme a hug

1 (27m 29s):
Because we have history.

4 (27m 31s):
Yeah. But our history is all beautiful.

1 (27m 32s):
It's a beautiful history.

4 (27m 33s):
We have history of We've never been in an argument. No, we've never yelled at each other. No. We've always had good times. Yeah. We've had a lot of laughs. We have. Oh

1 (27m 40s):
My god, dude. Some great laughs. Oh my God. We had laughs.

4 (27m 42s):
Yeah. Oh my God.

1 (27m 43s):
We've had, we've had moments where I even recall that you probably don't even remember. Like one time you and I were at the comedy store. We're in the patio, and Eddie Griffin bumped us. Ah, right. And we were talking shit. So this

4 (27m 55s):
Must be early

1 (27m 56s):
Days, early days back in the day. Nineties. Right. Nineties. Right. Wow. And then I remember there was a black guy near us listening. And he told Eddie Griffin that we were talking shit about him and he confronted us. Yeah, I remember that. And we were like, fuck off. You know what I mean? but it was like, 'cause you remember he used to do hours. Yeah.

4 (28m 14s):
Well, he would do three hours. He would go on at nine o'clock and your spot would be at nine 15 and he would do three hours.

1 (28m 20s):
It was him Dice would do it. Sometimes men Mencia would do it. All the it all. Oh my God. Oh my God. Yeah.

4 (28m 27s):
But it was, the thing is, it was the kind of, the culture of the Comedy store in Eddie's defense is that if you reached a certain level of fame, and at the time Eddie was definitely more famous than us, and he was, when I still to this day, maintained that Eddie Griffin set on Def Jam was one of the best fucking don Don't know. Was it 10 minutes, 15 minutes, whatever he did. It was one of the best sets I've ever seen. He had shorts on, remember? Yeah. Yeah. And he has so much energy. Man. I remember wa I, I'm pretty sure I was in New York at the time when I watched it. I was like, God damn, this fucking dude is

1 (29m 3s):
Talented. Yeah. I'm not questioning his skillset, but

4 (29m 5s):
It's a, the culture thing. This is what I was gonna say. Yeah. There was a thing at the store when you reach a certain level of prominence, you were allowed to just do whatever the fuck you wanted and people would show up. And apparently Kennison used to do that. And a lot of guys used to do that.

1 (29m 19s):
But do ours.

4 (29m 20s):
I get it, man. don don't, I don't agree with it. You wouldn't do it. No, but there's certain guys did, certain guys that are really good did Chappelle did it. There's a bunch of guys who did it. It was a thing that you were allowed to do there. You know what I'm saying? and it was like, I don't, I think we probably all should have talked about it. Yeah. And said, Hey, this is kind of crazy. Yeah. But

1 (29m 41s):
You didn't, I still to this day went to Emily and I. Go give me a list right now of who, the people that are allowed to bump me. Right. Right. And she goes, I'll get back to you. Right.

4 (29m 50s):
Nobody should be allowed to bump you. If someone wants to do a set, if a like a famous person is in town, they should ask you if it's okay. Yeah. That's how I feel. I never bump anybody I don.

1 (29m 60s):
But it still happens. I don

4 (30m 1s):
No I know. But it's, I don't, I don't. It's a, also, it's a thing that was the comedy store's like Mark, that you had made it to a certain level, if you could show up and some guys would try to get it, they would try to bump people and like, you're nobody.

1 (30m 15s):
Some

4 (30m 16s):
People are crazy,

1 (30m 16s):
Crazy, crazy delusional.

4 (30m 19s):
Yeah. They're like a YouTube person or someone who's on some show. Literally. Like someone who's on the, some show that you've never heard of that was on like the WB or

1 (30m 26s):
Something like that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. What

4 (30m 28s):
Are you talking about? Yeah. There's a few guys that like, wanted to try that juice before because it was that thing like when someone would show up, whoever it was, some Chris Rock would show up, he would just go on stage. That's it. Chris Rock goes on stage

1 (30m 40s):
When he gets there. But he's on the list. I have a list

4 (30m 43s):
Of people that

1 (30m 43s):
Are allowed. Yeah. You're on the list.

4 (30m 45s):
Okay.

1 (30m 45s):
You wouldn't do it, but you're on it. Yeah.

4 (30m 48s):
I don't do it. Yeah.

1 (30m 48s):
Chris rock's on the list. Chappelle's on the list. Bill Burr's on the list. Makes sense. Right. But then there are people, you know what I mean that aren't right. And they do it. and it drives me fucking crazy. Well,

4 (30m 58s):
It's a weird thing. It's like you're trying to appease the talent. You don't, you never know who's really gonna make it big and you don't wanna piss 'em off. Now. I'm so glad don don't have to deal with that. I know. I always told people, be nice to comedy club owners 'cause you don't wanna be one. That was my advice always to comics. 'cause they always get mad at comedy club owners. I go, listen man, you do not wanna be one of these people and we fucking need them. This is a crazy job. You're dealing with maniacs that may or may not take their flight. Might show up drunk. Yeah. Might, might get arrested Friday night after the first show. Yeah. Like, you don't, like, imagine you, you're feeding your family based on these fucking maniacs that come

1 (31m 35s):
In every week. I know I know I know I know

4 (31m 36s):
I mean. These people are regular people with,

1 (31m 37s):
I would go to comedy clubs and I. See, I would look at the, I go to the office and see the calendar and it, and it always say, it would always say Pablo Francisco with a question mark. Oh yeah. Pa Pablo was a rough one. I mean. Yeah. Yeah. So it's like, I get it. Yeah.

4 (31m 47s):
Look, Pablo's fucking insanely talented. He's so

1 (31m 51s):
Talented. Oh my God. Pablo

4 (31m 52s):
Goes to the basement, he gets in there, he goes and looks around those dark corners. Son. I,

1 (31m 57s):
I, you know, I, I I,

4 (31m 58s):
He goes out there, he goes into the tunnel

1 (32m 0s):
And I've, I've, you know, I I just feel so sad about it. But he could have been the biggest thing.

4 (32m 5s):
He should have been. Yeah. He should have been. That's how talented he should

1 (32m 8s):
Have been. Huge in the nineties. Oh my God. Oh my God. Crusher

4 (32m 11s):
Destroyer. And so fun to be around. Yeah. Like a sweetheart of a guy. Like a just nobody hated Pablo sweetheart of a guy, sweetheart. Every time people were around him, you wanted to hug him.

1 (32m 21s):
Yeah. But he had that skillset set on stage that was like a combination between impressions and act outs and he had everything. And

4 (32m 29s):
Funny jokes too. Yeah.

1 (32m 30s):
Funny jokes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

4 (32m 30s):
He had all of it, all of it together and just so likable. Such

1 (32m 34s):
A great guy. Such a nice guy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, it's, I see that still to this day.

4 (32m 43s):
Yeah. I was really lucky that the thing that I was into was weed and that the thing I was into made me terrified. It gave me, it made me paranoid. Mm. It was the opposite of making, giving me courage. It gave me no courage. Like

1 (32m 56s):
Marijuana.

4 (32m 57s):
Marijuana was a courage killer. Yeah. Yeah. Like, it made me feel like courage was foolish. You're so vulnerable. Life is vulnerable. And, and it made me appreciate people more. Like legitimately, when

1 (33m 8s):
You, when you're, do you perform when you're high? Sometimes. All the time. Right. Do you ever lose your place or No? No. That's what I found. I

4 (33m 14s):
Take a lot of nootropics. That's one of the keys.

1 (33m 16s):
Can I have one? Yeah.

4 (33m 17s):
Take take four of those. Okay. That's Alpha Brain black label. That stuff is the

1 (33m 21s):
Shit. I've always, when I see a show on, on your online, I always wanna try your little things. I don. What?

4 (33m 25s):
It's, that's a good one to try. And this is, you know, I'm affiliated with this company, obviously, but it is not the only one that I try. Thank I'll tell people about some stuff that I have no affiliation with. Neuro Gum is one of 'em. We have, we always keep Neuro Gumm in the studio and it's,

1 (33m 40s):
Can I have a packet of Neuro Gumm when I leave? Yeah.

4 (33m 42s):
We can have one right now. Yeah.

1 (33m 43s):
Yeah. A

4 (33m 43s):
Patch. You on the mic. Something I

1 (33m 45s):
Mean. I'm not gonna do it. I'll

4 (33m 46s):
Do it later. We have plenty. We should get some more. And we'll probably run and dry. Yeah. We, we go through four or five fucking boxes of that stuff. And

1 (33m 52s):
You really, neuro gumm really works. Oh

4 (33m 53s):
Yeah. A hundred percent. Oh wow. It's got theanine in it and caffeine and a couple other things. And what it does is it enhances your memory. It enhances your, your brain's ability to form sentences and Whoa. Yeah. Well, with Alpha Brain, we did two double blind placebo controlled studies at the Boston Center for Memory memory. and it showed increase in alpha flow state. It showed increase in verbal memory, increase in, I think it was a reaction time, but it does something. and it, and we did it at a dose. That's half of what I take. I take four. I sometimes I take six if I'm feeling

1 (34m 27s):
Frustrat.

4 (34m 29s):
Keep deal. If I'm talking to a scientist,

1 (34m 30s):
Does it hit right away or no?

4 (34m 31s):
No. Okay. No. It take it a while. If I'm talking to a scientist, I, I, I'll take a shit load of him. I'll take six.

1 (34m 37s):
Oh, like Lex Lex. Yeah. Yeah. I love that guy.

4 (34m 41s):
He's awesome. He's awesome. But I mean any scientist, like any, anytime I'm talking to someone who's like, explaining to me some very complicated things about the universe. Yeah. Like, I don't want any fogginess. I want to be like locked in.

1 (34m 53s):
See, that was one of my fears of doing your show is science and the things that you guys talk about. I'm talking about Science. I know. I'm just saying. Yeah. I, I was like, I don't know nothing about anything. You don't

4 (35m 3s):
Have to, okay. No, no, no, no, no. This is is

1 (35m 6s):
I know film, I know some film. Listen,

4 (35m 8s):
You, you and my friend, and we have had conversations thousands of times. That's all this is. It's just you and I having a con. Yeah. Do you remember when we first met, remember we first met the strip club in San Diego?

1 (35m 19s):
I, I, you can I say Ha ha can I say say something? But can I just say something about it? Yes. Yes. I think I might be wrong the way you're saying it. Maybe.

4 (35m 28s):
How so?

1 (35m 28s):
Well, I don't, let's, let's go by. So, okay. I meant you were headlining La Jolla. Yes. I was a doorman. Yes. Right. and I. Think Diaz was, Diaz was there. I

1 (35m 38s):
Yeah. I think it was there. Right? Yeah. I knew Diaz. Right. So he goes, Hey, let's go to the strip club with Joe and I. I was like, I was trying to be a host.

4 (35m 46s):
Was this 95?

1 (35m 48s):
Yeah. 95, 96. Okay. Right. Wow. and I was a kid. Right. I was enamored by you. You know what I mean? Not enamored, but I was

4 (35m 55s):
Like, I doubt it. I wasn't even famous back then.

1 (35m 57s):
No, but still you were a headliner. I was at mc. Okay. Right, right, right, right. So then we go to the strip club. Okay. Right. And it's deja vu.

4 (36m 4s):
Okay. Okay. Okay.

1 (36m 6s):
And I wanted up going like, I'm from San Diego. I know the ropes I know the people. I didn't Okay.

4 (36m 13s):
Of course I didn't. That's not really what happened.

1 (36m 15s):
No. But we sat there. Okay. And then there were gang members there. Right. Right. And then we, I don't know what the problem was or there was a problem between, I'll tell you

4 (36m 24s):
The problem. Okay. Okay. There's one of the gang members was dating one of the strippers. Okay. And when he was over there talking to the stripper, you went over and tried to get the stripper to give you a lap dance. And when you did that, I saw the look in his eyes and he had lo I'll never forget, he had long, straight black hair. Yeah. This Mexican dude with tattoos on his face in 95, only

1 (36m 45s):
Two teardrops. That's

4 (36m 46s):
Fine. Okay. That's only two people he killed. Okay. And this is 95. Okay. And you went over and I said, Bobby, what the fuck are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? I go, did you take a look at that guy's eyes? Yeah. I go, Bobby, these are like dangerous real people. And you're like, oh, shut the fuck off this. Nothing's gonna happen. They ain't gonna do shit if I, okay, I'm outta here. So I said, I'm leaving. You could either come with me or not. and I got up and left. I saw where this was going. They were getting up Bobby, they were moving around. They were thinking about coming over to you. and I got us right out the door. And you barely got in my car. You barely got in my car in time. You were dilly dalian. And someone had to yell at you. And then we got you in the car. And we took off. I go, Hey Bobby, you were gonna get us shot.

4 (37m 27s):
Like, for real.

1 (37m 28s):
Well, you saved my life.

4 (37m 29s):
Don don't know if I saved your life, but I definitely saved you nasty. But,

1 (37m 31s):
But, but also if she's working there, she's on the clock. No, just hear me out.

4 (37m 37s):
No, you're, if

1 (37m 38s):
I'm at McDonald's Right. And some

4 (37m 40s):
Technically correct, I'm

1 (37m 41s):
Technically correct.

4 (37m 42s):
Technically you're correct.

1 (37m 43s):
Ethically correct. But she was

4 (37m 44s):
Over there talking to her gang member boyfriend. And you went over asking for a lap dance. And you, you just like stormed your way into their conversation. You were gonna die.

1 (37m 53s):
Can I just say something? Yes, please. May I wanna say something. Okay. Okay. At the time, and I found this out later, I thought the teardrops meant that he was emotional or something. I didn't know about death. Okay.

4 (38m 3s):
If I, even if he didn't have teardrops in his face. Yeah.

1 (38m 6s):
The

4 (38m 7s):
Look in that guy's eyes, like the, the whole group of them. They were serious people. I don't

1 (38m 11s):
Wanna make assumptions about people.

4 (38m 12s):
Okay. Do you have any self preservation instincts? What whatsoever? What do you mean? Did you have any self-preservation instincts? We, well,

1 (38m 20s):
From the suburbs, we don't, we don't know danger that way. We had no homeless. We had surfers.

4 (38m 25s):
You should be just inherently, like a, a child sees a dog's teeth and is scared of him. You should see that guy. Yeah. Yeah. Growling. And go, okay, this is real

1 (38m 34s):
Joe. I'm 52 now. I've never had anything happen to me. No. Sure. So I feel like my instincts Right. Are on the on point.

4 (38m 40s):
You're also very likable. I'm likable. People decide not to kill you. I smile.

1 (38m 44s):
Yeah.

4 (38m 44s):
So what,

1 (38m 44s):
What the fuck

4 (38m 45s):
Dog? I go, yeah.

1 (38m 47s):
Yeah's a good move.

4 (38m 48s):
That's good move. That's

1 (38m 49s):
A good move. Yeah.

4 (38m 49s):
Yeah. But that, that was our introduction. That's how we became friends. Okay. It didn't Right, right. Fuck up our relationship. It didn't

1 (38m 59s):
Fucking know. We stayed friends. Yeah. I know. And like, I came to LA and then I think that grew. It grew. What

4 (39m 4s):
Year did you come to

1 (39m 4s):
La? 97 or 98. Like in that time period. but it

4 (39m 8s):
Was what a weird time at the store that was, huh? The

1 (39m 10s):
Dark ages. It

4 (39m 11s):
Was weird, but it was really good for us. Yeah. 'cause you would go on stage in the OR and it'd be half full. and it was, it was like a real good place to fuck around and practice. Oh. So

1 (39m 20s):
The people that did it really did it because there was no like light at the end of the tunnel.

4 (39m 26s):
Not anymore. I think the store goes through eras and it had gone through the Kinison era. And when Kinison died, I think there was a big drop off.

1 (39m 33s):
It was terrible times dude, dude. On a Saturday night in the, or they couldn't start the show without four people living in the audience and there would be sometimes no show. Yeah. On a Saturday fucking night.

4 (39m 42s):
Yeah. It was crazy.

1 (39m 43s):
Yeah. It was crazy, dude.

4 (39m 44s):
But then it came back, it came back when the internet came around. Came back and like in the early two thousands.

1 (39m 49s):
Yeah.

4 (39m 50s):
Yeah. It

1 (39m 50s):
Came back and, and we, I reaped the reward. I'm so glad it didn't quit.

4 (39m 54s):
Yeah. I'm so glad you didn't quit too.

1 (39m 56s):
Yeah. I saw, dude, I saw some cra I saw one time at two in the morning. I was working the door there. Yeah. and I saw people in purple robes. Ooh. Go up into the belly room. Oh, with candles. Oh, Jesus. Right. So now how you, you know how you can sneak up to the belly room through the green room with those offices and stuff? Right? Were

4 (40m 15s):
They supposed to be up

1 (40m 16s):
There? Yeah.

4 (40m 17s):
Oh,

1 (40m 18s):
I I I'm not lying. This

4 (40m 19s):
Is the nineties. Yeah.

1 (40m 20s):
Okay. Right. I peeked through. They formed a circle and the candles up. What a baby. No, no, no, no, no. Baby eating. Okay. I'd have to report that. Okay. Okay. And they were doing seances,

4 (40m 33s):
The comedy store, if any place is haunted. Yeah. The comedy store's haunted.

1 (40m 37s):
They were trying to seance Andy Kaufman's ghost. Oh. And when I went back downstairs, the people that went with the robes, they came back down and they were in their regular clothes. Lily Tomlin, Bob sda. Whoa. I saw with my own eyes. Whoa. It was fucking crazy. Whoa. Yeah.

4 (40m 59s):
Well, why not? You know? Yeah. You get a little high. Someone comes up. My idea. Yeah. Yeah. Why do we have to wear the robes? Because it'd be fun. And then you get Right, right, right, right. It sounds like something me and Duncan would do.

1 (41m 10s):
Yeah. Nice robes probably too. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I'm sure. Yeah. Yeah.

4 (41m 13s):
Literally, Tom, would I mean she's not gonna wear some bullshit robe?

1 (41m 16s):
Yeah. Yeah. But

4 (41m 17s):
I have some respect. So

1 (41m 18s):
Speaking of Duncan, when I got sober, when I had that 17 years chunk, and anyone out there listening Right. I needed to get all my drugs outta my house. So he was the only one I wanted to, he was the only one that could do it. So when I called him, he came under my house in five minutes. He cleaned out my apartment in like 20 minutes. And then he made me a fish dinner. Aw. And then he took all my drugs and went away. But I want to Duncan, if you're listening, thank you for that. Duncan's the man. He's the best. Yeah.

4 (41m 45s):
We lived together once for a while.

1 (41m 47s):
Where?

4 (41m 48s):
In my house, six months in California.

1 (41m 51s):
Really? Yeah. Wow.

4 (41m 52s):
He got kicked out of his apartment. He was, or the house. He was dating this lady. And she got tired of him playing video games, All day.

1 (42m 1s):
Really? And

4 (42m 2s):
He, he calls me and he goes, dude, I don't know what to do. I'm in a hotel. She kicked me out. I go, come live with me. Yeah. I get this big ass house. Yeah. So Duncan lived with me for like six months and that was, I had a sensory deprivation tank in the basement. I,

1 (42m 16s):
I, I saw that when I, your house

4 (42m 17s):
Duncan would go down in the basement and trip trip balls and Wow. Sort his life out. Was

1 (42m 22s):
He messy?

4 (42m 23s):
No. No. Duncan was a great roommate. Really? He was awesome. Yeah.

1 (42m 27s):
Did you have to kick him out or No, no,

4 (42m 29s):
No. No. He eventually got back on his feet again. Right. And, you know, we had a great time. Like, he had stayed there for years. We had a wonderful time. Oh. It was a lot of fun.

1 (42m 39s):
Wow. It was like,

4 (42m 40s):
Dunkin's one of my best friends, so like, having one of my best friends in my house, and the house is big, so it's not like we were on top of each other. I could be way the fuck the, the phone didn't even work in the whole house. I'd have to transfer phones to go to other

1 (42m 51s):
Parts of the house. Wow. Wow.

4 (42m 52s):
It's a big ass house. Yeah. So if Duncan's over in that side, I'm on, on over in this side. Like, we're not even in each other's hair. Yeah. Didn't even bother each other. So it was really cool, man. It was cool like having meals with 'em, hanging out with 'em. Wow. So for like six months we were roommates.

1 (43m 6s):
And to think that he was not even a standup at one point. He was a, a talent coordinator?

4 (43m 10s):
Well, he was a standup. He was trying to do standup when he was the talent coordinator. We became friends because I would call up and give my veils and then we would have crazy conversations. You know, he was like, did you see this thing with rom dos? And he'd like, and we would talk about like UFOs. Yeah. Bigfoot and shit. Yeah. That's why when that Joe Rogan questions everything show. That's why I did it with him. I'm like, God, he's the perfect guy to do this with. And Ari too, Ari did some of the episodes as well. Wow. But like, you know, Duncan was always trying to do standup. He was just, you know. Yeah. He was just unorthodox, you know, in his

1 (43m 45s):
Approach. Yeah. But he, but then he got good. Oh, he's amazing. Like the fucking doll.

4 (43m 48s):
Oh my God. Oh my god. Little, little Hobo is one of the best sets. One of the best bits I've ever seen.

1 (43m 53s):
It was so good. It's so good. Yeah. He

4 (43m 55s):
Did it the other night at the, at the mothership. Oh, did he

1 (43m 56s):
Really? Yeah. Yeah.

4 (43m 57s):
It's incredible. Yeah. Little. He's got a new little hobo too. Somebody stole little hobo.

1 (44m 2s):
No.

4 (44m 2s):
Yeah. Some piece of shit. Stole, stole, stole

1 (44m 4s):
Little, little Hobo was like an antique doll too, right?

4 (44m 6s):
Yeah. So how,

1 (44m 8s):
What do you find

4 (44m 8s):

1 (44m 38s):
Everyone's asking me to come.

You should come. I know you're talking shit about moving to Austin. But listen. No, I didn't. Yeah, You didn. I watched a video.

1 (44m 45s):
No, I didn't. Don't lie.

4 (44m 47s):
You did. You did what? Say, I'm not fucking moving to Austin. I don't leave my neighborhood don. Don't go to Compton. I stay right here.

1 (44m 53s):
Can I say something? What? You know what, man? No, no. You don. You know what, man? No. You know what,

4 (45m 0s):
Man? What?

1 (45m 1s):
Listen. What? You have to understand what you guys did. What did

4 (45m 5s):
We do?

1 (45m 6s):
You guys took half of the talent out. Yeah. So I was just butt

4 (45m 11s):
Hurt. We brought another bunch in too. Like Shane Gillis lives here.

1 (45m 15s):
I know. I know. He does well. We're doing great. I know. You guys are killing it. We're having, so I went to the club last

4 (45m 20s):
Night. Come move here. I know. but it, you're more than Paul's thinking about it. Paul's here a lot.

1 (45m 24s):
I know. and I was just here. The other Theo thinking about

4 (45m 27s):
It. Theo's thinking about it, right? Yeah. They're all just worried that like, people go, oh, you move there. Suck on Rogan's nuts.

1 (45m 33s):
I would never suck your nuts.

4 (45m 34s):
I don't ask.

1 (45m 36s):
I wouldn't do it. If

4 (45m 37s):
You did, it would be a problem. Yeah. I'd be like, why are you doing this? I'd have to

1 (45m 40s):
Be asleep. Would you hurt me? No. If you, okay. We weren't camping. If I woke

4 (45m 43s):
Up and you were sucking on, I wouldn't hurt you.

1 (45m 45s):
What?

4 (45m 46s):
I would yell at you hurt

1 (45m 47s):
You. Yeah. I'd be like, what

4 (45m 49s):
The fuck, dude? That

1 (45m 50s):
Felt good. It would feel

4 (45m 51s):
I was in the middle of a dream. What if I was in the middle of a sex dream? Yeah. Yeah. And

1 (45m 54s):
You sucked my notes. I came. I'd be so mindful too, bro.

4 (45m 56s):
That would be a real problem for the

1 (45m 57s):
Rest of my life.

4 (45m 58s):
Right? Like the hardest I ever came.

1 (46m 3s):
I wouldn't do it. Didn intent. There

4 (46m 4s):
Was I was sleeping. Yeah.

1 (46m 5s):
Would

4 (46m 6s):
It Sex dream. Bobby. Lee was sucking my nuts. I don't know why he was doing it. It was just for fun. He didn't

1 (46m 11s):
Know was, I've sucked nuts before, but like, you know, I get it. Yeah. But yeah, I'm, me and Santino will maybe think, talk about it though.

4 (46m 18s):
Listen, man, it's a great place to live. It's a great place. Tax wise, a great place traffic wise. It's a great place. The most important thing is people wise. The people here are so friendly. Austin people are great people. They're really nice. They're nice. They're not shithead, they're not Hollywood people. They're not lost in this fake world of leftist ideology that everybody's trapped in. They're just people. They're just regular people, man. And those people exist outside of these, these blue bubbles where everyone's gone insane. Well, I used to be a part of the blue bobbylee. I I was 100% a left-leaning person who lived in Los Angeles. I was 100%. I never voted Republican my whole life.

4 (46m 58s):
I was very left-leaning. Especially with like any social issues when it comes to financial things. I'm a little bit more conservative, but at the end of the day, I'm way more left than I am. Right. But California went nuts, man. It's gone like full communist. It's out of its fucking mind. And their approach to law enforcement is so insane. It's so insane. The no cash bail, the letting people out for committing violent crimes. The fucking, not stopping people for stealing up to whatever money it is. What is it? $900 now? I think they raised it. I think they made it a little higher. San Francisco is non-existent. San Francisco. Most of San Francisco is emptied out of like big chain stores and big department stores.

4 (47m 43s):
Because

1 (47m 44s):
I, I wouldn't even do standup there anymore. It's crazy. They ruined it.

4 (47m 47s):
They ruined the city. Yeah. Yeah. I mean you can bring it back. The structure's still there, but you'd have to have some hardcore Rudy Giuliani type motherfucker to come in there and knock heads. Wow. And nobody wants that. Nobody wants that. They're peace, love, and granola and fucking wear a mask.

1 (48m 1s):
I'm in the middle now.

4 (48m 2s):
I'm in the middle. I'm in the

1 (48m 4s):
Middle. I never, I never thought I would've ever say that.

4 (48m 6s):
Never. Never, never.

1 (48m 7s):
It only happened in this last year. Right. Exactly. I just went, I can't do it anymore. You know what I mean? People that you thought were aligned with you are like now, now like, mad at you about shit.

4 (48m 18s):
They're in a cult. They're in a cult. It's, it's got all I mean. Mark Andreessen, who's a brilliant venture capitalist guy, explained it to me in, in, in very clear terms, like what the definition of a cult is. How you can get excommunicated, how you get shamed for having differing opinions. The group think the whole, he's like, it's a cult. And he's right. He's a hundred percent right. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. It's just hard to say, because then people in the cult will attack you. But they're not attacking you for a reasonable, it's not logical. Yeah. Like the way they're attacking you. They're attacking like somebody attacks religious beliefs. Yeah. And some of these religious beliefs. So it get, it gets into these weird gray areas, like, like trans people in women's bathrooms.

4 (49m 1s):
Like says who? Yeah. Says who? How do you know that's a real trans person? How do you not know? That's a fucking creep. They don't want to pull his dick out in front of kids. Yep. Because those are real. We

1 (49m 13s):
Spa. Yeah.

4 (49m 14s):
And if all you, that guy was a convicted sex offender. Yeah. Yeah. And he was doing that. Look, those guys are real. It doesn't mean trans people aren't real also, but those guys are fucking real. Yeah. And to even say that those guys are real. You get excommunicated. Yeah. You get treated like you are a Nazi.

1 (49m 31s):
I never even cared about

4 (49m 33s):
It. Didn't care at all. Yeah.

1 (49m 34s):
I mean, I, whatever you are, don, don't give a shit. You know what I mean? But it's like, I can't do it anymore.

4 (49m 40s):
I think it's engineered. I really

1 (49m 42s):
Do.

4 (49m 42s):
By who? By China and by Russia.

1 (49m 44s):
Oh, no. Chinese.

4 (49m 45s):
Yeah. I think what they're doing by manipulating social media manipulating algorithms. I think some of it is natural. Don't, don't get me wrong. I think some of it would have happened either way. It happened during the seventies with the hippie movement. There's always like, there's always these people that are, they want to live completely outside of the norm of conformity of society. And there's always people like that. But what's going on now is very different. And it's accentuated by social media. and I think it's accentuated by algorithms naturally. 'cause people are inclined to go towards things that upset them. But also it's, it's done purposely and I think it's done.

4 (50m 26s):
If you have enough stuff about like, whatever the thing is, whether it's Black Lives Matter, or whether it's Ukraine, or whether it's pal free Palestine from the river to the sea. If you have enough of that online, it moves the needle. And the way I described it the other day, it's like if two ships are going in a certain direction, this is a ship where people logically work through things. And this is a ship that's adjusted by the algorithm, affected by the algorithm. It just moves that much over time. This is what we're seeing. So over time, you and I who used to be on the left, are now like, where's the left? Where are you guys? You guys are so far

1 (51m 2s):
Away. Yeah. Yeah. I can't even see you.

4 (51m 4s):
Yeah. Yeah. You're outta your mind. You're, you're, you're fucking chopping dicks off and, and giving little kids. Yeah. Yeah. Hormone blockers. You have no idea what the long-term consequences are. You're ignoring the health risks. You won't even talk about the health risks. Yeah. You, you use things like gender affirming care. What are you saying? Yeah. What are you saying when you're talking about children? Yeah. Why are you just accepting this? Because it, it's a, it's a noble thing to blurt out. So everybody goes, you are on the right team. That's what it is. It's not like, oh my God, what are we doing to kids? It's not like, oh my God, what are we doing to San Francisco? It's not like, oh my God, why are we letting these violent criminals outta jail? It's like, oh my God. Why are we defunding the fucking police? Yeah. What are you doing?

4 (51m 44s):
Yeah. You can't say any of those things. You say any of those things. You're a Nazi. You said it. Yeah. I did You get nervous? No.

1 (51m 50s):
Okay.

4 (51m 51s):
I live here.

1 (51m 52s):
Right. This is

4 (51m 53s):
Texas. In Texas, 99% of the people agree with me. Even the left leaning people here are way more reasonable.

1 (51m 59s):
Even last night, there's a joke that I tell that if I say it in a liberal city, it dies. You know what I mean? And it's a, it's a joke about, you know what I mean? Down syndrome. People making love and they make up their own moves. Right. And they have, they know traditional moves. and I did it last night. It crushed both shows. and I felt like, oh, this is, you know what I mean? What I've been, I think maybe looking for

4 (52m 24s):
Well, that club is specifically designed and nurtured just for what's funny. That's it. Yeah. There is no message here unless you have a message. And it's funny and it's in there. Yeah. You, you wanna do it, that's fine. But what's valued is comedy. Just like if you go to a music show, you don't want those in between the music speeches about climate change. Shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up and play the song. Entertain Me. We want to develop standup comedy, like real standup comedy. 'cause I think it's a worthy art form. I think it's very valuable to people in terms of enjoyment and in terms of mental health and in terms of society.

4 (53m 5s):
It's, it's, it's an important part of society. Like the Lakota had a person in their tribe that was called the Hey Yoka. And Hey, Yoko was the sacred clown, and this is the person that made fun of everything. Because if you couldn't make fun of something, it was bullshit. Like, if this is one guy, oh, you can't make fun of him. Well, that's probably bullshit. He probably has a a, an dis appropriate amount. Or an inappropriate amount of power. Yeah. A disproportionate amount of influence. It's like probably some ego going on here too. If you can't mon make fun of something. Yeah. 'cause if you can make fun of something and it's not funny, then you're not funny. But if you can make fun of something and it's funny and people laugh and someone gets mad, they're the problem.

1 (53m 42s):
Yeah. They're

4 (53m 43s):
The problem.

1 (53m 43s):
And I wanna say something, I never said this before. I wanna said it now, right. Is I just, for my personal life, some of the bullying that I received was necessary for me to get to where I am now.

4 (53m 56s):
Well, you don't want it. don

1 (53m 57s):
Don't want it. No. I didn't ever want want it I know. Understand. But I, I wouldn't like go back in my past and change anything. Right.

4 (54m 3s):
I wouldn't either.

1 (54m 4s):
Yeah. Yeah. Because I feel like everything, like my dad was fucking violent as fuck, dude. Like, he would knock my mom's tooth. Ou she has a missing tooth right here. You know what I mean? And we witnessed all this trauma. Yeah. Right. And he was like, dude, it was like, it was fucking terrible. I had done e MDR on just him trauma therapy. Right. And it's like, and then, you know, I know I was a little guy in, in, in American high school and people would bully me. I lived in Minnesota. They, I thought I was an Eskimo. They'd throw ice chunks at my head. Crows would. Anyway, my point is, is that all those little things, and even in comedy, it was hard being me. This little guy. You know what I mean? Doing it. People, you know, comics would, black comics would sometimes come back to me.

1 (54m 46s):
Asians aren't funny. You know what I mean?

4 (54m 49s):
Well, there was always that knock on Asians. Yeah. Let's be honest. Like Henry Cho was like the first guy that went mainstream. I love him. He was the first guy that went mainstream. I love him, wasn't he? Yes. Ronnie Chang's fucking hilarious. I love

1 (55m 2s):
Ronnie. That dude

4 (55m 3s):
Is

1 (55m 3s):
So good. So funny. So

4 (55m 4s):
He's so funny. And he's got so much attitude on

1 (55m 6s):
Stage. John y Yon was before him. That's right. Johnny Yon. He's funny too. Yeah. He's very funny. There's

4 (55m 11s):
There, but there was a knock, you know, but dude, nobody thought that when they saw you on stage, like, you're, you're a really funny guy. You're very good.

1 (55m 21s):
Thank you.

4 (55m 21s):
Very good comic. Thank, thank

1 (55m 23s):
You.

4 (55m 23s):
You're a very good comic.

1 (55m 24s):
Yeah. and I, I also want to tell you the reason why I didn't wanna do this now is because I'm doing a special and I wanna promote it. Okay. and I thought maybe I could only do it once every five years. But then your people said that I could do it when I

4 (55m 38s):
You could do this anytime you want. Okay.

1 (55m 39s):
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I feel, I

4 (55m 41s):
Feel that. Now you

1 (55m 41s):
Have my number. I'm gonna call you. I'm gonna text you. I'm gonna, you I'm gonna call

4 (55m 44s):
Anytime you wanna,

1 (55m 45s):
It's gonna, it's gonna be great. Listen,

4 (55m 46s):
I love you.

1 (55m 46s):
I'm I love you too. Yeah. I get it all. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I get it now. I know not how it works. Yeah, yeah, yeah,

4 (55m 55s):
Yeah, yeah. But yeah,

1 (55m 56s):
I was like, I have to do one. I have to do a special. And the reason being, you really should.

4 (56m 2s):
'cause it'll also force you to write more and fuck around more. But you need a place to do that. And that's why you should move here.

1 (56m 7s):
Well, that's why I'm gonna, there's so

4 (56m 8s):
Much stage time here, dude.

1 (56m 9s):
That's why in March I talked to Adam. I'll go, I'm gonna do shows here in the little room. Let's go to do Bobby Lee New Joke Night. Let's

4 (56m 16s):
Go Bobby.

1 (56m 17s):
Lee. Yeah. Let's go. And then me and Adam are gonna do a Star Trek podcast. Oh boy. Yeah. And at that point, you're gonna gonna watch the Inner Light.

4 (56m 25s):
That's a big ask lot of asking.

1 (56m 27s):
It's 40 minutes.

4 (56m 29s):
You really think that's the best science fiction ever? Better than Alien? The first alien movie, the Sigourney Weaver.

1 (56m 34s):
But you have to think though, that it the, you know, because o obviously the budget is an alien budget, right? So it's cheesy television. Right. but it, the concept, you know, what I mean was mind blowing at the time. When I saw that in my early twenties, it blew my fucking mind. Mm. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. And it's like, I don't wanna give it away. Now. You know what I mean? Maybe I can I try to sell it to you real quick or no? No, why not?

4 (56m 58s):
I'm sure it's okay. Yeah.

1 (56m 60s):
Alright. I will say, but you are gonna watch it.

4 (57m 2s):
I'll watch that one episode that you told me

1 (57m 4s):
To watch. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. And then make fun of me about it.

4 (57m 7s):
I will.

1 (57m 7s):
Yeah. Most

4 (57m 8s):
Certainly.

1 (57m 8s):
But you also,

4 (57m 9s):
That's not the best science fiction ever. That's crazy. If

1 (57m 12s):
You Google, if you Google the best television sci-fi episode, it's that the interlock is in the top three.

4 (57m 19s):
You know what's a super underrated television sci-fi show? What? Battlestar Galactica. The new version.

1 (57m 25s):
So good.

4 (57m 26s):
So good.

1 (57m 27s):
I've seen it twice already. All the way through. It's incredible. It's incredible though.

4 (57m 30s):
It's a really good

1 (57m 31s):
Show. Yeah, yeah,

4 (57m 31s):
Yeah. Like you think of it as a science fiction show, but it's a really good, like psychology show. It's a, like the way they had it set up, it's fucking terrifying. I

1 (57m 39s):
Just got goosebumps when you said it, dude.

4 (57m 40s):
It's so good. And it's so appropriate to watch today

1 (57m 43s):
Because, and they kept jumping every hour because they're so scared. Oh my God. It was so good. and

4 (57m 47s):
It also, the combination of artificial people and real people.

1 (57m 51s):
Oh my God. It's

4 (57m 52s):
Really di because that's something that we're gonna have to navigate. They didn't have AI then. They didn't have that aspect of it worked out. You know, there wasn't like a terrifying force that they were dealing with as well. But the cys were awesome. The, the the robot murderers. Yeah. Oh my God. They terrify. And they

1 (58m 9s):
Also kept some of the old school silos too, but Yeah. But the new school ones were like, you couldn't tell. Yeah,

4 (58m 15s):
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. There was new school cys. Yeah. And old school silences. That's a great fucking show.

1 (58m 19s):
I can't believe it. I'll cry it. And you know, I love, what's it the pop pop face guy with the it

4 (58m 25s):
Oh,

1 (58m 26s):
The head guy. Yeah. What's his name

4 (58m 26s):
Was Shit. Almost

1 (58m 27s):
James Edward James Almost.

4 (58m 29s):
He's amazing. Yeah. Yeah.

1 (58m 31s):
So good in that dude. Yeah.

4 (58m 32s):
He's amazing. Yeah. It's a great fucking show. Like great acting, great stories, great special effects. It really flew under the radar. I think it was on like FX or something like that.

1 (58m 43s):
Sci-fi channel, sci-fi sci-fi channel. That's what it was.

4 (58m 45s):
So people, like, not enough people were on that channel. But

1 (58m 47s):
Now you know that I saw it. Right. I'm telling you, the inner light rivals it. Hmm.

4 (58m 54s):
Rivals. Okay. That's more reasonable.

1 (58m 55s):
You, you watch it and go. Okay. That's like the same kind of feel.

4 (58m 58s):
Ri rivals is reasonable. Yeah. What's your favorite sci-fi movie?

1 (59m 3s):
Oh shit. In terms of like entertainment? Yeah. What?

4 (59m 6s):
Like,

1 (59m 7s):
All that. Just loved my favorite sci-fi Aliens is one of the original. Al Alien was good one. Yeah. Because, you know, Harry Dean Stanton was great. I'm like the cat. Here's what I loved about it. The cast was so believable.

4 (59m 18s):
Oh yeah. Yeah. And that was also the first time there was like a female action star that you didn't feel like they were shoehorning it in your face. That, that she's female. She was stuck in that role. That's not the role she wanted. Yeah. You know, she wasn't some like badass. Yeah. She was someone rising to the occasion becoming a badass in the face of this horrific thing. Yeah. That killed everybody else on our spaceship. Spoiler alert.

1 (59m 44s):
1979. Yeah. Yeah. They also felt like real truckers almost like, you know, the ship lived lived in Right. Right. Orly almost, you know? Yeah. Yeah. It was fucking amazing. It's

4 (59m 53s):
A great movie. It's

1 (59m 54s):
A great movie. Movie. but it's aliens too.

4 (59m 57s):
Not as good. Not

1 (59m 57s):
As good. But still entertaining.

4 (59m 59s):
Different kind of movie that was like, the aliens were easy to kill all of a sudden. And there was like a lot of 'em.

1 (1h 0m 4s):
All right. Yeah. Well, they're Marines zone.

4 (1h 0m 6s):
Yeah. but it doesn't matter. The the aliens were so the alien, the first one was so clever and so fast and so sneaky.

1 (1h 0m 12s):
Oh

4 (1h 0m 12s):
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then all of a sudden they're not all of a sudden they're just fucking idiots. They just running at you like, like the, the British with the fucking white cross on their chest target mark.

1 (1h 0m 21s):
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4 (1h 0m 22s):
It didn't make any sense. It's like their characteristics were completely different. They were the dumb aliens. Yeah. And then the big one, the big female, the mama. The, the, the queen.

1 (1h 0m 31s):
That was fun. She

4 (1h 0m 32s):
Should have fucked Seig Gordy weaver up like that. It didn't make any sense.

1 (1h 0m 36s):
Oh, okay. With that

4 (1h 0m 37s):
Still you bitch with the robot thing. Your whole body's exposed. Poke now you're dead. Whatcha talking

1 (1h 0m 43s):
About? Okay. Okay.

4 (1h 0m 44s):
And why is it moving so slow? All the, all the above. It should have been. Well,

1 (1h 0m 47s):
She's like, she's has babies in her belly already. Ever I know.

4 (1h 0m 49s):
You ever see a praying mantis kill a hummingbird?

1 (1h 0m 53s):
I don't watch stuff like that. Man.

4 (1h 0m 55s):
You should watch that. 'cause the praying mantis is like the, a human or the earth-like equivalent of what one of those alien things are. The alien thing's. An enormous praying mantis. Probably even more violent and more deadly. and I. Just don't buy Sigourney Weaver with a stupid fucking robot crane suit on kicking its ass.

1 (1h 1m 15s):
Does it make me a pussy when I watch Planet Earth and I see a lion chase a gazelle or whatever, and I fast forward.

4 (1h 1m 22s):
No. You just don't wanna see the suffering.

1 (1h 1m 24s):
I don't wanna see it. What does that make me weak though? No.

4 (1h 1m 26s):
No. It's not weak. You just don't wanna experience it. Yeah. I

1 (1h 1m 29s):
Don't wanna experience it.

4 (1h 1m 30s):
You know what it is. You've seen it

1 (1h 1m 31s):
Before. Yeah. I've seen it happen.

4 (1h 1m 32s):
You don't have to see a lion eating a fucking gazelle guts first over and over and over again. Yeah. Or hyenas. The the hyenas ones or the, or the wild dog ones. Those are the ruthless ones. Yeah. Those crazy. Yeah. Because they're pulling the guts out while the thing's trying to stand up. That's good. That's good.

1 (1h 1m 47s):
Yeah.

4 (1h 1m 47s):
Fuck man. Yeah. The least the lions kill you first lion. The cats always kill you. They don't just eat you. Cats grab you by the neck and they fucking kill you. Wow. But dogs, wild dogs and hyenas and bears, they just start eating you.

1 (1h 2m 2s):
And then the alligator, you have to do twirl with them.

4 (1h 2m 4s):
Yeah. You might not,

1 (1h 2m 5s):
You do a little dance,

4 (1h 2m 5s):
You might not die for an hour. You might with an alligator with a lot of different creatures.

1 (1h 2m 10s):
Well, oh really? Depends

4 (1h 2m 11s):
On what Well, alligators will take you underwater. They'll drown you. 'cause they want, they wanna stuff you under a log so you can rot. Yeah. So you're easier to consume.

1 (1h 2m 19s):
What, what animal could I think I, I could survive. You think

4 (1h 2m 22s):
A mouse maybe a mouse maybe.

1 (1h 2m 26s):
No,

4 (1h 2m 26s):
A really angry mouse. You'd probably, you you'd probably run into a wall. Well,

1 (1h 2m 30s):
With a bear, maybe.

4 (1h 2m 33s):
Hmm? You don't think so? A bear? Yeah.

1 (1h 2m 35s):
But I would just not freeze

4 (1h 2m 36s):
Don. Don't think that works. Freezing.

1 (1h 2m 37s):
Doesn't work.

4 (1h 2m 38s):
Depends on why they're there.

1 (1h 2m 40s):
Alright. If they're

4 (1h 2m 41s):
There to eat you, no, that's not gonna work. Right. If they're there to scare you away from their children, yeah. Maybe, maybe

1 (1h 2m 46s):
It'll work. But do you know what to do?

4 (1h 2m 48s):
No. There's no what to do. There's not a lot to do

1 (1h 2m 51s):
Because when you go to Hawaii and you swim with the shark, they give you rules. Work You don don't splash.

4 (1h 2m 55s):
You hear about that kid that was just in the shark tank was in The Bahamas. You got bit, they, they, they had some shark tank experience and some kid got bit by a shark. Some kid I think from Maryland.

1 (1h 3m 6s):
Really? Yeah.

4 (1h 3m 7s):
Don't fuck around, man. They don't know that it's a shark tank. They just, they're sharks. They're sharks. Yeah. And a bear is like to think you know what to do. Maybe, maybe if you spray it with pepper spray, it'll run away. Maybe, maybe it won't. Maybe if you shoot it, you'll stop it in its tracks. Or maybe you only have like a nine millimeter and you could pump it full of 4, 5, 6 holes and it still tears you apart.

1 (1h 3m 31s):
Wow.

4 (1h 3m 32s):
Yeah. You, you, if you're gonna shoot it with a gun, you want a large caliber rifle. You want like a 300 win mag? Yeah. Yeah. You want something big something. Boom, boom. Yeah. You wanna put large holes in that gigantic monster predator. What

1 (1h 3m 48s):
About sword? No. No. You're fucked. Fuck. Fuck. Okay. Able.

4 (1h 3m 54s):
Okay. You won't even, you'll fucking bounce it off its nose and it just get mad at you.

1 (1h 3m 58s):
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4 (1h 3m 59s):
You'll miss, you'll panic. It's just hard. The, the speed that it moves at will astound all your senses. You'll, you'll panic because you'll realize You don't have the reaction time. You You don't have the physical movement time capable of dealing with how fast it's coming at you. Yeah. You, you, your body doesn't work good enough

1 (1h 4m 15s):
To do that. You know, I would go, I would run toward it and just get it over with.

4 (1h 4m 19s):
That might work.

1 (1h 4m 20s):
I'll just run and I'll just jump right into the head. Maybe

4 (1h 4m 22s):
It depends on where it bites you. The thing about those things is they don't necessarily kill, they just hold down and eat. They just hold you down

1 (1h 4m 30s):
And start eating. Alright. Okay.

4 (1h 4m 31s):
You know Grizzly man, that documentary? Oh

1 (1h 4m 33s):
Yeah, I saw it. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. That,

4 (1h 4m 34s):
That video where the lens cap was on where they have an audio of him dying. It's like,

1 (1h 4m 39s):
It's so horrifying. I know. It's like

4 (1h 4m 41s):
Five minutes long. Yeah. Five minutes of that thing. Eating him alive.

1 (1h 4m 47s):
Five

4 (1h 4m 47s):
Minutes is

1 (1h 4m 48s):
So long. It's

4 (1h 4m 49s):
So long before you're dead. Yeah. You gotta think of how long it is that something just weighs a thousand pounds. Putting its paw on your chest and just pulling your guts out screaming, eating

1 (1h 4m 60s):
You dick first. It's like, I bombed for five minutes and it seems like 20 minutes. Right. Imagine

4 (1h 5m 3s):
Getting eating.

1 (1h 5m 4s):
Oh my god. Right. Forever. Yeah. Oh my God. Do you bomb anymore?

4 (1h 5m 9s):
Oh, bomb. A joke will bomb. Yeah.

1 (1h 5m 10s):
Yeah.

4 (1h 5m 11s):
We also do bottom of the barrel, you know, bottom of the barrel. No. Is like one of those shows where the audience has suggestions and you reach into the barrel and pull out the suggestions and then you just riff and I. I bombed on no shows.

1 (1h 5m 22s):
Oh really? Yeah.

4 (1h 5m 23s):
You can't, sometimes there's no suggestion. Yeah. Sometimes it's like green sneakers.

1 (1h 5m 28s):
Oh my. That's so

4 (1h 5m 29s):
Hard. The fuck am I gonna do with this? Yeah.

1 (1h 5m 30s):
Because

4 (1h 5m 31s):
Sometimes people are trying to trip you up. Sometimes people have good suggestions. Yeah. Some of 'em are actually like, almost in the form of jokes. Like some of 'em are really funny.

1 (1h 5m 38s):
Wow. Yeah.

4 (1h 5m 39s):
So

1 (1h 5m 39s):
You, you just randomly pull out a topic just randomly. Yeah. And the audience fills it out.

4 (1h 5m 43s):
Exactly. Wow. And it's like, sometimes it's an amazing premise factory because sometimes, 'cause you're on the spot like that, every now and then an idea will pop into your head. You're like, oh shit. That's a bit.

1 (1h 5m 53s):
Yeah.

4 (1h 5m 53s):
And then that bit you get home and you listen to it and you write it down. Like, there's three or four bits that I've gotten that are actual bits now because of that show.

1 (1h 6m 2s):
I, I wanna admit to something to you right now, if I may. I do. I wanna admit something to you right now if I may. Okay. The reason why I haven't done a special is 'cause of the fear of doing new shit.

4 (1h 6m 17s):
Yeah. of course. Of course.

1 (1h 6m 21s):
It's shameful. I, I get

4 (1h 6m 23s):
Yeah. But this idea that you have of a Bobby Lee new joke night, that's

1 (1h 6m 26s):
Forcing myself to do it. Perfect. Yeah. Yeah. Perfect. Perfect.

4 (1h 6m 29s):
Because,

1 (1h 6m 30s):
You know, when you guys left the store and I don't wanna make fun of I I and I. I love all the comics, dude. But it's like, you know, sometimes when the headliners, like the guys with names leave town for the weekends. You look some of the lineups there, you know what I mean. And so when I'm, they're not as strong. So when I'm in town, I'm in the main room. I have the prime spot, it's packed. I have this fucking pressure to crush

4 (1h 6m 56s):
Of course.

1 (1h 6m 57s):
You know, because I just know that they're there to see me. Yeah. and I wanna give them a good show. Well,

4 (1h 7m 1s):
You could do sets other places too, you know, do sets other places. Go to the ha ha fuck around with the ice house. Go to Flappers. Go fuck around in other spots.

1 (1h 7m 10s):
Flappers. Yeah.

4 (1h 7m 12s):
I know you're saying that, but it's like, yeah. Go up there. It's a, it's a crowd. The humans. Yeah. You know, fuck around. Burr fucks around there.

1 (1h 7m 19s):
Oh wow. Yeah. Yeah.

4 (1h 7m 20s):
Bur likes to do that. He likes to go to the ice house or fuck around there. Yeah. You gotta kind of fuck around. You gotta, you gotta like, come up with ideas and, and sit down. Like, like last night I was, I told myself I'm gonna go to bed early, but I was in front of the computer at 10 o'clock and I was like, I'll, I'll stop at 12 and I'll go to bed. Mm. But then I caught an idea. I caught an idea and I wrote it out till like three 30 in the morning. I was just writing. Wow. And when I do that, I'm like, okay, that was productive. Even though I'm tired and I woke up late today, even though I'm tired, I'm like, but that was productive. Wow. And if I can force myself to do that three, four times a week, and sometimes, dude, I'll just sit in front of that fucking computer and it's just nonsense.

4 (1h 7m 60s):
It's just nonsense. It's nothing. It's embarrassing. It's terrible. Yeah. It's nothing to this. I'm trying to work it out. You know, I'll fucking take a little of that. Go over it again. Hmm.

1 (1h 8m 10s):
But

4 (1h 8m 10s):
When you, and sometimes nothing, sometimes I got nothing. But when

1 (1h 8m 13s):
You write something though and you look at it, right. Do you go, okay, this is like a 60%. Like do you do that?

4 (1h 8m 19s):
It totally depends. It depends. Sometimes it's like a hundred percent. Some, some bits, like as I write them, that's exactly how I perform them. It's done not norm, not normal, but it happens. Yeah. And then some bits are just seeds. It's just a seed. and I gotta throw that bitch on stage and see where it goes. Yeah. And sometimes it doesn't go anywhere. Right. Sometimes I think it's like Ron White was telling the story the other day about this joke that he had that he thought was really funny. Yeah. And he had planned, I had it planned in my mind when it was gonna be applause break. He goes, he got fucking nothing. Yeah.

1 (1h 8m 49s):
Yeah. It happens. Yeah, it does. Yeah. But

4 (1h 8m 52s):
That's the beauty of creation, because every now and then, like I have, I have this new bit that's killing and it's so exciting to get to it because it's like, this is like, this bit is alive. It's like, it just, it was just born and it's just flexing, you know? It's fun. Yeah,

1 (1h 9m 7s):
Yeah, yeah.

4 (1h 9m 8s):
It's fun. but it's, it's also, it's hard. But you gotta, you know, you gotta pay devotion to the muse to sit down and, and try to like, let the ideas come to you. If you don't have a moment where you're just sitting down and just letting the ideas come to you, you're gonna miss those ideas. And some people say, oh, I only write on stage. I only write with my friends. That's great. You should do that too. Mm. But there's nothing wrong with like sitting, it's not gonna hurt you to sit in front of a computer and go over your ideas. And every now and then, maybe every two times or five times, every 10 times you sit in front of that computer or that notebook, something pops up that wouldn't have popped up without it.

1 (1h 9m 48s):
Yeah. And

4 (1h 9m 49s):
You gotta like suffer through the ones that suck, that drudge of not being able to come up with anything.

1 (1h 9m 57s):
My problem is, I do, I have these second addictions. I have like video games.

4 (1h 10m 2s):
Right. And your front of the computer, you start playing video games. Yeah.

1 (1h 10m 5s):
And I'll just start playing star Starfield or something. Of course. And 16 hours later I'm on a planet and I'm making an outpost. Right. Yeah. and I feel guilt. Right. Or I'll play Star D Valley, I'll create a farm. Yeah. Right. And it's, but it's a haunting thing. Like, what the fuck are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? Right.

4 (1h 10m 21s):
You're wasting your

1 (1h 10m 21s):
Time. I'm wasting my time. I know this. Yeah. But for the same reason, I can convince myself.

4 (1h 10m 26s):
But here's the thing. Yeah. If you do the work first, like say if you sit down, you say, I can only play computer games if I write a thousand words. Ah. So when you get to a thousand on a Word document, you look at the bottom, it'll tell you how many words you've written and then you can stop.

1 (1h 10m 43s):
That's what I'm gonna do.

4 (1h 10m 44s):
Yeah. Just earn it. Earn it that way. You'll actually enjoy it that way when you're playing the games, it won't be in your head, oh my God, I should be writing, oh my God, I should be doing something else. And by the way, it doesn't have to be, you write something funny, you could just write something about something and then try to extract funny things out of it. Mm. Like you could just write a story about like how violent your dad was. Like that what you just told me. Which is horrific. Right? Yeah. You, if you wrote that out, I guarantee you there's gonna be a seed of something in there. Something, it might even not even be about your dad being violent. It'd be, maybe it'd be about how you react to violence or maybe how you react to, you know, angry people.

4 (1h 11m 27s):
I just want everybody to be nice. You could find like a premise in there. Mm. So just write an essay. Just write an essay and write an essay with no expectation of whether or not it's gonna be funny.

1 (1h 11m 37s):
Yeah. I used to do morning pages. Mm. You ever do that?

4 (1h 11m 41s):
No. Just get up in the morning and write.

1 (1h 11m 42s):
Right. When you wake up, apparently when you just, you just start writing. That's

4 (1h 11m 45s):
Supposed to be the best time to write. Yeah.

1 (1h 11m 47s):
Well, You don't have those like filters and stuff like this sucks. Just freely write it and then just pages of it. Yeah. Couple, maybe a couple. You know what I mean? Yeah. And then later you look at it, you know what I mean. Maybe I'll start doing that again. don don't fucking know

4 (1h 11m 59s):
That. That's how most writers do when they write. They write in the morning and then they go for a walk. A lot of 'em do. And they listen to some of their notes and they'll, they'll go over the idea that they wrote down and they'll take voice notes while they're walking. There's something about walking, they say, because it's like a very mild aerobic exercise. So it stimulates your circulation. It gets everything flowing. It, you actually think a little bit better when you're walking.

1 (1h 12m 22s):
Oh, okay. Because

4 (1h 12m 22s):
It's real. It's a, it's, you're not tired. It's a mild thing. So you just out there walking and your heart is pumping and you're not sitting there sedentary. Just trying to think. You're actually walking around.

1 (1h 12m 33s):
Okay, I'll try hiking then.

4 (1h 12m 35s):
Yeah. Hiking's good. Hiking is good. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Hike after you, then you'll really have earned your video games. Right, right. Yeah. And then hike and think, think about what you write and then you, when you play, you'll be playing for fun. You'll be

1 (1h 12m 48s):
Enjoying it. So from this day forth, from this day forth, I'm gonna wake up, I'm making an announcement. I'm gonna wake up, I'm gonna write for an hour. Okay. Right. Hike. And then I'm gonna play video games.

4 (1h 12m 60s):
I'm gonna see you four months from now. You're gonna be cracked out with a cling on knife. You went off the rails.

1 (1h 13m 8s):
It was too much pressure. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I

4 (1h 13m 10s):
Was getting up every morning I was riding and I was hiking and it was just too much. Yeah.

1 (1h 13m 13s):
No, I and

4 (1h 13m 14s):
My fish died.

1 (1h 13m 15s):
I have to do it because now it's, it's incredible. Like, you know, when I do shows with Sura or me and Andrew, you know, because I'm on a, a podcast called Bad. Friends. It's

4 (1h 13m 24s):
A funny

1 (1h 13m 24s):
Podcast. Thank you. You guys

4 (1h 13m 25s):
Are good. Together. I wanna talk to you about an episode that I saw. But you, you having to go to Israel, was that on that or was that somewhere else?

1 (1h 13m 32s):
It was that.

4 (1h 13m 33s):
What was that like? Tell me what happened. God, do you not wanna talk about it? I can do it

1 (1h 13m 38s):
Because I, I'm not saying anything that's like wrong, it's just something that happened. No. So I get a call from Steve Byrne.

4 (1h 13m 45s):
Okay.

1 (1h 13m 46s):
And Steve goes, you wanna go to Israel?

4 (1h 13m 48s):
How long ago was this?

1 (1h 13m 52s):
14 years ago maybe. Oh,

4 (1h 13m 54s):
Oh, okay. Yeah. Okay.

1 (1h 13m 55s):
1214 I, don Dunno. and I go, why don don't wanna do a show there? And he goes, no. You know, I got a call and he, they're flying out a bunch of comedians and actors and it's a free trip. and I go, why? don don't know. They just wanna show us the country and their culture. And you get nice hotels, free meals, and you get a tour of like,

4 (1h 14m 19s):
Are you not performing nothing? No. Okay.

1 (1h 14m 21s):
So I went there with Jamie Chung, Brian Greenberg, their actors, and Steve Lopez went out. George Lopez. Okay. And we went out there, and then when we got there, they were like, welcome. We're like, thanks. And they were like, but every day you have to tweet how great Israel is

4 (1h 14m 39s):
Every day. Yeah.

1 (1h 14m 41s):
Like, put out a tweet.

4 (1h 14m 42s):
They told you you have to, and they didn't say anything about that before you left.

1 (1h 14m 45s):
Don don't remember them saying it before.

4 (1h 14m 48s):
But they might've.

1 (1h 14m 49s):
They could've.

4 (1h 14m 50s):
Right. Maybe they said it to Steve and Steve conveniently left it out.

1 (1h 14m 53s):
Don don't know. But I, I just, I do know that I, I feel, I feel like if they did say it, that I would've questioned it.

4 (1h 14m 59s):
Right.

1 (1h 14m 60s):
You know what I

4 (1h 15m 0s):
Mean?

1 (1h 15m 1s):
Yeah.

4 (1h 15m 1s):
So, I don't know if you're aware, so this is the early days of Twitter, right? Yeah. So when was t Twitter's only like 12 years old.

1 (1h 15m 9s):
It was 10 years ago then I don't know

4 (1h 15m 10s):
How long, how old's Twitter? Oh, there it is. 2006 Israel unfiltered. So 2006,

1 (1h 15m 16s):
Steve.

4 (1h 15m 17s):
Yeah. Yeah. Look at that. So

1 (1h 15m 18s):
2006, when was that? Look at your

4 (1h 15m 19s):
Face. Yeah.

1 (1h 15m 21s):
Like I was like, I have to tweet. Yeah. Yeah. But here's what happened. As soon as I tweeted the first thing I already knew, like, oh my God, I think I'm in trouble. Why?

4 (1h 15m 32s):
What'd you say?

1 (1h 15m 33s):
I just said Israel's great. They're beautiful people. You know what I mean?

4 (1h 15m 37s):
Okay.

1 (1h 15m 37s):
And then like, it was just like, and they flew us out here for free. And then you would just get a thousand, like, you know what I mean? That, that were like, you know, Palestinian, you know, oh. And going, you mother, you know, and it was like negative, negative, negative. And there was these gigantic wars that would go on in the comment section. Oh boy. It just got really uncomfortable. And then I just remember, you know, yeah. There I

4 (1h 16m 1s):
Am at you nice hat. Yeah. You should wear that all the time.

1 (1h 16m 5s):
I know I look cute with a

4 (1h 16m 6s):
Is that the famous wall? That's

1 (1h 16m 8s):
The wall. Yeah.

4 (1h 16m 8s):
What it feel like to be around that wall? That wall's old as fuck. Right? Yeah. How old's that wall?

1 (1h 16m 13s):
I put a note in it.

4 (1h 16m 15s):
Wow. You

1 (1h 16m 15s):
Could write little letter of, you know what I mean? Letters to Jesus.

4 (1h 16m 18s):
Yeah.

1 (1h 16m 19s):
Yeah. and I just, you put it in there. Dear Jesus. When you come out, I think mine was like, let me get more pussy or whatever, but nice. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But like

4 (1h 16m 24s):
That wall, how old is that wall looking?

1 (1h 16m 26s):
19

4 (1h 16m 26s):
Bc. 19 bc.

1 (1h 16m 28s):
Yeah. Wow. But then toward the end, I was just like, I gotta get the fuck outta here. I think. Yeah. I was like,

4 (1h 16m 34s):
How many tweets did you make? And did you kept going after they were attacking you?

1 (1h 16m 39s):
Yeah, I think so. Yeah.

4 (1h 16m 41s):
You have to. Yeah. Otherwise you don't get your hotel. Yeah.

1 (1h 16m 43s):
It was like a free thing Whatcha gonna do? and I didn't know the significance of it until later. Almost like, you know what I mean? The significance, but like what the impact of it, you know? Right. Because I, I, you know, obviously, you know, I mean, obviously I have my opinions about it, you know what I mean that I, I'm keeping to myself. But it's like, you know, it's not all fully aligned. You know what I mean with what people think that I should be, you know, you have to be careful because I live in LA and you know. Oh,

4 (1h 17m 11s):
I hear you. Yeah. Look, it's a complicated issue.

1 (1h 17m 13s):
It's so complicated

4 (1h 17m 14s):
And it's terrifying. Yeah. It's ter when you look at the video of when they do a, an overhead of what Gaza used to look like and what it looks like now,

1 (1h 17m 21s):
It, it, I just

4 (1h 17m 22s):
I mean, it's just

1 (1h 17m 23s):
I know. It's just, it's

4 (1h 17m 24s):
Insane. It's fucking insane. Saw

6 (1h 17m 27s):
Yesterday. It's gonna take over a year to clean up just the rubble.

4 (1h 17m 31s):
Oh

1 (1h 17m 31s):
My God. But it's like 25,000 now. At least. At least

4 (1h 17m 35s):
They don't know how many people are dead. They have no idea. And just the, and half the population is women and children

1 (1h 17m 41s):
And the trauma and the fucking, you know, famine. It's just, it's just, I just can't even comprehend it. Really.

4 (1h 17m 50s):
Yeah. And the Israelis tell you that it's necessary and that they, they have to get rid of Hamas and this is the way to do it.

1 (1h 17m 57s):
But just I mean. I believe that. I believe. I believe that. I believe that maybe that that's should be, but I think the approach could be different.

4 (1h 18m 5s):
Yeah. I don know. I don't have any expertise in war neither. But I'm horrified that they can just shoot missiles into buildings and they tell people to get out, but then they bomb the areas where they're going to I mean the whole thing's nuts, man. It's nuts. And it's so dangerous. It's so dangerous. These free Palestine marches that are happening all over the world. Those are all organized too, by the way. Mm. Those, those, when you get on social media and you see the free Palestine people and the pro-Israel people, what percentage of those people are bots? Right. It's not zero. It's not zero. There's a lot of what's getting stirred up, A lot of the hateful things that are being said.

4 (1h 18m 46s):
A lot of the crazy things that are being said, I guarantee you a lot of that's being instigated by foreign countries. And that's what's scary about social media and the influence it has on people and the way they feel about a particular issue. And that's on top of the horrific nature of the issue itself. Bolt of October 7th, which is undeniably horrific. Horrific. And then this, and then on top of that, you have this open antisemitism that we never saw before where it's just open everywhere. It's wild.

1 (1h 19m 17s):
It's fucking terrible. It's so

4 (1h 19m 18s):
Scary,

1 (1h 19m 19s):
Man. But it's also an issue that will never be resolved.

4 (1h 19m 23s):
But it's not just that it'll never be resolved. Like I never thought it was going to be an issue where the presidents of like major universities were standing in front of Congress and they were justifying people saying death to the Jews. That it wasn't harassment unless it was actionable.

1 (1h 19m 37s):
I'm tell you. That's insane. Yeah. Like what?

4 (1h 19m 39s):
Like what? And then when, when the congresswoman was trying to exp get them to expand on that, do you mean actual genocide then? It's harassment when they commit actual

1 (1h 19m 47s):
Genocide. I I, I, yeah. What

4 (1h 19m 48s):
The fuck are you saying? Yeah, but it's the same thing we were talking about. It's the cult. They're in that leftist cult and it's not reasonable. It doesn't make any sense. It's all crazy. Oh.

1 (1h 19m 58s):
And when they were like Osama bin LA and could have been Ryan or whatever that, do you remember that fucking trend? Oh yeah. Fucking insane. What are you talking about? And these are people, right? That weren't there. I was there.

4 (1h 20m 11s):
That's a TikTok thing too, by the way. Yeah. Osama bin LA America

1 (1h 20m 14s):
In 2000. Right. Or two. When 2000, 2001, I was on Mad TV. Nine 11 happened. I went to work the next day. Andrew Daley, one of the actors, his cousin was on one of the flights. Oh, Jesus. Right. and I, I could feel the pain. Right. And, you know, we, we were inundated with the, the, the fucking footage. Yeah. And just in the moment it was fucking horrifying. Yeah. It it changed America a hundred percent. Yeah. A hundred percent. And now people that weren't even around then kids, which is fine, but now they have these grand ideas about, it's insane. Well,

4 (1h 20m 50s):
It's also what, where did Osama Bin Laden come from? Well, he came from the CIA funding them, the mujahideen to fight against the Soviet Union. Mm. They were trained. They were trained by Americans. Yeah. Yeah. Look, there's a certain reality to American imperialism. It doesn't do anybody any good to deny it. Yeah. We have military bases. You're right.

1 (1h 21m 10s):
Yeah. Everywhere. You're right. Yeah. If

4 (1h 21m 12s):
You were a foreign country in a nationalistic foreign country, of course you'd hate America. Of course you'd hate what we do I mean, look at what's going on right now with this Ukraine, Russia thing. Look at how much money's being funneled through that. How insane amounts of money. Yeah.

1 (1h 21m 27s):
And most of it's like embezzled. Right.

4 (1h 21m 29s):
Who fucking knows? but it again, it's not zero. It's not 0%. Yeah. It's getting embezzled. Mm. And the fact that all of a sudden no one wanted to admit that Ukraine had always been a very corrupt country. There's a crazy Twitter exchange between Candace Owens and the New York Times, where Candace Owens was talking about how corrupt Ukraine is. And then the New York Times says to her like, what evidence do you have that Ukraine is corrupt? She goes, oh, you mean the links from your fucking newspaper? And just from like 2016 and before that, there's all these fucking stories about how corrupt Ukraine is in the New York Times. They didn't even bother looking it up because when you're in the cult, the cult says, you support Ukraine.

4 (1h 22m 10s):
Do you want Ukraine to win or do you want Russia to win? Like, what the fuck are you even saying? Yeah. How much do you know about why this thing was instigated in the first place? How much do you know about nato, about how much they're moving arms closer to the Soviet Union about how Ukraine joining NATO was always a red flag. Do you, do you know?

1 (1h 22m 29s):
I don't know. I don't know nothing.

4 (1h 22m 29s):
No. Most people that are talking about it don't know either. I don't know nothing. That was the red line that you could not cross you Ukraine, joining Russia or joining nato, rather. The whole thing's fucking terrifying because we're dealing with nuclear superpowers. When Xi Jinping tells bidet that Taiwan will join China again. Like that means they're gonna take Taiwan. What are we gonna do if they take Taiwan? Are are we gonna? And then Bidet says, we're not gonna do anything. Like, okay. First he said, we're gonna stop them now. He says, we're not gonna do anything. Like, oh my God. And he's only saying whatever the fuck they write down for him. The whole thing's nuts. It's like, who's deciding what happens and doesn't happen?

4 (1h 23m 10s):
It's not that guy. Right. So if it's not him, who the fuck is it? Is it the Secretary of State? Is it, is it the press secretary who's, who's, is it the military industrial complex? Are they completely at the helm? Will they ever let control of that wheel to anybody else now that they have it? Is

1 (1h 23m 25s):
This the, is this the shit you think about when you lay in bed at night? Yeah. How the fuck do you

4 (1h 23m 31s):
Sleep? Sometimes I don't. Yeah. Yeah. That's, that's a real problem at night. Yeah. At night. I have my most anxiety filled moments about this stuff. I, I've talked about it openly. Wow. But I'll really freakout at night because I, I legitimately think we are one or two events away from living in the stone age again. and I think it could happen in our lifetime and it could happen to you and I. Like, I'm, I'm really convinced that the fabric of society is way more fragile than anyone appreciates. Yeah. That most people appreciate rather

1 (1h 24m 2s):
I mean. I feel it in the air.

4 (1h 24m 3s):
Yeah. Well you saw it during the George Floyd Times in la

1 (1h 24m 6s):
Oh yeah. I felt it. Yeah.

4 (1h 24m 7s):
Yeah. That was mad Max times, right. When they were burning those cop cars on the highway and I. I remember seeing that going, I gotta get the fuck outta here. Yeah. This ain't gonna get better.

1 (1h 24m 15s):
Was it that or Covid that made me both those things and the money probably like taxes.

4 (1h 24m 20s):
No, that was not even in consideration. Taxes. It was nice, but it was the freedom. It was these fucking dipshits, like the mayor of Los Angeles telling everybody what businesses they can and can't have open. Mm. What's essential and non-essential, like says who. Yeah. And after a while when a bunch of people had had Covid I, and then gotten over it and they were fine. I was like, well, wait a minute. Like how, how scary is this? And why are we closing everything down? Why aren't we giving people choice? I, and when it never opened,

1 (1h 24m 47s):
I bought into it. Of course you did. I didn't even leave the house for two fucking years. Mm. I didn't even go to the grocery store and I had to spray. I had to spray everything down. Doritos spraying it with it was insane.

4 (1h 24m 59s):
Well, my whole family got it early on. Yeah. Before there was anything, before there was a vaccine, before there was anything. and I didn't get it. and I didn't do anything different. I hugged my kids, I fucked my wife, I hung out with them. I just took care of myself. Yeah.

1 (1h 25m 12s):
You've had a Covid though, right? Yeah, I got

4 (1h 25m 14s):
It eventually.

1 (1h 25m 15s):
Yeah. Yeah. I got it too. Yeah.

4 (1h 25m 16s):
I got it when the Delta variant was around. I got it when I was doing arenas in Florida. Mm. and I was gone. I got it because I was hanging out with my friend John Schulman. my friend John Schulman is a, a buddy of mine who makes pool cues and he lives right there. and I got to see him after the show. And we played pool till like three 30 in the morning. and I was exhausted. I had like fucking five margaritas and then I got sick. Yeah. But even then, it wasn't that bad. But my point is like, my whole family got it. and I didn't get it.

1 (1h 25m 42s):
They, they, they weren't vaccinated?

4 (1h 25m 44s):
No. No, there was no vaccine back

1 (1h 25m 45s):
Then. Okay. So yeah.

4 (1h 25m 46s):
And I didn't do anything different, man. Yeah. I, I remember I worked out two days where I was tired and I realized I was fighting something off. Like there was two days where I was in the gym. I was like, you know what, I'm just gonna go through the motions here. I'm just gonna lift lightweights and just like let my body like break a little bit of a sweat, but no exertion, just get some circulation going. So I did like some, some kettlebell exercises, like 35 pounds. Nothing strenuous. Yeah. Like just nice and light and just get the body moving. And then the next day I went back in the gym. I feel the same, same thing today, same thing. Did some pushups, did some chin-ups, nothing crazy. Like five rep reps of five chin up and not just a little bit of exercise, nothing strenuous.

4 (1h 26m 28s):
And then the next day I felt great. The next day I had a full regular workout. So whatever it was, I fought it off. And so then I was like, well what, what is at play here? How much of it, how much of can your immune system stop this? Or is it something that you 100% get? No, it seems very infectious. but it also think seems like if you have a healthy immune system, this isn't a death sentence. This isn't Ebola, this isn't so what the fuck is going on. And then the vaccine came out and I signed up to get vaccinated. The UFC had this whole allotment of vaccines. But I was there on a Friday for the UFC and they said, you have to go to the clinic. and I said, I can't don don't have the time. They said, can you come back Monday? I said, no, but I'll be back in two weeks.

4 (1h 27m 8s):
So I was gonna get vaccinated in two weeks. And in the two weeks they pulled it, they pulled the Johnson and Johnson from blood clots. And two people I knew got strokes. Two people. Oh my

1 (1h 27m 17s):
God. Two people.

4 (1h 27m 18s):
Wow. Within the 10 days of taking that vaccine, two people I knew had strokes.

1 (1h 27m 23s):
Yeah.

4 (1h 27m 23s):
Like healthy people, like weird blood clots. People were getting blood clots.

1 (1h 27m 28s):
Weird people like that. I mean I mean, it is true that if you were older though, like it's 70 and you had some sort of like, you know what I mean? Comorbidity, what's the word

4 (1h 27m 36s):
Called? Comorbidities.

1 (1h 27m 37s):
Comorbidity. Right. That they could die. Right. I mean that's a true thing, right? Like Herman Kane, he died.

4 (1h 27m 43s):
Oh

1 (1h 27m 43s):
Yeah,

4 (1h 27m 43s):
Yeah, yeah. Look, they die of the flu too. I mean it's a bad cold. Yeah. Yeah. It's not dismissing what, what it is, but it's dismissing this control that all of a sudden the me the medical industrial complex and the government has over you and your job and your choices in your life. Yeah. For something that now they admit they could have never contained. That it was never gonna stop transmission. That it was never gonna stop infection. It was all just lies. They lied about the efficacy, they lied about the protection in parts. They put, they put it out on MSN, bbc, Rachel Maddow, the virus stops with you. You can't get it. It's not true. It was not true. There was no, there was no evidence that it did that. Yeah. Not only was there no evidence, they never even tested it for transmission.

4 (1h 28m 24s):
Wow. They just tested it to try to see if it makes antibodies. But what

1 (1h 28m 26s):
Scared me was when Michael, yo, you know Michael yo. Oh yeah. When he was in the ICU because of Covid. In my mind, I don't know why. 'cause I know that Michael Yo is athletic. Yeah. and I thought to myself, oh, if, if he's in the ICU, I would've died. You know what I mean? Like,

4 (1h 28m 42s):
I fucked. Fuck. Meanwhile, his mom got it and she was fine.

1 (1h 28m 45s):
It's Michael. Yo, he's weak. I

4 (1h 28m 47s):
Don't know what it is, man. He, it could have caught him absolutely exhausted. Maybe. Yeah.

1 (1h 28m 52s):
That's

4 (1h 28m 52s):
What I've heard of people getting it really bad. It catches them when they go on a bender. And that's what happened with me. I was, I was drinking till three 30 in the morning. Mm. I think when drinking First of all is absolutely terrible for your body and terrible for your immune system. Mm. And if you're drinking, like I was drinking these five super sweet, super potent margaritas. We were hammered, you know? And then I was actually, I came from a show too, so I did a show that night. I probably had a couple of drinks at the show. So it's like you're not in a good place to fight off anything like that. You're exhausted and drunk. And then I've been sick that way many times. Yeah. The times in my past when I've caught a cold or caught the flu, it's almost always when I'm run down.

4 (1h 29m 34s):
Mm. Almost always. So don don't know, maybe Michael Yo was really run down when he got it. Yeah. I know a guy who got covid really bad because him and his buddies were drinking. They were drinking and they were partying, and they, he was really fucked up. And then the next day, COVID hit him bad, but he was weak. Yeah. Like his, his body was weakened by a bender. Mm. Like they were drunk all night. And then in the morning he started feeling like shit. And then it caught him bad.

1 (1h 29m 58s):
Yeah. But what I got out was really bad, but I, I lived through it. Yeah. It was fine. Yeah.

4 (1h 30m 3s):
Yeah. There's a lot of different things that were at play there. First of all, there was just general metabolic health that was completely ignored. People told you, all you have to do is get vaccinated. That's horse shit. Mm. Your, your immune system is complex and it relies on a bunch of different things to keep it effective. It relies on good nutrition, it relies on sleep, it relies on low stress. It relies on vitamins and nutrients, healthy diet, exercise. All those things were huge factors and they ignored every single one of them. When you look at the number of people that died of covid, something like 90 plus percent had four plus comorbidities, four plus cancer, diabetes, heart attack risk, fill in the blank.

4 (1h 30m 47s):
Four comorbidities. 90 plus percent of them. Yeah. It's not that it's not bad Of course it's bad, but it's, you know, what's worse. You motherfuckers telling everybody what they have to do and not have to do. You, you motherfuckers telling people they could shut their businesses down and they have to take this experimental medication regardless of why or not they have natural immunity. Dude, it was Gestapo shit.

1 (1h 31m 10s):
I'm with you, but I'm with you. It

4 (1h 31m 11s):
Was, it was fucking mind control. It was totalitarian authoritarian tactics. They were limiting people's livelihood, limiting people's ability to travel, shaming people. The fucking government released during omicron, which is nothing but a cold. They released this thing for the people that have been vaccinated. You did your job for those unvaccinated, you experience a winter, what is it? Severe illness and death. Mm. You're looking towards a winter of severe illness and death. When all, when biden's on tv, our patients is wearing thin. We've been patient, but our patience is wearing, Hey motherfucker, our patience is wearing thin with you. You can't even form a goddamn sentence.

4 (1h 31m 52s):
Yeah. You fucking zombie. Yeah. What are you talking about? Your patience is wearing thin. You're not even looking at data. You're not talking about reality. You're talking to the cult.

1 (1h 32m 2s):
Can I ask you, why are they so reluctant to not give us a different option there? Because

4 (1h 32m 8s):
It's control. Because the, whenever there's anything that happens in the world Yeah. Whether it's nine 11 and through nine 11, they pass the Patriot Act. Yeah. And there was a Dofasting Blow to free speech and control and just your ability to have privacy. Yeah. The government had full reign to listen to all your phone calls, listen to, read all your emails. And they're doing it right now. And the, the NSA is doing it right now. They can listen to any, any time you make a phone call to someone, it's all we're getting recorded. Yeah.

1 (1h 32m 35s):
But when we complain, like, I biden's a little too old, maybe can we find a different option? There's just not even, they're not even open to the idea of it. It's just like, no, he's, he's the

4 (1h 32m 43s):
Guy. He's not in control right now. Right. So if the people who are in control are in control right now, why would they want to swap out a new person?

1 (1h 32m 50s):
Deep state. For real? He's a deep listen. Yeah.

4 (1h 32m 54s):
You could put whatever words you want, but if you don't think that these corporations that donate insane amounts of money to political campaigns have an influence on what happens in the world, you're naive. That's a silly way to think of things. Now, if you've got a guy who basically has no mind and he is your figurehead, if you can keep 'em alive for four years, you just run it the way you're running it right now. Wow. All you have to do is get that other guy arrested a ton of times. Just keep, keep arresting him. Keep trumping up new, trumping up new charges. Yeah. Put him out there in the fucking news every day. Terrible things he's done. And he's an authoritarian. He is gonna lock all the gaze up. If you just say that enough.

4 (1h 33m 34s):
The people that are uninformed and aren't paying attention, they're going to listen. And then if you have mail-in ballots, and if you have a voter machine shenanigans, if you can fucking sway things one way or another, then you stay in power.

1 (1h 33m 47s):
Do you,

4 (1h 33m 48s):
You stay in power. So you believe same person stays as the figurehead and the same people run it. Now, do you believe

1 (1h 33m 54s):
The election was stolen then?

4 (1h 33m 56s):
No. Okay. I believe that there are, without a doubt, in every election, there's election fraud. Sure. It's like, what's the number? Yeah. So that's what I say. I don't know what the number is. I know Trump apparently released a whole bunch of documents showing irregularities, showing that the mail-in ballots were incorrect. There's the mail-in ballots is something Putin talked about recently. He said the 2020 elections were stolen and they used mail-in ballots. But who knows why he's

1 (1h 34m 20s):
Saying that. But these things happen every cycle. Right. Every election these things happen. There's irregularities. Hillary

4 (1h 34m 25s):
Claimed that she won. Right. You know, I mean, John Kerry claimed that he won. Yeah. Al Gore claimed that he won. Remember the dangling Chads in Florida?

1 (1h 34m 34s):
That shit in Florida? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

4 (1h 34m 35s):
The, the idea of people nine. But the

1 (1h 34m 37s):
Difference is, the difference is that the al though went, okay, I'm gonna concede and sort

4 (1h 34m 42s):
Of took a long time. Okay. You know, the, the Al Gore, George Bush won. How long did that go on before he conceded? I wanna say it was a, a few months. Mm. don don't think it was as simple as just conceding. Okay. I think the Al Gore, George Bush one went on for quite a while, if I remember correctly. 'cause I remember being confused like, wow, this never happened before. A month or so. A month.

1 (1h 35m 3s):
A month or so. Okay.

4 (1h 35m 4s):
The 13th. Okay. So think of that. Think of like a whole month where they're trying to decide if it's true.

1 (1h 35m 9s):
Right.

4 (1h 35m 10s):
It's fucking weird. And there was a documentary that HBO did back when Bush was president during these times. Well, this was when it was okay to deny the election because it was a Republican that was in office, and there was a documentary called Hacking Democracy. And in that documentary, they were using, I think they were using Die Bold Machines and Die Bold. They also make a lot of ATM machines. They make various machines. But what they had found in this documentary was that there was the ability to have a third party input. So first party input is you, you're the voter. Second party is me. I collect the vote. Third party input was also there. Mm. And so they used that on the documentary to change the vote.

4 (1h 35m 52s):
So they used it to change the numbers.

1 (1h 35m 54s):
Wow.

4 (1h 35m 54s):
And they showed that they can do it. Wow. I'll send you something. Jamie don don't know if this is true, but someone said that someone had just done this recently. Here, I'll send you this. 'cause this is just something that someone tweeted. don don't, don don't know if it's true. But I wanted to send it to Jamie so Jamie could research it. But what this says is that in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, computer scientist and engineering professor Jay Alex Halderman was able to hack a dominion voting tabulator in front of us. District Judge Amy Totenberg using only a pen to change the vote totals.

1 (1h 36m 35s):
That happened this time,

4 (1h 36m 37s):
Supposedly.

1 (1h 36m 38s):
Wow.

4 (1h 36m 38s):
Now this is a, this is a tweet from just a couple of days ago.

1 (1h 36m 42s):
Wow. It

4 (1h 36m 42s):
Was a tweet from, actually, a tweet from when was it? Anyway, I don't know if that's true, but that's crazy. If it is.

1 (1h 36m 52s):
Yeah. This

4 (1h 36m 53s):
Is, this is actually from two days ago. Wow. This person tweeted this now. We'll, we'll look, see if that's horse shit. And see what, but here's the thing. When you have computers, if you have a phone, like with Pegasus, Pegasus was the first one that, by the way, the Israelis created Pegasus. And Pegasus was a software that, that's what they used to get Jeff Bezos when they got his dick pics and all that shit. Oh

1 (1h 37m 17s):
Yeah. The good, the good ones, good ones, good ones, good

4 (1h 37m 19s):
Ones. It's got a solid. When they did that with him, what they did was someone sent him a link in WhatsApp, I think it was the head of Saudi Arabia sent him, allegedly sent him a link in WhatsApp. He clicked the link, and then Pegasus was downloaded on his phone. Now you don't even have to click a link anymore. Now they can get Pegasus on your phone. All they need is your phone number.

1 (1h 37m 41s):
I could have Pegasus now. They

4 (1h 37m 43s):
Probably do. You probably, do

1 (1h 37m 44s):
You have it?

4 (1h 37m 45s):
I'm sure.

1 (1h 37m 46s):
Oh, no. If, how can we detect it? Is there an app? I don't believe so. Okay. I don't

4 (1h 37m 50s):
I don, I think according to Gavin de Becker, who's a securities expert, these things are constantly evolving. And they get better all the time. They don't tell you when they're be better. Yeah. They just, they just have better technology. Yeah. And, but, but he's aware of Pegasus too. And he said with Pegasus too, all they need is your phone number.

1 (1h 38m 7s):
Yeah. Hey, but Joe, but Joe, could I ask you something? What? Can't you just shut it off and not I mean there's so many people in this country just walk around and they just don't, all these things that we're talking about right now, they don't think about it. They just live their lives. Don't you think that that's a happier life or no?

4 (1h 38m 31s):
Depends on whether or not your voice actually matters. So if you can change the way people think and you can change the way people look at things, and then those people vote in such mass numbers that you can't make stealing the vote possible because enough people realize it's horseshit to the point where the overwhelming majority you, you would have to like, have fraud That's so apparent that no one would buy into it. It'd be a national scandal.

1 (1h 38m 60s):
We need whistleblowers.

4 (1h 39m 1s):
We have 'em. We put in jail. Yeah. Yeah. Look at Edward Snowden. He's, he has to live in Russia. Now look at Julian Assange. She's fucked. Yeah. They've been prosecuting that guy forever. And if you ask what the crime is, it's nothing. Yeah. He's a journalist.

1 (1h 39m 15s):
I just feel so stressed out right now. Shit. Why? Because that's the reality. We live in it. It's stressing me out.

4 (1h 39m 22s):
That's the reality. Yeah. That we live in. We live in a very dangerous, complicated world. Yeah. Halder been a University of Michigan computer scientist changed results of a hypothetical referendum on Sunday alcohol sales. He flipped the winner in a theoretical election between President George Washington and Benedict Arnold, the Revolutionary War General who defected to the British. He rigged the machine to print out as many ballots as he wanted. Wow. As he needed. All he needed, excuse me, was a pen to reach a button inside the touchscreen, a fake $10 voter card that he had programmed. Or a $100 USB device that he plugged into a cord connected to a printer. Rewriting, rewriting the touchscreens code. Halderman delivered his presentation during an election security trial, evaluating whether Georgia's voting system is vulnerable to manipulation or programming errors.

4 (1h 40m 10s):
All in-person voters in Georgia make their choices on touchscreens that print out paper ballots. and I believe Georgia was supposed to update their machines. And then there was a, a talk of when they were gonna do it. And that I think it's a, it's, it's also taken into consideration other than just corruption. It might also be a budget issue.

1 (1h 40m 29s):
Mm.

7 (1h 40m 30s):
That the headline says, election officials say these vulnerabilities are

4 (1h 40m 34s):
Me merely speculative. Oh, merely speculative. It's safe and effective. Our election is safe and effective. Yeah. These people dropping dead. These 40% increase in all cause mortalities. Yeah. Ages 18 to 34. There's nothing to concern yourself with. Yeah. That's normal. Yeah.

1 (1h 40m 50s):
But

4 (1h 40m 50s):
It's merely speculative probably. Yeah. These people all have your best interest in mind. Is that a cigar? These are little baby cigars. Can I

1 (1h 40m 57s):
Have one? Yeah, sure. Okay.

4 (1h 40m 58s):
You're okay with nicotine cigars?

1 (1h 41m 0s):
Yeah. I know. I'm not gonna inhale

4 (1h 41m 1s):
That. You want a real cigar or a big one?

1 (1h 41m 2s):
No, the little

4 (1h 41m 3s):
Ones. You want like a, a real cigar? I I like 'em. Yeah. Once you have one of these Cuban Yeah. No, these are, they're from Nicaragua. These are JRE cigars. Oh fuck. They're actually really good.

1 (1h 41m 13s):
Yeah.

4 (1h 41m 14s):
Here, I'll open it for you. This is what I think, man. Okay. I think evil's real and I think evil exists in many forms. and it exists in callous disregard for loss of life for profit. That's evil. Right. And that's a real thing. Like you could say evil is the devil. Here's a little lighter here, buddy. You could say evil is Satan and evil is demons. And evil is, you know, exorcisms and shit. There you go. Look at that baby. But also, evil is prophet over human life, which is real evil is cobalt minds. And in the Congo, when you watch pregnant women mining for cobalt and getting toxic fumes in their lungs, or they, some of 'em have babies on their back.

4 (1h 41m 56s):
That's evil. That's evil. They're living in, in dirt floors with no sanitation. It's horrific conditions. And that is in everybody's cell phone. And everyone's cell phone is the labor of essentially people so poor. They don't have to choose whether they're slaves or not. They just have, there's no other option for them to work.

1 (1h 42m 16s):
But there's a powerless powerlessness that one feels like, what is little Bobby Lee gonna do about any of this? So it's like, a lot of times I'm just like, you know, everything that you said, I'm with you. But I'm just saying that like, it stresses me out. It should. Yeah. and I walk and, and I wanna walk around a little bit more free and you know,

4 (1h 42m 35s):
You deserve that. Yeah. You're a comedian man. You, you provide laughter and you help people. And if, if it's fucking you up knowing about all this shit that's happening in the world, that can get in the way of your job.

1 (1h 42m 47s):
Yeah. Yeah. Look,

4 (1h 42m 50s):
It's, it's not an obligation to pay attention to everything. Okay. but it is something that I think would help people break out of the cult. 'cause that cult, it's like you think you're a good person if you buy hook, line and sinker everything that the left says. That's crazy. These are the same people that want war. These are the same people that are encouraging censorship. Mm. These are the same people that are trying to silence descent. Mm. That's, that's all totalitarian shit. And just because it's done for trans kids or for Black Lives Matter, or for any social cause that you think is like undeniably worthy, it's still the same thing. At the end of the day, the Patriot Act still controlled people in a way that was never allowed before.

4 (1h 43m 36s):
and it did it under the guise. We have to stop a terrorist attack. Yeah. So even if they don't do evil shit to make these things happen, once these things happen, they take advantage by doing evil shit. And they enact control over the people that they never had before. Mm. And that's what they did during Covid. And the redistribution of wealth was insane. Yeah.

1 (1h 43m 56s):
The, we

4 (1h 43m 56s):
Did the redistribution of wealth to big corporations and

1 (1h 43m 59s):
Companies like Gates profited that. Yeah. Oh my God. I mean so many

4 (1h 44m 1s):
People that billions of dollars was

1 (1h 44m 3s):
Moved. Yeah. Well, it just stresses me out. You wanna talk about the movie? Yeah.

8 (1h 44m 10s):
Can we talk,

1 (1h 44m 11s):
Can we talk about the movie I'm promoting? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

4 (1h 44m 14s):
What's your movie? Bobby.

1 (1h 44m 16s):
Oh, I, I'm, I'm barely in it and they're making me, you know what I mean, but it's

4 (1h 44m 22s):
Like, but they're making you do promo and you're barely in it. Well,

1 (1h 44m 24s):
I have four scenes, what's it called? It's called Drugstore June.

4 (1h 44m 28s):
What's it about?

1 (1h 44m 30s):
It's about a girl, Esther. Right. And she was, she, she works at a pharmacy and I play a phar the main pharmacist. And it's basically, she plays sort of like a Gen Z You know what I mean? Girl that's kind of out of touch. It's kinda like a Juno. Right. You know what I mean? But it's more modern and it's what I like about it, Joe, is this Okay. Is just that, you know, I can I talk about Hollywood real quick?

4 (1h 44m 53s):
Sure.

1 (1h 44m 56s):
They're still gatekeepers. Right. And for me, it's like, I think I'm perceived as dangerous. don don't know why, because I'm on a podcast, I say shit. Yeah. Right. Right. And it's like, I'm always the fourth option. It goes Ronnie, Jimmy, Ken Jung. Right, right. and I like acting. Right. So it's like, I think this is cool because it's like everyone that's involved in it are dear friends of mine. You know what I mean? Pretty much everyone in the movie are people like Ms. Pat and people that I know. Oh, cool. And it's cool to like, have look at you. Yeah. It's,

4 (1h 45m 26s):
Let's, let's watch the trailer.

1 (1h 45m 28s):
Okay.

9 (1h 45m 30s):
You were gonna gimme a consultation for plastic surgery.

8 (1h 45m 33s):
That's not what I do here.

9 (1h 45m 34s):
But just if you were, what do you think you would do to my face?

8 (1h 45m 38s):
I'd probably start with your mouth.

9 (1h 45m 40s):
The lip filler.

8 (1h 45m 41s):
No, I would sew that sucker shut deal. What? Crazy. But

9 (1h 45m 54s):
I'm a loser. Your Facebook group is right. I have no life. What did you ever see in this psycho

8 (1h 46m 3s):
Two?

9 (1h 46m 4s):
Oh, I messed it up. I need a coffee break.

8 (1h 46m 6s):
You haven't even clocked in yet.

9 (1h 46m 7s):
I haven't been getting paid for any of this.

8 (1h 46m 9s):
Oh, give me a double macchiato. I brought you some hot chocolate. Oh, you're

9 (1h 46m 15s):
Interrupting my

8 (1h 46m 16s):
String. Okay. Bye. June squad, you would sit. Well, thank you Chad.

9 (1h 46m 23s):
What? Ew,

8 (1h 46m 26s):
I heard the pharmacy

1 (1h 46m 27s):
Got robbed. Miss Pot. What the

9 (1h 46m 29s):
Hell happened in here? What's your name at forever, June. On everything except Snap at June Forever. No, honey.

8 (1h 46m 35s):
Your real life actual name? June. June. This is not Queen June's private castle. June the Almighty.

9 (1h 46m 45s):
Oh, June.

8 (1h 46m 47s):
Oh, I got the poor man that ends

9 (1h 46m 49s):
Up with her. I think I'm gonna start doing some investigatory work. Y'all heard anything about a pharmacy here? Rob? I don't watch the news. All I'll do is smoke. Wait. Do you feel safe here? Going to have to, I'm looking for information. Hey baby Boo. June Squad has a lot of time on their hands. Take it easy. I'll tell you what you want. What are you doing here? I'm collecting evidence. You watch too many movies. You are not a police officer. Help us out here. God, mugshots are so sexy. Can I take this home? No, you cannot not.

4 (1h 47m 34s):
Did you watch it?

1 (1h 47m 35s):
No.

4 (1h 47m 36s):
So that's the first time you've seen the clip? Yeah.

1 (1h 47m 38s):
Well, Abby, you know, Abby Levitton, my manager. Sure. She saw, she was like, it's pretty good. And when she said that, I was like, oh, I don't wanna watch it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you know. No, I gotta promote it. I gotta I gotta

4 (1h 47m 50s):
I'm sure you're grading it. I'm sure you're grading it. Yeah. Yeah. You're hilarious.

1 (1h 47m 57s):
But I I I, I wanna say though that it's like, you know, it's our, our friends. It's like, you know, you, you and your friends got together and we made a movie and I heard it's great and it's gonna go into theaters. Yes. All there's all these things here. I'm gonna see it. I'm gonna eventually see it. Yeah. I can't watch myself. I, I, can I say something? I've been to movies. I get invited to premieres. I leave.

4 (1h 48m 14s):
Yeah. I don't wanna watch me, but this was pretty good.

1 (1h 48m 16s):
Oh, that's me And Death and Roman. Yeah. I'm pretty good in this. It's in a short that

4 (1h 48m 20s):
Just came out on YouTube. It's like 15 minutes long. Okay. Yeah.

1 (1h 48m 23s):
Yeah. But I, I'm okay in that. Yeah.

4 (1h 48m 25s):
Yeah. You, you want to get into acting. You're enjoying it.

1 (1h 48m 29s):
Can I ask you, you don't like it?

4 (1h 48m 31s):
No, I don't like the process. I love movies

1 (1h 48m 33s):
Though. You are a great news radio. Thank

4 (1h 48m 34s):
You very much. Huge

1 (1h 48m 35s):
Laughs.

4 (1h 48m 36s):
It's fun. Yeah. Stand up some more fun. It

1 (1h 48m 38s):
Is. But why can't you do all of it?

4 (1h 48m 39s):
Because I don't wanna deal with all those people.

1 (1h 48m 42s):
Yeah,

4 (1h 48m 43s):
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. That's why I did Fear Factor. I didn't wanna deal with actors anymore. When Fear Factor came along, I was like, oh, this is perfect. Not that there's anything wrong with that. And the, the cast on news radio were amazing. Incredible. It's just, you, you deal with a certain kind of person that is 60% insane. 60% of them are insane.

1 (1h 48m 60s):
Yeah.

4 (1h 49m 0s):
40% of 'em are cool as fuck. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But it's just like, don don't, they can't, they're not fun to joke around with. They're shitty. They backs stab. They fucking, they undermine you. They go to producers and, you know, try to rewrite your words and say that it conflicts with my lines. Yeah. It's like weird ego shit goes on with 'em. They're weird man. They're weird people.

1 (1h 49m 21s):
They are weird. But what the jobs that I have now, like, I did reservation dogs. I did, I'm on Sex in the City, the new one. Oh,

4 (1h 49m 29s):
How's that?

1 (1h 49m 30s):
It's, I, I said no to it for the first couple of times they go like, you want to do it? Because I just didn't think that it was the right fit. I had never seen it. I know, it's this big cultural thing. Yeah. But I just basically says, all I wanna do is feel comfortable. Dude, I said that to MPK, that showrunner because don don't want to go, go in there and feel like, like people are mean and I'm stressed out and I don't need it. Yeah. And he, he, he was, he comforted me. He was like, no, we want you on the show. and I, you know, I would go to New York and everyone was super sweet. Like, I, I put myself in situations that aren't, that I've had fucking directors called me a pan face. Go,

4 (1h 50m 8s):
What?

1 (1h 50m 9s):
Yeah. I had a director call me. That was, was

4 (1h 50m 10s):
He also?

1 (1h 50m 12s):
No, he was a white. What?

4 (1h 50m 14s):
Yeah. How long ago?

1 (1h 50m 15s):
In the nineties. Wow. I don't wanna call the director. He's a big director. Holy shit, dude. And he called the other actress a whore. Oh

4 (1h 50m 21s):
My gosh. He's

1 (1h 50m 22s):
Like, get on your mark. You pan face gook. Whoa. Yeah. Yeah. This is back. You know, when it wasn't. Whoa. Is he

4 (1h 50m 27s):
Alive?

1 (1h 50m 27s):
Yeah.

4 (1h 50m 28s):
So he's doing movies still.

1 (1h 50m 30s):
I, I wanna so badly tell you what

4 (1h 50m 32s):
It's, but what's his name? Rhyme with?

1 (1h 50m 33s):
I I'm not playing this game. I

4 (1h 50m 35s):
Know the internet. Will you tell me? Will you tell me later? Oh

1 (1h 50m 37s):
Yeah. Okay. Oh, yeah. Yeah. He

4 (1h 50m 39s):
Was gonna go through your IMDB and they're gonna find some likely candidates. Maybe, maybe we should do that. Yeah.

1 (1h 50m 45s):
Let the internet do it.

4 (1h 50m 46s):
Maybe we could play warmer. Warmer.

1 (1h 50m 48s):
Yeah. Warmer. No, no, no. One time this director. Same. I worked for this director.

4 (1h 50m 52s):
Was he Italian?

1 (1h 50m 52s):
No, I'm not playing this game. Fuck you. Okay. One time I fucked up on a line and he, he made the whole, everyone like the cameraman, everyone and the wardrobe, former circle. They put me in the middle of the circle and he goes, point your finger. And they all pointed their finger at me and he goes, repeat after me. You are the worst actor on planet Earth. Oh my God. And they all did that. And tears willed up in my eyes. and I remember a wardrobe lady looked at me and she goes, I'm so sorry.

4 (1h 51m 20s):
Oh my

1 (1h 51m 21s):
God. Yeah. I mean I had, I've had, I had Michael Bass do something to me.

4 (1h 51m 26s):
Wow. Why did Michael Bay do

1 (1h 51m 27s):
To you? He grabbed my face aggressively. Whoa.

4 (1h 51m 30s):
Why? What'd you do to him? Did you grab his balls? No. Do you wake up and do sucking on balls? don?

1 (1h 51m 35s):
Don't do I don't do that. I do that for comics. Okay. Okay. Yeah. don, don't do it. When I'm like on a, no, I did this. So I booked this commercial with Eric Stone Street. Right. You know Eric's Eric? He's a modern family. Okay. He plays the fat gay guy and it Sure, sure. So we played Tower Boys with Kim Catrell. So it was a I don forget. It was a Pepsi commercial, I think. And she was in this bathtub. and I had never acted before. You know, Joe, like I'm a stand I mean I come from the same place you come, which is open mics and I standup. Yeah. I didn't learn how to act. I don't know the fuck that. Right. I didn't know what a jib camera were, mark or any of that shit. Right. Right. So I had the scene where I had to bring these, oh fuck.

1 (1h 52m 16s):
I had to bring these towels into a fuck. You know, he was like stacked. That was a joke. And he would go, your face needs to be in the light. and I go, oh, I don't, I don't know. So I try to tilt every, take the light. The light. Right. And then like by the eighth one, he came from behind the thing and he grabbed my face like this. He goes here, here. and I like tears. Will, will. No. Don't feel bad for me. Poor boy. I'm a survivor.

4 (1h 52m 47s):
You know what I mean? That's your Holocaust. That was your Auschwitz. Yeah. But yeah. Yeah. Being on a movie and Michael Bay tells you to put your face towards

1 (1h 52m 53s):
The light. Yeah. But in the nineties I experienced that shit. Right.

4 (1h 52m 56s):
Well that seems like you really weren't putting your face towards the light. And he was freaking out. 'cause they could only do that take so many times. I'm kind of on Team Bay on that end.

1 (1h 53m 5s):
You are really?

4 (1h 53m 5s):
Yeah. He just turned your face. Oh, you're right. You're making it sound like

1 (1h 53m 8s):
You, you're right. You're you're right. Fucked you. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. Beat your ass in front of everybody. You're absolutely. But but also when you, when you come, when you come from a background like me Yes. With your dad fucking acting crazy. I get it. Yeah. When people scream Right. It fucking you triggers it fe you feel it,

4 (1h 53m 24s):
You

1 (1h 53m 25s):
Got triggered. Yeah. Like term, what's a Robocop, what's his name? The original Robocop?

4 (1h 53m 30s):
Peter.

1 (1h 53m 30s):
Peter

4 (1h 53m 31s):
Weir. Weir. Yeah.

1 (1h 53m 32s):
He's a screamer.

4 (1h 53m 33s):
Screams you.

1 (1h 53m 34s):
Yeah. So I, yeah. So I was on Mag scam at you. Yeah, I was on Magnum. He does it to everyone, right? Oh yeah. Back in the day, we wouldn't have sides. You can't remember one line you would like yell. Shit it like that. Right. Really. And every time he would do it, I would like tense up. I'm not a pussy, dude. I get

4 (1h 53m 51s):
It.

1 (1h 53m 52s):
I'm a warrior. Okay. Wow. Yeah. And then, and then, right. I just went to the showrunner. I go, I just, next time I'm on the side, maybe not him. So they just did it, you know? Yeah. But anyway, now I do shit that's like where I feel like I'm wanted. Right. and I'll do it. Right. So it's not like that crazy bullshit where I need, back then I needed it. Right.

4 (1h 54m 13s):
When someone would say something horrible to you, you just have, you would

1 (1h 54m 15s):
Absorb it. But

4 (1h 54m 16s):
There was also no recourse back then. I mean, that's how you get to like a Harvey Weinstein, right? Mm. A guy who has just ultimate control can do whatever the fuck he wants. Yeah. And does ruins people's lives and careers if they don't accept his advances. Mm. That's where I mean. That whole business has always been about powerful people abusing the people that they, that had to listen to them from casting directors all the way up to producers.

1 (1h 54m 45s):
It was different then. Yeah. Yeah. It

4 (1h 54m 46s):
Was, look, Tarantino was in here, and he was talking about this old school director who had his office had a bedroom where he'd take the starlets. All the starlets had to fuck 'em.

1 (1h 54m 58s):
Oh my God. He had a

4 (1h 54m 58s):
Bedroom in his fucking office. Oh my God. So everyone just assumed if a casting, you know, thing was going on and a girl came into his office, he fucked her.

1 (1h 55m 7s):
And 20 years ago I would've done it. I think. You think so? I, I think that if I I know, I think that it was a huge director. Right. Would what? Fuck him. No, I would suck his dick. Maybe. Really? I think, I wouldn't say I wouldn't tell you.

4 (1h 55m 22s):
Well, there's definitely,

1 (1h 55m 23s):
I would just cry. You

4 (1h 55m 24s):
Could have fielded some offers if that was out there. What? You could have gotten some offers if that was out there.

1 (1h 55m 29s):
Yeah. Yeah.

4 (1h 55m 29s):
Maybe you weren't like, open enough.

1 (1h 55m 32s):
Yeah, yeah. With

4 (1h 55m 33s):
Your desire to make it. Yeah.

1 (1h 55m 34s):
I just think that back then I was like, so like, yeah, I had no money. Right. And in my mind, I would be like, oh, this is the way it's supposed to happen. Right? Yeah. Yeah. So

4 (1h 55m 43s):
I mean, if, imagine if you're an actress, right? And you, you come out to Hollywood from fucking Kansas. Mm. You're 20 years old and you, you are all of a sudden in this producer's office and he's 50 and he's been banging stars for 20 fucking years and you don't know how it all works. And he explains to you, listen honey, this is how it works in this business. You're like, well, I mean, okay. Do you want to be an actress? And you're kind of mentally ill anyway. Oh, right. And you're like, yeah, I do so much.

1 (1h 56m 12s):
Yeah.

4 (1h 56m 12s):
Yeah. It's like, no one has to know about this. Oh, okay. You won't tell anybody. It's

1 (1h 56m 15s):
Terrible. It's fucking terrible. Yeah.

4 (1h 56m 16s):
And that's probably what they did forever.

1 (1h 56m 19s):
It's so fucking terrible. Yeah. And I mean I mean I know, you know, we have problems with the word woke. But, you know, I think in many ways Hollywood wokeness is also good.

4 (1h 56m 30s):
Yeah. In that way. I think now in a stopping the abuse way. But the problem is, there's like, in Hollywood particularly, there was an overcorrection and crazy people like Amber Heard, got involved. Right. They started manipulating the truth to sort of gain sympathy. You, you, you've got a lot of those cases too. The Chris Hardwick case. There's, there's a lot of those where the, the reality is so different than the truth. Right. And everybody just assumes that the woman's not insane. And that she's, she's telling the truth. So you, but you're gonna have to have a few of those. If you're gonna have to have real change, like a real correction of actual abuse, you're going to, it's just like, if you're gonna like, accept trans people, you're going to have a bunch of instances of perverts pretending to be trans.

4 (1h 57m 12s):
If you're going to say, Hey, we have to stop abuse, you're gonna get fake abuse. You're gonna get people that come out and say

1 (1h 57m 18s):
Their abuse. I know man. And that's the way Hollywood is. Like, that's the way humans are bad.

4 (1h 57m 22s):
That's the way humans are.

1 (1h 57m 23s):
Yeah. But in the sense of like a show like Beef getting greenlit, which are mostly all Korean or Asian cast, I think in that way it's good. Right. But there is an overcorrection in, in terms of like, well, it's,

4 (1h 57m 35s):
It's good because that show's good. Right? That's why it's good. Oh yeah,

1 (1h 57m 39s):
You're

4 (1h 57m 39s):
Right. It's good when the show's good.

1 (1h 57m 40s):
But it should also, but even if the show was good back then, 20 years ago, they would've never been. That's true. Yeah. They would've never wrote it.

4 (1h 57m 44s):
That's better about accepting. Yeah.

1 (1h 57m 46s):
Yeah, yeah.

4 (1h 57m 46s):
But it's still, I think art has to be a particularly, standup is the best example I could speak about. That has to be a meritocracy. It has to be what is actually funny. Mm. At the mothership, we have a fucking very clear mandate. No one gives a fuck if you are gay, if you are straight, if you are trans, if you are black, if you are Asian, if you're white, they don't give a fuck. Are you funny? That's all. It's, are you funny? And that's our goal. Yeah. The goal is, and that's what comedy used to be. I had this conversation with Ali Wong once, and she was like, do you think comedy's a meritocracy? I was like, ultimately it has to be. Because at the end of the day, the, the what's funny is what people are gonna come see again. You know, and you could pander and you can get away.

4 (1h 58m 28s):
You can kind of like be half-assed and be treated like you're better than you are. You see that all the time when they make those lists of the best standup specials of the year. And some of 'em are like, what the

1 (1h 58m 38s):
Fuck are

4 (1h 58m 39s):
You saying? I know. I know. You're so crazy. I know if you think this is good. And they're only saying it because it's the right demographic. Yeah. And you can say that if it's, they're talking about the right points. Even if the standup is clunky and awful and unoriginal and just garbage, they still, they'll tell you. It's amazing.

1 (1h 58m 58s):
I and Don don't wanna kiss your ass. May I for a second though. Just accept it. Okay. Alright. I feel like, here we go. I love it. I love it. I love it. Yeah. Just, just hear me out. Okay. Okay. I'm gonna hear you out. I just feel like, you know, in a, in a way, you carved the way for me specifically because before I did TigerBelly and Bad, Friends, I mean, Joe. I'll be honest with you, I mean I would do half rooms. You know what I mean? E even though the eight years of Mad TV and all the things I had done Right. and I couldn't get an audience.

1 (1h 59m 37s):
Right. And now I mean, it's just like, it's night and day. I mean, it's you, you I mean the the path that you laid down. And even back then when you used to do, remember we used to do it at the Ice house and it used to pop in back in the day, right? Yeah. It's sort of like, I think it just kind of like, subconsciously I absorbed it and it became a path for me and it changed my life because now that's beautiful. To hear what That's beautiful to hear. And when I go on the road now, it's like, I get people that are like, really? They're fans. They know me. Yeah. They're, they love me and I love them as well, you know? and it's, it's a different fucking deal, dude. You are a

4 (2h 0m 12s):
Creature of the internet. I am. Yeah. And you should be. And the internet changed the game. The internet also made it, instead of a famine thing, people had an abundance mentality because when we first started in the nineties, there was only a few shows you could get on. You got on Mad tv, I got on news radio. There's only a few shows. And you were really lucky if you were on a show. Yeah, I remember we would talk about it all the time. Like, oh my God, I'm so lucky.

1 (2h 0m 35s):
Miracle

4 (2h 0m 36s):
Crazy. We're on tv. Oh my God. We're so lucky. But there was other people that didn't get your spot and they hated it. And they were mad at you. Mm. Like, like if you cast for mad TV and other comics at the club, you know, I know you experienced that. Oh yeah. And they were fucking jealous and bitter and they would talk shit about you. He fucking sucks on the show. He doesn't do anything. And they just angry that it didn't happen to them because it could have happened to them. Yeah. Now instead of that, now we're valuable to each other. 'cause now we're a community of podcasters and comedians. And instead of us being like in competition with each other, we all feed off of each other and we all support each other.

4 (2h 1m 16s):
It's a much better environment for standup. It's a much better environment for comedy clubs. It's like, everything's better now.

1 (2h 1m 24s):
It's also the connection with East Coast too. It's like, before I felt like there was like a rivalry almost. Right. And now it's like when I go to New York and I, as soon as I land, I don't even call the the, they, they, the seller will call me and go, what spots do you want? Yeah. And then like, all the comic go, come by, let's pod You know what I mean? It's like a family. It's fun. It's fucking amazing.

4 (2h 1m 45s):
Yeah. That happened during the podcast revolution. That's what changed everything.

1 (2h 1m 49s):
You think it's going down now?

4 (2h 1m 50s):
Going down the, the

1 (2h 1m 51s):
Podcast revolution? Yeah. Are we still It's happening. I know. No. Are we in downswing or upswing? No,

4 (2h 1m 55s):
It's not a downswing at all. It's if you pay attention to the numbers, more people are listening now than ever. Yeah. All the podcasts. Yeah. It's awesome. And it's, it's awesome because you get to see people for who they really are. No bullshit, no filter, no nonsense. You can't nonsense people for three hours. You know, at a certain point in time you're fucking demons will show their ugly face.

1 (2h 2m 18s):
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4 (2h 2m 19s):
It's really who you are. Yeah. and it also shapes who you are because you get to kind of like experience feedback and examine how you think about things and why you say the things you say and how much of the, in the early days, like how much of what we used to say was just for shock value. Like you were, you would go on a morning radio show you try Yeah. I know. We would try to say as shocking things as we could because that was the way to get attention. Especially like Op and Anthony I

1 (2h 2m 41s):
Know, I, I, I

4 (2h 2m 42s):
I know I know. We don't have to talk about it.

1 (2h 2m 43s):
I know. I we don't. It's no, IIII could vaguely go around it. I'm just like, at the time we all did

4 (2h 2m 49s):
It. Yeah.

1 (2h 2m 49s):
I was a survivor. Yeah. And I'm like, oh, this is the culture.

4 (2h 2m 53s):
Yeah. This is

1 (2h 2m 54s):
The culture. And also I'm like a LA comic. I'm an opening Anthony with Beasts, Patrice, Patrice Norton, all those guys were fucking beasts. Yeah. And it's like, you know, and then, you know, at the time, you know, and then later, and then now, you know, it's, but it's like,

4 (2h 3m 9s):
But now it's a much more honest thing. Yeah. Because now you, you do your own thing. Right. And if people want to see Bobby, they know how to find Bobby and they go, they seek you out. So it's not like some random person's tuning in, like, who's this guy? And then you have to say something crazy to get attention. Yeah. Now it's just, you could be yourself. You know? That's the difference. Like, if you got a million views on TigerBelly, that's a million people that really want to watch a show. Wow. Yeah. That's not random. Yeah. You know, if you get a million people that are on, like, some Comedy Central show, a million people watching that they're flipping channels. Yeah. They, they like, how many of 'em are looking forward to it? How many of 'em just stumbled upon it? Yeah. It's, it's probably quite a bit. Most shows don't have like, loyal dedicated viewers unless they're like streaming shows.

4 (2h 3m 53s):
Yeah. Most like, if you're watching Stranger Things, that's what you wanna watch. But there's a lot of things that are just not that popular and the numbers are like, still not as good.

1 (2h 4m 3s):
I know. I

4 (2h 4m 4s):
Know the podcast thing is a wild thing.

1 (2h 4m 6s):
Do I drive down the street in LA and I see a show? I'm like, who the fucker?

4 (2h 4m 9s):
Who's on that? No one's

1 (2h 4m 10s):
Gonna watch that

4 (2h 4m 12s):
I mean Maybe, maybe,

1 (2h 4m 13s):
But like, maybe it's good.

4 (2h 4m 14s):
Yeah. Yeah. I mean I like that they're still doing them. Yeah. I don't want 'em to go away. But they tried to kill that man. This fucking last strike, dude. I had so many friends, I know stopped doing standup and then just been riding that went into a panic.

1 (2h 4m 26s):
'cause

4 (2h 4m 26s):
They had mortgages and they just started, c Camille was started doing standup again. Right. Wow.

1 (2h 4m 30s):
It was hard. A

4 (2h 4m 31s):
Lot of, he hadn't done standup in seven years.

1 (2h 4m 33s):

Went up in the, in the little, in the little boy, the Little Room. and I hadn't seen him in years. and I go, dude, that was so funny. You were so loose.

1 (2h 10m 10s):
Yeah.

4 (2h 10m 10s):
And he was like at the Comedy store, I was always tense.

1 (2h 10m 12s):
Yeah. It's

4 (2h 10m 13s):
Like, it's hard for me to be free. He's he's a different person. I

1 (2h 10m 17s):
Also, I wouldn't be in this business without him and that family. Her,

4 (2h 10m 20s):
Oh, her I mean, that's why she's here. She

1 (2h 10m 23s):
Said two things to me as a young comic. Okay. Okay. She's a, it's a sin to support mediocrity. Right. I still dunno what it means, but I still have it in my heart. But then one day I was at Bull's restaurant. I mean in La Jolla with her. I was, when Freddy Soda used to drive her down, he would go, come eat with us. I miss Freddy so much. I do too. Yeah. Yeah. And so one day we were sitting there at Bull's restaurant in La Jolla and she goes, you know what makes a star? I go, what? She goes, 50% of the people have to love you, but it's okay with that other, the other half hates you. It's all in the same. Right. And it's like when I read bad comments now on, you know, 'cause I get some because I'm like, I've risen.

1 (2h 11m 5s):
Right. I just take that into the thing that it's like, it's a attention. Right. It's not personal.

4 (2h 11m 12s):
You know what I would tell you to do? What? Don't read them.

1 (2h 11m 14s):
Yeah. I

4 (2h 11m 15s):
Haven't, don't read anything. Yeah,

1 (2h 11m 16s):
Yeah, yeah. You don. So you

4 (2h 11m 17s):
Don't read? No, no, no, no, no. I don't read articles about me. I don't read shit. But

1 (2h 11m 21s):
If you read it, would it hurt your feelings? It

4 (2h 11m 23s):
Could. Yeah. It could. Okay. It could bother you. All right. You're a human being. Yeah. Yeah. Someone says something. Especially if it's not true and it's, and it's influencing people in a fucked up way. It paints the least charitable version of you. People

1 (2h 11m 35s):
Also don't realize that I'm a sensitive guy.

4 (2h 11m 37s):
We're all sensitive. Right. They're sensitive too. That's why they're lashing out. The reason why they're writing mean shit is 'cause they know what hurts them. A kind person, a happy person wouldn't be writing shitty things about you. They're doing it because they're, it's that old expression. Hurt people. Hurt people most,

1 (2h 11m 54s):
But when they make shit up, dude, the other day I read, I'm sorry, she, I read this, this is what I read. I heard Bobby Lee abuses his animals.

4 (2h 12m 1s):
Okay. Like why

1 (2h 12m 2s):
The,

4 (2h 12m 3s):
'cause they want to hurt your feelings. They want you to get angry. They want to

1 (2h 12m 6s):
Get upset. I like Cat Nobu.

4 (2h 12m 7s):
I believe you

1 (2h 12m 8s):
Sh dude. Yeah. I get them the best. I go, what's the most expensive shit? The healthiest

4 (2h 12m 13s):
Shit shit. They have all those oils and stuff

1 (2h 12m 15s):
On the, it is not all everyday adv event. You know, every other month. Every now. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know what I mean? Like Gunnar's book.

4 (2h 12m 20s):
Isn't it weird that cats hate water but they love fish. I don. It's kind of crazy. Right?

1 (2h 12m 25s):
It's crazy. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. It's weird.

4 (2h 12m 26s):
They love fish.

1 (2h 12m 27s):
They love fish. Yeah, yeah.

4 (2h 12m 28s):
Yeah. They don't want you go nowhere near that fucking water. Yeah, yeah,

1 (2h 12m 30s):
Yeah, yeah. Anyway, I don't abuse my animals. I love animals more. Course you don't. Yeah. I know Of course, but it's like insane. of course

4 (2h 12m 36s):
Of course You don't. of course. You

1 (2h 12m 37s):
Don. Yeah. Yeah. So I don't read it and yeah,

4 (2h 12m 39s):
Just don't read it. Because even if you read a hundred things that are awesome, one that sucks is gonna like stick in your head. I know. 'cause that's how a human mind is designed. It's designed to find danger and conflict and look out for it because it could hurt you. And so when you see that one thing, that's the thing you're gonna concentrate on. It's the one person that hates you. Yeah. Why do they hate me? Yeah. Oh my God, what if they're near me? That feeling of hate is the same feeling that you would get if there's someone that's dangerous, it's from another tribe that's looking at you over the hill and you think they might want to kill you. Like, ah, fuck. And you have to think about them. You don't think about your friends that love you. You think about the danger. And that's natural. It's a natural inclination of the human mind.

4 (2h 13m 19s):
Right. So you do that with social media too.

1 (2h 13m 21s):
You don't seek out the danger then?

4 (2h 13m 23s):
No. Yeah. Don't do it. And don't spread it either. The people that spread it. You, you don't realize what you're doing, but you are also affecting yourself. 'cause you know that what you're doing, unless is like the person you're going after some legitimate Nazi or something. Mm. You know what I mean? Like, most of the time when people are attacking, they're, they're, they're attacking someone to try to hurt them because they know that they can be hurt too. Mm. and it is like a lot of the people that are doing this shit on social media, All day long, they're, we know them. They're mentally ill people. I don't need to name any names, but I can, but there's, some of them are severely mentally ill people Yeah. That are just liars. They're insane. They're full of shit. They're, they're, they're on medication and in therapy and they're just lashing out at other people's behavior.

4 (2h 14m 7s):
And it's like, they don't realize that like, to be a good person also means to be nice to everybody. Mm. It doesn't just because someone has a differing view on something, you can't demonize them and turn them into a non-human. But people do that because they're terrified of that happening to them. Yeah.

1 (2h 14m 24s):
And I also don't like when people try to do things like that. I'm not mad at them either. I don't have like a thoughts of revenge or, you know, what I mean, you know what I mean. I, you know, I just, you know, I just feel bummed that like they feel that way or whatever. You know what I mean. Right. But I have no, I have, I I have love for people.

4 (2h 14m 40s):
I know You do. Yeah,

1 (2h 14m 40s):
I do. Yeah. and I have love for you Bobby. Okay. Anyway. Thank you. Bye everybody.

4 (2h 14m 44s):
Bye bye. Thank you.

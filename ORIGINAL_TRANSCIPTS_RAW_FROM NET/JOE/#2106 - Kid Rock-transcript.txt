Talk. It is. It is. Stoner talk. Most of my conversations are stoner talk, like high level

4 (30s):
Dude. It used to be Tom Petty's weed dealer in a sense. Like he would come to town, he married a girl from Saginaw, Michigan, I forget her name. Great, great girl. And they would come to, you know, outside Detroit where I lived and I'd get this call like, Hey, can you get Tom some weed? And I'd be like, fuck, I'll take him some weed. So I'd call some of my brother's friends and get some weed. I'd be like, this is fucking awesome. 'cause I love Tom Petty. I didn't really know him. So I'd go up there and drop the weed off and I'd be in his dressing room and like, he'd be like, so what's up man? I'd be like, nothing. And I'm like, we have nothing in common. This, this guy's so fucking high.

4 (1m 10s):
I might have been tuned up on a couple beers or something. and I'm like, well that sucked.

3 (1m 16s):
I

4 (1m 16s):
Guess I'll just enjoy the music.

3 (1m 19s):
Was this before or after you were doing music?

4 (1m 21s):
Oh, this when I was a big star.

3 (1m 23s):
Oh really? Oh yeah. No shit. Yeah,

4 (1m 25s):
It was all exciting.

3 (1m 26s):
And you hanging with Tom Petty?

4 (1m 28s):
Not really. I was just taking him weed, trying, trying to hang out with him. You

3 (1m 31s):
Know. That's how Tom Petty died. Somebody got him some pills.

4 (1m 35s):
Oh, is it Fentanyl? Yeah.

3 (1m 37s):
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck yeah. Shit. He, I don't remember what his, his injury was, but he was hurting. And a roadie got him some Fentanyl.

4 (1m 48s):
Terrible.

3 (1m 48s):
Yeah. That's how Prince died too. Yeah, I

4 (1m 51s):
Remember. I've heard that in the

3 (1m 52s):
Elevator. That's the same thing. Pain.

4 (1m 53s):
We all know people that have, it's travesty.

3 (1m 56s):
It's real, it's a horrible thing.

4 (1m 58s):
Well, let's just go right at the border.

3 (1m 60s):
Yeah. Well it's the border, but it's also the, the opioid crisis that was created by the Sackler family. I mean. Those motherfuckers just got a giant percentage of the population hooked on heroin. That's some evil shit, man. It's funny. Those fucking people are still running around too. Yeah.

4 (2m 18s):
In case you were ever thinking about quitting drugs. Fentanyl should seal the deal. Yeah. That should seal the deal. Yeah. I know a lot of people. It has. They were like, you know, I was still an experimental cocaine user, this, that and the other. They were like, when that shit came up, that was it. It's like, I had some friends tell me they were gonna buy a testing kit, this, that, and the other. I was like, yeah, that's probably time to Yeah. It's time to move

3 (2m 42s):
On. If you're buying a testing kit to make sure You don't die, you probably should reconsider your option.

4 (2m 47s):
Might wanna revisit whiskey.

3 (2m 49s):
Yeah. Weed's not bad. Weed and whiskey are, it's a good combination. You don't really, you don't want to go down that road. Although I've heard it's awesome. Not fentanyl, but cocaine. I have not tried it. I've never done it. But everyone I know who does it tells you not to do it 'cause it's awesome.

4 (3m 6s):
Hmm. I had a good run. Having too many problems, You know, in the, in the older days and, you know, it's kinda just following the handbook of rock and roll. Yeah. It's like their chapter 14 gets some blow, blah, blah, blah. We, we had fun. Nobody, I've seen people get all fucked up and lose their minds on it. But I know quite a few people in my position. Like, okay, we had some fun, we were younger. And you know, at some point, you know, kind of a weekend warrior type thing. Don't let it interfere with business and engagements and things you have to do. I can't say I was batting a thousand, but pretty good. Average. You

3 (3m 44s):
Did pretty good. Yeah. Considering it, it all worked out pretty well.

4 (3m 48s):
And I'm not advocating for it at any level.

3 (3m 51s):
I'm just don don't think anybody is. That's,

4 (3m 52s):
That's my honest experience. Like, hey, you know, I came out. Okay.

3 (3m 56s):
That's the thing. There's people that'll tell you they're weed advocates. There's, there's no like Coke advocates, there's no people like Coke Fix my life. I never got anything done. All of a sudden I was doing coke and starting businesses Is weed

4 (4m 10s):
Fixing lives? Weed

3 (4m 12s):
Can fix people. Depends on who you are. I

4 (4m 15s):
Know if you're sick and Yeah.

3 (4m 16s):
For a guy like me, weed's a good drug. A guy like me, weed just like chills.

4 (4m 22s):
My brother's a huge weed smoker. Yeah. And I'm always, and he'll always be like, you know, for golfing or some shit and I'm drinking. My beers having a fun, I'm always like, you know, you drive. And I'm always like, maybe you fucking shouldn't be driving. He's just fucking stoned out of his mind sometimes. And I'm like, yeah, I don't like this. I'm, I'm a little nervous and I'm tuned up already.

3 (4m 46s):
Yeah. For some people, weed makes you nicer, calms you down, makes you a little more sensitive. A little more compassionate.

4 (4m 54s):
Yeah. Everything affects people

3 (4m 55s):
Differently. Yeah.

4 (4m 56s):
I've drank tequila three times. Only three I've, I've been to jail three times. Do the math. Kid. Rock. No drink. Tequila.

3 (5m 7s):
So what do you think tequila does to you differently?

4 (5m 10s):
Ah, just makes me wanna punch you right in the mouth. Really?

5 (5m 12s):
Oh fuck.

4 (5m 14s):
That's it.

3 (5m 15s):
The Mexican influence. Say,

4 (5m 16s):
Hey, Kid, Rock nice to see you. Like, wham

5 (5m 19s):
I mean what

4 (5m 19s):
The fuck's the matter with him.

3 (5m 21s):
What? Tequila? Like what, what? I have

4 (5m 23s):
No idea. What

3 (5m 24s):
Does it dude just makes you hyper. Just

4 (5m 26s):
Makes me fucking hyper violent. Fucking, you know, it could have been a combination of maybe those few times I drank and I was just in a head space where, you know Right. It could be in different head spaces when you're doing different

3 (5m 37s):
Things and you could blame it on the tequila, but it was really just, but I

4 (5m 40s):
Kinda have a rule that I, I really try not to like, you know, I, I really mellowed out the last 10 years or so, but I really try not to get tuned up unless I'm in a good spot. Yeah. Good mood, good people. Right. They don't wanna be like, you know, all worked up. You know, after watch Fox News for six hours, you're just fucking ready to fucking, you know, slay the beast and start pounding whiskey and go to the club.

3 (6m 4s):
Dude, if you watch Fox News for too long, you will think it's the end of the world.

4 (6m 7s):
Oh, I do. and it is,

3 (6m 9s):
It might be. It really might be. Did you see the fucking Tim Dylan thing that I posted yesterday? Yes. It's legit. Yeah. No, it was so

4 (6m 17s):
Brand new. But Is that the gay comedian? Yeah, he's fucking great.

3 (6m 20s):
He's hilarious. But he, he wrote a, he had a picture with a girl. He said, I'm getting married. The homosexuality thing was just a phase and RRFK Junior writes to him, she's a beautiful lady. I could see how she ung you, Tim. The guy's running for president.

4 (6m 37s):
Fucking great.

3 (6m 38s):
Amazing. It's awesome in that sense. It's an amazing time. He don't

4 (6m 42s):
Scare me.

3 (6m 43s):
No, he shouldn't scare you. He doesn't scare me. He should do the opposite of scare you. Yeah. It should scare you the opposition to him. 'cause if people listen to what he says and you pay attention to what he says and you actually research what he says, he's telling the truth. He just, we've been fucked over and lied to for so long that he seems like a crazy person. Look at that. She's a beautiful angel. Tim. Easy to see how she ung GAed. You

4 (7m 4s):
Unga. Fuck. I learned something. I haven't been here five minutes. My new favorite word. Usually I'm just using gay inappropriate all the time. You know, like, that's fucking gay. You know, someone's like, oh, you're so insensitive. I'm gonna be like, that's so uny.

3 (7m 19s):
Yeah. It used to be a, a thing that we would say something's gay or it used to be, imagine like from the time of the Flintstones, the Flintstones was, we had a gay old time.

4 (7m 29s):
Do you remember playing smear the queer when you were a

3 (7m 31s):
Kid? I never played that. What is it? Just

4 (7m 33s):
You give somebody the football and everyone tries to tackle 'em. Like in grade school just ran around. We didn't even know what queer meant. That's the name of the game was Smear the Queer.

3 (7m 41s):
I never played that. Did you play that, Jamie? Yep. Yeah, sure. Definitely.

4 (7m 45s):
Hundred percent. You from the Midwest

3 (7m 47s):
In the, he's from Ohio. There you go. They didn't have that where I grew up.

4 (7m 52s):
Where'd you grow up?

3 (7m 53s):
Boston. I mean I'm sure they had it.

4 (7m 57s):
Fuck, I would think it was invented in Boston.

3 (8m 1s):
I, I lived a fucked up life. Not, not fucked up, but just my high school years was all martial arts. It was all from the time. I was like 15 till I was 21. All I did is train and compete. That's

4 (8m 13s):
A lot of discipline.

3 (8m 14s):
Yeah. A lot of obsession. A lot of discipline and obsession. but it was very weird socially. Like, so it went from that to being a standup comedian, which is like the complete opposite ends of the spectrum. Hang out with maniacs who were doing drugs and staying up all night. Just complete polar opposite. So I missed a lot of stuff.

4 (8m 34s):
Huh? You got a lot of money now you can make up for it. Fast track it. Probably get it all done in like two years with the, with the loot you've made.

3 (8m 43s):
Yeah.

4 (8m 45s):
I found that to be a problem at times for people

3 (8m 48s):
Money.

4 (8m 49s):
No, that didn't experience, you know, the certain coming of age things. Whether it's, you know, crazy chasing girls, you know, that whole thing. Doing drugs, you know, just being kind of wild. You know, stealing people's statues outta the yard, whatever crazy shit like that you do when you're young. And, and then they reach this point. A lot of it with ath athletes. 'cause they were so focused in their training at such, such a young age. And then they get to that point where they get money and they're like, I wanna taste it all.

3 (9m 15s):
That's

4 (9m 15s):
True. And then they kinda get fucked up.

3 (9m 17s):
Yeah. You can lose your bearings. That's true. That is the case with a lot of athletes. A lot of athletes get fat too. They just fuck it. It's over a lot of fighters. Yeah. 'cause a lot of fighters are always dieting. Well, you

4 (9m 29s):
Get that big muscle and it's so hard to fucking maintain as you get older.

3 (9m 33s):
Yep. That too. You start

4 (9m 34s):
To lose your, lose your lean muscle. You know about all that stuff.

3 (9m 37s):
Yeah.

4 (9m 38s):
All of a sudden, two to 10 beers a night doesn't seem like a bad idea.

3 (9m 42s):
Yeah. Well it's also like, I think with athletes, especially with fighters, the the rush of competition is so extreme that the regular world just seems so dull. And then going back to the regular world, you don't feel like you have a real purpose anymore. You're not training for this big event that takes place every few months.

4 (10m 1s):
Like coming back from the military.

3 (10m 3s):
Yeah. Like a lighter version of that. That's a big problem with guys coming back from the military. Big problem.

4 (10m 9s):
Huge suicide. Just unbelievable.

3 (10m 11s):
And no coaching at all. Nobody tells you what to do. They just let you back in the world and you're like, fuck.

4 (10m 16s):
Yeah. Seen it too many times.

3 (10m 19s):
Too many times. Too many times. So what's it like being the dude who took out Bud Light?

4 (10m 27s):
Just get right to it. Let's get right to it.

3 (10m 29s):
We were gonna bring a few cases. Lemme sit here for you.

4 (10m 32s):
Switch sunglasses. Fuck out. Drink it. don, don't give a shit. Two kinds of beer in this world. Cold and free. I like 'em both. What? Bring some man. I was just having fun to be honest with you. I mean, I funny was I was pissed. Like, you know, but it wasn't like it was gonna wreck my day yet, yet alone my life. I was just kinda like, what the fuck are they doing

3 (10m 52s):
Is too far? You were the straw that broke the camel's back.

4 (10m 54s):
I became the face of it. Yes. Yeah. I'm not, I'm not the pied piper to sit around and think like people follow what Kid Rock does. I just became the face of it. Yeah.

3 (11m 2s):
But they kinda do, they kind of do. No when, listen man, when you got so upset that you were fucking machine

4 (11m 9s):
Gunning, throwing a tantrum with a machine gun,

3 (11m 11s):
Wha

4 (11m 13s):
Wha

3 (11m 14s):
You machine gun cases. Fuck they wanna put

4 (11m 16s):
Put, they wanna let guys play girls sports. Wha

3 (11m 20s):
That was the end. That was really it. If there's one moment that they look back on and, and fucking go shit. It's that moment, dude, I've talked to him about it. I know you have

4 (11m 30s):
Yeah. You, yeah. You were there at the UFC

3 (11m 32s):
Fight. Yeah. and I met that dude, the ceo, EO Brendan. He's a good guy, man.

4 (11m 35s):
We've become friends.

3 (11m 36s):
He's a good guy. He's a,

4 (11m 37s):
He's a great guy. After five minutes of talking to him, I'm with Trump there in Dana's green room. I go to Trump, I go see that dude behind me. I go, that's the CEO of Bud Light. Or, or Anheuser-Busch. And, and Trump's like, you wanna go talk to him? Which in my mind he was, he Trump said, you wanna go fuck with him? And I'm like, yes, absolutely. So we go over there, we're talking to him, actually a great conversation. And at some point he was telling me how he got the video and he was actually down at Texas doing some hunting. And I'm like, we, we talk and talk and I'm not gonna share all our conversation. That'd probably be inappropriate. But I'm like, I'm like, dude, you seem like somebody I'd fucking be friends with that I'd hang out with.

4 (12m 18s):
He's like, you would? That's what I'm saying. And I'm like, well, come to Nashville, come visit me. He fucking did. That's awesome. Came with his top team. Fucking, we broke bread, got fucked up on Bud Light, fucking bold. Like did all this fun shit. And we had, we had a good meeting beforehand. Trying to think if there's something I could do with, with Anheuser-Busch. And I'm, I just at the, I just didn't feel comfortable with it. You know, I threw out some, I just threw out some ideas that scared the living fuck out 'em. And at the end of the day, I was like, guys, I, I don't feel right taking your money. I was like, I, I go, we can continue the conversation, see where it ends up. But honestly, don don't want any corporate deals. I don't feel right.

4 (12m 58s):
There's not a penny on earth that could make me change who I am or have people look at me in a different way. Right. Even, even though it's probably half the country at this point that Yeah. Likes me. Another half wants to put a bullet in me. I understand that. There's no like, ah, he's okay. Right. I've destroyed that. There's no kid rock's. Okay. It's either I fucking hate that kid or

3 (13m 18s):
I love that dude. Yeah. I'll take

4 (13m 20s):
A bullet for him. Yeah. But you know, we, we still talk and

3 (13m 23s):
That's a better place to be, honestly.

4 (13m 25s):
Yeah. And like I said, you know what I mean, they fucked up. And when you get to the, the grassroots of it, that's what they did. And there's so many people at that work for that company and you know, all the stuff they've done. We don't have to be a broken record here.

3 (13m 35s):
It's a great company. Right. And I'm like, they've done amazing things. Anheuser-Busch is an amazing charitable con company that they do a lot of great things. Yeah. and I dug

4 (13m 43s):
Into that. and I was educated on it even before Dana called me about his deal and things like that. You know, people discussed with me, you know, I did a little digging and talked to people and I'm like, at the end of the day I am like, all right. They got the message. Like, I'm, I'm not someone who holds a fucking grudge this whole life. You know what I mean? And honest to God, I was having a lot of fucking fun. don don't get to pull my machine gun out and fill myself doing cool shit too often. I'm just not that type of person. And I was like, this warrants it right here. Get all the Bud Light on property. That was actually all the beer I had on property. I kept a lot of that shit around more than I thought.

3 (14m 17s):
We stopped selling it. The mothership. 'cause nobody's buying it. They got that bad,

4 (14m 22s):
You know, what's going on there?

3 (14m 23s):
I mean It's nuts. It's stupid. I think it's stupid. And Shane Gillis brought it back a lot. I

4 (14m 27s):
Love Shane. Shane's

3 (14m 28s):
A buddy. He's the best. Yeah. He brought it back a lot, you know, because he never stopped drinking it. And you know, it's, it's slowly making its way back. and I think the UFC helps a lot too. But they took a big hit.

4 (14m 41s):
One of the things I told them was like, I was like, I go from the outside looking in guys as a friend. You know, somebody who doesn't wanna see this, this brand hurt and destroyed anymore. Like you, you got smacked on the ass. Yeah. You know, in a pretty hard spanking. I was like, but I don't wanna hold your head underwater and drown this fucking company. Put people outta work and that shit. It's like, you got the message. And, and it's clear. I, I wish people knew these guys running the company 'cause they're great fucking guys. But I said, I, I said, you know, it's just a percentage of these fucking trolls on the left and on the right. They're like, I'm so empowered by the internet. Yeah. I'm gonna piss and bitch and moan and you know, I have a voice.

4 (15m 22s):
It's like, go fuck yourself. All right. Cut it out. Like if anyone's still spending time on it, you clearly are fucking bored. Find something better to do.

3 (15m 30s):
Yeah. It's definitely a pursuit of losers. But the problem is those losers can actually affect businesses. And that's what they know. They know now that it's possible both on the right and on the left.

4 (15m 40s):
But they need to know there's so many more businesses in this country deserving of that treatment. Right. Fucking Ben and Jerry's, Starbucks target, your list goes on and on. Yeah. and I don't care if they're left wing or right wing, it's just their fucking ideology. Yeah. Like, you know, when they cross that line and signal to people like myself and many others, that they were okay with this transgender thing and and more so at like, is this gonna get directed at my kids? Right. So you think fucking men should be in women's sports? Like, nah, nah, nah, that's where I'm drawing the fucking line. Get the fuck

3 (16m 9s):
Outta here. That's the most amazing one that they're supporting. And the fact that, was it the Olympic Boxing Committee? What was it that just allowed transgender?

4 (16m 17s):
Oh, they're allowing the reverse.

3 (16m 19s):
What do you mean

4 (16m 19s):
They're allowing, they always get confused here. They're biological

3 (16m 23s):
Females

4 (16m 23s):
To fight men. They're lying chicks that sow on dicks to fight dudes. Which I'd tune in for that.

3 (16m 29s):
Is that real?

4 (16m 30s):
I think so. I thought

3 (16m 31s):
It was biological men who identify as females are gonna be allowed to box.

4 (16m 36s):
Might be. I thought it was the other way too. But don don't know. Jamie

3 (16m 39s):
Will find out. Yeah. Yeah. The other one was the, the other one's easy. Sure. You think go ahead, do it. Go for it. But at the end of the day, you're gonna have to take steroids. And it's supposed to be illegal to take steroids. Like if you are taking synthetic testosterone, you're, you're taking steroids. And if so, if you're doing that and you're becoming a man through that, who's to say that the men can't do it too? Like it's just,

4 (17m 4s):
Do we even have to think that deep about it? You can't just look at it and go like, no, that's fucking wrong. Cut it out.

3 (17m 9s):
Well it should 100% be wrong for biological males to compete against biological females. That's just period. Period. And any bullshit that you say like trans women or women, well guess what? They're not, they're not biologically, they're not. They can identify as a woman. You wanna call yourself Sally, I'll, I'll call you Sally. I'm a nice guy. Policy states that minors under the 18 must compete in their birth gender in the weight class outline in the rule book. Transgender women over 18 can only compete in the female category if they undergo genital reassignment surgery and submit to quarterly hormone tests for at least four years following surgery. The guidelines which define normal ranges of testosterone.

3 (17m 49s):
See, but this is just, it's, this is still not good enough. The people don't understand all the differents. I

4 (17m 54s):
Didn't understand any of that.

3 (17m 56s):
I went into it deeply. Unfortunately, transgender men over 18 have to meet similar requirements. They must undergo genital reassignments, transgender men, general reassignment surgery. So you have to get a fake dick. You have to in order to box, submit quarterly. That sounds insane. Are

4 (18m 13s):
There donor dicks?

3 (18m 15s):
They should be. Right. Do you know they can't donate

4 (18m 17s):
Test off? Can't me? Or like a heart or something? Like could you can't, are there donor dicks?

3 (18m 21s):
They definitely do. For guys who get their dicks blown off. They get 'em new dicks. Are they

4 (18m 24s):
Switching? Like, Hey, I want to be a man, I wanna be a woman.

3 (18m 27s):
I haven't heard of that yet, but I'm sure that's coming. But what they do not do is they don't give you the balls. Because if someone switches your balls, like say if you donate your balls, you die in a car accident, you donate your balls to science or whatever and someone takes your balls and sos 'em on. That'll be your kids. Your genes will come out of those balls. So it won't, that won't be like a new person. Yeah.

4 (18m 50s):
What

3 (18m 50s):
The fuck I mean? It won't be like this person's jeans carrying on. It'll be your jeans carrying on through your balls that are attached to this guy. So that'ss not ethical. Why is this

4 (18m 59s):
Always like come up in conversations? Is it the media? Yeah. I mean, because I don't remember the last time like I seen it. And by the way, if you're transgender and you're really fucking good at it, no one knows.

3 (19m 11s):
Right.

4 (19m 12s):
It's usually not the case. Although only time I've been around transgender people was like some crazy club like in Miami or New York back in the day and gotta say fun.

3 (19m 21s):
It was rare.

4 (19m 22s):
Yeah. But I mean you used to have those clubs where they weren't, it'd be fucking blast. No big deal. Yeah. Like if this America freedom, if you wanna fucking be that, go ahead. Like I'll exist with you in society. Yeah. You're probably not getting the dinner invite, but, but you know, if you're out and about, like we can both shop in Walmart. I'm not gonna freakout if you're not fucking with me, I'm not fucking with you. Yeah. No matter

3 (19m 42s):
Who you are. And that's how it should be. Yeah. It's pretty simple. That's how it should be. It's common sense. Yeah. You should be able to do whatever you want. But when you want to compete as a woman or you want to start, you know, if you're a 50-year-old man, you wanna compete against young girls, which is what's going on in Canada. There's a guy's 50 who identifies as a teenage girl. They let 'em compete and swim meets with girls and change in the locker room with 'em. That's you're, you're now, you're insane. Now you're taking it too far. And that's the problem. No one's ever happy with us moving the goalposts a little bit. They wanna move them reestablish, move them further, move them further, move them further.

4 (20m 15s):
I had a thought about that. So I'm thinking like it's black history month. Right. I can get down with that. That makes sense. I think November's like Native American month. I can get down with that. That makes sense. The thing I'm struggling with is pride month and Veteran's Day. Right. See the fucking balance there. Yeah. I'm like, good point. Should we flip that?

3 (20m 39s):
Yeah, that's a good point. That's a real good point. Yeah. It's a weird time man. It's a weird time because there's like so many fucking weird people that are involved in promoting these things and, and pushing them and changing what's normal and what's not normal to regular people.

4 (20m 55s):
It's just fucking weirdos and all those fucking mentally ill fucking nutcases. That's why I, that's honestly why I carry a gun everywhere where I'm legal to. I have somebody with me. It used to be like, okay, if I'm going somewhere where I thought, you know, that would, you know, make sense to do, you know, I've always had a concealed weapons permit everywhere and, and whatnot. I'm gun enthusiasts. But in the last, I don't know how many years, five so many years, it's like, carry a fucking gun everywhere. Just 'cause just 'cause of that. Like, just fucking people that are unstable. You never know one of these motherfuckers is gonna lose it. And you're just sitting there defenseless.

3 (21m 33s):
Yeah. Yeah. It's a strange time man in so many ways. People are just,

4 (21m 39s):
I gotta imagine they were edge. They were saying the same shit in like the sixties and seventies. They were, you know,

3 (21m 44s):
But the sixties and seventies were fucked too. We just forgot because the eighties were so easy. The eighties and the nineties were, everyone was kind of coasting and then, you know,

4 (21m 52s):
Everyone was on blow.

3 (21m 53s):
There was a little bit of that, the eighties. but it was also the, you know, the Cold War ended this collapse of the Soviet Union. We weren't worried. There wasn't like this existential threat hanging over our heads.

4 (22m 4s):
Well now it's back.

3 (22m 5s):
Now it's back. Yeah.

4 (22m 6s):
Fun times. We've, we've done a 360

3 (22m 9s):
Fun times. Real fun Chinese people are entering over the border.

4 (22m 14s):
Unbelievable. Yeah. I had no thought on that. I think I saw it on a t-shirt. I I don't take credit for everything I say 'cause I'm most likely I'm just repeating something I saw somewhere. Right. But it's like, you know, they want to do away with gas stoves. Mega electric, electric cars. Like why don't we start with that wall. I can make that fucker electric. Put up some solar panels.

3 (22m 36s):
Yeah.

4 (22m 37s):
China built one how many thousands of years ago. Fucking make it a Taurus attraction charge. People go fucking hang out in the wall, put some fucking Louis Vuitton stores on it or some shit.

3 (22m 46s):
Well it's, it's a real weird thing like what they're doing and there's so many different people that have opinions about why they're leaving it open and why they're allowing people to come in and, and you know, setting them up. And Dr. Phil was on here yesterday and he was talking about it

4 (22m 58s):
About, I like Dr. Phil,

3 (22m 59s):
He's a great guy. He's starting his own network.

4 (23m 1s):
I played his show years ago.

3 (23m 3s):
Did you?

4 (23m 3s):
It was like so many anniversary show. It turned out it was one of his favorite acts and I fucking played a banjo on there.

3 (23m 9s):
Oh, that's awesome. He's a good dude. Yeah. I know him through I'm, I'm friends with his son. Son's a good friend of mine. Alright. But he's, he's starting to network. Like he's just so fed up with the news and the way things are portrayed and these biased ways and he wants to have objective news and he, so he created his own

4 (23m 28s):
Network, the HR department.

3 (23m 29s):
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. That's a fucking very Bazar time. And I'm sure it's gonna get more Bazar. We're gonna look back on these days. One day like, oh remember the good old days where you just, all you're complaining about was transgender women competing in sports. Yeah.

4 (23m 44s):
Kid only wanted to be a cat. Took a litter box to school. Fuck the good old days.

3 (23m 50s):
Yeah. People don't get better. Like society doesn't get better. Just gets, unless something happens, unless they figure out some sort of mind reading

4 (23m 58s):
Software. Well, unfortunately, usually that turns out to be tragedy. Right. And when something really fucked up happens, you know, like what happened in Israel or worse. Right. That tends to bring nations and people together on different levels. Unfortunately,

3 (24m 12s):
Like nine 11, remember nine 11?

4 (24m 14s):
Yeah, absolutely.

3 (24m 15s):
When nine 11 happened, I tell everybody, like even in Los Angeles, which is probably the most unpatriotic place on earth, everybody had an American flag on their car. People were letting people in lanes, they were waving to people. They were friendly, they felt united. I remember it was interesting, I remember it didn't last long a few months. Everybody

4 (24m 34s):
Ha half the country didn't hate George W. Bush for almost 48 hours.

3 (24m 39s):
They didn't hate him at all when he gave that one great speech.

4 (24m 42s):
No I mean it was, it was a couple weeks or a couple months, whatever it was. But then things kinda went back to normal. There

3 (24m 48s):
Was a lot of liberals that liked him after that. They were like, that's what you want when you're in times of war. You want a strong leader. That's

4 (24m 54s):
Too bad. We can't get to that without, you know, having something terrible happen. I know if we could just have a little more civil discourse in this country, you can tell me to go fuck myself. You, you hate Trump and my politics, I'll be fuck you. But I'll still sit down and have a beer with you. Like we, we don't have to have this fucking goddamn going over your throat. And I'm part of the problem. I've, I've been polarizing, you know? No, no question. My last album. That's what it was all about. But, or a, a good portion of it. and I understand that. But I even said that album I was like, I'm gonna get this outta my system and hopefully we can go back to having some civil discourse in this country. Did you think that was actually one of my, that was actually one of my suggestions to, to Bud Light I was like, what if you could use this to not only make fun, my thing was like, you guys need to poke fun at this.

4 (25m 38s):
Like, people aren't here 'cause you didn't apologize. I'm like, I don't necessarily agree with apologizing over everything. In this day and age. Everything's become a fucking big, I'm sorry. Fuck that. Like, what you should do is like, make fun of the situation. Have something that shows light of the situation, but do it in that fun fucking Anheuser-Busch Old School. Funny fucking way. We're like, we get it. We fucked up. Like, you know, while we don't, I I, I told Brendan I was like, whoever coached you on that CBS morning show, I was like, you were coached. Right. He was like, I was I was like, fucking Gail King set it up. She goes, would you send that can back to that influencer? And he goes into this, well, Anheuser-Busch has been supporting, you know, the LG BT A, B, CD.

4 (26m 18s):
I'm like, what the fuck, man? All you had to do was say like, look, no, we would not, while we want everyone to enjoy our beer, we understand that we shouldn't be sticking our noses into polarizing conversations. And we understand who our market is. And at the end of the day, we're in business to sell beer, keep people employed for shock to shareholders back, you know, a return fucking end of it. You didn't have to throw trans people under the bus and all that shit. Right. You just fucking I was like, fuck.

3 (26m 47s):
That's actually good advice.

4 (26m 50s):
Yeah.

3 (26m 51s):
It's pretty solid advice

4 (26m 53s):
Ladies and gentlemen. Introducing the head of marketing for Bud Light. Kid Rock.

3 (26m 58s):
That would be their ultimate move.

4 (26m 60s):
Be funny shit.

3 (27m 1s):
Are you you

4 (27m 2s):
To commercial? Told him I commercial, we should do a skit like the Kenny Powers case list.

3 (27m 6s):
A hundred percent.

4 (27m 8s):
But it's like, you know, I walk in as VP start fucking with people

3 (27m 13s):
That would work. But they need to get back to, you know, remember we used, they used to have those real men of Genius ads. It was fun. It was Bud Light was fun. It was a fun I did, I did a tour with those guys, the real men of comedy. I

4 (27m 26s):
Can't believe looking through all my old pictures, how many pictures I found with like fucking Bud Light in my hand. Like fishing, doing something. Or like playing Sturgis with a big Bud Light, you know, next to the stage. Like, yeah, you know, I've done so much. Cool. Good shit. But

3 (27m 39s):
Well that's why when a guy like you shoots the cans, everybody goes, oh, that's it. It's over. It's over.

4 (27m 45s):
And trust me, I don't have one of these teams of people. It's like, right. It's me. Like, you know, maybe Corey was here with me. I'm like, ah, let's have some fun. Go get all the fucking tell farm guys to get all the fucking Bud Light shit together and grab, grab my fucking MP five.

3 (28m 1s):
Yeah. I didn't think you ran that by a marketing department. No.

4 (28m 4s):
There's not much that goes through one

3 (28m 6s):
Over here. Well, a marketing department for a guy like you would just fuck things up. What kind of advice could they possibly give you? They'd have to be maniacs too. And then they would never be in marketing. I've had more

4 (28m 16s):
People, managers and stuff through the years. Tell me. Which I took as a compliment. They, they told me like, just everything you've done to get where you're at. I would've told you no.

3 (28m 26s):
Yeah.

4 (28m 27s):
And I think that's honest. 'cause I get, you know, done some, I guess you could call it crazy polarizing, whatever type of shit. Just, it's really, I just, I speak my mind. I haven't changed one bit. I came out fucking like this with middle fingers on the CDs, like, yeah. and I haven't changed, but holy shit the times have.

3 (28m 44s):
Yeah. Well it's obvious though that it's all you, that's what people like in this day and age where everything is sort of planned ahead and Oh, it's bullshit and scripted. And

4 (28m 55s):
You've seen behind the curtain Sure. Of these pop stars people, big levels and their teams and everything's fucking, they're

3 (29m 1s):
Trapped.

4 (29m 1s):
It's like a politician, you know, like bidet that won't, can't say anything off the teleprompter.

3 (29m 6s):
Well, Of course he can't. but it, it's also, it's, you got a whole team of people behind you. You got a bunch of people that wanna keep their jobs and they wanna play it safe. They wanna play it safe, and they wanna figure out which way's the wind blowing. This is what we're gonna do. And you see it in celebrities and people turn on 'em now because it's like so disingenuous and they realize what you're doing. You can see right through it. You're gonna lose a giant percentage of your people that knowing that a marketing team is behind everything you say. Right. So when a guy like you, it's obvious that that was your idea. Like,

4 (29m 36s):
Who

3 (29m 37s):
The fuck is gonna say

4 (29m 38s):
It wasn't even an idea.

3 (29m 39s):
Whatever it was, a thought that popped into your head that you acted on.

4 (29m 42s):
That's pretty much what it

3 (29m 43s):
Is. Yeah. That's, that's obvious. But that's, that's what

4 (29m 45s):
They all are.

3 (29m 46s):
That's

4 (29m 46s):
What

3 (29m 46s):
People like, that's what people like, they, they're like real people.

4 (29m 50s):
And sometimes you don't always turn a 10, you're like, no. Oh yeah. Maybe I should have thought that one through a little bit more.

3 (29m 56s):
Most of the things I say I mean, think about I mean. I've done so many podcasts hammered and then after we're, we're all listening or thinking about what we said. Like what did we say? Like,

4 (30m 5s):
Oh boy, story of my fucking life.

3 (30m 8s):
Yeah. But people like that. They like real humans. They don't want some fucking pre-programmed bullshit shoved down their throat just to make a little bit more money. That's

4 (30m 16s):
Incredible. No one's that kind of seems like a big, a big chunk of the country Yeah. Wants that. They want to go back to this normal, fucked up DC all the bullshit that's been going on there. I, I would dare say in our, for our lifetimes, we've just, it's just become a lot, lot more out in the open for several reasons. You know, social media and, and the, the sharing of media worldwide and fucking Trump pulling everyone's fucking pants down there. Yeah. Showing them. Look, everyone has a small penis in this fucking town. See, I just showed it to you. They act like they have the biggest dicks on earth.

3 (30m 49s):
One thing no one can deny is that he exposed the media, expose the media for being essentially a propaganda agent. It's not just the news. Yep. And to pretend it's the news. They never covered anything that he did that was positive anything. Had some negative spin on it. They spent years talking about some fake collusion story with Russia and never apologized for it. Never took it back. And they'll allow people on the show to, to, to, to support that, to try to justify that or to try to even say that it's not true that he did co collaborate with Russia. How

4 (31m 29s):
Many times have been watching the evening news? I'm a sucker for news. Like, and I've flipped between 'em. I'll flip between CNN and M-S-N-B-C and Fox, you know, mainly Fox. But then I'll watch the evening news. I watch a, b, C one night. NBC and this is one, this is just one example. There's a million of 'em as you know, but like they're talking about January 6th and they completely edit his speech. Yeah. They take out the part where he says it's marched down there peacefully or whatever. Yeah. He actually says that and they cut it out. He says, we're gonna march down the capitol. Cut. Yeah. And then they go, if you don't fight like hell, you're not gonna have a country. Yep.

3 (32m 4s):
I mean, how

4 (32m 4s):
The fuck do they get away with that?

3 (32m 6s):
They, they get away with it because they are the news and no one's checking them. There's not another new, if the news was real, the other news organizations would go, this is horrible propaganda. And what you've done is you, you've edited out a former president, you've changed his words. This should be illegal. You're taking it completely outta context. The whole thing is so fucking screwball. Every single presidential race we've ever had that I can remember people contested the results. Hillary Clinton,

4 (32m 38s):
Hillary Clinton did it. And Stacey Abrams, they all said, no fucking big deal.

3 (32m 43s):
He didn't really win the election. They all said there was Russian collusion. They all said that he was essentially an agent of Russia. They all said that he's an illegitimate president. They all said that he didn't win the election. They all said that. There was so many people that said it. It was nuts.

4 (33m 1s):
Oh, pencil neck, fucking dick. Fuck Adam Schiff.

3 (33m 6s):
It's, it's crazy how people still listen to those folks.

4 (33m 10s):
It was

3 (33m 10s):
Crazy about

4 (33m 10s):
Could be

3 (33m 11s):
Wrong though. How about

4 (33m 11s):
That election? I'm not a conspiracy guy or whatever, but I'm like, fucking, it just seems like shenanigans, which

3 (33m 18s):
I love. When anybody says, I'm not a conspiracy guy, does that I

4 (33m 20s):
Mean I'm

3 (33m 20s):
A conspiracy?

4 (33m 22s):
I'm a total fucking conspiracy guy. Fuck it. I don. I don't give a shit either way. But I was like, there's so many fucking shenanigans that I just, it's coming so fast with the covid shit and the ballots all over the place. You know, secretary of States are taking liberties. But

3 (33m 37s):
Here's my position on it.

4 (33m 38s):
But wait, lemme finish this one. It was, it was that, hold on, did I lose my train of thought? Secretary of States? It was, it was that, okay, so these, the biggest corporations on the face of the earth are getting hacked.

3 (33m 51s):
Right.

4 (33m 51s):
But there's absolutely no way you can get in this election thing. I'm like, then why aren't these corporations using that technology? Why are they still getting fucking hacked? That doesn't just make up in, I just can't figure that out in my fucking mind. Well,

3 (34m 5s):
The, the thing the statement is, there's no evidence that they've been hacked. Doesn't

4 (34m 8s):
Mean, yeah, it ain't a crime, but you don't get caught

3 (34m 10s):
Either. It is true. But there, there is evidence that you can hack those machines. Right? There is, and wasn't, wasn't that Jamie the subject of they were gonna update the machines in 2024 or something like that, but they, they're gonna, they're gonna update 'em. But they weren't at, at a certain point in time when they were recording this, where they were reporting on this rather. They, they had it updated them. Here's my, my take on this ele election fraud is never zero. It's not 0%. Right. We can all agree to that. Right? I think we can all agree that there's people that are complete maniacs, that are maniacs for the Democrats or maniacs for the Republicans, and they will do whatever the fuck it takes to get their person to win.

3 (34m 55s):
There are certain human beings like that, that exist, especially in these like very polarized groups. And especially when you've got a guy that you've been comparing to Hitler forever. So you can kind of treat as if Hitler's coming, let's stop Hitler. Let's literal Literally you can think like that. Well, they're doing it right now. You get people to think like that. And the, the moral question would be if you knew you could stop Hitler from being president, would you do it? And how would you do it? And then they act that way. It's much bullshit. But what they don't recognize is that is deeply un-American. And the only way you're gonna beat this person or any person who runs for president is to be better than them.

3 (35m 39s):
That's what this country's supposed to be about. It's supposed to be about a meritocracy. It's supposed to be who is the best leader? Is it her? Is it him? Who is it? Who's the best leader? And that's the person we should gravitate towards. Who has the mo the ideas that make the most sense, who's the one who understands what the fuck is going on internationally on a deep sense? Really can tell you like what the, the, the people, the puppeteers behind the strings. Like how this is all happening.

4 (36m 5s):
Well, I think a lot of that would be taken away if we cap the money. Like you can raise, yes. Let's call it $10 million. Yes. You can each raise $10 million. Now let's see who spends it. The wisest,

3 (36m 16s):
Well it's, it seems insane that you could just donate fucking untold millions of dollars. These super pacs and they can support these presidents. They're essentially running the country. 'cause you can't beat them. And they play dirty. They play so dirty. I mean it's kind of impressive. But it's also, you are, they're exposing the wiring under the machine in a, in a way that it's never been exposed before. You know, we never were totally aware of how wild it is that, you know, there's a group of people that no one ever thinks about called the deep State that is real. and

4 (36m 53s):
It's like, oh, they're, they're gonna run bidet right out of there. Make no mistake. Oh,

3 (36m 56s):
They're running him out right now. They're

4 (36m 57s):
Fucking running him out.

3 (36m 58s):
That's why all these crimes or all these, these things he's being charged for. And then that judge's decision. How about that judge's decision that he was too mentally compromised to, to be tried.

4 (37m 11s):
That was the prosecutor's decision? Or what was

3 (37m 14s):
That? Is that, what was

4 (37m 14s):
The investigators? Her whatever his name was HUR. So who was it? And that was in his report?

3 (37m 19s):
Yeah. Let's see. But do you need that? The exact quote was, does

4 (37m 22s):
Anybody out there need that fucking report to just watch this guy and go like, Of. course not. Hey, I feel bad for him. He's fucking old. Right? We're all gonna get there someday, right? Yeah. It's like, can you not fucking look at this guy and go like some, I can look in his fucking eyes and go like, something's not fucking there, something's wrong.

3 (37m 39s):
It's the people that work under him. Because if they, if he goes, they go, then everybody gets appointed by the new person. The report described the

4 (37m 47s):
Special counsel.

3 (37m 48s):
Yeah. Okay. Spec did the, the report described the 81-year-old Democrat's memory as, I wonder why they write that. The 81-year-old Democrat. How about the president? How about the president's memory as hazy, fuzzy, faulty, poor, and having significant limitations? It noted that bidet could not recall defining milestones in his own life, such as when his son Bo died or when he served as vice president.

4 (38m 13s):
God, God bless his son.

3 (38m 15s):
But thi think about just that, the way they wrote that, the 81-year-old Democrats memory. Why would they write that? That seems so nuts.

4 (38m 25s):
Little political. He's

3 (38m 26s):
The president. He's not just a random Democrat. Like what defines him? If you've got one word you go with Democrat.

4 (38m 33s):
Is is that the, is that the Washington AP writing that or is that in the special prosecutor's report? I was unclear.

3 (38m 39s):
I was unclear as well.

4 (38m 41s):
Because that's different, right? Of course, the AP iss gonna say that

3 (38m 44s):
Of course. But he didn't say I don.

4 (38m 45s):
I can't see the special prosecutor saying that, but

3 (38m 47s):
It's just No, I don't think so.

4 (38m 48s):
Because then it sounds very political. Yeah,

3 (38m 49s):
But it's, it's such a crazy thing to say, to call him a Democrat. He's the president, he's our leader.

4 (38m 55s):
That's, I would put past the media.

3 (38m 57s):
It's wild. but it, this is why what I'm saying about like, the wiring under the board has been exposed in a way that has never been exposed before. What you're looking at and you go, what,

4 (39m 6s):
What

3 (39m 6s):
Are you guys doing? He can't, he can't stand trial 'cause he's mentally unfit. But he can run the country. Don't worry about it.

4 (39m 13s):
He can't

3 (39m 13s):
Speak and he's gonna run again. He can hardly

4 (39m 15s):
Fucking walk.

3 (39m 16s):
But it seems like when they release information like that, they know what they're doing. They're slowly chipping away at it. And by the time, probably I would say like May rolls around, it'll probably be Gavin Newsom. That would be my guess if I was, I'm not like playing this sport. So I'm watching it from the sideline. I'm like, what would I do? How would I, what moves would I do? I can't.

4 (39m 37s):
How the fuck can they run? GII keep hearing that Gavin Newsome, Michelle Obama, like Gavin News. How the fuck when, when you just look at California, one of the most beautiful states, arguably the most beautiful Yep. In America resources for days, fucking everything. and it just, him fucking Pelosi, fucking Maxine Waters, fucking Adam Chip. They just fucked the whole state up. Like fucked it up. Everybody's running for the fucking hills.

3 (40m 5s):
You gotta wonder how much of it is by design. You gotta wonder of it. How much is designed to make the population more unstable, more violent, more scared, more crime, less, less ability to prosper. Everybody goes like, everyone's much more vulnerable.

4 (40m 25s):
Well, this seems like a lot of work of the Democrats though.

3 (40m 29s):
It seems crime something is probably behind it that's bigger than that. And if I would guess it's

4 (40m 36s):
Probably you're not a conspiracy theist.

3 (40m 38s):
I'm a hundred percent a conspiracy theorist. Right? Fuck I, I love a good conspiracy. Let's, let's be good. I believed in Bigfoot until about eight years ago. Fucking

4 (40m 45s):
The Yeti's, another story. I didn't say I didn't believe in the Yeti.

3 (40m 50s):
I don't anymore, but I, I was all in for a while. But I've been, I've been down so many rabbit holes, so many nine, 11 rabbit holes, so many, you know, Bohemian grove rabbit holes.

4 (41m 1s):
I went down woods with bones and I got kicked out.

3 (41m 4s):
Did you, you went to The Grove? Yeah. Oh shit. Why'd you get kicked out? Fucking

4 (41m 8s):
Weird. Fucking weird. I punched a kid in the head.

3 (41m 11s):
You punched a kid in the head in Bohemian Grove.

4 (41m 14s):
Yeah. It turns out, it turns out this fucking kid was an infiltrator. So then after that I was kind of this hero. Like a year or two later, he come back. I was like, I'm not coming to your little fucking weird party out in the fucking woods. I was like, I went once. It ain't that cool.

3 (41m 29s):
So the infiltrator, what happened with you and the infiltrator?

4 (41m 33s):
We were sitting on, we were sitting around this fire. You have these little, they're kinda like tree houses or campsites, but they're really nice. Everyone has a private chef got like, you know, really? Yeah, you do share a room. Me and Jimmy John shared a room that was fun. and I can't remember kids talking around this fire and he just pop start popping that shit. and I just fucking went at him. Oh. Gave him a couple, helped him up. I was like, Hey, we good. Well, we were, I think, you know, we weren't on great terms, but I think we had an understanding. It wasn't, it was just, you know, one of those things. And then I couldn't go to the, to the concert that night. I think Zach Brown or somebody was playing like, you can't come.

3 (42m 11s):
Oh my God.

4 (42m 11s):
And I had just sit home like I was in fucking time out or something. I'm like, fuck this place.

3 (42m 15s):
Meanwhile, your Kid Rock and you're getting left alone by these people with some fucking crazy person. And you defend yourself.

4 (42m 23s):
Fucking weird.

3 (42m 24s):
There's gonna be a certain percentage of people that are just out of their fucking minds. And if you haven't vetted them, that's on you. He'll

4 (42m 30s):
Kick them out. Hey, for all I remember, it could have been drunk shit or whatever. It wasn't the end of the world. It was a little tussle and a little hit the ground, maybe a punch here and there it was like, you know, then it was done. It wasn't like, you know,

3 (42m 39s):
But it was a fight. I guess you, you're just a nice guy. You didn't beat him. The death, it was a

4 (42m 43s):
T it was a tussle.

3 (42m 44s):
You're a nice guy. But it's how many people infiltrate that place? Because a bunch of people have filmed videos there now.

4 (42m 51s):
I have no idea.

3 (42m 52s):
Alex Jones was the first. Him and John Ronson, this is back before Alex Jones' persona non grata. And people would do legit, like legitimate journalists, like John Ronson would do these things with him. Not familiar. You never seen that video of them in Bohemian? I've

4 (43m 6s):
Never heard of John Ronson.

3 (43m 7s):
John Ronson's a brilliant guy. He's a, what, what is his ex? He's an author. He wrote that book. So you're getting publicly shamed about like social media shaming, you know, like, he's an interesting guy. He's a very funny guy. But he, so he went with Alex to Bohemian Grove and they filmed these rituals, these people dressed like Druids. And they're burning this effigy in front of a giant owl statue. Oh, the

4 (43m 30s):
Owl was at the owl statue. This is fucking hilarious. So I'm there on day one, right? And we're drinking beers. Like it's pretty laid back there. There's some really cool talks. I remember this dude talking about shooting asteroids out that might hit the earth. And so many years, shit like that. I'm like, fuck, this is cool. Oh wow. But the first day, it was the first evening, and you gather around whatever, the owl by this lake, if I remember correctly, which could be a little hazy. It was a long time ago. And like, I'm, I'm, I've heard about this place. I'm like, this is some real secret ass shit, man. I can't believe I'm fucking here. Right? And it's just a trove of celebrities fucking everywhere you turn, it's just fucking a, fucking a. So you go there and I'm like thinking we're gonna hear some shit, right? They're, they're about to introduce the first speaker and I'm like, fuck, this is gonna be some shit.

4 (44m 13s):
And they're like, and no offense against this guy. We, I, we consider him friendly. We have very good mutual friends, but they're like, ladies and gentlemen, Tony Danza. And I'm like, and I'm like, what? I'm like, come on man. Who's a fucking boss? Tell them bitches. Which he would've just gone up there and been like, who's the boss bitch? Like,

3 (44m 32s):
That's hilarious.

4 (44m 33s):
I was like, no fucking way, man. I was like, we came all the way to this secret as shit. and I love Tony fucking love him. But I'm like, come on man. I was like, they brought Reagan back from the dead and he's got a speaker hologram or some shit. Like

3 (44m 48s):
You were hoping for some devil shit.

4 (44m 50s):
Just some crazy shit one way or the other. He was, he was a very good speaker, I gotta say. But maybe

3 (44m 54s):
They toned it down. Maybe they toned it down

4 (44m 56s):
After. This has be 20

3 (44m 57s):
Years ago. Infiltrated. Oh really?

4 (44m 58s):
I, I'm terrible with dates, but it's long time ago.

3 (45m 1s):
Okay. Because when Alex snuck in was like, this is like the nineties, Jamie, what was it like when Alex Jones and John Ronson snuck into Bohemian Grove? That's when they first got that video. I, I wanna say it was in the nineties. I wanna say it was like 99 or something like that. I

4 (45m 19s):
Did have some fun there. I gotta say it was fucking weird. I met like Paul Pelosi and his son. Oh

3 (45m 24s):
Boy.

4 (45m 25s):
And like Chris Matthews, like, you know. Oh, okay. But I was hanging out with them. We were having cool conversations. I understand. Kind of weird. And then they asked me like, I had to come play my guitar.

3 (45m 34s):
Oh no.

4 (45m 35s):
And like sing at one of these camp things. And I was like, I feel so used.

3 (45m 41s):
I feel

4 (45m 41s):
So dirty. Like, I don't do this shit, man. What the fuck?

3 (45m 47s):
Yeah. That's gotta be weird. Hey man, play us a song.

4 (45m 50s):
Well it's kind of like a unspoken requirement. Like a wink wink. Like you, oh, you need to take your guitar over there. You know, if you wanna be in good graces or be a team player type deal. And I'm like, yeah, I really don't.

3 (46m 3s):
A friend of mine went to a party and in the middle of the party, Michael Bolton just starts singing and everybody gathers around while Michael Bolton was standing there singing.

4 (46m 14s):
Was it set

3 (46m 14s):
Up? Yeah, it was set up. Oh, that's funny. But no one knew. And all of a sudden, like, I think no one knew. How do you know? Didn't know. but it was just like, what's going on

4 (46m 23s):
Then? How do you know? All of a

3 (46m 24s):
Sudden Michael Bolton singing and everyone would just be quiet. It's

4 (46m 27s):
Not a bad strategy if you want, don't wanna look like a putt to like, otherwise you're just like, Hey, these motherfuckers paid me a shit ton of money and I'm gonna sing some songs.

3 (46m 34s):
Right. That's what it is. It's like the ultimate flex, you know? Yeah.

4 (46m 39s):
That's how I used to fund my foundation to a corporate gigs.

3 (46m 42s):
Dude, Dana White had a birthday party and I've

4 (46m 45s):
Played it a

3 (46m 45s):
Few times. I know, you have I know you have and Dana White's birthday parties are wild. And he had a birthday party, I think it was for his 40th and Stone Temple pilots played, dude, they put on a show like it was a fucking packed arena. That's what I did. I mean I know. You do ask

4 (47m 0s):
Dana I know that's what exactly what he said to me. He goes, there's 150 people here. He goes, where'd you think you were? I was like, fucking at and t Stadium.

3 (47m 8s):
That's exactly what he told me.

4 (47m 9s):
You kind of gotta put yourself in that mindset.

3 (47m 11s):
Fuck yeah. Yeah. Because

4 (47m 12s):
Those things can be fucking grueling.

3 (47m 14s):
Right. They can be weird if people aren't paying attention. And the Stone Temple palaces thing, there wasn't a lot of people there. There was only a few hundred people there. It was crazy to see.

4 (47m 23s):
That's usually what they are. A couple hundred people.

3 (47m 25s):
Dude

4 (47m 25s):
Was killing it.

3 (47m 26s):
Killing it. He had the bullhorn out and everything. Oh, Scott was the best man. Oh my God. What an animal. That guy was like, it was so inspiring. Like how good he was at performing. Yeah.

4 (47m 36s):
He was fucking loved. Scott. God bless him.

3 (47m 39s):
They, they killed that show. It was really good, man. It was really good. And you felt like super lucky to be there.

4 (47m 46s):
That's great.

3 (47m 47s):
You know, there's something about seeing something where there's not a lot of people around to see it. You know? That's why I like watching those UFC fights in the Apex Center. There's something about, even though I know the world, seeing it on video, like to be there live while that's happening, can, that was one of the positive things about Covid. Can we talk

4 (48m 4s):
About that punch at the last fucking one we were at sitting there that fucking, I think it was the second Josh

3 (48m 11s):
Emmett. Yeah.

4 (48m 12s):
That crack.

3 (48m 13s):
Oh my God. Dude, that guy punches

4 (48m 15s):
So far I, I've only been to a handful of the fights. I know you've fucking, obviously that's your

3 (48m 19s):
Josh Emmett might be the hardest puncher in that division.

4 (48m 21s):
I've never heard anything like that. Yeah. He

3 (48m 23s):
Hit so hard. I thought

4 (48m 24s):
The guy was dead.

3 (48m 25s):
Yeah. Well that was a crazy combination of Bryce Mitchell moving forward quick, and then him catching him right at the end of one of the most powerful punchers ever in in the 145 pound division. Yeah. Show that again. Watch this. Look. Look at how that dude's built. I mean

4 (48m 42s):
You can't appreciate it without the smack smack

3 (48m 44s):
Look at the fucking physique on this animal. I mean Josh Hammer is just a ball muscle, bro. That guy hits,

4 (48m 53s):
It sounded like somebody smacked a two by four, like against a garbage can.

3 (48m 57s):
Bro. If that guy hits anybody, they go night. Night. I mean anybody. Damn anybody. He had this fight with Michael Johnson and it was a real, Michael Johnson's a really good fighter. Like he, he knocked out Dustin Poer at one point. Damn. Michael Johnson's very, very legit. And Michael Johnson's winning the fight. And Josh Emmett catches him with one punch and just shuts him off. Watch this. So Michael Johnson's winning this fight.

4 (49m 26s):
Boom.

3 (49m 28s):
One shot dude. One shot I mean crazy power man. I mean his power is preposterous. He's got the total touch. What Aha calls the touch of death. That's the touch of death. Wow. He's got it. He's got it better than anybody in the sport. The touch of death. But that ilio por guy that just knocked out Vol, Kowski, he's got the touch of death too. There's guys that just, these guys

4 (49m 53s):
Are getting bigger. Not they're just getting stronger, but their techniques getting better. It's like any sport. It just keeps,

3 (49m 59s):
There's a lot of factors. There's a lot of factors to kind to having that kind of power. And some of it is just pure genetics. Some of it is just, you just got lucky. You got that frame, whatever it is. Like Josh, he's built, like, if you look at his body, it's just like a fucking tank. Just his ball of muscle. And he gets so much force into it. And that's just a gigantic advantage if you use it correctly, like por does. Did you see that fight with por vol? Kosky?

4 (50m 25s):
I still don't know all the names. I know a handful of names. It

3 (50m 27s):
Was the featherweight title this past weekend. It was I, Alexander Kinski. He was trying to defend his title against Ilya Topoya. And Kinski had been dominant in this division forever. He's and Topoya put him to sleep. Man, this is not the fight by the way. This is just like, yeah, the lead up to the fight. Yeah. Topoya. He put him to sleep. It was wild to see, man, this kid is a fucking monster and he's only 27 years old. And he said he was gonna do it. He said, I'm gonna knock him out in the second round.

4 (50m 59s):
Well do any of those guys go and go like, you know, I, my my chances are about 50 50 on this one. No,

3 (51m 5s):
Some, some guys have respect, you know, for their opponents. Right. And they, they, they say things like, that's kind of, he's a great champion.

4 (51m 12s):
That's no fun though. Yeah. That's no fun. This is a talk shit sport.

3 (51m 16s):
It is.

4 (51m 17s):
And it hypes up the match. It gets everybody going. Yeah. Fucking

3 (51m 20s):
And it's also part of the psychological warfare. 'cause that shit works. Yeah. Especially on some people. Some people like Nate Diaz doesn't work on at all. You can talk shit to him. All day long. I like Nate that that's not gonna change anything about the kind of ass whooping you're gonna get. But for some guys it fucks with their head hardcore. They just have a really hard time with someone talking shit about them. And they get real emotional. It's

4 (51m 42s):
A lot of sports, a lot of fucking, even in my business, in music.

3 (51m 44s):
Yeah.

4 (51m 45s):
You see people when that red, red light comes on, when you're doing something like live or taped to television or whatever, you see people that red light comes on. I have band members. I like 10 of 'em. That's usually one. Somebody just fucking can't keep it together and fucks up. It's just one of those things. It's just something about having that fucking cool, calm, collective fucking mindset. When you're going into anything that's stressful or you know, high energy, whatever it might be.

3 (52m 13s):
How much, how difficult was it for you when you first started getting famous? Because you go from being a regular dude to being Kid Rock and not a lot of time.

4 (52m 25s):
What was it like getting pussy? Not a lot.

3 (52m 27s):
What was it like being the man and just, that's pretty much

4 (52m 29s):
What it was.

3 (52m 31s):
But was it stressful? Was it like hard to deal with? Fuck

4 (52m 35s):
No. Wasn't it all fucking awesome? I love it. It's the greatest fucking shit on earth. I'm like, I don have to worry about fucking buying food. Like, I'm gonna be able to put my kid through college at this point. We're getting a new fucking house. I getting a new car, fucking getting a nice seat at the restaurant. Yeah. Fucking no problem with that. I I, I'm not one of those people that bitch about it like, it's

3 (52m 58s):
So tough. What do you think it is? It's so tough. What do you think about people that can't handle it? Like, why, what do you think it is? Fucking

4 (53m 3s):
Get away from it. Britney Spears moved back to wherever the fuck you're from. Where's she from? Arkansas or Louisiana or something. I. don know. Somewhere down there. Get the fuck outta la and Place is eating you fucking alive.

3 (53m 15s):
I think Brittany's in Vegas now, right? Oh,

4 (53m 17s):
So much better.

3 (53m 18s):
Yeah. It's better for her health.

4 (53m 20s):
You know, I'm not gonna do heroin anymore. I've, I've stepped it down to crack

3 (53m 24s):
And gambling

4 (53m 26s):
And get a, there's ways to get away from it. Yeah, there's ways. Trust me, you know this too. Yeah. So many of these people, 'cause I've been here and seen this first fucking hand of the front row seat. Half these people are telling these people, they're feeding the machine through a source to get their story told. They're telling them where they're gonna be at. So the paparazzi's there. Yeah, it's a fucking game.

3 (53m 50s):
It's a publicity game. It's weird. and it works. You can make a lot of money that way. Who the fuck, don don't the game.

4 (53m 56s):
Like I, I had, that's

3 (53m 57s):
What the Kardashians did Exactly. Worked out. Worked out well.

4 (54m 1s):
God bless 'em.

3 (54m 1s):
Solid business model for them really worked. Like if you just wanna make money, that's the way to

4 (54m 6s):
Do it. I will never get the big ass thing don don't get it. I just right over my head.

3 (54m 13s):
You don't like big asses at all? No. Really? You like 'em little

4 (54m 16s):
Just fucking small white pancake ass with huge tits.

3 (54m 23s):
Every man has his

4 (54m 24s):
Type. I don't know. Yeah. That's all I'm saying. Everybody has his type, but, but there's like this fucking ass movement in the last 10. Somebody was, it's awesome. It's awesome to watch watching rap videos and shit. It's fucking great. I'm like, really? That's all right.

3 (54m 39s):
You just don't know the, what the appeal is. None. Wow.

4 (54m 43s):
None.

3 (54m 44s):
I don't think I could be further from you in that department. I love a good ass. Yeah. A big well girl. Like, looks like she could

4 (54m 51s):
Qualy stone different strokes from different folks. Girls

3 (54m 53s):
Look like they can pick up heavy kettlebells.

4 (54m 56s):
Oh God. I don't have a, he, I don't have a heavy kettlebell. I'm working with the old two pound hand weight out here.

3 (55m 7s):
Different strokes for different folks. And isn't that the message anyway? Yeah. For the world. Totally. It's really what it should be.

4 (55m 13s):
I'd say everything against it. I'm just saying don, don't get it. Yeah,

3 (55m 16s):
I get that. You don't get it.

4 (55m 19s):
And that's

3 (55m 19s):
Okay. You got like a 1970 sensibility, you know? Yeah. The Catherine Bach days. Oh yeah. Dukes of Hs. Oh fuck. Remember how hot she was?

4 (55m 28s):
See if if a girl with a huge ass drove drove up in the general e, I'd definitely be excited.

3 (55m 34s):
That lady was so pretty. Oh my God. I remember watching that show. Thinking that's not even possible to be that pretty. How the fuck is she that pretty,

4 (55m 42s):
All those shows. Love Boat, fantasy Island, Dukes of Hazard. How about

3 (55m 47s):
Charlie's Angels? Charlie's Angel. Hot Chicks. Chicks out there solving crimes. Fuck yeah.

4 (55m 50s):
With guns Sold Fantasy Island. Like they got a fucking midget. You're like, yes, welcome.

3 (55m 57s):
Come to Fantasy Island. He's

4 (55m 58s):
In a suit. They got a little guy in the suit. Like fucking, he's got an accent. Oh fuck. Turn it up.

3 (56m 4s):
Was there always a lesson in Fantasy Island? Like they didn't really need what they were asking for and they should have just like, stayed where they were? Wasn't there like those kind of messages? I don't remember. Did fantasy,

4 (56m 16s):
Wasn't it be kind of like careful what you wish for type thing?

3 (56m 18s):
Yeah, those were always that way. You know, it's always, there's always like a trick. The genie's got a trick. Careful what you wish for. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. It's never like, oh yeah, and then I'm gonna be the king of the world and everything worked out great. You have one wish whom gonna wish for a million wishes that would kill you. Right. If they, if you do that, they get real mad. Like now you abuse the wish.

4 (56m 42s):
Totally.

3 (56m 44s):
Imagine if that was real. Imagine if Jeanie's were real. We're just all looking.

4 (56m 49s):
I was jealous. I was always jealous stuff. Ricky Schroeder on Silver Spoons. I'm like, fuck, look, all these kids got a fucking train in his living room, man. How cool is that? Pinball machines everywhere. Shit. I'm like, fuck, that looks awesome. It's not like I grew up without. It's from a very middle upper class family. We had everything we needed. We had a swimming pool and tennis court and shit, all that. But I was like, fuck Silver Spoons. You're like, we don't have money like that. That's some other shit.

3 (57m 14s):
That's what social media is doing times 10, right? Yeah. Imagine being a kid today and just dealing with all this social media shit.

4 (57m 22s):
Trying to keep up with the Joneses.

3 (57m 24s):
Impossible. Yeah. Just trying to, and

4 (57m 26s):
I think it's even worse. Like I, I have, well my granddaughter's nine, but I have nieces who are teenagers and going through all that stuff and it's man, the influence it has over 'em and then what the other kids say and then what they're all saying on social media and what the new trend is and what the new this, I think it's always been that way, but now it's just exaggerated times a thousand because everything's right there.

3 (57m 47s):
It's a difficult thing for adults to handle. And the the the emotional aspect of going back and forth with people and comments and stuff and the whole world is commenting on things like when they're doing that to each other, the kind of pressure that they're putting under 'em. No kids have ever experienced that before. No kids have ever grown up with that before. This is a totally new pressure. And if you look at the data, like suicide went up, self harm went up, depression went up. It's not healthy, it's not normal. And we're all,

4 (58m 17s):
I think it's the devil. I said that the year Twitter came out, you might be able to look this up. I don Care. I think it was in Rolling Stone or somewhere or whatever. They're like, what do you think about Twitter? and I said, Twitter's fucking gay. This Fre came out. And and so as time went on, 'cause I always saw was people like having a subway sandwich for lunch or whatever. I'm like, no. Gives a fuck.

3 (58m 39s):
Oh, right. The early days. Yeah.

4 (58m 40s):
Like, you know, I get promoting stuff and this, that, and the other. Fucking getting a rise outta somebody stirring the pot. But then the funny part was years later, you know, Twitter blew up to be this huge fucking thing and they're like, this fucking reporter's getting kinda snooty with me. And he is like, you said, and I quote, Twitter's gay. And I'm like, no fucking way. I go, I didn't say that shit. I go and I'm so sick of you fuckers in the media misquoting me every time, every opportunity you get. I said, to be clear, I said, Twitter is fucking gay. All right. Get it. Right.

3 (59m 16s):
The I gotcha. Questions like that. You said,

4 (59m 20s):
Dude, that's why I stopped doing interviews like 10 so many years ago. Yeah. Because, you know, you used to have to promote something called every radio station in every market. It's like, that would be part of your day. Get up early, which I was not good at back then. These days I'm up at three 30. But it's not good at the back in these days. It's like, get up early, call all these different places. All these things like weekly. and it turned into, as the internet and social media started becoming prevalent, it turned into I gotcha. Because that was the headline. And as my publicist used to say, dude, you speak in fucking headlines 'cause you have no fucking filter. and I'm like, I don't, it's gonna be very tough to change that. So it was always this, you know, be your buddy.

4 (1h 0m 0s):
Say some nice things that your new record's great, blah, blah, blah. Then like, fucking get you on the line with something. Of course I go off the fucking rails. Right. And then fucking, that's all you hear about. and it just, you know.

3 (1h 0m 9s):
Well, that's what they want to do.

4 (1h 0m 11s):
They

3 (1h 0m 12s):
Still do. They only have a couple of minutes with you. They wanna say something outrageous or question you in a way that's gonna go viral.

4 (1h 0m 19s):
And I just got tired of dealing with it. I was like fucking Yeah. and I feel bad for so many reporters that were so good to me. Especially in Detroit. You know, that, that I just kind of, I I think a lot of 'em took it personal. Yeah. I I was, I've been meaning to contact for all these years and say like, Hey, this, you know, I'm gonna do stuff with you again. I'm starting to come out of it. I'm doing your show. I'm like, I get it. I got some stuff to promote. I'm like, but I, I just didn't, like, if I never saw another fucking TV camera interview again, I'd be fine. Yeah. I'd be totally fucking fine. Like, I don don't need to be on fucking Good Morning America every week, don. Don't give a fuck.

3 (1h 0m 52s):
But you, you don't have to. You have a, a beautiful setup.

Don don't wanna overshadow that. I'm extremely blessed in

3 (1h 1m 1s):
Oh, I know you appreciate it, but like, the way you're living life. I've talked on this podcast many times about you giving me the tour of your house

Shower. The shower's not gold.

Well, it wasn't in place yet. No, it's happened. It was just a, I just seen the tile and it was golden. And someone told me it was a golden shower. Right. I was like, that's the most amazing thing I've ever seen in my life. The

4 (1h 1m 44s):
Golden urinal. But the

3 (1h 1m 45s):
Walls were gold. Yeah. Yeah. It's all, everything was gold. It was, dude, it was before when I went into it, it was before everything was installed. Was that three, four years ago? Yeah. I think it was three years ago. You

4 (1h 1m 54s):
Have no idea how hard it was to find gold toilets. Not joking. Now you can go on Google, a gold guy and you pump 'em up. Well, I had to get the seat gold plated. 'cause I couldn't find, I found a gold toilet and I couldn't find a seat in a lid. and I fucking guy and fucking God had to like, you know, cheaply gold plate it.

3 (1h 2m 11s):
Well, gold is a weird, you ever see what they can do with gold? They can take a little tiny piece of gold and cover this whole table. Absolutely.

4 (1h 2m 17s):
Very. I get, I get so much shit. Gold plated 18 Kara 24 karat

3 (1h 2m 21s):
Gold plated. Look at that bro. You got a gold

4 (1h 2m 23s):
Urinal where you get that

3 (1h 2m 25s):
Internet. The internet knows everything.

4 (1h 2m 26s):
Fucking, hey, that's on the internet,

3 (1h 2m 27s):
Bro. Look at that. That's amazing. A gold urinal.

4 (1h 2m 34s):
Why

3 (1h 2m 34s):
Not? Your house is incredible. I describe it to everybody. I'm like, there's two bedrooms. The fucking house is gigantic. It's bigger than the actual White House I don. It's got two bedrooms. I think your house is bigger than the actual White House. No. Fuck no. I think so. No way, way. I think, yes. Somebody was telling me that. No fucking

4 (1h 2m 50s):
Way. Yeah. The White House is like a hundred thousand square feet. Are you sure?

3 (1h 2m 53s):
Yeah. That thing looks a little, I've

4 (1h 2m 54s):
Looked it up,

3 (1h 2m 55s):
Isn't it? But the White House has more than one house, right? Like there's two, there's more than one house. Well

4 (1h 2m 59s):
There's, there's levels. There's underground is basement, main floor. Then you go up and up to the, to the main residence. And they have tunnels that go out to, you know, to the other side, to the VP's place where the vol, where the bowling alley is and shit. And

3 (1h 3m 10s):
Bro, is that the dumbest idea of all time to tell everybody where your president's gonna be all the time? What a fucking dumb idea. Oh, he is in this super visible house. It's just a house.

4 (1h 3m 23s):
I think they're pretty protective over

3 (1h 3m 25s):
There. How protective can you be if you've watched those Instagram drones? The

4 (1h 3m 30s):
Airspace is shut down.

3 (1h 3m 31s):
Okay. 55,000 square feet. All I'm gonna, I'm wrong. I thought your house was bigger.

4 (1h 3m 35s):
Nah, mine's 27 or something.

3 (1h 3m 37s):
But what your house is is,

4 (1h 3m 40s):
But it's on 200 acres, not 18.

3 (1h 3m 43s):
Well, your house is as exactly if an 18-year-old kid won the lottery.

4 (1h 3m 47s):
Oh, a hundred percent.

3 (1h 3m 48s):
And sydnee, you can have any house you want. I want a fucking giant room for jacuzzis with like exposed beams like a collapsed mine. I'm like, this is amazing.

4 (1h 3m 60s):
I joke with my friends when we're, when we're touring, I, I love to give people tours. I'm proud of it. You know what I've done and hard work and shit. and I, it's one of my favorite things to do. and I joke with 'em all the time. It, and it is pretty serious. I'm like, if I had this fucking house 15 years ago, something like that, like I'd be dead. I'd be fucking dead. There's no question.

3 (1h 4m 19s):
It's an amazing setup, dude. Thank you. You you made a party house. It's perfect. Beautiful view, great place to be. Fucking

4 (1h 4m 27s):
Awesome, man. I believe if there were advertisers would be a great place to entertain. Yeah. An entertainer's dream.

3 (1h 4m 32s):
An an entertainer's dream. Yeah. If you were trying to sell that. Oh boy. What is it? About 27,000 square feet. How big is it? Yeah,

4 (1h 4m 41s):
I put, but the only reason I patella I put the elevator. 'cause I'm gonna die there. I was like, I'm gonna need to get up and down these floors one day.

3 (1h 4m 49s):
That elevator's amazing too. Golden

4 (1h 4m 52s):
Elevator. That's an funny one. The architect. You know, I, I, that's probably my second favorite thing outside passion outside of, you know, be a close second with hunting and, and the outdoors, you know, as music is interior design and, and architecture. And so I'm designing a house with, I had to, he's an architect obviously, for many reasons, but he's like, are sure you wanna put the elevator right in the foyer of the, of the main entrance. He goes, you know, most people hide it, you know, off to the back by a laundry room or something. I'm like, yeah, I want right in the fucking middle. I want it gold. So people walk in, they're like, kid rock's got a fucking elevator.

3 (1h 5m 29s):
Yeah. Put it right out front bro.

4 (1h 5m 31s):
Yeah.

3 (1h 5m 32s):
Yeah. This is the house for ballers. This

4 (1h 5m 36s):
Is a house of learning doctors and ballers.

3 (1h 5m 40s):
That's an amazing story. That's how I would do it

4 (1h 5m 43s):
With fun. You built something right?

3 (1h 5m 46s):
No, I bought a house. I bought a house right here. But if I was going build a house, I'd build a house like that. I think I want to, you know, what I want to do is I want build a podcast ranch. I've been thinking a lot about that lately. You

4 (1h 5m 56s):
Kinda, this is a good, you got a lot of cool shit here. Like, but you can take all this and like, I've already figured out your lighting here for you. I was telling the guys up front. Oh really? Yeah. So there's several spaces here and there's a lot of light switches I noticed already just from doing a small tour. Fuck Lutron. Fuck Crestron. Fuck that automated shit. Okay. What you do, you can, you might be able to do the whole building. If not, you can do it in sections. That makes sense. Like this whole front thing. Everything's on dimmers and there's one switch when strategically placed when you walk outta the door and maybe somewhere by your office or something. Oh. All hooked up to the same breaker click. Like when I walk into my studio where you bend down there or whatever the, you know, things like 10,000 square feet. There's two light switches.

4 (1h 6m 36s):
Shut everything off in there. Three. 'cause one in the studio, it never breaks. Works perfectly when you turn it on, you're ready to rock. If the cleaning people need to do something, they can adjust the dimmer up or down and it's the cheapest, smartest, most efficient fucking thing you could do. Mm.

3 (1h 6m 51s):
Good advice from Kid Rock love. I love that shit. Yeah. That's, that's good advice. Yeah. This place is a little chaotic. But this was used to be, well, I can't say that I can't talk too much about it, what it used to be, but we, I'm, I've been thinking about doing something in a place where we could do a lot of other shit too.

4 (1h 7m 10s):
Just put in a fucking, have

3 (1h 7m 11s):
A plate with a place of the lake runway. You can get, definitely get somewhere with a runway out here. If you really

4 (1h 7m 17s):
Travel far out or you doing so well and you're so successful. Have, have, get a chopper. So you could bring the people. Like what a cool experience. They fly to your ranch because you're gonna, you're gonna get more value the farther you go out.

3 (1h 7m 27s):
Yeah. But I limit my time in those fucking things.

4 (1h 7m 30s):
Oh, I do too. Rock and roll and choppers don't mix. They

3 (1h 7m 33s):
Freak me out a little bit.

4 (1h 7m 34s):
Me too.

3 (1h 7m 35s):
Yeah. They took out Stevie Rayon, didn't it? Jim Cro, was it a plane crash that took out Steve Ray Von

4 (1h 7m 40s):
A helicopter coming outta Alpine Valley up in Wisconsin. Jim Cro. There's a million of 'em. That's a scary,

3 (1h 7m 47s):
Scary one to die.

4 (1h 7m 48s):
A buddy Roy from, what's it called? Oh fuck. Montgomery Gentry.

3 (1h 7m 55s):
Bill Burr has his own helicopter license. And he took me up. I took

4 (1h 7m 58s):
Lessons.

3 (1h 7m 59s):
Did you? I

4 (1h 7m 59s):
Took lessons for a while. I had this grand idea when I was younger, when I first started getting fucking money. And I'm like, I'm

3 (1h 8m 6s):
Gonna get a fucking helicopter. Panic gold. I'm gonna like

4 (1h 8m 8s):
10 10,000 fucking Yeah, exactly. I would hundred

3 (1h 8m 12s):
Percent

4 (1h 8m 13s):
Gold flake. Fuck. Yeah. I was like, it looked like a lowrider. I was gonna get like 10,000 acres in the middle of nowhere. Build my fucking little fucking redneck empire. And then, so I started taking these lessons in a single engine, Robinson and I. I, I let, let my hand off the collective a couple times and like, you know, the, the fucking, the teacher's like, dude, what the fuck did you do that? I'm like, You didn't tell me not to fucking do that. Blah, blah, blah. And then what really was the deal breaker? I'm like, I know myself. I'm like, we'll be sitting around getting tuned up and I'll be like, you guys don't wanna get the chopper out. Go for a spin. Oh my God. Drunk

3 (1h 8m 51s):
Flying a he helicopter.

4 (1h 8m 52s):
Oh yeah. I was like, could

3 (1h 8m 54s):
You

4 (1h 8m 54s):
Imagine? No. Let's, let's make enough money to ride in the back.

3 (1h 8m 58s):
Yeah. The only times that I've been in one, I'm like, keep it together. Keep it together. It feels like you're, I try to stay outta it in a flying football helmet. Oh man. It seems so fragile. They seem so fragile when you're in them. They're like, Ugh,

4 (1h 9m 12s):
I'll never get in a single engine. And anything again that flies never. Everything's, everything that flies is based on a system of two, two fuel pumps, two engines, two everything you can go with without one of them. So your odds are pretty good when those things fuck up. Mainly speaking about planes. It's, it's pilot error. Probably 90 some percent of the time. There

3 (1h 9m 33s):
Was a recent private jet that crashed.

4 (1h 9m 36s):
Yeah. On in LA

3 (1h 9m 37s):
Yeah.

4 (1h 9m 38s):
What was a

3 (1h 9m 39s):
Challenger? Yeah. Challenger. 300. A couple

4 (1h 9m 41s):
People got outta the back and the pilots died.

3 (1h 9m 43s):
Yeah. Yeah. The people survived. Which is crazy. If you look at the footage the

4 (1h 9m 46s):
Passengers did,

3 (1h 9m 47s):
Landed on the highway. Oh, Jesus Christ. Dude. That's insane. I thought that was in la Oh my god. It is in Florida. Okay. Right. Dude, that is so wild to see. Fuck, scary. Watch this land. Watch this happen again. I'll do it again from the beginning. Yeah, do it from the beginning. 'cause the beginning. Watch this, watch this land. This is so crazy that that's what kind of plane.

4 (1h 10m 8s):
Look at this. That's the kind of plane I got.

3 (1h 10m 10s):
Look at that bro. Fuck I mean. How insane is that?

4 (1h 10m 15s):
And I think it was three people came out of the back.

3 (1h 10m 17s):
Yeah. The pilots the amazing, amazing.

4 (1h 10m 22s):
Oh

3 (1h 10m 23s):
Damn. They just had a, just landed on the fucking highway. Holy shit, man. Imagine trying to land a plane and knowing you're gonna take out those cars and you're probably not gonna land anyway. You're probably not gonna be able to pull it off anyway. You don't have any engines anymore.

4 (1h 10m 37s):
Scary.

3 (1h 10m 38s):
Oh my God.

4 (1h 10m 40s):
It's scary. Just not being in control of anything. Yeah. At least for me, I'm a bit of a control freak. Like just not being in control of any situation. Especially when it's something like that, that always

3 (1h 10m 50s):
Yeah. That's

4 (1h 10m 52s):
Why makes you think a little bit more.

3 (1h 10m 54s):
That's why when, when things aren't a meritocracy and you're, you're hiring because you want things to be inclusive. Oh God. And you're not getting the best people working on your fucking airplanes,

4 (1h 11m 5s):
Insanity,

3 (1h 11m 6s):
Flying your airplanes. You're not getting the best people. What are you doing like that? Is any business one of the scare. But for especially like airlines, that is one of the scariest fucking methods of transportation. Whether it's the safest, it's arguable it is very safe. Yeah. Relatively. But it's one of the scariest for people gives the most anxiety because you give up all control. You're hoping that the pilots can keep it together. You're hoping that the, the equipment's been tested correctly. You're hoping that everybody who like tightens every bolt and checks every fucking weld. They, you're hoping they do a really good job. Like they, they're really good at it. They,

4 (1h 11m 40s):
They do do a pretty good job overall. Like, and I'll even say, you know, like, you know, just lot like this is a place that makes sense for regulations. Yeah. You know what I mean? That as somebody's a hundred percent very, you know, very right of center, you know, you know, less re regulations on most things. That's something that makes sense. And they have a lot of good ones in place. You know, it's, they, you just can't fucking jump in a plane. Like when something like that happens, it's something's fucked up. Yeah. It'd be interesting to see when they, you know, do their investigation. What happened. Exactly.

3 (1h 12m 13s):
Yeah. It would be interesting. Like how does it, how do you get a double engine failure? That sounds insane. Or

4 (1h 12m 18s):
Maybe it's like when Sully, you know, landed that on the Hudson River, it was, you know, geese or whatever it was. Right. Or something like that. Okay. That's, you know, you know, I, I've flown outta many airports where they go out there with shotguns before just to boom, get with blanks just to get the, you know, geese outta there. And they actually let you hunt them at some, at certain times of year. It's like I know at Metro Airport, Detroit, there's a congressman that asked, they had a special permit to go over there and hunt 'em at certain times of the year. and I love the bird hunt.

3 (1h 12m 44s):
Yeah. They try to keep populations down. They have snipers. They do a lot of different things to keep, they, they try a bunch of different methods to keep ducks and pigeons and shit. Because how many p planes have been taken out by birds? Probably quite a few. Huh?

4 (1h 12m 57s):
It's becoming more common.

3 (1h 12m 58s):
Really.

4 (1h 12m 59s):
You know, you never know if something's more common or is the media just that much more accessible? Right. With everything. I, I always wonder with that like, as population grows, things make sense that that gets more of whatever. Right. But you just don't know in this day and age, like it's, you know, when there's fucking how many 24 7 news channels all trying to report and get an exclusive story. It's like, you know,

3 (1h 13m 22s):
And some of them just straight up gaslighting you. Oh yeah. Gaslighting you on the news.

4 (1h 13m 27s):
If I shit my pants right now, like just legit shit, my fucking pants. Like, it would be the biggest story of this week. Maybe next week

3 (1h 13m 36s):
It'll be a big one. That loser he shit his pants as if it's never happened to you.

4 (1h 13m 41s):
Well it's not, it's not like the left wing media is reporting any good stuff. I do.

3 (1h 13m 46s):
No. Well,

4 (1h 13m 47s):
I'm just in their sites

3 (1h 13m 48s):
What we we need is a non winging media. That's what we need. Then. There, there should be value in just the news. And that's what Dr. Phil wants to do. There's supposed to

4 (1h 13m 57s):
Be, that's supposed to be the ap.

3 (1h 13m 59s):
Yeah. It's supposed to be, but it's not anymore. Well, 'cause I think journalists, at some point in time, the at least corporate journalists, a big percentage of 'em decided that they're working towards a better future. They're, they're like, they're activists, you know, and I think some of those people are not very charismatic and they're, they're people don't like them that much. They just happen to be on television.

4 (1h 14m 23s):
Well, why do many of these people refuse to retire? Because

3 (1h 14m 26s):
Now, now they have a career. They have and that's

4 (1h 14m 28s):
All they have now. It's their identity.

3 (1h 14m 30s):
It's their identity. It's

4 (1h 14m 31s):
Like they're 75 years old plus Yep. They refuse to go away.

3 (1h 14m 36s):
Yeah. They won't go away's sad. And they also wanna give their opinion opinions all the time. That's a lot of these people wanna give their opinions on things. Yeah.

4 (1h 14m 42s):
I, I want someone who's actually has, if they're in the media, who has consequences on their opinions when you're fucking 77, you know, and you're, what's her name from a, b, c or whatever, like, who's crying at fucking Hillary Clinton's, you know? Yeah. When she lost the election, who reports fucking world news? Yeah. You're like, she has nothing to fucking lose.

3 (1h 15m 0s):
That's not a journalist. I mean, that's

4 (1h 15m 2s):
Not no want somebody who's young has a family. Like you have shit to actually lose if you're gonna sway things, this, that and the other and get called out on it. If you're in the media, if you wanna talk shit, join a band.

3 (1h 15m 12s):
I just feel like we need objective news with no spin at all. Absolutely. And not coming out of a, a place where You don't wanna report on a certain thing. 'cause it makes Trump look good. Not, not, you know, just look at what are, what are the facts? What are we dealing with? Like, what are we dealing with in terms of the economy? What are we dealing with in terms of international conflict? What are the facts? What's actually happening? Don't, don't twist it in some weird,

4 (1h 15m 38s):
If they went by

3 (1h 15m 39s):
A conservative way, if they

4 (1h 15m 40s):
Went by facts and things like that. There's no one been better than Trump. The shit he got done. And if you just look at the numbers in his record, forget about all the noise.

3 (1h 15m 51s):
You see that guy who was one of the founders of Facebook who talked about it and he said it was the right message, but the wrong messenger. He talked about all the different things that Trump did. That it, it turns out it worked.

4 (1h 16m 1s):
But I, but I, even though we're friends, I I, I even before we became good friends, like I understood as, as I think a lot of people did. Not, not a ton. A a good amount of people understood that there's a method to that, to what people call madness when he says, you know, like, fucking Russia go after fucking Poland. If You don't wanna pay your fair share, nato, my sense tells me, no, he's never gonna let that happen. But he's gonna fucking go in there and fucking let them know you're gonna pay your fucking money. He's not gonna let that happen. I, I, I would say in my heart and the way I feel, there's no fucking way to let that happen. It's like when he's telling certain countries, you know, like if you're gonna go into Ukraine, I'll fucking blow up Moscow.

4 (1h 16m 47s):
Even if they only believe him, 5% fucking keeps him out. You know what I mean? The guy knows how to fucking go in and get shit done and, and talk business wise and make these statements and this then, and they don't know what the fuck he's gonna do. But I have to say, when he was in office by me, he did the right thing pretty much every fucking time. Everything he he did for this country. Whether it was keeping the border in check fucking everybody working, including minorities, energy, fucking independence. Build the fucking military up. Keep us out of fucking wars. I mean the list goes on and on.

3 (1h 17m 20s):
I think if people could look at it without his personality attached to it, they'd be able to see that. But that's one of the most amazing things the media's done, is they've turned a guy who was a celebrity, who was beloved. He was the host of the Celebrity apprentice on NBC.

4 (1h 17m 34s):
Zelensky was a celebrity. Everyone puts him on the highest fucking pedestal. Like, oh, he is the greatest fucking, it's like, yeah.

3 (1h 17m 41s):
Well that's confusing too, right?

4 (1h 17m 44s):
Super confusing

3 (1h 17m 45s):
That that whole thing when the left is calling for war and the left wants war. That's like what has happened to the world.

4 (1h 17m 52s):
Trump just said the smartest thing. Everything he says to me is fucking great. But smartest thing. He is like, we should not, I've kind of spoke about this with family and friends for the years. Like, why do we keep getting into these wars giving countries this fucking money and we get nothing in return. This should be a fucking loan. Or we should fucking, we should take land or natural resources that they can buy back one day with a small interest or something. Why are we just giving fucking money away, giving our resources? Oh, you know, the fucking trillions we spent in Afghanistan and Iraq.

3 (1h 18m 27s):
So what's the answer to that though? Why did they do that?

4 (1h 18m 30s):
I have no fucking idea. I wish I had the answer. I I'm not smart enough enough to know that. Why

3 (1h 18m 35s):
Would they be? I, yeah, there's probably someone who could probably illuminated for us. But where, what

4 (1h 18m 39s):
Like, does the debt matter? don don't understand how the debt fucking matters. I don't get it.

3 (1h 18m 45s):
National debt. Yeah.

4 (1h 18m 46s):
Everyone's always bitching about the debt, but we just fucking keep spending money. Like no business survives like that. Right? That's just common sense. But they keep doing it. I'm like, it must not matter. 'cause we have the biggest bomb. It's like trying to collect from the biggest bully in school. Like, Hey, where's my $20? Like I'll beat your ass. Like, okay, I'll get it next year. Who

3 (1h 19m 2s):
Do we owe all that money to?

4 (1h 19m 4s):
You know, they say China, they say this country that I'm like,

3 (1h 19m 6s):
Imagine if China just bought America if like one day they're like, oh, they us. Imagine,

4 (1h 19m 10s):
Imagine if they tried to collect,

3 (1h 19m 12s):
Look at all the people. Us debt clock.org. Oh my god. Look at how much money.

4 (1h 19m 18s):
34 trillion.

3 (1h 19m 20s):
Yo, look at how crazy this is when you watch this. It's so insane. Yet

4 (1h 19m 26s):
They're like, Hey, we need to send another 60 billion here. We need fucking a hundred billion for this.

3 (1h 19m 32s):
The thousands. Just look how quick the thousands go by the thousands. There's another national debt.

4 (1h 19m 37s):
There's another a hundred.

3 (1h 19m 38s):
It's insane to watch.

4 (1h 19m 41s):
That's bananas. It's so weird. They got that ticker in New York City

3 (1h 19m 44s):
Debt per citizen $101,960 debt per taxpayer. $265,178 per taxpayer.

4 (1h 19m 57s):
I I, I don't understand how that works.

3 (1h 19m 60s):
That's so insane.

4 (1h 20m 4s):
But I've never heard it. How

3 (1h 20m 5s):
Is that sustained? Sustainable?

4 (1h 20m 6s):
I've never heard it explained. I've heard, heard politicians bitch about it. And we, you know, our debt and this, that and the other. I'm like, I don't get it. Yeah. Why does it keep going up if we can't afford it? I, I, what's going on? My conclusion is we can clearly fucking afford it. We'll just print some more fucking money or whatever. don. Don't get it. Have you ever heard that explained?

3 (1h 20m 22s):
No. I never realized it was that bad to watching that clock. There's something about knowing the number, but seeing the number move in real time. That's just terrifying. How does it, I don't understand how this makes sense. Okay. Many people believe that much of us national debt is owed to foreign countries like China and Japan. But the truth is that most of it is owed to social security and pension funds right here in the us. This means that us citizens own most of the national debt. It's a fucking scam. It's a giant Ponzi

4 (1h 20m 54s):
Scheme. It's a Ponzi scheme.

3 (1h 20m 56s):
It's a Ponzi scheme.

4 (1h 21m 1s):
I just went around. Yeah, yeah. We need that a hundred thousand dollars. What the fuck? We gotta pay off the debt.

3 (1h 21m 8s):
What the fuck?

4 (1h 21m 10s):
Crazy.

3 (1h 21m 11s):
What the fuck? We owe it to ourselves.

4 (1h 21m 15s):
God. Sound like what a awesome, did we sound like Debbie Downer and negative Nancy over here with our

3 (1h 21m 22s):
Yeah. What are we doing? We're punching ourselves, right? Keep gonna the hospital.

4 (1h 21m 25s):
Let's talk about fun shit.

3 (1h 21m 26s):
Yeah. Well it's not, you know, just something that just comes up. If you're having a conversation about why the world is crazy and you can't find a single example. Politics

4 (1h 21m 36s):
Never came up years ago, man. Do you ever remember that? No. I remember if it came up as like, who you voting for, be like none of your fucking business.

3 (1h 21m 43s):
Yeah. Like in the eighties and the nineties, who the fuck talked about politics?

4 (1h 21m 47s):
Meanwhile, I'm looking in the mirror with a fucking MAGA hat on and a Trump flag. I'm the biggest fucking provocateur and offender of this.

3 (1h 21m 57s):
Yeah. But you're also a guy who's like fed up, you know, you're fed up with, there's a narrative that the world got fed.

4 (1h 22m 7s):
Yeah. Yeah. I just love my country too much.

3 (1h 22m 10s):
But it's a stupid narrative. You know, it's which

4 (1h 22m 13s):
One?

3 (1h 22m 14s):
Well, the narrative First of all the narrative that right and left are really that separate from each other. Most people care about the same things. Holy.

4 (1h 22m 22s):
All my left wing friends, I got plenty of 'em. Look at my fucking band. You wanna talk about DEI? We got fucking gay, black lesbians, fucking, fucking rednecks, fucking females, fucking men. Black, white fucking, that wasn't fucking done by like, oh, we need to mix this up. Right. It was like, we want the best people and not only they that are best for, you know, whatever they play or whatever their instrument musical talent is, but also people that we knew could get along and could spend time as a family. Like, you know, you hear these horror stories about so many bands hate each other. Yeah. This, that and the other. And like, we've never had that fucking problem. Sure we've had disagreements and fuck you and this, that and the other.

4 (1h 23m 4s):
But fucking for 25 some years, like, well that's, everyone loves each other and gets along. That's very, and fucking politics all different across the fucking board. and I just came to a point where I'm like, look, you gotta vote. I don't give a fuck who it's for. I was like, you gotta vote or you're outta the fucking band. Which is a fucking threat I probably never followed through with, but I'm like, just let 'em know. Like, you just gotta fucking vote.

3 (1h 23m 26s):
Well that's the difference between social media and real life. In real life. You can be friends with people with all sorts of different opinions. 'cause if they're good people, you can talk, you can talk even if you disagree

4 (1h 23m 40s):
And you'll find more in common. Yeah. And you don't have in common

3 (1h 23m 43s):
Much more. It's, it's so, so much. Everybody wants basic things. They want friendship, love, family. They want to be successful in whatever they're trying to pursue in life. And they wanna be safe. Everybody wants that. Those are the primary things we all agree on. It's the most important things that all of us want in our life. And then the other stuff, when it starts getting on the fringes, like, you know, trans women competing as, as bi with biological females. Like now you're out there in, in crazy land and that's getting the majority of the attention. But that's not the majority of our fucking problems. The majority of our problems. We all kind of agree Yeah. On keeping things safe and educating kids. We,

4 (1h 24m 21s):
We disagree on, on the paths to get there. Yes. To those things. And that's great. That's what it made. Makes America great is thinking differently. But

3 (1h 24m 28s):
Instead of thinking so much about the things that we disagree on, which I think are insane, and how many people have been incited by bullshit stories in the media and it's changed your narrative on, on all the people running for president. Whether it's gaslighting you about bidet or gaslighting you about Trump. They're just bullshitting to get, trying to get whatever narrative they want out there. And they don't really give a fuck if it's the truth.

4 (1h 24m 52s):
Well, and not only that, the truth can be spun so many different ways. Yeah. Facts and numbers can be spun so many different ways where it's like you teeter that line where it's not really a lie. Yeah. But it's not the whole truth.

3 (1h 25m 5s):
What's really wild is that the people behind bidet are willing, like if he wasn't fucking up as much as he is, if they could just kind of keep him outta the limelight for a while, they're, they're willing to run him again. Basically. Could they keep

4 (1h 25m 18s):
Him outta the limelight any more than they do though? But

3 (1h 25m 20s):
They're basically what they're saying is they're running the country without the president. Right? Yeah. That's essentially what they're saying. Absolutely. And that's what that report says. That report says he's not there. Okay. So if he's not there then you know, he's not really running things. And if he's not really running things, that means the people that are running things are now not the president in insanity. And they like to keep it that way.

4 (1h 25m 40s):
Insanity.

3 (1h 25m 41s):
And they'd like to keep it that way. Well that seems fucking nuts.

4 (1h 25m 46s):
That didn't fucking

3 (1h 25m 47s):
Sanity. That is not what we signed up for. We didn't sign up for these unelected people that are working under the administration taking care of everything. We did not sign up for that.

4 (1h 25m 57s):
It's hilarious to me that a lot of the extreme leftist people, you know, they have this thing where like, you know, older white men are the fucking devil. They just are. And so what do they do? Like an older white man who's a, that's the guy who

3 (1h 26m 12s):
Catholic getting the power. Yeah. This is the most diverse. That was the thing that the White House Press Secretary lady was going on about how diverse the cabinet is.

4 (1h 26m 22s):
Sean Cloudier.

3 (1h 26m 23s):
And that one dude gets caught butt fucking in one of the Senate rooms. Oh

4 (1h 26m 28s):
God. Yeah.

3 (1h 26m 29s):
You see that? What the fuck? And then there's another person who's like a trans influencer pulled their tits out on the lawn, took photos, their tits out of the White House lawn.

4 (1h 26m 38s):
And it's almost like we gotta compete on the right. It's like, Hey, hey, we got George Santos.

3 (1h 26m 45s):
That's hilarious. That's hilarious.

4 (1h 26m 48s):
Fucking weirdos,

3 (1h 26m 49s):
Man. That dude's a hoot.

4 (1h 26m 50s):
Fucking cuckoo.

3 (1h 26m 51s):
He's Coco Puffs. He's fun. It's fun to listen to. He's fun in those interviews, man. He goes off, he's sassy. As long

4 (1h 26m 57s):
As he doesn't have access to your finances or

3 (1h 26m 59s):
Yeah, it seems like he might, might be an H-U-S-T-L-E-R hustler.

4 (1h 27m 5s):
I thought that one the other day. 'cause I'm always trying to do comparisons to Trump and bidet for people that, you know, they know my French and my love for Trump's politics. Everything. And you know, I don't like the way he talks and he speaks and like, okay, look you fucking, you need an emergency medical procedure. You're in Los Angeles and you have to get to Santa Barbara. The only people that can drive you there that are available are Trump and bidet. Fucking pick one.

3 (1h 27m 33s):
Right. That's good. Yeah. But he shouldn't be driving anywhere. There's no way bidet should be driving. That's not fair. He's

4 (1h 27m 41s):
Having trouble walking.

3 (1h 27m 42s):
He can't do anything. They don't really want him as president. They just want him to get them into power again. That's what it is. It's people want running the show. Behind the scenes. I mean Kare. Jean Pierre. How do, how do you say her name? I don? I don't know. She got busted using his account. Ka tweet

4 (1h 27m 57s):
Kareem Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

3 (1h 27m 58s):
Did you see that?

4 (1h 27m 59s):
What happened?

3 (1h 27m 60s):
She got busted using his account to tweet.

4 (1h 28m 2s):
I didn't see that. She

3 (1h 28m 3s):
Fucked up and forgot to change accounts. So she tweets as the president. Oh boy. Like you gotta see this.

4 (1h 28m 12s):
Hi. You know, people fuck up, make mistakes,

3 (1h 28m 14s):
I know. But it's just fun to see the wiring under the board. Yeah. It's fun to see how the sausage is made. Like this is an, this is not really the president. The wizards just

4 (1h 28m 22s):
A small weak, a Bernie angry guy.

3 (1h 28m 24s):
It's literally weak at Bernie's. This should be impersonation. Look at this. Investing in America means investing in all, all caps of America. When I ran for president, I made a promise that I would leave no part of the country behind and she'd be put it out. She put it out under her account.

4 (1h 28m 42s):
She,

3 (1h 28m 42s):
Yeah bro. When they say things like that and they tweet when president's like bidet tweet it, it's like trying to get wisdom from a fortune cookie. It's like they're the dumbest little quotes. Like who's who's who Read that. and it was like, yeah, he did. And he's doing a great job.

4 (1h 28m 58s):
I bet fucking Reagan would've been good at it.

3 (1h 29m 1s):
I I think most of the people that are supporting Bidet online are bots. I think there's a lot of people that are genuine democrats and are supporting bidet. Don't get me wrong, those bots are a problem. But some of the, some of the nuttiest pro bidet stuff, despite like, no matter what happens, no matter what kind of gaff he makes, where it's so embarrassing and if it was your dad, you would want him like get get dad, get dad. We gotta get him off the stage. He'd be like, dad can't, you can't do this, dad, dad, dad it's over. We gotta get you to a home. We gotta get you some care.

4 (1h 29m 31s):
So I heard from a very good source, I can't confirm, but it was a very good source that when Bidet met the Pope, he shit his pants. Did you hear that one? I

3 (1h 29m 42s):
Hope he did. That's amazing. I mean don. Don't hope he did. But if he did, it's a funny story. This is

4 (1h 29m 49s):
A very good source. Damn.

3 (1h 29m 51s):
It's not fair. It's not fair to do that to an old guy, but it just shows you the mechanism behind the scenes that keeps the country running. It's a bunch of people working for the president and now they're essentially pulling all the strings. It's kinda wild. And those people duh. Fully don't wanna see Trump get into power. Well it's like the 'cause then they lose everything. Well,

4 (1h 30m 10s):
It's like the last election this, a lot of this stuff seems like it was done semi behind the curtain. And now it seems they've come to a point, they're like, we don't give a fuck.

3 (1h 30m 19s):
Yeah, we're moving ballot

4 (1h 30m 21s):
Or we're coming right after this guy. Yeah. Everything. We're gonna find him 355 fucking million dollars for where there was no one that got hurt in a fucking Yeah.

3 (1h 30m 29s):
There's no victims.

4 (1h 30m 30s):
It's fucking insanity.

3 (1h 30m 31s):
Yeah, that's what the insane part about that is. Elon actually posted about that. Like, where's the money going? Where's the money going if there's no victims, if he didn't owe anybody any money, where's that money going? Because there's no, there's no like one person that's a, you know, a claimant, right?

4 (1h 30m 49s):
I hope he drops it off in fucking pennies. Right at LA I just Leticia James's front door in that fucking stupid judge.

3 (1h 30m 55s):
I'm just fascinated by watching it all play out because

4 (1h 30m 59s):
It's like they're doing it right in front of your face,

3 (1h 31m 0s):
Right in front of your face. Like a Banana Republic style prosecuting of your poli political opponents, framing them in the worst way possible. Getting judges like, we tried to figure this out and we tried to be as reasonable as possible. Let's figure out how anybody could ever value Mar-a-Lago at $18 million.

4 (1h 31m 17s):
Unbelievable. Will you go to Google right now? Look at blank property and Palm Beach.

3 (1h 31m 22s):
Yes.

4 (1h 31m 23s):
A couple acres will come up for a hundred million dollars on the water. Yeah. He's got property, 18 acres on the water. And the intercoastal, just

3 (1h 31m 29s):
The land alone is insanely, insanely valuable. And then there's a palace on it. Like

4 (1h 31m 36s):
For

3 (1h 31m 36s):
You to tell me that's only worth $18 million. I'd buy three of those. There's

4 (1h 31m 40s):
Vacant land on Zillow. Go Zillow bead, like that highest to lowest price, bro. Something'll come up for a hundred million dollars. It's two acres.

3 (1h 31m 48s):
I'm not even a real estate investor. But if I found that for sale for 18 million, I'd snatch that shit up and turn it right around. Right.

4 (1h 31m 55s):
That

3 (1h 31m 55s):
You're crazy. That's so biased to say that's $18 million no matter what metric you're using. Insane. But think about it's,

4 (1h 32m 2s):
That's insane. Been pretty much every day, every week since this guy came down the escalator and announced he was running for president. It's been nonstop. and I can confirm that because I, I got on board pretty early before he got the nomination publicly and I've had shit thrown at me at my level. Yeah. Just constantly nonstop. This guy's took it every fucking day. That's, that's why we call him Teflon Don.

3 (1h 32m 24s):
He is in, in an odd way, the only president that didn't age incredible. They all rapidly age do

4 (1h 32m 33s):
I I golf with that fucker all the time, man. Fucking unbelievable. That guy doesn't miss a fairway. Hits at 250 yards right down the fricking middle.

3 (1h 32m 41s):
That's amazing.

4 (1h 32m 42s):
It's incredible.

3 (1h 32m 43s):
He's so with, and that's his only form of exercise too. Right.

4 (1h 32m 45s):
He's so smart. When he's talking numbers and different things in his memory, like everything, you're just like, man, it's mind boggling really.

3 (1h 32m 53s):
He's

4 (1h 32m 53s):
That smart. Really is. I I it's unbelievable.

3 (1h 32m 57s):
Is has there ever been a turnaround like that before where like so many people love the guy for his bombastic personality and then he becomes president and then they all hate him? You know, when it all started, it all started. Well

4 (1h 33m 9s):
See, the media would have you think that everyone hates him?

3 (1h 33m 11s):
No, no. Most people love him. The the reality is when you go to the UFC, I said, when you Right. Tucker Carlson, him and Dana White walked in. It was likes the Republican Avengers. Yeah, that's funny. It was the most, it was the most insane reaction. It was like they have a super team. There's a super Where

4 (1h 33m 28s):
Was that one at? Well,

3 (1h 33m 29s):
I've seen you guys walk in together New York multiple times. New York for sure. Miami. Miami. Miami. Miami was a big one, but, but

4 (1h 33m 35s):
They were all nuts.

3 (1h 33m 36s):
Yes. New York was a banana. Yes.

4 (1h 33m 39s):
Bananas.

3 (1h 33m 39s):
New York City. New York City. And that is a Madison

4 (1h 33m 41s):
Square Park. And that is a very diverse crowd. The U Ffc.

3 (1h 33m 43s):
Oh yeah, man. Oh yeah. The, the UF C's the most diverse crowd. Look

4 (1h 33m 47s):
At Tucker smiling.

3 (1h 33m 48s):
The UFC is filled with people from all walks of life. There's a giant lesbian fan population of the UFC bunch. I got a huge

4 (1h 33m 56s):
Lesbian, lesbian fan

3 (1h 33m 56s):
Base bunch being fi Do you really?

4 (1h 33m 58s):
Yeah, I had a couple lesbians in my band. We always joke like back in the day, like the early days, like always be these fucking hot chicks in the front row showing her titties and shit. You know, just cool rock and roll shit. And like, so I started, I started, I I got a great friend in at Toledo, Ohio, Dan McGirk and You know, he's got some, some issues and what do you call Down Syndrome or whatever. And so he's posted a lot of things publicly. You know, I, I kinda stopped doing Make-A-Wish and I kind of took him for life. You know, he's my friend and I'm gonna be with this kid forever. Whether we go That's awesome, go to a Pistons game or you know, he comes to all the shows, anything like that. So, but as a result of that and then having two lesbians in the band, like me and my guitar player a couple years ago, sitting there jamming a stage and we're like, boy man, shit's changed.

4 (1h 34m 47s):
And it's like three, four kids with Down Syndrome in the front and like four lesbians like hanging out. I'm like, wow. The times they are changing.

3 (1h 34m 55s):
Yeah, they are. Right. You know, one of my favorite songs of yours that I I play in on my Green room playlist is Runoff to LA

4 (1h 35m 6s):
Oh shit. There's a Love

3 (1h 35m 7s):
That song.

4 (1h 35m 7s):
Song. There's a deep cut.

3 (1h 35m 8s):
That's a fucking great song, dude. That is a deep cut. But that's a great song. One of those

4 (1h 35m 13s):
Breakup songs.

3 (1h 35m 14s):
Yeah. But it's a, it also like, there's so many guys that get, get got, you know, to have a get the fuck Outta Here song. You know,

4 (1h 35m 24s):
Don't be fucking with 'em. Hollywood hoes. Yeah

3 (1h 35m 27s):
Bro. There's some predators.

4 (1h 35m 29s):
Oh man. Learned my lesson. I used

3 (1h 35m 31s):
To watch them move in on Dudes at the Sky Bar. Remember the Sky Bar?

4 (1h 35m 35s):
Oh yeah. Yep.

3 (1h 35m 36s):
I, we would call them the Coyotes. 'cause you could see these like really aggressive, hot Hollywood crazy ladies who would move in on these rich guys and I remember I was, I was watching this, this bald chubby guy getting seduced by this girl. And then, and then she goes, do you like coke? And he is like, yeah, I like Coke. Yeah, okay. And then I'm like, oh, she's got you, she's got you buddy.

4 (1h 36m 4s):
Her client and sinker.

3 (1h 36m 5s):
Then she's gonna be moving in soon.

4 (1h 36m 8s):
She's gonna be moving out your shit.

3 (1h 36m 10s):
She's gonna move in soon. You're gonna marry her. Then she got you done. Yeah. It's like a real, like gold digging is a real business model. Just like those Nigerian princes. Gold digging is absolutely an interpersonal way of where crazy people can latch onto people's lives. It's fascinating to watch

4 (1h 36m 32s):
No better place to do it than Hollywood, California.

3 (1h 36m 34s):
It's crazy. 'cause so many of these guys are like executives and back in the day at least, and they're, they were killing it back then. TV executives are out partying at the ong, da da da, and the coyotes just move in. I knew a bunch of dudes who

4 (1h 36m 49s):
Lost a bunch of money. Well, my theory on Los Angeles, Cal or Hollywood is you get all these beautiful girls that migrate there. They wanna make it at some level, wanna do something. So wherever, it doesn't matter where it is on earth, doesn't have to be Hollywood. Wherever there's a bunch of hot chicks, whether it's the local disco club in your town, wherever there's a bunch of fucking grease balls, bunch of fucking kooks. If there's a conglomerate of hot chicks hanging out in a concentrated area, it's a bunch of fucking weirdo dudes. Just a bunch of fucking creeps. Mm. That's five fucking like dive bars.

3 (1h 37m 22s):
Yeah. So it's just being a proximity to hot chicks.

4 (1h 37m 27s):
Yeah. It attracts every DBA on earth.

3 (1h 37m 30s):
Mm. That's probably true. Yeah. If they know that hot chicks are be there, remember going there,

4 (1h 37m 35s):
Pop popular clubs, different places and just, you know, wow, there's a ton of hot chicks in there. And they'd look around like, wow, there's a bunch of dbags in here too.

3 (1h 37m 42s):
I remember thinking of going, like when I was a kid and I first started going to clubs, like with my friends, go to a dance club or whatever, just being an idiot. Like wearing cavariccis and looking stupid. Fuck Yeah.

4 (1h 37m 53s):
To meet para pants.

3 (1h 37m 55s):
And all I could think of is like, this is like the least productive way ever to meet somebody. Like, I've never met anybody at one of these places. It's always just me and my friend standing around looking stupid, trying to figure out how to meet girls.

4 (1h 38m 9s):
I didn't either until a fucking had hit record. What? Yeah. I fuck. I looked like the same dirt ball I look like now my whole life. And like, fucking couple hit records. Well, that was fucking Brad Pitt. You look hot fucking God. That's sexy. Motherfucker.

3 (1h 38m 23s):
Talent is the great equalizer. It really is. Talent is the great equalizer. If you have talent, you, you could bat way above your head

4 (1h 38m 33s):
Confirmed.

3 (1h 38m 35s):
It's everywhere You see it, all throughout Hollywood. It's interesting. It's interesting. It's interesting how that stuff works.

4 (1h 38m 43s):
And it's never gonna change. No,

3 (1h 38m 45s):
It's never gonna change. It's just, you're always gonna have, the whole thing about Hollywood too is that you have to be chosen. Like most of the people that are out there are out there to be chosen for something. They're out to be chosen to get a record deal or chosen to be on a sitcom or chosen to be in a movie or chosen to be on a show. It's, you have to be picked. So you're always trying to figure out how to be more, but if, how to fit in more. But the

4 (1h 39m 7s):
More true talent, like raw doc talents you have or whatever it is, like it starts to negate some of that stuff. It

3 (1h 39m 13s):
Definitely

4 (1h 39m 13s):
Does. You still have to kiss the ring a little bit, like Right. I always called it, I always said, you know, when it came to radio, it was a whole fucking game to play to that shit. and I only had a couple radio hits. I was, I always say I was willing to tickle some balls, but I would not insert penis in mouth. That's kind of my Do

3 (1h 39m 31s):
You think that's why, because you had so many hits songs, but they weren't necessarily radio hits? Is that what you're saying?

4 (1h 39m 38s):
Yeah. Well, MTV was huge for me. So that was, that was even a better outlet than radio. But I've never had a number one song in America. I was never willing to do the fucking shit to, to get it there all over the world where didn didn't have to do anything. Yeah. Went number one in seven countries or something. But yeah, I was just, I, I, my feeling was always like, okay, we have to, at some level when we're, when we're getting this big chance, you know, after I'd been knocked down this, that and the other and finally got my big record deal and like 1997 I was like, okay, this is do or Die, have to play a little bit of this game. and it was one of the best, my most successful record. 'cause that's kind of what I did. and it worked. And then after that my philosophy was like, you know, I came out with picture and they're like, this is gonna kill your career.

4 (1h 40m 19s):
You know, a fucking country song

3 (1h 40m 22s):
I love that's also on my Spotify.

4 (1h 40m 23s):
They literally told me it was gonna kill my fucking career. Oh. And I was like, that's so crazy. That's minds

3 (1h 40m 28s):
A great song, man.

4 (1h 40m 29s):
Yeah. Thank you. My mindset at that point was, I want to try to make classic records not hits, you know, something that'll stick around and, and it's hard to nail it. You know, I probably made a thousand songs. There's arguably, you know, a handful of fucking great ones in there. You know, it's, it's like being a photographer. You take a thousand pictures, you hope you get five good ones.

3 (1h 40m 48s):
Dude, you got a lot of bangers. But I love picture. Thank you Sheryl Crow. Whew. That voice.

4 (1h 40m 55s):
She can sing. God

3 (1h 40m 57s):
Damn.

4 (1h 40m 58s):
She can sing. She's very, there's

3 (1h 40m 59s):
Emotion in that voice.

4 (1h 41m 0s):
Very talented. Our politics don't line up so well these days.

3 (1h 41m 4s):
I would imagine not. Are you still friends?

4 (1h 41m 6s):
We're we're still friendly. We don't talk as much. You know, that

3 (1h 41m 9s):
Suck.

4 (1h 41m 10s):
Well, we, yeah, we've, it sucked. We sat, we sat down recently. We were talking about gun control.

3 (1h 41m 16s):
I'm like, oh no.

4 (1h 41m 18s):
Yeah. And I'm like, she here, she's like, no one in this town will, you know, country artists will talk to me about it. This. and I'm like, yeah, it's, if you want gun control, you should move back to LA or New York City. It's very prevalent there. That's just not kind of the Tennessee way of life. I was like, and the scary thing about it is like, I could say like, okay, common sense gun law. If we actually had one to keep guns outta mentally disturbed people, I could take a serious look at that. Yeah. And I know the n a's gonna be all over for that. don don't fucking care. I can honestly take a serious look at that. But the problem that I see in it is, as soon as this common sense gun laws pass written up by attorneys and people in, in, you know, politics that none of us can really understand.

4 (1h 41m 58s):
They throw in some mumbo jumbo. First thing that's gonna happen is see that crazy shit Kid Rock was saying and blackout drunk. And his honky tonk. He's, he's not mentally stable when you take his guns away. You know what I mean? It's like, where does that line get, get crossed in back and forth, one side or the other. That's the problem with the common sense law. It's like there's not, everybody doesn't have fucking common sense.

3 (1h 42m 21s):
That's a very good point. It's also a very good point that you can get experts to lie. We saw that during covid. Yep. You can get experts to lie. Absolutely. And if you have mental health experts decide, or you could get con decide that you're unstable for a political reason, for any reason.

4 (1h 42m 34s):
I could, I could go out and find, you know, 10 people, a conglomerate of 10 people that hate Joe Rogan. Yeah. Easy. And get 'em to all

3 (1h 42m 40s):
He could say I'm mentally unstable. Right. For sure. Get the same together. Probably admitted to being mentally unstable. Right. In some ways. But it's not you, you can't let people define that. 'cause you, you, you're gonna get people that are just using it to take away your rights. And then they're gonna, once they have that, now they pushed past a certain line, they're gonna push even further. It might get to a point where you're not allowed to have knives anymore. It might get to a point where you can't have a sword in your house. Well,

4 (1h 43m 8s):
What was their argument for years? Why would you need an AR 15 with a 30 round clip? Right? Yeah.

3 (1h 43m 13s):
One,

4 (1h 43m 13s):
One word.

3 (1h 43m 13s):
Well, 30 people breaking into your house. One,

4 (1h 43m 15s):
One word answer Israel. Right.

3 (1h 43m 18s):
It's a great, great answer. You know, that was one of the craziest things. I saw somebody tweet about Ukraine. All you people with ar fifteens, you should be donating them, donating to them to Ukraine. Like, do you not see what the fuck you are saying this. We know that this, this is a real possibility with human beings that they can invade places and shoot people up. That's a real thing. How do you want us to be unprepared? Why? How do we,

4 (1h 43m 43s):
How do we protect our politicians so well, and our courthouses. Exactly. And everything else. Exactly. We can't do this for our schools.

3 (1h 43m 49s):
These anti-gun politicians are being protected by people with guns. Brave people with guns.

4 (1h 43m 55s):
And they live behind gates and walls.

3 (1h 43m 56s):
Exactly. They're protected. Yeah. And they're, they're getting away with pushing this nutty agenda. And the what you need is better law enforcement, better trained, more law enforcement. But the problem is, wants

4 (1h 44m 9s):
To, wants a fucking a cop these days. Yeah. They've made that a popular sport.

3 (1h 44m 13s):
Yeah. They fucked that up hard. Gosh. It'll be a long time before that recovery. I'm

4 (1h 44m 16s):
Not saying that every cop's good. There's good and bad in everything, as we all know, that have a smid of common sense. Everything. You're gonna get bad actors in anything. Anything, anything.

3 (1h 44m 25s):
Anything in life. But overall,

4 (1h 44m 27s):
When your kid can't breathe and you call 9 1 1 and that cop shows up. Yes. You know, or

3 (1h 44m 33s):
Someone's holding someone hostage or you need someone rescued or there's a a real problem. Someone's shooting up a store. Shooting up a

4 (1h 44m 41s):
School and you see those cops nationals go running in there. That we're trained in the military. Exactly. Not knowing what they're gonna face. God bless 'em.

3 (1h 44m 48s):
Exactly. And that's, those are the kind of people that you should fucking praise. That's most cops.

4 (1h 44m 54s):
And it's not, it's not the private schools. My granddaughter goes to a private school. They have security there. Right. They're taking precautions. Says what about the people that can't afford private school, which is the majority of this country. Yeah. You know, what are we doing for them? Politicians all talk about it like,

3 (1h 45m 8s):
Well it's, there's also certain ideological aspects of shooters that they don't talk about. Like they didn't wanna release that trans shooters manifesto. 'cause it's like this really crazy anti-white anti, like there's a, it was a weird manifesto

4 (1h 45m 25s):
The same way just in Kansas City. They didn't wanna say who the shooters were. Right. And what's her name was on Bill Maher the other night. And, and Coulter, she's like, well, I can guarantee it wasn't two white guys. Because

3 (1h 45m 34s):
Would've

4 (1h 45m 35s):
Known because they would've had 'em all over the news. Hundred percent. And unfortunately that's fucking true.

3 (1h 45m 38s):
It's a hundred percent true. And anybody that denies it, it doesn't matter if you're right or left, you know. That's a fact. This is not, and

4 (1h 45m 44s):
It's fucked up. We need to catch these shooters. Yeah. We need to catch these bad actors. You need to gimme the ultimate description of them. Yeah. You know, he had a sha you can't be hiding a shad head. Right. You know. Oh, that's it. Forties to fifties wearing a gray sweatshirt. Yeah. You know what I mean? Looked like he was high. Yeah.

3 (1h 46m 1s):
Yeah. You can't just say two men.

4 (1h 46m 4s):
No. Yeah. Trying to keep a PC politically fucking, fucking correct.

3 (1h 46m 8s):
Show the fucking pictures. How quickly did they have the pictures? How quickly did they know?

4 (1h 46m 12s):
Probably within an hour. Yeah.

3 (1h 46m 14s):
Yeah. It's a weird time, man. It's like people are scared of reporting the truth because they're gonna be called racist. It's so strange. and it, you're transphobic if you're talking about the fact that these shooters are trans, like how many of 'em in a row? How many of 'em in a row?

4 (1h 46m 29s):
I'm checking all the boxes for the, for the left dude. Extreme left wing.

3 (1h 46m 32s):
Right. It's nuts.

4 (1h 46m 34s):
I'm a racist fucking Nazi. Just fucking laugh when you have to. Shit.

3 (1h 46m 40s):
I know It's nuts, man. Anybody that opposes them in any way, shape or form is far right. But, but

4 (1h 46m 45s):
You think about it, it's, it's actually is Nazi shit. What his name. Bels or Goebbels, whatever, you know, tell a lie a thousand times. It becomes the truth.

3 (1h 46m 52s):
It's also, you should be vehemently opposed to this no matter what your political ideology is. You should be vehement vehemently opposed to gaslighting from anybody that, that your side should win because they have the best argument. They shouldn't win because they're full of shit. That's dangerous. It's dangerous to everybody. And the fact that we're all just trying to sort this out in real time as a country. And so many people are skeptical of the news now. So you don't know where the fuck to turn for the truth.

4 (1h 47m 17s):
Well, they're skeptical of the news. A lot of people skeptical of, you know, the CIA and FBI like institutions that have been there to protect us and serve us for years and our judges and prosecutors. And we're like, everyone's being exposed. At least say what you are. That's, you know, that's why, you know, I've, I've, I don't, I I don't care. You know, the people know who I am and where I stand because I know where other people stand around me. And it's the oldest cliche, you know who your friends are. Yeah. I know who my friends and my family are in the world that I have, I'm so blessed to have. and I don't need to try to play both sides of the fence to, you know, be in Hollywood's good graces. Yeah.

3 (1h 47m 56s):
As,

4 (1h 47m 57s):
As David speed said, he is like, dude, you're like, Hollywood's fucking kryptonite.

3 (1h 48m 3s):
But good for you man. Good. Good for you for being yourself. The world needs more people just being themselves. You're a good dude, man.

4 (1h 48m 10s):
Don, don't nail it. Every time I've said things outta line that in, in a different day and age, I would probably have apologized for. But in this day and age, no fucking way.

3 (1h 48m 19s):
You're a good dude, man. You really are. Thank you. You really are. You've always been a good dude. You're always cool to be around. And you're, you're cool to everybody. You're always friendly to everybody. Like, when I went to your house, I brought some friends. You are just cool to everybody man. And it's like, that's what really matters in life. It doesn't, you know, this idea that you're supposed to be hated 'cause you have a different political opinion than someone else is so dumb. It's so dumb. Can we just look at who the people are? Can we look at who the people are? And let's debate which, which is the right idea in terms of like what to do with the economy or what to do with the environment or what to do with all these things. That should be what we're all concerned about. Absolutely. Everything.

3 (1h 48m 59s):
Be so fucking these people are evil and these people are the future. And this is the death of democracy. If you go that way and it's a shut the fuck up. You people are freaking everybody out. Exactly. You people are freaking everybody out. and I don't think you're right. And you weren't right when he was in office. Where did, where what happened? Where was the end of the world? The guy was in office for four years. Where was the wars? Oh, we didn't start any new wars. You know? Exactly. The whole thing is nuts, man. And during the bidet administration, the disastrous pull out of Afghanistan, you realize that all the, that he wouldn't have done, he wouldn't have done it that way. He would've done, he would've asked those guys. He would've asked the generals like how to do this.

4 (1h 49m 37s):
Absolutely.

3 (1h 49m 38s):
And do it the right way.

4 (1h 49m 40s):
Absolutely.

3 (1h 49m 40s):
You should get out. Yeah. They should get outta there. But they're probably gonna have to maintain some force there. Otherwise the taliban's gonna take over like they did. Like fucking,

4 (1h 49m 47s):
Yeah. It would take him a month.

3 (1h 49m 48s):
Fucking duh. And then you left all the tanks. 'cause it's too expensive to get 'em outta there. He was. I saw Trump down talking about that. Like how insane that was. Right? That he left behind all the military equipment. It's

4 (1h 49m 60s):
Billions of dollars. Why are we sending money to countries that hate us?

3 (1h 50m 4s):
How could you ever imagine a scenario where it makes sense to leave a hostile military group like the Taliban tanks? What

4 (1h 50m 17s):
Insanity.

3 (1h 50m 18s):
And it's also, it's almost like, you know, we're gonna have to go back and you'd like them to be a little more well armed this time. So then we could have a real war war. Jesus. Like a bigger war. War. Like a war war with two armies. So then with the war, if we lose some people, then you can really justify spending much more money to buy like better shit. To fuck those people up with their old shit. Our old shit. Well,

4 (1h 50m 41s):
Unfortunately some of that might come back to haunt us here. and I hate to put that out in the universe. But it's, you know, with this border being open, we know there's bad actors here. We know it's not. If they would have, it's when you would

3 (1h 50m 52s):
Have to do that. If you could. If you I mean if, if Isis is real, we know it is. What? Why? If they're doing their job, they would sneak in. They already

4 (1h 50m 60s):
Have. Well,

3 (1h 51m 0s):
Why wouldn't you sneak in?

4 (1h 51m 1s):
They're already here. They're already here.

3 (1h 51m 4s):
Okay.

4 (1h 51m 4s):
Kid

3 (1h 51m 4s):
Rock. Unfortunately. Kid Rock. Let's put on the tin foil hats. Why? Why are they allowing the border to be open like this?

4 (1h 51m 9s):
It's insanity. I don't know. To get votes for the Democratic party. I, I have no idea. I can't answer that question. It seems insane to me. We want great migrants to come here. Yes. It's the foundation of our country. I know so many good ones that fucking work hard. That we're working on my house to build it, to do different things here and there. Sure. Friends, you know what I mean. We, we need workers like this. We just want 'em to come through legally. I know it sound like a broken record and

3 (1h 51m 35s):
It should be a better ve butt process that allows people to come in legally. But also you have to vet people. You can't just let terrorists through if you really care about security. So this is my question. And this is where I get when I, when I get really conspiratorial, when the weed kicks in, when you get real conspiratorial, I start thinking about all these things that are happening. The decline of California, the fucking tents in the street. The fact that they know they can clean it up, but they choose not to. They cleaned it up when Xi Jing Ping came to San Francisco. You saw that. Right? I saw that. So if who would be po? Why would anybody want it to continue in the same direction? It's continuing because it seems to be deteriorating. It doesn't seem to be improving.

3 (1h 52m 17s):
Who other than someone who would want America to fail.

4 (1h 52m 21s):
Well the other question is like, okay, Trump handled it to the best of his ability with the tools he had in his toolbox. Bidet now has that same toolbox and he keeps saying, well, Congress won't gimme the money. They won't pass. And why the fuck is that going on too? Then they put three things in one bill. They put you, you know, Ukraine, they

3 (1h 52m 41s):
Put Ukraine in the border wall.

4 (1h 52m 42s):
Border wall, and Israel aid to Israel. They put those three th why the fuck are these not separate bills? Yeah. To vote on. You know? 'cause they're all trying to throw their fucking bullshit in there. It's a game is a And that's both sides do that. Yeah. They both do that. They both should cut that crap out. It's like we're gonna vote on the fucking border wall. Have it be the fucking border wall and that's it. Yeah. Don't fucking try to piggyback Ukraine and Israel into there. Those should be separate bills on their own.

3 (1h 53m 6s):
Well, not only that, H how much are they required to know about the bills they're signing? 'cause some of those bills are enormous.

4 (1h 53m 15s):
Attorneys have fucked this country up beyond belief.

3 (1h 53m 17s):
Some of those bills. How? Unless you spent a long time going through them. And also

4 (1h 53m 25s):
Refer to if you're educated enough. Right. To decipher the lingo, the wording, the definitions. Yeah. You don't think a lawyer can spin something around

3 (1h 53m 33s):
100%. That's why I was saying like I was gonna say and consult with people that are experts in whatever the fuck they're talking about. They should

4 (1h 53m 39s):
Be written two page bills. Two to five to 10 page bills in layman's terms that anybody with a high school degree can fucking decipher. Yeah. Period. Why don't they make that a law so we can all read them and understand them. The

3 (1h 53m 52s):
Fact that they sandwich all kinds of shit inside bills is just nuts. That should be illegal

4 (1h 53m 57s):
Completely.

3 (1h 53m 58s):
You're sneaking stuff in there that allows for mass surveillance. And that's,

4 (1h 54m 2s):
And Trump pulled their pants down on that.

3 (1h 54m 4s):
Yeah. Trump

4 (1h 54m 5s):
Did that. And make no mistake, there's plenty of fucking the Republican establishment that hate him too. He's fighting them as well because he's like, you guys are full of shit over here too. He's telling so many people up there in DC you're full of fucking shit. He goes, I'm gonna run this like a fucking business and I'm gonna win. He likes to win. He loves to win so much that he fucking, that I want him fighting for this country. 'cause he wants to fucking win. I want him on my team period.

3 (1h 54m 35s):
I like it. I like your passion for this Kid Rock. This Mitch McConnell guy is the most amazing one. He won't step down once again. He keeps freezing up. He froze up again. Yeah. This guy's locked up like three times. I don't get

4 (1h 54m 48s):
It. Well he

3 (1h 54m 49s):
Just locks up. Like if he was doing any other job, they would stop. They would stop him. They say you're gonna have to retire. You can't, you just lock up.

4 (1h 54m 58s):
If I lost my, my voice or some ability to do what I do. Well if you

3 (1h 55m 1s):
Just locked up, we couldn't talk to you. Right. Forget about losing your voice.

4 (1h 55m 5s):
I'm saying, what if

3 (1h 55m 5s):
You did it? Would you? Yeah. Would you still

4 (1h 55m 7s):
Come

3 (1h 55m 7s):
On here and just do a podcast like this?

4 (1h 55m 9s):
I'm Joe Rogan. I'm still trying to like, no. You'd be like, you know what, I had a good run.

3 (1h 55m 14s):
Yeah. You'd have to stop. Stop doing that. Whenever they get him in front of the podium, the dude just locks up.

4 (1h 55m 21s):
I just feel like sometimes we're having like the dumbest conversation. 'cause it's like we're repeating a lot of things and it's all, to me boils down to common sense. You

3 (1h 55m 28s):
Know what I wonder about Mitch McConnell too, though? He's probably guilty of some serious shit. I wonder if like he's doing the Vincent de Chin Gigante thing. What's that? Vincent de Chin was this mob leader that would pretend he was crazy. So he'd walk around with like a bathrobe and slippers and he'd shuffle around the street like a crazy person. And h his dons would meet him or his The

4 (1h 55m 48s):
Old rope and dope.

3 (1h 55m 49s):
Exactly. So all of his bosses would, you know, the, all the guys under him would meet him and they would go walking. And so the, what the FBI did was they put these recording devices and all the hubcaps of all the cars on the street, they parked their own cars there. And so they recorded him as he was walking and then they, they knew he wasn't actually crazy 'cause he's really running the mob. But he did it by pretending. So

4 (1h 56m 12s):
Master of deceit,

3 (1h 56m 13s):
If they're coming after Vince or what's his name? What the fuck's his name?

4 (1h 56m 19s):
McConnell.

3 (1h 56m 20s):
Yeah, McConnell. If he's pretending to be locking up, that'd be a good move. Like if you think the shit's coming down, you think

4 (1h 56m 27s):
He's that good of an actor,

3 (1h 56m 29s):
All you have to do is this. I could do that. I could fake lock up.

4 (1h 56m 33s):
You could do it straight face. All

3 (1h 56m 35s):
Good

4 (1h 56m 35s):
In front of a bunch of cameras. Stand

3 (1h 56m 37s):
I'd, I'd lock up if I knew I was gonna go to jail. If it was,

4 (1h 56m 40s):
If I locked up like that and sat there like that for a minute, I would make sure I had like a huge fart on deck. Right. Stand there. Go like, everyone's like, oh no. Oh no. You're like,

3 (1h 56m 50s):
And I go Woo.

4 (1h 56m 51s):
You're never beating fart jokes.

3 (1h 56m 53s):
No. Imagine someone doing that as president. Hold up like Joey Diaz style. Grabbing the mic, putting it. Joey Diaz has done that on stage. He grabs a mic and puts it in his ass and fart How I got cramp. You've cramped up. Oh no. Cramped up on your leg. How

4 (1h 57m 8s):
Much water have I drank? Yeah.

3 (1h 57m 10s):
Did you take electrolytes?

4 (1h 57m 11s):
I do. I drank the fucking hydrogen water. Really? I do all that shit.

3 (1h 57m 15s):
Somebody told me once

4 (1h 57m 16s):
Red lights on his cold tubs. Fucking intermittent fast. Fucking let's cardios.

3 (1h 57m 20s):
Fuck

4 (1h 57m 21s):
Yeah. Fucking Kaiser Gym equipment circuit trained. Let's go. Fuck, let's go.

3 (1h 57m 25s):
Somebody told me once that if you get a cramp in your leg, you should actually pinch down on your tongue and then it's a pressure point. Oh shit.

4 (1h 57m 31s):
It comes back.

3 (1h 57m 32s):
Yeah. I'll try. I've tried it. I think it might work. I'm not sure though. It might just be in my head. You know the worst is foot cramps when your foot locks up.

4 (1h 57m 44s):
They say to eat potassium too. Eat, eat it. They say potassium. I grab a banana or something like that. I,

3 (1h 57m 49s):
I very rarely get cramps 'cause I, I drink a lot of electrolytes

4 (1h 57m 53s):
Out. I do too. I mean I've drank four or five cups of water bottle drink

3 (1h 57m 56s):
Didn didn't used, used to do it at all. I I never drank them for years and years and years. I just worked out and drank water. And then when I started drinking electrolytes, I was like, oh my God, this is such a game changer.

4 (1h 58m 5s):
Lemme ask you a health question. How do you get, and I've meaning to hit Dane on this, how do you get protein, the best protein without the calories?

3 (1h 58m 15s):
Why are you scared of calories?

4 (1h 58m 18s):
Just 'cause wanna don don't wanna bulk up. I just wanna stay thin and, you know, protein

3 (1h 58m 22s):
Of course. Well, high protein diet is probably one of the best ways to stay thin because protein I

4 (1h 58m 25s):
Don, lot of protein. I just don't eat after I work out right away. I haven't been,

3 (1h 58m 29s):
Well You don't have

4 (1h 58m 30s):
To because I don't need till one then I stop at six or seven o'clock.

3 (1h 58m 34s):
The idea that I mean you're not a fucking professional athlete. You don't have to eat right after you work out. It's the best way to get optimal performance is to, you know, get some glucose into your muscles. Most people think carbohydrates after workouts are really good. But if you're on a, like a high protein diet, one of the things that happens, like if you're on like a carnivore diet specifically, you don't crave as much food. You don't eat as much.

4 (1h 58m 57s):
Don don't eat as much just from doing the intermittent fasting. I kind of do what I want the weekends or when I go out to dinner, periodically I do it. So I can do that. You know, I ate a lot of raw vegetables. The right fruit and then a lot of salmon. Chicken should

3 (1h 59m 10s):
Be careful with some raw vegetables because really? Yeah. You get

4 (1h 59m 13s):
Oxy. I had a ton of raw

3 (1h 59m 14s):
Vegetables. You get oxalates that the thing about raw vegetables special, especially when you blend them up in like smoothies and shit.

4 (1h 59m 22s):
No, no. I eat 'em raw. Right. Like

3 (1h 59m 24s):
I used

4 (1h 59m 25s):
TKI thing, little zeki. If I want some flavor

3 (1h 59m 27s):
I mean you're probably not eating enough that it's gonna be a real problem. But for people that get like blended smoothies of raw vegetables, especially like raw leafy greens, they say that like when you cook 'em, it actually is more bioavailable and it gets rid of the oxalates. You could, you could get it out of the, out of the vegetable. Hmm. But I know people that have drank a lot of smoothies, like green smoothies and develop like kidney stones and shit. Yeah. and it, it becomes a bit of an issue for some folks. don don't know why it might be a genetic thing. Like I

4 (1h 59m 55s):
Do smoothies, it's protein. Oh really? Yeah.

3 (1h 59m 57s):
Yeah.

4 (1h 59m 58s):
But the amino acid's protein,

3 (1h 59m 60s):
I'm addicted to jocko's proteins. Jocko's got this stuff called milk. It's fucking delicious. It's so good. I'm addicted to it. I just keep drinking them even though when I don't need it, I drink it. But you don't need to worry about like what's high calories. Well, I like to, the real high calorie things are the things that you shouldn't be eating anyway if you're trying to lose weight. Like pizza.

4 (2h 0m 23s):
Well you gotta factor in spaghetti. I like to drink my beer. Oh,

3 (2h 0m 25s):
That's a lot of

4 (2h 0m 26s):
Calories. When that's usually only one or two nights a week. Like depending if I'm working or not. Yeah. But like weekends and that's usually one good night. But I can drink some fucking beer.

3 (2h 0m 34s):
I bet you can drink some fucking beer. I

4 (2h 0m 35s):
Can drink some beer. I bet you and I enjoy that. And I'm not fucking stopping.

3 (2h 0m 38s):
Well then maintain. I do

4 (2h 0m 40s):
I mean I'm maintaining good.

3 (2h 0m 41s):
Yeah. But don't worry about calories for food. The food calories you need. You gotta

4 (2h 0m 46s):
I was just talking about after working outta 30, you're supposed to have protein protein pretty quick.

3 (2h 0m 49s):
You should, should have carbohydrates and protein after you out. I like to eat some fruit after I work out. I like to eat fruit before I out too. That's like kind of the only time I ever eat fruit.

4 (2h 0m 60s):
I, I've been trying to eat the right fruit. Blueberries, melons.

3 (2h 1m 3s):
Blueberries great. Yeah. Wash 'em though. Blueberries. Yep. Wash the shit outta 'em. That's the thing. You gotta worry about foods. Like what the fuck is being sprayed on your food? How, how good of a job did they do at cleaning it up before it got to the grocery store

4 (2h 1m 14s):
Shelves? Well we I'm sure like we got two freezers full of fucking elk and, and venison. Yeah. We got chickens for our fresh eggs. Yeah. You know, we're, we're pretty good about that stuff and and very fortunate to able to afford it. Yes. Because we joke, even if, you know, we shop at Whole Foods, like we, we'd nickname it whole paycheck.

3 (2h 1m 31s):
Yeah. It's brutal. And it's also like, I've had people on like the guy from White Oaks pastors who explained that whole grass fed thing and then also that it's a US product. Even if the cows are grown in another country. Did you know that? No. They ship, they, they can, they can grow cattle in another country, kill it in another country, ship it to America. And then if they cut it up and put it on the shelf, then it's a, a product of the USA

4 (2h 2m 2s):
Makes no sense.

3 (2h 2m 3s):
But it's wild. So they're labeling it like a product of the UFC when it's UUSA rather when it's a cow from another country. Well

4 (2h 2m 11s):
That's a whole nother conundrum of trying to just fucking see through the bullshit on food labels. Yeah. You know how much research you have to do and then you fucking start googling this shit and you don't know what the fuck to believe there. And the worst thing you do is like, you know, I have a headache and you start googling like WebMD headache and it's like you're dying. You're fucked. You know? It freaks y'all out. Yeah.

3 (2h 2m 35s):
Fuck.

4 (2h 2m 38s):
Lemme tell you about these fucking shows we're doing.

3 (2h 2m 40s):
Tell me about these shows. Kid Rock.

4 (2h 2m 43s):
So fucking next excited about this shit. Doing huge schedule this year. Nine shows, which is kinda like my number. I like to do nine or 10. But this year the, the big one is called Rock. the Country. And it's a two day festival with me one night and Jason Aldean one night and ca cast of characters from Miranda Lambert to Hank Jr. Skinner, Bradley Gilbert, Travis Tritt on down. And so we're doing these in very small towns like Ocala, Florida and Mobile, Alabama and Gonzales, Louisiana. Just in these fucking fields. And this is like, so I own part of this festival and it's this place for fucking people who love music, love freedom and love fucking America.

4 (2h 3m 27s):
Which I'm not sure that they have one of these anywhere. It's like a two

3 (2h 3m 32s):
Day festival for the people. Rock the Country.

4 (2h 3m 35s):
It's like everyone's welcome, but you're probably not gonna see a whole lot of blue hair and nose rings there.

3 (2h 3m 40s):
Right.

4 (2h 3m 42s):
And so I'm super excited about that.

3 (2h 3m 44s):
You're essentially doing like

4 (2h 3m 46s):
Likes Dude Ocala, Florida. There's 26,000 tickets sold already. Ocala fucking Florida. That's

3 (2h 3m 52s):
Incredible.

4 (2h 3m 53s):
And we're going to these towns, you know, and there's, and we got RV stuff and you know, you can camp outta your car and stuff like that and VIP experiences and all that shit. but it really, you know, when they approached me about this and, and you know, having a piece of it in perpetuity, you know, it's made me do shit like this go out and like, it, it excites me to go out and do things now rather than just go tour and make money. Okay. I've been blessed to be able to do that. That doesn't excite me. You know, it always excites me to play but to do something like this, a little outside of the box and create this space because make no mistake, all the shenanigans and experiences we're gonna have here, the people are gonna fucking make it the people. 'cause they're, you know, they're coming red, white, and blue. They're coming with their bag of shit, this, that and the other.

4 (2h 4m 33s):
Like, it's gonna be a fucking shit show. The greatest shit show on Earth. So I'm looking forward to that. And then we're doing this is, we're doing Kid Rock's, rock and Rodeo at at t Stadium in Dallas. Yeah. The night before the PBR world finals bull riding. I've, I've really in the last several years gotten into, started with rodeos and bull riding. We played a lot of those through the years. Calgary Stampede and Cheyenne Frontier Days and you know, Of course the Houston Rodeo and I wanted to take rodeo to the next level. So we've created six teams. So it's team competition, rodeo. So like, you know, the ropers are gonna be going head to head rather than just timing them. And then I'm gonna open the show rather than have, you know, usually it's the rodeo and then you play music.

4 (2h 5m 17s):
Right now the way I'm trying to format it is I open with a big number, like kind of an award show type thing. I'm really gonna put some fucking time and effort into it. And then, you know, we'll do the rodeo of some music for entertainment in between. I've been, I've been gunning for this one and I think we found it. We wanna do some entertainment in between, you know, trick riders and you know, six shooters and stuff like that. But I think we found two midgets that are gonna ride mini bulls.

3 (2h 5m 42s):
Wow.

4 (2h 5m 43s):
Fucking mic drop.

3 (2h 5m 46s):
You could still do that today. Fucking

4 (2h 5m 48s):
Mike Drop and then Of course we're doing Kid Rock's Comedy Jam. I think it's third year. Third or fourth

3 (2h 5m 54s):
Year. Who's on that?

4 (2h 5m 56s):
Don Don't know yet. Brian from Zanies, you know, usually handles that. Like I put I know Chris Porter will be there, my old friend. You know, we've had, we've Gillis did it, you know, the first year Donne Rawlings. We've had some great people. Eleanor Care again, you know, I'm a, I'm a fucking comedy groupie. If I didn't have shit to do tomorrow, I'd be up at your show. Hanging out in the green room and giving comedians hand jobs. Like fucking, I pretty much live at Zanies in Nashville, you know. Oh, that's awesome. So we do that for charity. It's everything's a hundred percent for charity.

3 (2h 6m 28s):
Is that where you met Theo?

4 (2h 6m 30s):
No, I met Theo a little bit before that, but he popped up the first year and he, like, he came as the big star and did, did 15, 20 minutes. Yeah,

3 (2h 6m 37s):
Theo, he, he enjoys that

4 (2h 6m 38s):
Stuff. We have a little musical guest play. I did it one year and, you know, other people. And it's something really fun just 'cause I fucking love comedy. It's called the American Badass Comedy Jam. it was during Comedy Week in Nashville. How

3 (2h 6m 49s):
Many of those have you done? I think this

4 (2h 6m 50s):
Is the third or

3 (2h 6m 51s):
Fourth. Nice. We've

4 (2h 6m 52s):
Been able to raise some real money for people. I got buddies that have, you know, throw in 10 grand here just 'cause they got it and shit like that. So we've, you know, raised e on average just at Thery in theater owe a few thousand people. So we've raised 80 to a hundred grand every year. Nice. Last year we donated the money to the victims of the Covenant School shooting in Nashville. And then the, the guys that lost their lives on those choppers that went down outside of Fort Fort Campbell. So we try to pick a couple specific things each year and help people out. That's awesome. That's fucking great. That's

3 (2h 7m 19s):
Beautiful, man. That's a really cool thing to do with your time. I'm glad that you like, you know, like that excites you now. Yeah. Doing something interesting. Yeah.

4 (2h 7m 28s):
Something where you got a stake in the game. Yeah. You know, where, where you're really, you go out and you fucking work. It, it, you promote it and you tell people what it's about and you're excited about it. You know, like these rock the countries, it's, and and it's a fucking gamble man. When you're fucking with Mother Nature. Oh right. You're doing an outdoor fucking festival.

3 (2h 7m 46s):
Especially in Florida,

4 (2h 7m 47s):
In the middle of fucking nowhere. And you know, we're trying to, one of the smart things, I Pat myself on the back. One of the things you came up with was before we announced these and did 'em, we got, we invited everyone from these small towns or states, whether it was their mayors, head of city council, sheriffs, state senators. And we had, we had some of each show up from each state and had 'em all up to my house in Nashville. And you know, we broke bread and we just talked about how can we put our heads together and make this a great experience for fans. 'cause you know, that's the biggest thing when you're doing these festivals that you have to make sure of. We have enough bathrooms, enough water, enough things for people to do, like, you know, create photo ops, this, that and the other. Right. The music's gonna be what it is. You know, we're gonna give our all there like we always do. But you know, to be involved in that level, you know, to be able to throw my creative ideas in and this, that and the other.

4 (2h 8m 31s):
One year we tried to do the generally hood slide, worst fucking idea I ever had Fucking John this when we used to do this thing called the fish fry. John Schneider got him to host it. I got a new, you know, I have a, I have a very nice, generally with four 40 in it, I got a new hood for it. Like an old hood that we painted. 'cause I know the hood's gonna get fucked up. Right, right. So I've got this all planned out 'cause I'm so fucking smart. Well, the first fucking lady that goes to fucking, it was like some muddy and you know, judges the first fucking lady, she's got a big old girl. She got a beer in her hand. She goes, she fucking trips bam. Head her right in the front quarter panel.

3 (2h 9m 7s):
Oh my God. They

4 (2h 9m 7s):
Fucked that car up. I think I had four grand worth of damage to it.

3 (2h 9m 11s):
Oh my God. How was that lady? Is she okay?

4 (2h 9m 14s):
She fucking bounced off. She still had her beer in her hand.

3 (2h 9m 17s):
Oh my God.

4 (2h 9m 19s):
That's, but, but, but that's fun. Trying different shit like that, you know, to create fun shit. Like, so I get to have my input on these, on these festivals and really give my 2 cents and, and try to do cool shit and, and things, you know, just, just up it make it this fucking patriotic fucking freedom, love, and music festival, which I just saw a need for it.

3 (2h 9m 36s):
Well, there's a lot of people that didn't feel like anybody was talking to them half

4 (2h 9m 41s):
The country. Yeah. Why do you think Yellowstone so Big Duck Dynasty. Exactly. All that shit.

3 (2h 9m 46s):
Yeah. There's a lot of people that just don't feel like they're being represented in the media because they're not,

4 (2h 9m 52s):
Or this d it's like fucking deep experience system. Like, I get into a fucking program, a series on something and like I said, don, don't give a fuck if you're gay. Just be gay. If you're Jewish. Just be Jewish. Hey, if you're black, be fucking black. We don't gotta like clap louder for you. All right. Just fucking, but it's like become this fucking Hollywood bullshit where I'm into some fucking program. Second episode, here comes two guys kissing, or the trans person enters in just for no fucking reason. Not for the narrative. Not if it fits the story, I fucking get it. They just gotta factor it in. I'm like, fuck, go fuck off. I'm like, fuck off. Like fucking, it's, it's just, do you notice this on Saturday Night Live?

4 (2h 10m 32s):
This is a perfect example. and I, I tevo every week and you know, I just love staring a life. But I'm like, all right, fuck. Now it's become unfunny. There's bands in there, never fucking heard of that suck. And it's gotten, it has its moments where it's great and this, that and the other. And you probably know the ones I'm talking about. But nonetheless, I watch it and I've noticed this. It's like, so when they're doing the opening monologue, you know, one of the cast members will be in the crowd or whatever and everyone will give him some applause. Watch this every fucking time. When the Asian gay dude comes on, people are like, ah. I'm like, what the fuck is that? Why? Like, why, why are we screaming louder? He's not the best person on the show.

4 (2h 11m 13s):
Clearly. You know, Mikey day's fucking great. You know, there's other people on there that are fucking equally great. I'm like, why, why are people doing this? Like, you know, just clapping louder. That's like, we're all just fucking humans, man. Be who you want.

3 (2h 11m 28s):
They wanna show they're inclusive.

4 (2h 11m 30s):
The signaling, that's what I mean. It's, it just shows me this fucking millennial generation that like a good chunk of 'em are just complete fucking pussies.

3 (2h 11m 37s):
It's very performative. You know, virtue signaling iss like something that everybody does now. It's like, it's something that you feel obliged to do. It's like you're

4 (2h 11m 46s):
So brave.

3 (2h 11m 46s):
Yeah. It's like, you're so

4 (2h 11m 48s):
Brave. You're so brave. God bless you soldier. Fuck, this guy likes Dick. It's not that big of a deal.

3 (2h 11m 58s):
It's not that big. It shouldn't be that big of a deal. No.

4 (2h 11m 60s):
Yeah. No one cares.

3 (2h 12m 1s):
No.

4 (2h 12m 2s):
We should clap on who's the funniest in the best one on the show. Yeah. I What now you got me going on rant. So I haven't even had a drink.

3 (2h 12m 9s):
I like a good rant. You want a drink? No. Okay.

4 (2h 12m 13s):
Alright. I'll take a beer.

3 (2h 12m 14s):
Let's get some beers in here. Let's get some Bud Lights in here.

6 (2h 12m 18s):
Speaking of that, Shane's hosting SNL this weekend.

3 (2h 12m 19s):
Yeah.

4 (2h 12m 20s):
I know. I had that confused. I thought it was not, not the last week and the weekend before. And I'm like, nothing. TiVo and I Wanna see Shane?

3 (2h 12m 27s):
Are they showing him work shopping? His, it's a

6 (2h 12m 29s):
Promo they put out for it just a bit ago. Yeah. don don't know. I mean we can watch it, but it was just,

4 (2h 12m 33s):
God. I'd like to take a look at his wardrobe case. Man.

6 (2h 12m 37s):
Sweatpants. Lots of sweatpants.

3 (2h 12m 39s):
I

4 (2h 12m 39s):
Fucking love Shane, man. He's

3 (2h 12m 40s):
The best. He's

4 (2h 12m 42s):
His funnier shit. People, people out there haven't watched his, he's on Netflix. Yeah.

3 (2h 12m 46s):
Beautiful dogs. It's

4 (2h 12m 48s):
Amazing. Dude, your best joke. I, I bet to compliment you on it. Not not only that, but all your success. I've known you. I don't think people know that we've been in the same circle for 20 years plus easy. Like Yeah. When you were hosting the shows that I would perform at and shit like that. Yeah. You know, we've always been friendly and just to see you fucking work your ass off all those years through all the TV stuff and have this going and make fucking hundreds of millions of dollars. Fucking God bless you.

3 (2h 13m 10s):
Thanks brother. Appreciate it man. Thanks for much.

4 (2h 13m 11s):
But the best show is 1-year-old shows when you're like, can you imagine if all of our founding fathers came back to Earth and like looked around in the present day? And you're like, and they're like, what? You guys haven't written any new shit? Fucking great.

3 (2h 13m 28s):
Thank you. They've wrote some new, new shit. Some bills, right?

4 (2h 13m 32s):
It's

3 (2h 13m 32s):
Kind of funny. Yeah. But the, the way that our government is structured, they were fucking Genius huh? To figure out that there's gotta be some checks and balances in place to keep tyranny at bay. They just didn't know that it was gonna be subverted the way it's been. They could, how could they possibly know that it far, I

4 (2h 13m 47s):
Think people were smarter back then. They, because they had to be, they were forced to

3 (2h 13m 50s):
Be. They knew the nature of man too. The nature of man is almost always too, here we go, let's go.

4 (2h 13m 57s):
We at, are we really drinking Bud Lights? Let's lights. Let's go Watch how much shit I get for this. Who

3 (2h 14m 2s):
Cares?

4 (2h 14m 2s):
How don't give a fuck. Why do you get Bud Lights here, by the

3 (2h 14m 5s):
Way, Shane?

4 (2h 14m 6s):
Oh, Shane Gil. She's

3 (2h 14m 8s):
On the podcast all the time. Oh,

4 (2h 14m 8s):
Did I tell you these fucking smart asses? You know, my, my buddy's now at Anheuser-Busch for my birth. Cheers. Cheers, brother. For my birthday. They sent me a fucking a hundred cases of Bud Light.

3 (2h 14m 18s):
That's beautiful.

4 (2h 14m 19s):
It's fucking hilarious. Truck rolled up to the fucking house. I'm like, who? The, what's Because my friends have been bringing it over, shoving it in my golf bags. s like, since, since I did the machine gun fucking, we call it machine gun gate. They've been fucking with me and everything. I go to like, someone's fucking bud like this, bud like that. And finally it came to a point where I'm like, you know where I did my research and like I told you, like, I don't give a fuck. Like a lot of people work. You know what the worst part about it was? As people were like people losing their jobs. I was like, no people's fucking livelihoods. I knew people who drove truck for, for, you know, big Bud Light trucks, this, that and the other. And their fucking livelihoods were crushed. 'cause now people are fucking with 'em. One are the heads of fucking AB said he went to my bar, Kid Rock, you know, big ass honky talk in Nashville.

4 (2h 15m 2s):
He is like, dude, I walked through there with a Bud Light shirt. It's like three people told me to go fuck myself. I was like,

3 (2h 15m 9s):
Yeah. I was reading about this one bar owner who had to stop carrying Bud Light because when people would buy it, other people would get aggressive with them.

4 (2h 15m 19s):
Yeah. And

3 (2h 15m 20s):
That's dumb as fuck. It is. That's it's dumb as fuck. And

4 (2h 15m 24s):
By the way, I'm not into fucking boycotts and cancel culture. Like sending someone a message. Okay. Or when they're targeting our children, shit like that. Like, you know, there's a fine line there. But ul ultimately I'm not fucking into cancel culture and fucking that shit I mean, I fucking railed against it since they fucking won. And I'm like, we sent 'em a message. We don't need to fucking cancel 'em. All right. If they go down this path again and they start this like, I think they figured out who the, if you're in business and you have a clear market, you might wanna focus on that market.

3 (2h 15m 56s):
Yeah. And don't disparage them openly, publicly like they did.

4 (2h 16m 1s):
Yeah. I don't think if there's like what would be like, what's a, what's a target audience for gay people? A product

3 (2h 16m 8s):
Like something Lube.

4 (2h 16m 10s):
Lube. I think that's universal.

3 (2h 16m 15s):
But you know,

4 (2h 16m 15s):
It's something like that. That's, that's, you know, this is, this is for gay people, you know, primarily. I don't think there's a thing and you probably don't wanna advertise on the outdoor channel. Right. Just saying it's nothing to say it's bad or wrong or fucking right. Right. It's just fucking common sense.

3 (2h 16m 30s):
That's an actual good comparison. I'd be like advertising musicals on the outdoor channel. Hey Bud

4 (2h 16m 35s):
Light, send me a fucking check.

3 (2h 16m 38s):
They, they sent you how much beer?

4 (2h 16m 41s):
Two pallets. A hundred cases.

3 (2h 16m 43s):
How much is that worth?

4 (2h 16m 44s):
I have no fucking,

3 (2h 16m 45s):
Probably a lot money. Well,

4 (2h 16m 47s):
It depends. We,

3 (2h 16m 48s):
How much did they spend

4 (2h 16m 49s):
On that? On Broad, on Broadway in Nashville and including our bar. We're guilty of it. Everyone does it. I'm not a fan of it. Beers are fucking like seven to $10.

3 (2h 16m 57s):
Wow.

4 (2h 16m 57s):
Nobody bats an eye.

3 (2h 16m 59s):
Wow.

4 (2h 16m 60s):
But I, when we went into the, the agreement with my partner with the bar I was like, don don't want shit to do with operations at any level. With dealing with bands booking. I'll throw in my 2 cents. I'll keep up on things, but I hang fucking pictures. That's what I do. I come down and I, I'll get on stage drunk once in a while and sing, sing a number or two, but fuck a lot of money if you, it depends where you're selling them. So I've been giving 'em to my friends. But if just they're even, you wanna see fucking confused people. We get done play pickleball or something by week and I'm like, Hey, you guys take a couple cases of Bud Light if you want. And they're like, and they take 'em in this room and they're fucking stacked them. They're like, what? What the fuck? Fuck dude.

4 (2h 17m 41s):
and I'm like, it's a long fucking story, man.

3 (2h 17m 43s):
But if you gotta think the retail on those, let's just say retail, the retail on those a case of beer

4 (2h 17m 48s):
Is what? 15 bucks

3 (2h 17m 49s):
Beer. Okay. And how many cases?

4 (2h 17m 50s):
15 grand.

3 (2h 17m 52s):
How many cases was it? A

4 (2h 17m 53s):
Hundred. A hundred

6 (2h 17m 55s):
Hard times. 30. 30 grand ish. 15 to 20, 30 grand. Depends.

4 (2h 17m 58s):
Yeah.

3 (2h 17m 59s):
They spent a lot of money.

4 (2h 18m 2s):
Fuck.

3 (2h 18m 3s):
They send you a bunch of beer.

4 (2h 18m 4s):
What's funny, when I met with them and we were talking, they were like, you know, if you're messaging, you know, we'd like to work out a deal. And I'm like, what? I'm like, dude, guys, I'm not here to fucking do a deal. I'm like,

3 (2h 18m 14s):
If you're messaging,

4 (2h 18m 16s):
It was kind of like, you know, they were kind of a about, you know, like I was telling 'em how I felt about everything. Right? First was telling me, you know, like, Hey, here's how you fucked up and here's how people like-minded like me think, you know, and I and I kind of gave it to 'em and I gave it to 'em at the UFC that night. And that was just speaking openly. I go, but now after I've done some research, and especially after I talked to them, but not only them, you know, they're the heads of this company. They got vested interest talking to a lot of people, including Dana, including Trump, including people that own distributorships, people that drive for him, this, that, and the other bars whatnot. I was like, that's fucking enough. I'm like, I go, but I, I don't, I go out. I'm not here to do a fucking deal. I go, no one's gonna look fucking terrible if I come out and I'm like, oh, I got a bunch of money from Bud Life for shooting up cases.

4 (2h 19m 0s):
I don't feel right fucking doing

3 (2h 19m 1s):
That. No, you shouldn't. I'm glad you don't. I think,

4 (2h 19m 4s):
And like I said, there's no amount of money on the faceless fucking earth. I threw out a couple ideas and they're fucking terrified. Fuck. I I, I can't wait to tell you one day don don't want let 'em outta the box now. 'cause they're okay. Fucking Genius.

3 (2h 19m 16s):
Tell me afterwards. I I'll

4 (2h 19m 17s):
Tell you after. Okay. And fucking and I, I was just like, I'm not, I go, I've made my friends a bunch of money. Gilis Dana Peyton.

3 (2h 19m 27s):
Yeah, that's

4 (2h 19m 28s):
True. I still haven't gotten thank you cards from those fuckers yet.

3 (2h 19m 31s):
Well, we made Shane the Bud Light spokesman on Protect our Parks. We, we just kept talking it up the entire time. Like, dude, you could bring him back. You could bring him back. 'cause he'll, he'll down 16 of 'em in a podcast. Like, you'd never seen anything like that.

4 (2h 19m 45s):
Well, dude, if I didn't have shit to do tomorrow, I was getting after it. We we'd be, we'd be around there now.

3 (2h 19m 50s):
But Shane like, he doesn't even slur. It's weird. He just absorbs it.

4 (2h 19m 56s):
Me too. Yeah. That's why, that's why I try to stick to beer. I like a little whiskey, but I try not to drink it. Public

3 (2h 20m 2s):
Whiskey will take you there quick beer's like a nice slow, you

4 (2h 20m 5s):
Wanna see all this fucked up videos of me on stage at fucking the honky tonk

3 (2h 20m 9s):
Whiskey? Oh

4 (2h 20m 10s):
Yeah. Blackout fucking drunk.

3 (2h 20m 15s):
I think what happened was probably it sucks that they lost so much money and it sucks that people lost their livelihoods. What it did do that's positive though, is it sent a message like it every

4 (2h 20m 26s):
Other company,

3 (2h 20m 26s):
The

4 (2h 20m 27s):
Fuck outta that shit to a lot of companies that sent a message.

3 (2h 20m 29s):
Stay the fuck outta that shit because most people don't agree with it.

4 (2h 20m 31s):
And by the way, stay on fucking brand if you're a company Yeah, exactly. For your employees. and I would go in that order for your fucking employees first. Yeah. Your shareholders and I know you guys are the top got stock and shit, but for your fucking employees, you're in fucking business to sell a fucking product. Yeah. You know who your market is. Fucking stick to them. You don't gotta be fucking out here like fucking going after everybody and don don't know who their board members are, but people have told me that it looks like there's a few woke people on there. But I'm like, so fucking what? I'm like, you stick to your fucking market. Yeah.

3 (2h 21m 6s):
Stick to your market. Make go where

4 (2h 21m 7s):
You're celebrated is the best thing I ever heard in life. Go where you're celebrated, not tolerated.

3 (2h 21m 12s):
Yeah, that's good advice. I think it's just one of these things where these people get outta universities and they're indoctrinated into this way of thinking and they start working for a corporation. They want to change

4 (2h 21m 22s):
It. I told that to Brendan, the CEOI said, what did you think was gonna happen when you move half the corporate offices from St. Louis, Missouri to New York City and then you start hiring these Ivy League liberals to do your marketing. What do you think's gonna happen? That's like, you know, lining up a powder keg and lighting a wick and being like, I wonder if it explodes.

3 (2h 21m 41s):
Exactly. Yeah.

4 (2h 21m 44s):
I still think they should go back to fucking St. Louis too.

3 (2h 21m 46s):
They probably should. They probably should. Well, they're probably reevaluating everything. Obviously they are reevaluating everything after that. How do you not, it's like they lost $27 billion. They

4 (2h 21m 58s):
Are. And that, that was one of my things too. I'm like, you know what? It appears to people like me because although we're friends and I love you guys and we'll see what the future holds. I have no fucking idea. But I'm not, I'm not looking for a corporate deal on any fucking level because that's how you set yourself up to get canceled. And nobody can fucking cancel me at any level. And I'm fucking, I like that very much. But I was like, you need to fucking go back to fucking you, you, you look like you're just, it's like this. You cheat on your girl or vice versa or something like that by throwing money at it and buying her some shit. And this, that and the other. Doesn't sweep it under the rug. It don't fucking go away until you go, yeah. Fucked up.

4 (2h 22m 37s):
And, and they just refuse to go. Like, and I said, You don't have to go out and say, I'm fucking sorry, we fucked up. I go, I'll say it. Here's some fucking ideas for that. I go, here's one idea. I was like, so the commercial cuts, and it's like me out fucking working my ass off. I'm just sweating. Fucking no shirt on. This, that, and the other one. And someone's like, Hey man, cool off. And they hand me a Bud Light and people are like, what the fuck? and I drink the Bud Light. And then they pan out and I'm shoveling fucking piles of money into the back of my truck. Like, oh, Kid, Rock sold out. He's doing some shit

3 (2h 23m 12s):
That's funny. This

4 (2h 23m 13s):
Way to do it. But at least it would poke fun of themselves. Yeah. They would kind of get it and people would go like, all right,

3 (2h 23m 17s):
That's the way they should go. They should go with a poked fun of themselves. I had some ideas too. I'll tell you later. I had one that I pitched to Shane. I think there's a way to do it, but it's also, it's so, you know, for other companies, just realize, like a lot of people think all this stuff is nonsense. And a lot of people think that a lot of these influencers that you're latching yourself to because you think they're popular. They're popular because a lot of people are, they think that they're attention whores and they're mentally ill. And so they pay attention to them. It doesn't mean they respect them as human beings. And you want to have them as your spokespeople, and you wanna disparage all the other people that have been your loyal supporters for supporters forever. You're making a decision.

3 (2h 23m 57s):
You make, it's a bad tactical decision. It doesn't make any sense. Logically, you, you're not, you're not speaking to your giant part portion of your market. You're actually in opposition to them. Yeah. It's fucking dumb. I I,

4 (2h 24m 8s):
Yes, but I, I want them to give me a reason to drink it again. I want to double down on stupid humor. So funny. I want, I want to just like, like a specialized can. You know what I mean? Like, fucking they made these kick ass Budweiser cans back all red, white, and fucking blue. Shit like that. Just do something funny. That would work. You know what they should do?

3 (2h 24m 28s):
Imagine if they turned Budweiser into a red, white, and blue. Can God, I want

4 (2h 24m 32s):
To tell you this one idea. So fucking

3 (2h 24m 33s):
Tell me later. Tell me later. So

4 (2h 24m 35s):
Fucking funny. Hang on to it. They shit themselves, when I told 'em, they literally cracked up laughing. They were on the floor laughing. They were, and then they were like, we didn't sleep for two fucking weeks.

3 (2h 24m 45s):
Because wondering whether they should go for it.

4 (2h 24m 48s):
Oh, there's no way they're going for it.

3 (2h 24m 49s):
No.

4 (2h 24m 50s):
Fuck no. That's

3 (2h 24m 51s):
Hilarious.

4 (2h 24m 52s):
It's not my, my favorite things. I've had a lot of great fucking corporate deals. Like fucking, it's, it's incredible with Chevy and Harley Davidson and Jim Beam, so many other ones, but, and they've all been pretty good for the most part. But you know, like dealing with Chevy, like the people I dealt with were great, but trying to get stuff done in those situations. Like even when I was talking to him at the design center about the shape of the suburban in the back, I'm like, you get fucking groceries. Like they slide out. It's just a bad design. Or a lot of people use these cars as chauffeur cars or an Escalade. Why can't the seats move back? So if you don't have any luggage, you get more leg room for those being transported around.

4 (2h 25m 32s):
And we're in the design center and they're like to change the mirrors on that car will take three years. Which is why I fucking love Elon Musk. A motherfucker. Not only for everything he stands for in the shit he says, and I know he is probably not a Trump fan and I'm fucking love Trump. Make don don't. In case we're not clear here today, Joe, I fucking love Trump.

3 (2h 25m 52s):
But I already got that part

4 (2h 25m 53s):
Elon's fucking awesome man. I

3 (2h 25m 55s):
Wonder who Elon is supporting. What did he

4 (2h 25m 56s):
Fucking tweet last week? It was something so, oh, he tweeted, do you see the Disney tweet?

3 (2h 26m 2s):
No. Pull that

4 (2h 26m 2s):
Up. Elon Musk. Oh, this is fucking great. He took the Disney logo, flipped Mickey Mouse upside down, so it looks like two balls and a dick. And he wrote D's nuts in the Disney lettering.

3 (2h 26m 15s):
No fucking

4 (2h 26m 16s):
Winner.

3 (2h 26m 17s):
Really? That's wild.

4 (2h 26m 20s):
What do you think? That's cyber truck.

3 (2h 26m 22s):
I love it.

4 (2h 26m 23s):
See, I kind of like it too. And I'm not an electric dude. I was, I was gonna tweet this out to Elon, like don don't know if we have mutual friends, but I was gonna say like, Hey, I'll make you a deal. Send me a fucking cyber truck. I'll fucking drive it for a few weeks and I'll give my honest fucking opinion on it. Oh, oh, you'll love it. Like, no fucking money, no nothing. If I like it, you just let me buy it. I don't even want it for fucking free. I go, but you're gonna take the chance. It's a 50 50. You're that fucking confident in it. Like, people know me that I don't fucking bullshit. Right. and Don don't need a free fucking truck. Right. You should probably give it to me if I do that. But don don't fucking need it. So I'm happy to be like, send me a fucking truck. So I basically jump the line. Right. You know that that's should be. Yeah.

3 (2h 27m 1s):
You do a review. I'll

4 (2h 27m 2s):
Drive the fucking truck.

3 (2h 27m 2s):
A Kid Rock review. Fuck yeah. I like it. You'll love it. Have you driven electric

4 (2h 27m 7s):
Car before? I guess we, I guess we're calling him out now, right?

3 (2h 27m 8s):
Have Yeah, we are. Yeah. Have you driven dude's nuts? Dude, that is hilarious.

4 (2h 27m 13s):
I mean right there. I wanna hang out with that dude. He's

3 (2h 27m 15s):
A maniac. He's a fucking maniacs. Fucking

4 (2h 27m 18s):
Great.

3 (2h 27m 21s):
Have you driven an electric car before?

4 (2h 27m 23s):
I drove Rivian for the first time. Oh, those are great. But I only drove it like down the street. Buddy of mine showed up with one and a friend of a friend drove it down the street. It was the SUV and then like drove up my driving shit and it was fucking wild. Yeah, it was good. And I've been interested in those too. 'cause those are, that's a Detroit company.

3 (2h 27m 39s):
Yeah. The Rivian are supposed to be great. The plaid. I have the, the plaid. The S plaid. What's that? It's the four door car that goes zero to 60 in 1.9 seconds. Do

4 (2h 27m 52s):
They make it in a men's color?

3 (2h 27m 53s):
Yes. White or black. I think you get red too, but the fucking thing, it's something from the future. You can't, you can't imagine a car that's that fast and and completely silent.

4 (2h 28m 8s):
That blew my mind too. But you're, you're like me. You're not driving up to fucking Alabama in your

3 (2h 28m 14s):
Car. Right. If you have to drive long distances in those things, it's a pain in the dick. Right. Because you gotta pull over and stop and wait for 20 minutes and charge it up. It might take

4 (2h 28m 23s):
Longer. I think the only place I drive myself these days is to the airport or to the dentist. Mm, that's it.

3 (2h 28m 28s):
Well, if you just wanna drive around town, electric cars are the shit. And that thing, I think it does zero to 60 under three seconds and it's 7,000 pounds and bulletproof.

4 (2h 28m 38s):
And it's stainless steel. I like, I

3 (2h 28m 40s):
Could stainless steel.

4 (2h 28m 41s):
I could wrap up motherfucker in gold.

3 (2h 28m 43s):
Wrap that motherfucker in gold

4 (2h 28m 45s):
Or camo.

3 (2h 28m 46s):
It looks like something from the future. It looks like some Blade Runner shit. Like when you're

4 (2h 28m 49s):
Standing, which I'm not into. I'm not into modern

3 (2h 28m 51s):
Design. You been in front of it? No, in real life. Oh, it's so sick. It's, I saw

4 (2h 28m 55s):
Things about if getting fucked up in snow and shit. Have you've seen that shit. Bad

3 (2h 28m 58s):
Tires. That's all that is. Have you ever driven an A MGG wagon in snow? They're fucking terrible because they have street tires. They have wide street tires on that make can handle

4 (2h 29m 6s):
Well. Got one foreign car.

3 (2h 29m 8s):
What do you got?

4 (2h 29m 10s):
Rolls Royce?

3 (2h 29m 11s):
Well, we both had only Velociraptors, right? That's

4 (2h 29m 15s):
Right. I got my, that's my daily driver still. Yeah.

3 (2h 29m 18s):
I drive is TRX

4 (2h 29m 19s):
I know, I've been back

3 (2h 29m 20s):
And forth and he, he's the man, he's a maniac.

4 (2h 29m 22s):
I want, I wanna preface because people think I'm up fucking like, like I'm really into Rolls Royces. I bought this car 'cause I've had this Waffle House license plate, like, you know, holder forever. and I got this car guy and he's like, I got a hundredth anniversary rolls with Gold Flake. And I'm like, we're gonna get that fucker and put that Waffle House plate on it and I. And then I got, let's go Brandon Badges on the side of it.

3 (2h 29m 47s):
Oh, that's hilarious.

4 (2h 29m 48s):
And we have more fun in that fucking thing. Going to Waffle House or like, whatever shit we're doing. That's

3 (2h 29m 52s):
Hilarious us. That's the only Rolls Royce in the country with a Waffle House license plate on it. Let's go, Brandon. There it is.

4 (2h 29m 60s):
Oh my. How'd you find that? Fuck is all this shit on the internet? Yeah.

3 (2h 30m 4s):
You didn't know it was on the internet. That

4 (2h 30m 5s):
Was on the news.

3 (2h 30m 7s):
I'm sure it was Of course. It's on the news. I

4 (2h 30m 10s):
Stop nerding out everything.

3 (2h 30m 12s):
I'm glad You don Glad you don't pay attention to all the shit that people write about you. You'd go crazy, right?

4 (2h 30m 16s):
Oh yeah. Do you know what? Only time I read comments is when it's like a news article and I'll go, I'll see like some fucked up article and I'll, I'll think like, family Feud. I'll think like, this is what everyone's saying down below and I'll scroll through 'em and I'm usually pretty fucking close.

3 (2h 30m 35s):
Mm. Like

4 (2h 30m 36s):
I could read something up there and probably start scrolling. I could tell you what they're saying in some fucked up particle. Like the, the majority, like I I, I fucking Pat myself on the back. I'm being pretty in tune with common folk, even though I couldn't tell you what a gallon of milk costs, but just my friends places. I have houses where I spend my time wanna do like, I'm kind of, people think I'm some fucking nutball right wing fucking weirdo. I'm pretty fucking level headed overall. Yeah. And I know, you know this more Yeah. More than most people. But you know,

3 (2h 31m 3s):
When people get real suspicious, when things get real weird is when you got people that put up things and you can't comment. That's weird.

4 (2h 31m 13s):
Well, I did one, like,

3 (2h 31m 14s):
Like Bill Gates puts up a lot of stuff on Instagram and you can't comment.

4 (2h 31m 17s):
Well, my, my father passed away last week. God bless him. And so I put up a nice post and then Trump actually posted the bottom, which was fucking mind blowing and unbelievable. What a great friend right there. If I could speak to him about a human being. and I could tell you what a great father, grandfather he is All day long. but it was actually my fiance's suggestion. I see fiance too. We've been together 17 years. So they're suggesting like, Hey, if you're gonna do this nice post for your dad, turn off the comments. Make it about him, not about you. And you know, everyone saying, I feel bad for you and this, that and the other. and I thought that was the right thing to do. That's the only time I've turned the comments off.

3 (2h 31m 54s):
Yeah. That's not a

4 (2h 31m 55s):
Thought. I thought that made sense. Yeah. I thought she was hit that one. You know?

3 (2h 31m 58s):
Yeah. That's not, that's not a bad piece of advice, especially in that particular post. Right. That makes a lot of sense. But that's one of the, the, the things that people are having to navigate through now. Someone posts something, people get to comment on it. Everybody gets to comment on it. It's interesting. See, I

4 (2h 32m 17s):
Get all that from, from my fiance, Audrey. My life's turned into a fucking meme as yours. Like me and my friends, we don't fucking talk. They just send me fucked up memes and I send them back like fucked up shit on the internet.

3 (2h 32m 29s):
Yeah.

4 (2h 32m 30s):
And it's some half the time, it's some comment that's some weisenheimer made. That's fucking hysterical. It just fucking makes your day. But I'm not gonna spend my time sifting through 'em. No.

3 (2h 32m 39s):
Well, there's so many out there and so many people find them. So many people aggregate 'em. There's like thousands of meme pages. I follow a shit ton of 'em. I find they say funny shit. I follow 'em. It is one of the things that's really interesting politically today is that the left are terrible at Memeing. They're fucking terrible at it. Who would've ever thought that the funniest shit would be essentially right wing? Like the, the the, and it's not, they're really right wing people.

4 (2h 33m 10s):
Conservative have changed immensely when they're the

3 (2h 33m 13s):
Rebels.

4 (2h 33m 13s):
Rebels Now, when from when I was right, I'm the fucking rebel.

3 (2h 33m 16s):
Yeah.

4 (2h 33m 16s):
Everybody in fucking Hollywood, my business is fucking, you know,

3 (2h 33m 19s):
They're the conformists fuck.

4 (2h 33m 20s):
Right? Yeah. I'm the one like, fuck that. Yeah, Trump.

3 (2h 33m 23s):
That's, that's the punk rockers and the rebels or Republican. Now you know who said that? Johnny Rotten. Johnny Rotten, yes. From the fucking sex pistol. Had a very famous quote about that. Well,

4 (2h 33m 33s):
He's fucking, see if you can find

3 (2h 33m 35s):
That.

4 (2h 33m 35s):
He's right wing wild. He's a Trump dude.

3 (2h 33m 37s):
It's wild. Well, it's like even Mike Tyson said this. He goes, when I was younger, I was very, very liberal. But as I, as I get older, I just have more common sense and I, see how my kids are going into this world? I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa. He goes, I've become more conservative. That

4 (2h 33m 52s):
Seems to be pretty common. It's

3 (2h 33m 54s):
The oldest expression ever. But like, show me a young man who's not liberal. Show you a man with no heart. Show me an old man who's not conservative. I'll show you an old man with no brain.

4 (2h 34m 3s):
Very true. But that, and it used to be more so back in the day, like big conservative was you're fucking dork. Yeah. You were dork when you're a kid.

3 (2h 34m 10s):
Yeah.

4 (2h 34m 11s):
That's changed. I mean you got fuckers like me on here. Fuck this, fuck that. You know, blah, blah, blah.

3 (2h 34m 16s):
We also realize like there's a certain, certain aspects that being conservative promotes that are very beneficial. One of them accountability and discipline. Those things alone. Those things alone. Like you're, you're a thought of as a conservative, and I'm not conservative, but you're thought of as a conservative view exercise, which is just hilarious. If you're telling me that you are not on my side because I'm fit and because I I work out all the time, then good. I want to know that. I want to know that you don't like strong people. I wanna know that you don't like people with willpower. I wanna know that you don't like people who have discipline, who get things done because you're not on my side then. Because I know the way to navigate this life in a positive, happy way.

3 (2h 34m 58s):
And it's not by being lazy and it's not by not promoting beneficial things to your health that are difficult to do, like getting in shape. If you're not, you've not actively, if you're not saying that. It's good to be fit and strong and be able to protect yourself if you're not saying that. and I

4 (2h 35m 16s):
Would like to double down on that for people who like what I do. And there's plenty of them, you know, that they know I love them and they love me. Like, you know, I've done it the last several years. Really got my shit together. I'd say since I'm 40, I'm in the best shape and feel the best that I've ever felt since then. That's awesome. So it's pretty wild since then. But I would like to put it out. I've always wanted to figure out a way, and this might be the right platform, because I know you're into that lifestyle, is to employ them. Like, Hey man, listen to fucking what Dana White says. Listen to what Joe Rogan says. You know, listen, if if you want advice from me, I'll give it to you. Like, there's ways to do this now. And the information is all there at the fingertips to like start taking small steps. Whether it's the intermittent fasting or whether it's cutting out processed foods.

4 (2h 35m 59s):
Whether it's, you know, just everything in moderation, including moderation. You know, there's so many little things of getting in the gym, self-discipline like that. It's, it's, you know, a lot of my fans are in and around my age. It's fucking time. It is time to start doing that.

3 (2h 36m 12s):
It is. It's never too late. And you will improve. Just do it carefully and slowly in the beginning. Yeah. That's the most important thing. Don't, don't become, become a hero first day in the gym and hurt yourself. Because most

4 (2h 36m 23s):
Of the time I'm doing is shit. I come off like all I do is fucking drink and smoke and say, oh fuck that. That's, that's not how you get to where I'm at. No. There's a whole lot more discipline involved, workwise, health wise, family wise friends, fan wise. 100%. Everything.

3 (2h 36m 37s):
100%. I'm glad you said that. People need here.

4 (2h 36m 39s):
It's the most positive shit I've said in fucking 20 years. I'm

3 (2h 36m 41s):
Bringing it outta you. Kid Rock. Let's go. It's important to talk about because it's important for people to hear that, you know, it doesn't mean you're not a good person. Doesn't mean you're not a kind person. It's like, I like being strong and if you wanna tell me there's something wrong with being strong, then you're weak. There's no, there's no way. No way. You're making any sense. It's not important to be fit and healthy. Shut the fuck up. It's not important to know how to protect yourself's so dumb. It doesn't mean that you hurt people. It doesn't mean you want to hurt people. I don't wanna hurt anybody. But if I'm in a situation, I would rather be the person who gets to decide who goes to the hospital. Absolutely. don don't want to be at the mercy of some crazy person.

3 (2h 37m 22s):
It's

4 (2h 37m 22s):
Peace of mind too. It's much

3 (2h 37m 23s):
Like I have much more calm

4 (2h 37m 25s):
Way overdone electronic locks here on my bedroom and this, you know, gone here. Safe room, all this shit. And it's not like a necessarily need it because you've been to my place to get to my place. Like you, if you come up there, you're fucking already on strike too. Right. It's sleep easier.

3 (2h 37m 40s):
Sleep easier, better sleep. Better. Also the world. You gotta know what's real in the world. The idea that there's no threats out there is so stupid. No, it doesn't mean you're looking for one All day long and seeing ones that aren't there. But recognize the reality of the world that we live in. The threats are real. That's

4 (2h 37m 57s):
Fucked up. We went to the movies probably five years ago. Me and me and Audrey we're just afternoon, like four o'clock. Let's go see some movie we wanted to see sitting there fucking one time. don, don't bring my gun. Right. Just grab a seat. Just 10 people in there. You know, theater's empty. This fucking kid walks in some fucking white kid, his fucking backpack and his fucking hoodie up. Oh Jesus. He goes and sits all the way in the back and I'm sitting there and with her and I'm like, I don't have my gun. And we both agreed, let's go. And we fucking left. Wow. It's fucked up to have to even think that way. But that's where my mind was. and I more. I dare.

3 (2h 38m 33s):
There's no metal detectors at the fucking movie theater.

4 (2h 38m 36s):
Right. This fucking $20 we spent on movie popcorn. I'm like, let's go. I I just for peace of mind, I'm like, let's leave. Right,

3 (2h 38m 42s):
Right.

4 (2h 38m 43s):
Probably was a nice kid. I don't know. If you don't think people judge you on your fucking appearance, you're fucking crazy. Yeah.

3 (2h 38m 48s):
Especially if you have a hood over your head and a backpack.

4 (2h 38m 50s):
Well, anything I would look like a fucking nut When I was young, I had fucking flat top up to here and pants sagging and fucking smoking doobies fucking like, and I got judged by it. Rightfully fucking. So there's Of course until you get to know somebody. What else do you have? And to judge 'em on how they appear.

3 (2h 39m 8s):
But also that's a new factor in the world. The mass shooter. It's a new factor. And here's the thing that new,

4 (2h 39m 14s):
It's always fucking white people too on talks about black people kill each other and white people like fucking shoot up fucking schools and fucking bullshit and this, that and the other. Yeah.

3 (2h 39m 22s):
It mostly is white people

4 (2h 39m 23s):
Stereotypes are fucking crazy.

3 (2h 39m 24s):
It is mostly white people. And lately mostly LBGT people.

4 (2h 39m 31s):
It's not even gay people. It's the fucking weirdos are like, yeah. And how many people do you think are doing that? Like, I wanted to rebel against my dad, God rest his soul when I was fucking young. You know what I mean? Even though I was totally like into hip hop and everything, I still knew that it got his fucking goat. And you know, and we had our fucking differences when I was young. Very understandable now that I'm a grandfather myself. But how many of these kids like, you know, got that dad, they think he's a racist, this, that and the other. Maybe is on some level it's certain things. 'cause he tells inappropriate jokes or whatever, this, that and the other. You know, people are from different times, blah, blah, blah. That I know I'm gonna piss my dad off that motherfucker.

4 (2h 40m 11s):
I'm gonna wear a dress.

3 (2h 40m 12s):
Oh yeah.

4 (2h 40m 13s):
Remember guys, when we were younger, they'd get earrings shit. Totally straight dudes. You know, just get earrings. I remember dudes getting em pissed. Their dads up. My my, my brother got my dad ripped it out of his fucking ear. That's no shit. Woke em up out of bed. Fucking

3 (2h 40m 27s):
That's hilarious. Yeah, for sure. There's definitely people that rebel against their parents. There's also people that always look at the people that are older and look at how fucked up the world is and think they've got better ideas. That's how communism starts. It starts from the universities. That's where it comes from.

4 (2h 40m 44s):
Unbelievable. What's going on in those universities. Did you go to

3 (2h 40m 45s):
College? Oh, it's wild. Yeah. I went to UMass Boston, but it, I really only went just so people didn't think I was a loser.

4 (2h 40m 52s):
Where's your fucking accent?

3 (2h 40m 54s):
I got rid of it. As soon as I started hearing my voice, I was like, Ooh, that's I

4 (2h 40m 57s):
Terrible. I love Boston accent. That's one of the reasons I love Bill Burr. He's funny as shit. But I love that fucking, hey fucking guy. Fuck this guy.

3 (2h 41m 4s):
He's the most Boston Boston guy. I, I was actually born in New Jersey and then I lived in San Francisco until I was 11. and I lived in Florida from, I was 11 to 13, then Boston from 13 to like 24.

4 (2h 41m 17s):
Oh, no wonder you're fucked up. San Francisco, Florida in Boston.

3 (2h 41m 21s):
Yeah. Yeah. I lived all over the

4 (2h 41m 23s):
You. don know if you're a gay redneck or just a fucking Irish fighting son of a bitch.

3 (2h 41m 28s):
Yeah. I lived everywhere then. I lived in New York till I was like 27 then lived in la Yeah. So I was all over the place. So I never really dev. I I did have a Boston accent though. I did for a while. I definitely blended in. I love that

4 (2h 41m 41s):
Fucking accent.

3 (2h 41m 42s):
It's a great accent for dudes. Rough on the ladies rough to hear. Like a hardcore Boston. Are you going to fuck me a

4 (2h 41m 52s):
Wat I'd take it over a New York accent. All of a, some of my buddies from New York, they got the hardcore Long Island shit. They're funny too, I guess. Who's saying it? You know,

3 (2h 42m 2s):
A friend of mine, we kids hooked up with this girl and

4 (2h 42m 4s):
Did we finish all that beer?

3 (2h 42m 6s):
No. We can get more. There's not a ton left, but there's something,

4 (2h 42m 10s):
There's not a ton left.

3 (2h 42m 11s):
So a friend, he hooked up this

4 (2h 42m 13s):
Girl. Maybe I could call my boys, have 'em drop you off if I

3 (2h 42m 15s):
We've got some beers. Yeah. You have to drop off a pallet. But anyway, he, he said that, she said like, when they started making out, she's like, you're gonna tell your friends. So that became a thing that we always repeated. You're gonna tell your friends

4 (2h 42m 35s):
Who made that neon? I collect a lot of old

3 (2h 42m 38s):
Reports. Roadside relics. A company here in Austin, Texas. I

4 (2h 42m 42s):
Know roadside relics. I bought shit from them. They're so what they did right there. 'cause you can't get porcelain anymore. It's very tough to get, but what they did right there, you

3 (2h 42m 48s):
Can't get porcelain anymore.

4 (2h 42m 49s):
It's very tough. So what they did right there, 'cause I a collector of these is they painted behind the neon. See how it makes that Joe Rogan pop? A lot of people can't see the top thing either. That's cool. But what I'm saying is they did a fucking great job on that.

3 (2h 43m 3s):
Well, they do all their stuff like, like it's old. Right. You

4 (2h 43m 6s):
Know, it's, but that's, that's half the thing of old is painting behind the neon. Yeah. A lot of these new ones don't do that. Oh. A lot of the honky tonks you see in Na in Nashville down there, they don't have that.

3 (2h 43m 15s):
Oh, well this is a gift. Yeah. From my friend Brigham. And so when he gave it to me a great gift, when I, when I got it, I was like, oh, that should be like right behind me. Look at that. That's great. That's perfect.

4 (2h 43m 26s):
Now trust me, I, that shit, you have no idea what that shit is worth. Go online and start looking up fucking real fucking porcelain old school neons and go to auction houses. I go to all these auction houses and buy 'em and shit.

3 (2h 43m 37s):
Oh yeah.

4 (2h 43m 37s):
On fucking real.

3 (2h 43m 38s):
Well this is, you know, this guy does a wild, he does a bunch of wild shit online. He does amazing stuff. I know their stuff. Cool. Artist I know their stuff. It's an interesting art form. Right. Like old neon signs. They, there's a, a soul to those that they're, they're exciting. There's

4 (2h 43m 55s):
A great place in Nashville. I gets, sometimes I'll find old ones and they're so ridiculously priced. I have one in my house. It was Redneck Paradise. It was, it was a thing up in the, I can't remember what, upstate New York's some vacation spot and I wanted to buy it and it was fucking ridiculous. It must have been like fucking 35, $40,000 for something around that size. Different dimensions.

3 (2h 44m 16s):
Wow.

4 (2h 44m 17s):
So I go to Bobby Joslyn, Joslyn Sign company. I'm like, Hey, can you replicate this with what I wanted to say? Yep. Six grand.

3 (2h 44m 25s):
Ah, you saved yourself some money. There's a thing about having the old ones though, right? Yeah.

4 (2h 44m 30s):
I got some cool ones.

3 (2h 44m 31s):
If you have something that's really old,

4 (2h 44m 33s):
I have Willie Nelson's Nashville nightlife who was on his thing. It's probably 26 feet long and probably five to six feet high.

3 (2h 44m 41s):
Like what does it mean out of

4 (2h 44m 44s):
Steel? 'cause it was outdoors.

3 (2h 44m 47s):
Oh.

4 (2h 44m 48s):
But painted on the whole thing. Fucking

3 (2h 44m 52s):
Wow.

4 (2h 44m 54s):
I got some cool ones. The old Dixie gas ones that you know you're not supposed to have. 'cause I have a Confederate flag on 'em, you know, from the old gas company back in the day.

3 (2h 45m 0s):
Oh wow.

4 (2h 45m 4s):
There's some eerie racist shit out there. Yeah. I, I antique and flea market a lot. Especially I, I rarely stay the night in the city unless I get to

3 (2h 45m 12s):
The west coast. Like Racing

4 (2h 45m 12s):
One, no racist.

3 (2h 45m 14s):
Oh racist.

4 (2h 45m 15s):
Like, not neons, but just shit out there racist. Like, I'll collect some of the stuff just 'cause they're never making it again. Whether it's Native American, black shit. Like I have these fucking signs that I found in Reno, Nevada at some antique shop and they're solid steel. Real deal. It's like, it's like, they'll say like, swimming whites only. Whoa. And these were actual signs that were up somewhere. and I don't know what to do with 'em. 'cause I wanna put 'em up, put 'em up somewhere and I ask my black friends. They're like, dude, don't put that up.

3 (2h 45m 46s):
Don't put that up.

4 (2h 45m 46s):
I'm like, but it's a reminder of how fucked up shit was. Yeah.

3 (2h 45m 49s):
People don't want that reminder. You should put it in a drawer somewhere. Yeah. They're, you can show people like, look, I'm gonna show you something. This is how fucked up things used to be. And then you like preface it every time you introduce it to 'em. So You

4 (2h 45m 59s):
Don't think it has like a little bit of a reminder of how fucked

3 (2h 46m 1s):
Up things were. No, no. It does. If you have it in a drawer. Yeah. So if you have it in a drawer, shouldn't then, shouldn't you say you wanna see how fucked up things used to be? You, you know, they used to have those signs. So you

4 (2h 46m 10s):
Don't think I should put it right next to my swimming pool up there?

3 (2h 46m 14s):
I would advise. No, but I think having it is not a bad thing. You should have it in a drawer. So if you have it in a drawer, every time you show someone, you get to represent what it is. Instead of it just being a sign. They're like, Kid Rock is a sign

4 (2h 46m 27s):
Only, but my friends are all fucking cool. Like, I'm sure they are. We fuck with each other's on that level all the time.

3 (2h 46m 32s):
I'm sure they are. It's not them that I would ever worry about.

4 (2h 46m 35s):
I'm not putting it up for other people. I'm putting it up for my family. My friends

3 (2h 46m 38s):
Already. Your fucking, your your fucking Rolls Royce. They're the,

4 (2h 46m 42s):
I'm putting it on my Rolls Royce.

3 (2h 46m 43s):
But they have it. Great idea photos. Where'd you

4 (2h 46m 45s):
Get that idea? Joe Rogan Whites old me, my Roll Royce.

3 (2h 46m 52s):
Oh my God.

4 (2h 46m 54s):
But oh

3 (2h 46m 54s):
Shit. It's, but having it as a, a relic of, you know, the Jim Crow days is, is, you know, I

4 (2h 47m 1s):
Don wanna show my son. I wanna show my granddaughter. Show anybody,

3 (2h 47m 3s):
Like, you know, it is historic. There's I mean it's creepy, but it's like at the old studio we used to have Where is that fucking helmet? That Nazi helmet. We had a Nazi helmet that had a, a sword, like a bayonet.

4 (2h 47m 18s):
You'd only use, you only used it on Halloween and stuff? No,

3 (2h 47m 20s):
It had a, a light. It was a light, it was made by this same guy, Shane against the machine. This guy who made this chimpanzee skull. He, he made this like a, a lamp that was a Nazi helmet with a, a bayonet through it. Where the fuck is that Jamie?

6 (2h 47m 36s):
In a box? I don't know.

3 (2h 47m 37s):
We gotta find it. He has a picture. It needs to be brought back. That's our, that's our thing. How dope is that?

4 (2h 47m 44s):
I love it.

3 (2h 47m 45s):
That's dope. Right? Just

4 (2h 47m 46s):
'cause it's,

3 (2h 47m 46s):
It's a real bayonet. So,

4 (2h 47m 48s):
No, it's artwork. It's provocative. Yes. It's fucked up. It looks cool as shit.

3 (2h 47m 51s):
And it's a lamp. And the one I have has a bunch of holes in it. Like that one. It's pretty dope. This might

6 (2h 47m 57s):
Even be redone. I think that part's new.

3 (2h 48m 1s):
Oh, he, he, he ramped it up. Let's get a new one from him. We'll reach out.

4 (2h 48m 7s):
Yeah. I'm into that shit,

3 (2h 48m 8s):
Dude. I love it. But it's like, that is a, not

4 (2h 48m 11s):
Because it's obvious, you know, you get it,

3 (2h 48m 13s):
Obviously. I get it. But I mean, there's, apparently there's an area in Europe where so many people died. I, I'm not exactly sure what country is I know France has this enormous area,

4 (2h 48m 25s):
Fucking Normandy,

3 (2h 48m 26s):
The size of Paris. But France has an enormous area of the size of Paris that no one can go into. Do you know that they have so many unexploded or ordinance and so much chemical bombs and all this shit that they fucking dropped on them. No shit. Yeah. Find that one spot. What is it called? There's an area that's literally the size of Paris that you can't go into and it's all from the war. So apparently they found so many helmets that you, you could go there and like find them in the ground in certain, in these places during World War ii. So they're not uncommon. I wonder why they haven't, they take them and they could turn 'em into art artwork.

4 (2h 49m 6s):
I wonder why they haven't like de Debo it, de mind it, like all that stuff.

3 (2h 49m 9s):
I know, right? Like going there and gather up all the, all the swords and shit. Like, like how many people died there? They just left them there. I would

4 (2h 49m 18s):
Like to do that trip to Normandy. Like, yeah, I got some friends in Paris. Like, I am, I'm not diver. Like it's getting bad. Like, you know, years ago, I was like, I never wanted to be one of those people big around the world. It's not that I don't appreciate the fans. It's like, don don't give a fuck about being big in Croatia or fucking wherever. You know? Right.

3 (2h 49m 38s):
You wanna be able to go hang out. Played

4 (2h 49m 39s):
Europe and all. and I was raising a kid too as a single father. So I, I split my time. You know what I mean? It was always home. Like, you know, Thursday, maybe to Sunday. It was always home. But it's getting so bad. I was like years ago. I was like, I fucking love Canada. Love the fucking people there. But I'm like, eh, I'm not gonna go. I'm like, I'm not going to Europe. I said that years ago. I'm like, I'm fucking done. We, we have talked about doing a festival and, and Budapest like for all the European fans, some shit gets kicked around. But I'm like, nah, I really, I love the fans and I don't fuck. I don't care. I'm like, I'm not gonna fucking Canada love fucking Canada, but I'm not going. And now I'm to the point I'm like, is there really a reason to go west of the Mississippi?

4 (2h 50m 21s):
Mm. Like fucking huge in Kentucky, man. Like big.

3 (2h 50m 30s):
But you don't have to. You do whatever the fuck you want. Your Kid Rock. You can make those people come to you.

4 (2h 50m 35s):
I try not to let that get to my head actually.

3 (2h 50m 37s):
But you don't have to. But you just decide. don don't like going there. Like, I don't hate anybody in Canada. I just don't go there anymore.

4 (2h 50m 44s):
Dude. I went there with, here it is. I went there with Wayne Gretzky and got detained.

3 (2h 50m 49s):
I believe you Why'd you get detained? Just

4 (2h 50m 52s):
For, it's like, you know, you had to do that rehabilitation thing 'cause you got caught with weed when you were like 18 or whatever. Everyone in my band did. This is one of the reasons we stopped going there. They kept fucking with me. Every time I go flying private, we fucking, the king of Canada fucking detained me for 45 fucking minutes. I'm like, fuck this place man. And I know it's not the people's fault. I look at Trudeau. He's a fucking classic piece of

3 (2h 51m 12s):
Shit. He's piece of shit. When did this happen? How long ago?

4 (2h 51m 15s):
This was with cello's hall of fame induction. So whatever year that was.

3 (2h 51m 22s):
How many years

4 (2h 51m 22s):
Ago? Seven. Eight. Seven. I'm terrible with the year game.

3 (2h 51m 25s):
Yeah. They're rough on letting people in. So listen to this. The years follow. Maybe

4 (2h 51m 30s):
We ought to take a nod from 'em.

3 (2h 51m 32s):
Yeah. They've got Well they're not, they, they don't want people integrating into their culture though. They're happy for people to be able to,

4 (2h 51m 40s):
Their whole culture's integrated. Yeah. In Vancouver.

3 (2h 51m 43s):
It is. It is. But what I'm saying is like they're having a problem with like Muslim people wanting to impart Sharia law in certain schools and certain

4 (2h 51m 52s):
Cases Don't tell me about it. I was born in Dearborn, Michigan, which

3 (2h 51m 55s):
Is crazy. Right. Fuck. One of the things that was hilarious was they, they elected this woman to be a Muslim who's a mayor of the city in Michigan. And the everyone's like, yay. So inclusive. First thing she did is ban the pride flag.

4 (2h 52m 11s):
Yeah, exactly. They're throwing mother, they're throwing gay people off buildings. It's crazy. People are like, free gay people are like free Palestine. Have

3 (2h 52m 18s):
You ever seen that meme? Like gays for Palestine then Palestine for gays. Yes. They're

4 (2h 52m 23s):
Throwing people. Yeah. Throw people off buildings.

3 (2h 52m 25s):
Jamie, can you pull that up so I could read it?

4 (2h 52m 27s):
The thing

3 (2h 52m 27s):
I just had up? Yeah. About the size of Paris. So in the years following the great War today around a hundred, 460 kilometers. Square

4 (2h 52m 37s):
Square

3 (2h 52m 37s):
Miles. Yeah. Roughly the size of Paris is still strictly prohibited by law from public entry and agriculture use because of an impossible amount of human remains and unexploded, chemical munitions yet to be recovered from the battlefields of both wars. So there's an impossible amount of human remains out there, dude. Right.

4 (2h 52m 59s):
I'm looking at the top and the website says messy nessy chick.com.

3 (2h 53m 5s):
It's a solid website. It's totally trustworthy and reliable.

4 (2h 53m 10s):
Messy. Nessy chick.com says,

3 (2h 53m 13s):
Well this is a lady that just, whatever, maybe it's a dude don don't know who wrote it, but whoever, this person that just reporting on something that is true. That this is, damn, they pulled so much shit outta that area.

4 (2h 53m 24s):
I kinda wanna go there like a metal detector.

3 (2h 53m 28s):
I bet you'd find some shit. 100%. We

4 (2h 53m 30s):
Do some metal detecting.

3 (2h 53m 31s):
But just imagine that expression. An impossible amount of human remains.

4 (2h 53m 36s):
460 square miles.

3 (2h 53m 39s):
Yeah. Paris.

4 (2h 53m 40s):
That fucking, that's no.

3 (2h 53m 42s):
What is the total amount of square miles? It say Jamie, it said

6 (2h 53m 45s):
It originally covered that much space and then it now was down to the size of Paris. Mm. There's a,

4 (2h 53m 51s):
There's

3 (2h 53m 52s):
Fucking way

4 (2h 53m 53s):
In Paris is full

3 (2h 53m 53s):
So square they slowly encroached in on the toxic area.

6 (2h 53m 58s):
1200 square kilometers. Four 60 square miles. Now down to the size of Paris.

3 (2h 54m 3s):
Wow. Originally

4 (2h 54m 5s):
Covering. Oh big 460 square fucking miles is,

3 (2h 54m 8s):
It's a lot.

4 (2h 54m 9s):
It's fucking huge.

3 (2h 54m 9s):
That's a giant piece of land. It's a state. Yeah. Bigger

4 (2h 54m 12s):
Than some states. So

3 (2h 54m 13s):
There's a state you can't go into.

4 (2h 54m 17s):
I wanna go,

3 (2h 54m 18s):
It's probably super scary. I mean there's places in Vietnam where people would walk through the jungle and then boom, no leg. 'cause you just stepped on a landmine that had been left there for 50 years.

4 (2h 54m 29s):
My uncle was in Vietnam. Not good. Not good.

3 (2h 54m 34s):
That's one of the sketchiest wars. You wanna be a conspiracy theorist Look into Vietnam. The Vietnam War is one of the most perplexing of all wars. 'cause today no one thinks we should have gone. And yet they do the exact same thing today. They did it back then. The way they just decide that people from this country need to be flying overseas to go shoot at people they don't know. And it's all based on a lie. And no one ever goes to jail for that lie.

4 (2h 55m 4s):
That's

3 (2h 55m 5s):
Insane. And everything evolves, man. Everything evolves. You know, like computers back then were terrible now. They're really good. You know, if they were really terrible at the way they were corruptly running the world back then and made it real obvious. They're better at it now.

4 (2h 55m 20s):
Yeah. You just, what's the end game?

3 (2h 55m 23s):
I don't know man.

4 (2h 55m 24s):
Like, I'm fine. I could ride it out. I've blessed. I'm like, all right, what about my grand grandchildren? Like, fuck

3 (2h 55m 30s):
I know. I go back and forth from being optimistic to really pessimistic. I go back and forth. Like I'll start thinking, you know what, I'm pretty sure we're gonna pull ahead and figure this out. And then I go, yeah, stupid. That's 'cause you live in Texas and you don't live in Gaza. If you lived in Gaza, you would be convinced that it's the end of the world. Right? Yeah. Because it is the end of the world in one place in that spot. It's the end of the world. But where you are, it's not. And you gotta look at it that way. And when I look at it that way, I'm like, the

4 (2h 55m 58s):
Only wars we won were the fucking ones. We were the most brutal motherfuckers on the planet. Which I don't disagree with what Israel's doing. It's like they should just go in there and be like, you know what? We want our hostages back if we don't have 'em back clock starts now in fucking 24 hours. We're gonna start bombing motherfuckers and killing fucking civilians. 30, 40,000 a fucking time. So you civilians better fucking pack up and fucking get these fucking motherfuckers and tell you, you go against Hamas, you fucking go against them. We're not playing fucking games with you. But that's how only thing people understand. This is what happened in Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Boom swiped out.

4 (2h 56m 39s):
They're like, oh yes, we don't have supreme leader anymore. We did not know you had such big bombs.

3 (2h 56m 45s):
Yeah, but everybody has big bombs now. The problem is you use a big bomb. You set a precedent that they can use a big bomb.

4 (2h 56m 50s):
They don't have one.

3 (2h 56m 51s):
Well they don't, but they're allies too. Then we, that's the real problem.

4 (2h 56m 55s):
The fuck outta them. Someone's gonna learn. Yeah,

3 (2h 56m 57s):
You

4 (2h 56m 57s):
Gotta get get your ass beat hard enough.

3 (2h 56m 59s):
You can't just nuclear bomb people. I

4 (2h 57m 2s):
Didn't say

3 (2h 57m 2s):
Nuclear bomb you back. No, I didn't say okay. Since Hiroshima and Nagasaki. I thought you meant it like that.

4 (2h 57m 6s):
No, no, I was saying just the the brute force of strength. Okay. Used in those. Yeah. But

3 (2h 57m 10s):
Even, even the conventional bombing campaign, if you wanna do that somewhere, they can do that to your place. And this is what we have to avoid.

4 (2h 57m 19s):
Fuck around and find out.

3 (2h 57m 21s):
Yeah. Until someone launches nukes and then we have a a and we, our civilization is over the world, as you know, it ceases to exist. There is no more electricity. Whatever tools you have or things you find and a small percentage of us are gonna make it to breed and then make new kids. I like

4 (2h 57m 43s):
How you said us

3 (2h 57m 44s):
Go out into the world.

4 (2h 57m 45s):
I like how you said

3 (2h 57m 46s):
There's very few people that are gonna live. Man. It's

4 (2h 57m 48s):
Like me and you could probably

3 (2h 57m 49s):
Figure Figure it out. Yeah. Yeah. I have chickens too. I have elk in the freezer too. But that freezers not gonna stay

4 (2h 57m 57s):
On. You can gut, you can gut an elk. I

3 (2h 57m 58s):
Can gut an elk. Yeah. But that freezer's not gonna stay on. So I'm gonna lose most of my meat unless I turn it into jerky. You're gonna have to do something to figure out how to fucking get by. Because the world is gonna be different. You know, you're not gonna have any electricity forever for the rest of your life. There'll be no electricity

4 (2h 58m 15s):
Just throwing paint at the ball wall. But what if we empower the people of Palestine who are, could be good people. I don't know. I mean last I checked, most of these motherfuckers hate us. But I'm not saying all the people do. There's probably a lot that don't. Just like in Iran, the population as you know, because of the Iraq war, there're, there's so many under 50 there. That's like the majority. The

3 (2h 58m 36s):
Thing is, these guys don't have access to other information outside of where they live. And then on top of that,

4 (2h 58m 41s):
El Elon el send the starlink. We'll send 'em some fucking guns. Fuck. Let's go.

3 (2h 58m 46s):
The problem is, most of them would be so opposed to Israel that they would want to use those guns to go attack Israel. Well

4 (2h 58m 53s):
Then we've, especially

3 (2h 58m 54s):
Now we

4 (2h 58m 54s):
Have, now we have do reason to fuck them all up.

3 (2h 58m 57s):
Yeah. But if you think about you're a kid and you don't know why there's a conflict between Palestine and Israel and you're living in Palestine, it's, and then they start bombing it's, and then they kill your mom's fucking, but didn't do fucking war. Right. But you didn't do anything. It sounds like Bud Light. And then you get guns fucking, you're gonna go want to attack people, you're gonna want to avenge them. You're gonna want to join whatever group, whatever

4 (2h 59m 21s):
Terrorist group. So why did World War II end?

3 (2h 59m 23s):
Well why did World War II start

4 (2h 59m 26s):
Checkmate?

3 (2h 59m 27s):
You got a dude who's fucking methed up. You got Adolf Hitler methed up, charismatic dude that wants to take over the world. That's how it started. You know, how did it end? Nuclear bombs. but it also ended through attrition. You know, at the end of it. Like the, the devastation on both sides was so horrible. Terrible.

4 (2h 59m 46s):
But where was the end? What was what?

3 (2h 59m 49s):
Washir Shame in Nagasaki. No, but what

4 (2h 59m 50s):
Was the alternative?

3 (2h 59m 52s):
Well, that's that case. You know the thing about whenever you're bombing cities, like you're killing, what if

4 (2h 59m 59s):
That was your house? What if that was your house? Let's call your house Israel and your neighbors are Palestine.

3 (3h 0m 5s):
Okay. Those

4 (3h 0m 6s):
Motherfuckers, there's, you got a family of four, they come over and fucking take out two of 'em. In the fucking worst way. Are you really gonna like, worry about like what type of force you're using at your neighbors?

3 (3h 0m 17s):
No. You definitely believe, well,

4 (3h 0m 18s):
The wife didn't have anything to do with it. We gotta make sure she's okay and get some aid. This, and there's like, no, I'm sorry man, this is fucking war. It's terrible. It's the worst thing on earth. I'm a peaceful man.

3 (3h 0m 28s):
Right. But you're not supposed to pick civilian targets. That's actually a war crime.

4 (3h 0m 33s):
You can't find war like that

3 (3h 0m 34s):
When you, but you're not supposed to pick target. They're

4 (3h 0m 35s):
Hiding in civilians targets.

3 (3h 0m 37s):
They are. So that's where like the massage, they're

4 (3h 0m 40s):
In hospitals, hospital trenches, fucking underneath. They got operation centers. They, they, they

3 (3h 0m 43s):
Killed those dude.

4 (3h 0m 44s):
Day s go by the reporting. Like, you know, I get it. but it, at some point you gotta believe something. Right.

3 (3h 0m 50s):
No, I definitely do. They definitely seem to be doing that. But also if you're a person who's born in Palestine, you're fucked. You're under their control. Yeah. It's not your fault. And we by

4 (3h 0m 60s):
Birth

3 (3h 0m 60s):
You're fucked. Yeah. But that, those aren't our enemy. And the the thing is, like what you were saying, get 'em, get 'em, cell phones, get 'em the internet. Get 'em armed. If you get 'em armed, they're not gonna really know how to use it. They're gonna also true. Unless they're joining those military groups. And then they're also gonna be indoctrinated at a young age by those groups. I would imagine, especially now with all the bombing that's been happening in Johnson.

4 (3h 1m 24s):
You just came full circle To my point.

3 (3h 1m 26s):
I'm not opposed to what's what you're

4 (3h 1m 27s):
Saying. There's, there's no alternative.

3 (3h 1m 29s):
I'm not saying that I'm opposed to what you're saying. What I'm saying is that, you know, what you're saying is like, could be taken as like a callous thing to like that. It's just gonna have to be how it is that we have to kill women and children. Yeah.

4 (3h 1m 41s):
I, I wish there was an alternative. Well, and I don't know everything on this by the

3 (3h 1m 45s):
Way. I don't know everything on this either, but I,

4 (3h 1m 47s):
But I do know, I doubt They're sitting up in, in, in, you know, congress going like, Hey, we better listen real close to Kid Rock. He's got this figured out.

3 (3h 1m 55s):
He's just not willing to accept that. The only way human beings can resolve things in 2024 is to bomb each other out of existence. Oh, I

4 (3h 2m 2s):
Wish. I fuck. Believe me.

3 (3h 2m 5s):
It's just the whole thing is so fucked. The whole, the whole

4 (3h 2m 8s):
House time. The reality sets

3 (3h 2m 9s):
It Israel thing is so fucked.

4 (3h 2m 12s):
If everybody in the world was willing to give up their fucking guns and weapons, okay. Never gonna fucking happen.

3 (3h 2m 20s):
Like, well no

4 (3h 2m 21s):
One so fucking why we

3 (3h 2m 22s):
Don't even bring it up. No one would agree to that. Just because you're always gonna need, you're gonna assume you're gonna need to hunt things. There's cops, you're saying that like you're gonna let the animals just go wild then bears and, and you deer overpopulate everywhere. You're never gonna kill any of 'em. Did you see that anymore?

4 (3h 2m 38s):
Did you see that one fucking crap fucker by the antlers was fucking just

3 (3h 2m 43s):
Dude. Yeah. If you live near moose, you better have a gun bitch. Oh my

4 (3h 2m 47s):
God. They're fucking mean. They

3 (3h 2m 48s):
Will stomp you to death. Wow.

4 (3h 2m 50s):
You got one of my hunting. Montana comes right up to the, to the lodge. Pretty cool. But

3 (3h 2m 55s):
You don't wanna go outside where they're outside. They'll stomp you to death. Yeah. Seen

4 (3h 2m 58s):
The videos.

3 (3h 2m 58s):
Oh my god. I watched this. Don't

4 (3h 2m 60s):
Throw snowballs at the moose.

3 (3h 3m 1s):
I watched this snowboarder the other day just get stomped and it broke his leg.

4 (3h 3m 6s):
Did you see the one where the chasing him down the hill? Is that the one?

3 (3h 3m 11s):
No, the guy was like, he just walked up to it and it just started stomping him and it stomped him down and he couldn't get back up. He's just getting rocked and it, no one wanted to jump in and help him. They're afraid, you know, he's getting stomped to death by his fucking moose. They're the most aggressive of all the deer species. They'll actually go after you if they think you're threatening. They don't want to. But if they think you're encroaching in another territory, they're like, oh, I'm gonna stomp this dude out. They know how to fight.

4 (3h 3m 40s):
I'm gonna suck this dick.

3 (3h 3m 41s):
Alright Bud Light. These are the special Texas cans son. I see that. Look at that. We got Longhorns, we got the star. We got both.

4 (3h 3m 58s):
Alright. Shane Gil is getting you free. Bud Lights.

3 (3h 4m 1s):
I don't think we, I think we bought 'em. We bought 'em, right? Yeah. I could have taken 'em from my club

4 (3h 4m 8s):
Free. Shit kind of sucks.

3 (3h 4m 9s):
Free shit's not as fun when you have money. There's not,

4 (3h 4m 12s):
There's nothing free about it.

3 (3h 4m 13s):
The thing is, it comes with Yeah, you become friends with that person or influence. Yeah.

4 (3h 4m 19s):
There's nothing free about

3 (3h 4m 20s):
It. Yeah. It could get weasley

4 (3h 4m 23s):
I mean unless you're like talking like free Tesla cyber truck.

3 (3h 4m 27s):
Well you're not even, you're, you're subjecting him to a review. Right. I mean it's not just free. You're gonna

4 (3h 4m 35s):
Just thinking maybe I could bully him into a free one.

3 (3h 4m 39s):
I don't think so. Especially now that you said it.

4 (3h 4m 41s):
Yeah. Damn. Just

3 (3h 4m 44s):
Fucking the thing's amazing though. I haven't driven it, but I have a friend who has one and he said he, he bought it just 'cause he had like one of the earlier, you know, like number out of the lot, like number nine or something like that.

4 (3h 4m 54s):
The only thing I could see bad about driving around a cyber truck, telling your parents you're gay.

3 (3h 5m 4s):
I knew something like that was coming. I was just hoping it was gonna be Nah.

4 (3h 5m 8s):
Fucking I, I fucking, I hate modern shit and I fucking something about that truck. I like it.

3 (3h 5m 13s):
It's a great truck. Like they

4 (3h 5m 15s):
Have you driven one? Yeah.

3 (3h 5m 16s):
No, I haven't driven the cyber truck, but I've driven electric cars. I've driven the, the s I've seen the cyber truck in real life. He brought it here and I've seen a bunch of 'em on the road. I think they look dope.

4 (3h 5m 26s):
He brought it here. Yeah,

3 (3h 5m 27s):
He brought it here. He parked it right back there. It's cool. We sh I shot an arrow at it.

4 (3h 5m 33s):
Fuck

3 (3h 5m 33s):
You asked me to shoot.

4 (3h 5m 34s):
Why'd you shoot a gun at it?

3 (3h 5m 35s):
Because I didn't want to have a ricochet in a fucking garage. 'cause it will bounce off. It's

4 (3h 5m 41s):
Worth it.

3 (3h 5m 44s):
We'd that

4 (3h 5m 44s):
You had to weigh the fucking,

3 (3h 5m 45s):
If I had ear plugs, you know, if I had the my my ear gear. My eye gear, maybe I would've shot it. But the point is it can survive a 45 slug. It's legit. It's, it's like folded steel. It's thick as shit. I like it. It's pretty dope. I like the idea

4 (3h 6m 4s):
Of it. And like I said, I'm

3 (3h 6m 5s):
Done and it's an American car.

4 (3h 6m 9s):
I like a little

3 (3h 6m 10s):
American. That's me shooting at

4 (3h 6m 11s):
That's you.

3 (3h 6m 12s):
Yeah, I shot at it and it didn't even scratch.

4 (3h 6m 16s):
What's the Porter Rico shirt?

3 (3h 6m 18s):
It's a meme. There was a dude, there was a dude who went to a a game who looked exactly like me. I mean he looked exactly like me. And the meme was like, Joe Rogan ain't being slick.

4 (3h 6m 31s):
That's pretty good. and I saw that

3 (3h 6m 33s):
And I saw that. I was like, oh my god, that guy looks exactly like me. So I was him for Halloween. So me and Elon did a podcast together. Come on bro. That looks exactly like me. How much does that guy look like me? It looks like me. If I've been eating spaghetti, tell me

4 (3h 6m 47s):
That's his real fucking hair.

3 (3h 6m 49s):
Don don't know if that's his real hair, but that was me.

4 (3h 6m 51s):
Tell me that. That's that can't look at his eyebrows. That can't be his. No, they were all wearing

3 (3h 6m 55s):
Blonde wigs for a reason. I looked it up at one point. Oh okay. It has to be a wig. Yeah. So I got a similar wig.

4 (3h 7m 7s):
And this kids is why you just say no to weed?

3 (3h 7m 10s):
Well, you know it's a fun thing to do. But the point is, I didn't go through the I mean I have an 80 pound bow shooting. You

4 (3h 7m 18s):
Draw

3 (3h 7m 18s):
80. Yeah. What

4 (3h 7m 20s):
The fuck?

3 (3h 7m 21s):
I have a 90 too. I have a 90 as well. You don't,

4 (3h 7m 23s):
You don't need to draw more than fucking 30.

3 (3h 7m 25s):
That's not true. Who told you that? Ted. Ted? Yeah. Ted has a very, I'm not a bow hunter.

4 (3h 7m 30s):
Listen, my girl

3 (3h 7m 30s):
Is Ted is a legend and I agree with him on almost everything. Except

4 (3h 7m 36s):
How far are you shooting a fucking whitetail at fucking 150 yard.

3 (3h 7m 39s):
Okay. If you're shooting whitetails. But I'm shooting elk. And also I am of the opinion that, well that goes 80 pounds to me is not the same as 80 pounds as someone who's not strong.

4 (3h 7m 50s):
True. I can't pull that. It's a big difference. I can't pull

3 (3h 7m 52s):
Fucking 80 pounds. So when people say like, oh you pull 80 pounds, that's stupid. I do 80 pounds hundreds of times a day. I do it all the time. It's not hard for me to pull 80 pounds. So when someone says you pull 80 pounds, like yeah, I shot 200 arrows. Like what's your point? Like if you have a hard time pulling 80 pounds, why are we pretending that we have the same body? Why are we pretending we have the same physical strength? This is dumb. So like if someone's saying like 70 pounds is all you need for, okay, but why, why not go to 50? Why not go to 30? Why not go to 20? That's dumb. Because at a certain point in time you're gonna lose speed and you're not gonna be able to penetrate correctly. You're gonna have less kinetic force on your arrow.

4 (3h 8m 33s):
Kinda goes with golf like a hardy swing the far the ball goes. But you don't have to swing hard. You need to hit it straight and make good contact.

3 (3h 8m 39s):
Right. But there's also a lot of people that believe that holding weight makes you more accurate and a heavier holding weight when you She is locked in. Locked in. You're more accurate. I know guys who feel more accurate with an 80 pound bow than they do with a 50 pound bow or a 40 pound bow. But it's all subjective. Right? That's all dependent upon your technique and how much you train in archery. But I just, I I train with

4 (3h 9m 3s):
A hundred wind mag.

3 (3h 9m 5s):
I Yeah. Look. Okay, good example. You don't shoot a 22, you shoot a 300 wind mag. Why? Because you can

4 (3h 9m 12s):
Well I'm not doing head shots.

3 (3h 9m 15s):
That's true.

4 (3h 9m 16s):
17 cow

3 (3h 9m 16s):
Headshot. You're not doing head shots with a bow and arrow either. When you're shooting something with a a you should have it as mo as lethal as possible. And so for me, I like a heavy arrow moving fast and really accurate. And the best way to do that is to have heavier draw weight.

4 (3h 9m 34s):
Alright. I'm not, I'm not bow, I like shoot my bow at targets and drink beer.

3 (3h 9m 38s):
Yeah.

4 (3h 9m 39s):
That just pisses me off when I'm out there and fucking, something's outta range and I see it. And I've been sitting out there, I'm like, fuck that shit. What about the adrenaline rush? I'm like, get that every night on stage. I'm like, I want fucking kill some shit and eat it.

3 (3h 9m 52s):
Well then you can just get it. Sit over a feeder. There's a lot of people that hunt in Texas like that. They just put a stand over a feeder. Yeah.

4 (3h 9m 59s):
I I don't like the white tail hunt anymore.

3 (3h 10m 1s):
No.

4 (3h 10m 1s):
Nah. I don't need to be alone in the woods with my fucking thoughts for that Fucking long fucking bored. I try to take some, some snacks, take a fucking nap. I wanna run the mountains and chase elk or birds action buddies there. I don't like to be alone.

3 (3h 10m 14s):
Yeah, that's a definitely, I've done it before. I did it with my friend John Dudley. I did some tree stand whitetail hunting. It's, it's a different mental game. Like it's very hard to do. and I, I think people don't understand how hard to do. What's

4 (3h 10m 28s):
The game? Fucking sit here and wait. Yeah.

3 (3h 10m 30s):
Sit there and keep your shit together where you don't move. Because maybe that if you do that doesn't, at one in time a giant buck's gonna stroll through the the trail. Right. I

4 (3h 10m 39s):
Hate that. Fucking,

3 (3h 10m 39s):
Fucking and I get it. I get it. I

4 (3h 10m 41s):
Rather ride horseback, get off. If someone puts some birds out, we got some pointers. I get a beer in my fucking case.

3 (3h 10m 48s):
It's not for me. A

4 (3h 10m 49s):
Lot of work chase elk up and it, that's, you know, that's a lot of fucking

3 (3h 10m 52s):
Work. Yeah, that's a lot of work. And it's the most fun, fun

4 (3h 10m 54s):
Getting to the elk. You know, once you, once you spot 'em, then there's a lot of them and you're picking out the big daddies and then you gotta fucking figure out how to get to 'em. Yeah. And that could take fucking a couple days and fucking a lot of miles of fucking hiking.

3 (3h 11m 6s):
It's difficult everywhere you go. The hunt, it's difficult if you're hunting elk, like if they're wild free ranging elk, it's really hard.

4 (3h 11m 14s):
But I enjoy

3 (3h 11m 15s):
That. But the thing about that's hard, about whitetail hunting though, is the mental game. Just keeping your shit together and stand All day down.

4 (3h 11m 22s):
Oh, my girls sit out down, out there for seven hours. She'll take a couple snacks and the tree stand with a fucking bow. I'm like, you're fucking nuts.

3 (3h 11m 28s):
People are dedicated to it. They're dedicated to it. Like, 'cause they're, they're also like learning from each other on how to set up trail cameras and how to

4 (3h 11m 36s):
Set up pattern. The Deeres.

3 (3h 11m 38s):
Right. Putting scent on trees and shit. I'm fascinated by I don't do it because it's just, yeah. They make the grunt noises. They rattle. I, I hunted some white tails down in South Texas last year. But we did it. Well

4 (3h 11m 52s):
I have too. You're on a buggy. They put their feeder around goes

3 (3h 11m 55s):
White tail. No, we didn't do it that way. We rattled them in. They're real responsive to rattle during the

4 (3h 12m 2s):
Rut.

3 (3h 12m 2s):
And fucking dude, it's crazy. You rattle, you cl some antlers together and within 15 seconds, bucks were running straight towards you. Just

4 (3h 12m 13s):
Running at you South Texas is unbelievable. Like

3 (3h 12m 15s):
It's crazy down there. Yeah. Crazy down there. You could have anything. You could have zebras and fucking,

4 (3h 12m 21s):
It's the only state. 'cause I looked into it 'cause I was like, I should high fence our place in Nashville. Like even just get some cool shit to look at. Whether it's some stags or zebras or fucking, you know, whatever. Water. Buffalo low.

3 (3h 12m 34s):
You can't do it. Oh, you cramping again, bro.

4 (3h 12m 37s):
That

3 (3h 12m 38s):
Didn't work. Did it work? Didn't work.

4 (3h 12m 39s):
I think it's from sitting in this fucking dead chair.

6 (3h 12m 42s):
Pinch your lip. Not his tongue.

3 (3h 12m 44s):
Oh, your lip. If

6 (3h 12m 44s):
It's your, if it's your right leg, pinch the inside of your left lip or something like that. I was reading it says it's a, a thing. I don't

3 (3h 12m 52s):
Know. Yeah, I'd heard it was Grab your tongue. I went to

6 (3h 12m 54s):
Dad said that Inside

4 (3h 12m 55s):
Of your lip to pinch my leg down here.

3 (3h 12m 57s):
Fucking almost

4 (3h 12m 58s):
Grab my cock.

3 (3h 12m 59s):
Whoa. Easy. What were we talking about? So you couldn't high fence your spot?

4 (3h 13m 3s):
Well, no you can't in Texas, you can have any animal you want. Right. And like at Tennessee and I, think Alabama too can only be native to that. Oh. To that state that you can have in there. You

3 (3h 13m 14s):
Know what's hilarious about Texas? But

4 (3h 13m 16s):
That's not true because Luke Bryan had some red stag on a property.

3 (3h 13m 20s):
Maybe it was on the snake tip.

4 (3h 13m 21s):
It's only certain things you can have, but you can't, the more exotics, like, they're like, no. Oh, that's what it is. Like

3 (3h 13m 27s):
Zebras and shit. Yeah. I,

4 (3h 13m 28s):
I like, you gotta fucking be honest here. 'cause fucking homeboys over here like tick,

3 (3h 13m 31s):
Tick, tick,

4 (3h 13m 32s):
Tick, tick. Fucking fact.

3 (3h 13m 33s):
He'll, one handed Google you. It's,

4 (3h 13m 34s):
It's not like fucking fact checking after the fact. It's fact checking in real time.

3 (3h 13m 38s):
But wasn't Tiger King in Oklahoma? Wasn't that where that was?

4 (3h 13m 42s):
Dude speaking Oklahoma. Shout out to Jesse Jane who passed away recently. The porn star. Yeah. I dated her for a while. Way back in the day she

3 (3h 13m 50s):
Passed away.

4 (3h 13m 51s):
She did drug overdose Sally. But she was a beautiful girl. Nice girl. and I feel like people in my position wouldn't, wouldn't say that. You know what I mean? Because she had a lot of friends. She was awesome. I spent Christmas out there with her family and her mother actually took care of baby tiger. She worked at this Tiger Zoo. Oh. Back. This was years ago. Her family couldn't have been cooler. Her mom, her dad, her brother, her grandparents, her son was young at the time. Like she was a really nice girl. I just wanted to say condolences to her family. But she was involved with, they had a baby tiger during Christmas at the house that she was taken care of. and it was the coolest thing.

3 (3h 14m 26s):
You know, one of the craziest ones, do you know Melanie Griffith when she grew up, it was Melanie Griffith. Right. She grew up with Lions.

6 (3h 14m 33s):
I think that's right. Isn't that movie we've been trying to watch a million times?

3 (3h 14m 36s):
Right, right. There's some crazy movie where they used real lions and these people getting caught up by lions. Like everybody on the set got hurt. But I think Melanie Griffin grew up in a house with like large cats.

6 (3h 14m 49s):
Yeah. She's in the movie I think

4 (3h 14m 51s):
Like lions.

3 (3h 14m 53s):
Yeah, like, like lions. and it was like their, their house. Like there's photos of them with these lions in their house. I

4 (3h 15m 0s):
Can't say I don't want a pet lion.

3 (3h 15m 2s):
Yeah. But dude,

4 (3h 15m 3s):
When they, when a monkey,

3 (3h 15m 4s):
When it goes parrot south, she got

6 (3h 15m 6s):
Attacked by a lion that turned the movie.

3 (3h 15m 8s):
She eventually recovered without being disfigured. Although she did require some facial reconstructive facial reconstruction. 50 sutures. 50 sutures. After being attacked by a lioness. What sutures? It was fear that she would lose an eye. But she eventually recovered without being disfigured. Although she did require some facial reconstruction.

4 (3h 15m 28s):
Stitches. Stitches of sutures.

3 (3h 15m 30s):
Sutures. A lion jumped on John Marshall and bit the back of his head inflicted a wound that required 56 sutures.

4 (3h 15m 40s):
When did people start calling 'em sutures? Why do they say stitches?

3 (3h 15m 43s):
They're just being technical. She See if you can get photos of Melanie Griffin with the lion, the photos. 'cause there's a a website that like documented it and it's, it's really weird. Yeah. Like that's her house. Oh,

4 (3h 15m 57s):
I see it

3 (3h 15m 58s):
Up here like that. How weird is that? Man, that's her as a kid. That's so insane. They have lions. Like you have a dog. That's so insane. These things are so big. And they were playing with them in the house and hoping that these things didn't fuck them up. Look at this. This is so crazy, dude. Oh, this is the dumb movie where the thing's attacking people look, it's so being playful and they're trying to pretend that they're being attacked. Yeah. It's bad. It's so dumb. If that thing attacked you, it'd be so quick and violent. If it wanted to Looks

4 (3h 16m 36s):
Like a great movie. Like you still did Hallucinogenics.

3 (3h 16m 39s):
No, it'd probably freak you out. It's supposed to be a terrible movie, but it's just, imagine growing up like that.

4 (3h 16m 46s):
Yeah.

3 (3h 16m 47s):
Fuck. That's fucking insane.

4 (3h 16m 49s):
Talk about Frosted Flakes

3 (3h 16m 50s):
Growing up with Lions.

6 (3h 16m 53s):
Oh, they're saying we we're listening to it in this. She is being attacked.

3 (3h 16m 57s):
Oh, she really was.

6 (3h 16m 58s):
I guess she was saying the safe word and the director kept filming.

3 (3h 17m 1s):
Oh my God.

4 (3h 17m 1s):
So they're trying to promote the movie

3 (3h 17m 4s):
So they didn't pull the line off. Is that what they were supposed to do? I guess I know. Oh Jesus Christ.

4 (3h 17m 9s):
Where's your smoke suckers in here.

3 (3h 17m 11s):
They'll suck it out. Nowhere where it's going up. It's all through. They're up

6 (3h 17m 14s):
Behind

3 (3h 17m 15s):
Their head. Yeah.

4 (3h 17m 16s):
Slick. Yeah, bro. Like that. This is what happens when you get a ton of fucking money for talking to people. Smoke suckers.

3 (3h 17m 24s):
If you wanna do it this way. Some people do it differently.

4 (3h 17m 28s):
I I got the big ones in the studio like,

3 (3h 17m 30s):
Oh yeah, those are loud though. Those will fuck with the conversation. This is perfect. It's like

4 (3h 17m 35s):
Just worst mouth suck. Worst thing you can have in the worst thing you can have in a fucking recording studio.

3 (3h 17m 39s):
Oh my God. Right. Gotta

4 (3h 17m 41s):
Do vocals. Like click shut 'em off. Yeah.

3 (3h 17m 44s):
Yeah. This is quiet.

4 (3h 17m 45s):
I couldn't afford the, the good ones.

3 (3h 17m 48s):
Well it's also, there's like a lot of space above the room so you could set up your equipment outside so it doesn't make so much noise.

4 (3h 17m 57s):
Starlight ceiling, look at you.

3 (3h 17m 58s):
Yeah, bro.

4 (3h 17m 59s):
At

3 (3h 17m 59s):
You. Good Flying stars too. Shooting stars. What does Kid Rock think about aliens? Do you ever worry about what the fuck's going on? Nah. Not at all. No. You see all the talk in the news and all the disclosure hearings?

4 (3h 18m 18s):
No. I mean I've, I've don't never click on the articles. I'm like, I can fuck.

3 (3h 18m 23s):
That's good.

4 (3h 18m 25s):
It's

3 (3h 18m 26s):
Until you have to know

4 (3h 18m 27s):
Until someone's like, dude, he's with me. We're coming over.

3 (3h 18m 30s):
Right. Like,

4 (3h 18m 32s):
Eh.

3 (3h 18m 32s):
That's a good way to, yeah. Because you know how many people waste their time wanting it to be real. Hoping it's real.

4 (3h 18m 40s):
Don don't know.

3 (3h 18m 40s):
It's a waste of time.

4 (3h 18m 41s):
Don don't even know what to think about it. I know if I want it to be real.

3 (3h 18m 46s):
Well you gotta imagine as big as the universe is that there's something out there and you gotta imagine what if there's something out there that's just a thousand years more advanced than us. Just a thousand little blip. Little tiny amount of time. Not that much time at all. Really think about us.

4 (3h 19m 1s):
There's something here like that. He's called Elon Musk.

3 (3h 19m 5s):
Yeah. Imagine a whole planet filled with the successor to Elon. You can, you could easily imagine something would want to visit here and you could easily imagine that something exists.

4 (3h 19m 17s):
No. Could you imagine if they didn't? Yeah.

3 (3h 19m 19s):
That's crazy.

4 (3h 19m 20s):
They're, if they're like, fuck Disney World.

3 (3h 19m 22s):
Yeah. Like don,

4 (3h 19m 23s):
Don't go to that fucking stupid place. Look what we got here. Yeah. That'd be like us going to Canada or Europe.

3 (3h 19m 29s):
It would be a lot crazier than that

4 (3h 19m 31s):
If they're like, yeah, I don't want to go to fucking that planet.

3 (3h 19m 34s):
I think it'd be like us going to like some country and studying animals. don don't think it would be. I think it'd be like studying, literally like going and finding cave people that are stone age still now that would be studying them. See, I'd

4 (3h 19m 52s):
Rather go back in time and talk to those fuckers than talk to the people in front of us.

3 (3h 19m 57s):
The people in front of us are probably

4 (3h 19m 58s):
Not gonna be people anymore. Poignant questions.

3 (3h 20m 0s):
The people in front of us are probably gonna be integrated with technology, like permanently integrated. They, that new guy that Elon Musk put the neur link in his head. Yeah. He apparently can use a, his cursor. He can actually like search the internet and I saw that. Do a bunch of things just using his brain now. So it's working.

4 (3h 20m 20s):
I just wanna see if like me and George Washington would be boys, like, would he be like golfing, like me and Trump like hanging out? Like I have a lot of questions.

3 (3h 20m 32s):
If you go to one place, where would you go? If you had one shot, you can go back in time once and survive and come back to the future. Where would you go?

4 (3h 20m 40s):
Jesus. Jesus.

3 (3h 20m 43s):
What if there was nobody there?

4 (3h 20m 45s):
Even better, I get involved myself. Just me and

3 (3h 20m 48s):
Jesus. No I mean What if Jesus wasn't there? What if you go back and you're like, I just wanna go see Jesus. You're like, okay. Fuck. He'd be there. What time

4 (3h 20m 54s):
He'd be there. He'd probably, he'd probably like a DJ back then. Fucking cutting his shit up. Fucking he's there.

3 (3h 21m 1s):
You think there's a real Jesus Definitely.

4 (3h 21m 4s):
Absolutely. A thousand percent.

3 (3h 21m 6s):
What makes you convinced

4 (3h 21m 10s):
My faith

3 (3h 21m 17s):
I mean? That's a good answer. I always wonder when people are telling stories though, like how long did that story take before people wrote it down? How many times did people alter it just like they do with everything today? I gotta imagine that at a certain point in time in history, they probably didn't tell the truth about a lot of things. And we take those things, tell 'em through oral traditions, tell, have them written down. Well

4 (3h 21m 40s):
There's a difference between lies and between the truth getting, you know, manipulated and twisted a little bit. The underlying usually is still there.

3 (3h 21m 49s):
So you think the the real truth was that he actually was the son of God?

4 (3h 21m 53s):
Yes.

3 (3h 21m 55s):
It'd be amazing if it was true.

4 (3h 21m 57s):
It is amazing.

3 (3h 21m 59s):
I believe you. I believe that. You believe that. Would

4 (3h 22m 1s):
You like to be introduced to Jesus?

3 (3h 22m 4s):
Listen, I think the concept of Jesus is absolutely amazing and if Jesus came here and wanted to visit me, I would be psyched.

4 (3h 22m 10s):
Would you like to know Jesus? In what way? I can put my pastor on your show.

3 (3h 22m 15s):
I'm good. She's great. Pastor

4 (3h 22m 17s):
Paula White. Very. She's Trump's spiritual advisor too. That's hilarious. You should have her on the show. Talk about Jesus.

3 (3h 22m 23s):
I'm very interested in the idea of Jesus being a real person. But I look at it the same way I look at everything else. Whereas like, let's circle

4 (3h 22m 32s):
Back

3 (3h 22m 32s):
What the words are.

4 (3h 22m 33s):
Let's circle back. You told me that you believed in Bigfoot for

3 (3h 22m 36s):
A while. Joking.

4 (3h 22m 37s):
Joking.

3 (3h 22m 37s):
I was joking around. Okay. I was joking around, but I wanted Bigfoot to be real. For sure. Just like I want Jesus to be real. He is. Well. Well the thing Bigfoot used to be real. The thing that I found out when I really got fascinated by Bigfoot,

4 (3h 22m 49s):
You know how you know Jesus is real right in this moment. How? Because the forgiveness that I'm exercising by drinking this Bud light right now.

3 (3h 22m 57s):
Oh, that's Jesus.

4 (3h 22m 58s):
That's Jesus. Jesus is everywhere. He's in this room. He's in the world. He's in the universe by the aliens that you want so desperately to be real or have the concept of them being real. That's Jesus. Mm. That is Jesus.

3 (3h 23m 14s):
Mm.

4 (3h 23m 15s):
As a Christian, I have to believe in forgiveness.

3 (3h 23m 19s):
Beautiful. Cheers. Well said.

4 (3h 23m 26s):
I never thought I'd have to explain Jesus. They're drinking a fucking bud Light. But

3 (3h 23m 30s):
You don't explaining it. You're just, you're you're saying how you feel. Jesus has

4 (3h 23m 34s):
God everywhere. They're everywhere. Yeah. Every time you look at a flower that blooms or you look at what are your children, you're like, that's Jesus. That is Jesus. That is God.

3 (3h 23m 48s):
Yeah. I wanna be real clear. I'm not like I

4 (3h 23m 50s):
Just saw shooting star. Yeah. How fucking cool is that? That's God going, bang. Nailed it.

3 (3h 23m 55s):
Sort of. That's every 30 seconds happens.

4 (3h 23m 58s):
I haven't seen one all fucking interview. They've been doing it all the the whole time. I just happen to be speaking passionately. They do it all time. But Jesus and gone that motherfucking went whoop.

3 (3h 24m 4s):
But that's how bi confirmation bias happens. People. That's what makes people believe certain things like that. Jesus sent that suit that fucking stars on a Maybe you timed it right.

4 (3h 24m 15s):
That's

3 (3h 24m 15s):
Jesus. It could be coincidental. That's Jesus. I think he's probably super busy and I would, I would guide him if he can do miracles. This is not the, this is not the spot.

4 (3h 24m 25s):
Sam Kinison the greatest ever.

3 (3h 24m 27s):
Yeah. He was the greatest ever. Or one of them for sure. When he went

4 (3h 24m 30s):
Off. When he went off in the Jesus yet.

3 (3h 24m 32s):
Oh my God. Yeah. Oh, not my left hand. Oh wow.

4 (3h 24m 37s):
What's that? You've been gone with your 12 fuck head friends who won't get a job. This is day three of this shit. Shit. 12. Every one of them is using you and You don. You don't have sense enough to know it. Yeah.

3 (3h 24m 49s):
Where have you been? Well, First of

4 (3h 24m 51s):
All, I was dad. He comes back after three days. Mrs. Jesus there. He's like, I've had enough of this shit. Comes back looking all partying out, man. Yeah, that's Sam Kinison was my favorite fucking

3 (3h 25m 5s):
Comedian. Also, you gotta remember Sam Kinson was doing that in 86.

4 (3h 25m 8s):
Oh. He was doing everything. Age jokes on gay people. Like it's the funniest shit on earth.

3 (3h 25m 14s):
Oh. He was an animal. If you

4 (3h 25m 15s):
Kids out there fucking listening have not watched that Sam Kinison from Hollywood. That's special. Yeah. His first one.

3 (3h 25m 23s):
I think it's called Breaking

4 (3h 25m 24s):
The Rules.

3 (3h 25m 24s):
Me Breaking Rules. Yeah. Is that what it's called? Breaking the

4 (3h 25m 26s):
Rules? I think so.

3 (3h 25m 27s):
It's either Breaking the Rules or Have you seen me lately? Have you seen me lately?

4 (3h 25m 30s):
No, it's, it's not even seen lately. Album. Album. It's gotta breaking the rules

3 (3h 25m 32s):
I think. Have you seen Me Lately? Is an album.

4 (3h 25m 34s):
It is the greatest comedy and that's going to get some strong shit.

3 (3h 25m 37s):
And louder than hell his, his cassette

4 (3h 25m 41s):
Like no doubt, like if Sam Kinson wouldn't have tragically passed away, like we'd be rolling around together.

3 (3h 25m 46s):
Yeah. Hey, I saw him live a couple of times when I was a kid. Oh,

4 (3h 25m 52s):
I'm jealous.

3 (3h 25m 52s):
Yeah, I got to see him two different places live.

4 (3h 25m 55s):
Rodney put him on.

3 (3h 25m 57s):
Yeah,

4 (3h 25m 58s):
One of our favorites too.

3 (3h 25m 59s):

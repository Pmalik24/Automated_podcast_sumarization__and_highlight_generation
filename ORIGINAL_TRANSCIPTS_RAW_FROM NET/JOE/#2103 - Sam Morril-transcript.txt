4 (13s):
I don't really like we do

3 (15s):
You like cigars?

4 (16s):
I like alcohol and I like coffee, huh? I'm my big cigar guy.

3 (20s):
Do you want alcohol?

4 (22s):
I'll have it maybe in like second half of the show.

3 (23s):
Second half of the show.

4 (25s):
I like, I like to feel the caffeine.

3 (26s):
Let's prepare glasses with ice for the second half of the show when things, once things start getting a little sideways.

4 (32s):
Yeah.

3 (33s):
So what's happening brother? How you doing? Great.

4 (35s):
Great. I, I've been on the road just going pretty hard with this hour and I love it. Yeah, I love, I still romanticize the road. I still love it. and I did, I did theaters last year for the first time ever. Just the theater run so that now I'm back in clubs to just tighten it. but it's, I love it, man.

3 (51s):
Yeah, clubs are the best. It's the best experience. The arenas are pretty nice. Yeah, they're fun in the round. They're really fun.

4 (59s):
They look fun.

3 (60s):
Theaters are fun, but it's slightly removed from a club. Club is better than a theater.

4 (1m 6s):
Yeah. It's pretty cool. I mean theaters. I forgot how intimate clubs were just doing theaters Yeah. Last year and being like, oh shit, I can see when a dude's frowning. You know? I can see one person having a bad time now, so that, I forgot about that. But there was a guy in Dallas over the weekend who just kept doing this to me, and I'm like, what the fuck? And I was like, oh, your girlfriend's the fan. He's not, he doesn't like me, his girl. He was just a Drunk. Oh,

3 (1m 31s):
Wow.

4 (1m 31s):
And I peeled outta me. He was Drunk on rum too, which is the fun to me. It's like funny. That's

3 (1m 35s):
A funny, that's a Jimmy Buffet Drunk.

4 (1m 37s):
It's just not, you don't see a lot of white dudes with goatees who are rum Drunk. So I was like, oh, all right. But it's eccentric. Yeah, he was, he was just a, he was a bad Drunk, but she was cool as hell. Well,

3 (1m 46s):
Sometimes guys have a real hard time with their girlfriend. Being a fan of a guy,

4 (1m 51s):
I feel like most of the people that like me are dudes. But yeah, me too. When I see women out there, I'm like, great.

3 (1m 56s):
Yeah,

4 (1m 57s):
I'm, when see

3 (1m 58s):
Titties

4 (1m 58s):
A tabletop of four. I'm like, fuck yes.

3 (2m 0s):
Yeah. When, whenever a lady asks me, are you Joe Rogan? I'm like, yeah. They're like, I'm a fan of your podcast. I'm always like, that's crazy. Thank

4 (2m 9s):
You. I mean, I'm sure you have a lot of female, it's a big pod.

3 (2m 12s):
It's the number two female podcast.

4 (2m 14s):
What's number one

3 (2m 16s):
True crime.

4 (2m 17s):
That makes sense. Like

3 (2m 18s):
One of them True crime shows women

4 (2m 19s):
Love true crime.

3 (2m 20s):
Yeah. So this women do listen to it. Yeah. But it's not, you know, I'm a guy and I'm probably annoying. I

4 (2m 28s):
Get it. I don be annoying. I

3 (2m 29s):
Get it. Like, if you're a woman and you don't I mean this, this is a bro heavy show. You know, like when we do protect our parks or when we do a fight companion or

4 (2m 36s):
The fights are definitely bro for

3 (2m 38s):
Bros. Yeah. And then when I have fighters on, unless it's female fighters, I've had a bunch of female fighters on too. You know, female fighters are probably my best example that I point to when people think that something horrible about fighting that it's like brutality and it's wrong and it's barbaric and I point 'em to some female fighters. I'm like, just listen to this woman talk. Like, listen to Rose Nama, Eunice talk about fighting and like listen to her post-fight speeches when she's telling everybody that we just have to be nicer to each other.

4 (3m 8s):
It is pretty cool to be almost like Buddhist and a fighter.

3 (3m 12s):
She's an amazing, amazing human. Very unusual human being, you know, elite world class fighter, world champion multiple times. And like one of the sweetest, nicest people alive. She's so nice to her opponents after fights.

4 (3m 28s):
That's, I don't know a lot about fighting. A lot of it I've learned from hearing you talk and stuff, but I, and you know, I, I remember watching a fight with like Louis Gomez and Dave Smith once, and they knew so much about it that that's how you get me into it, like backstory and stuff. Yeah. Like, I'm an insane NBA fan. I love sports, but yeah, I mean the, the comradery in that stuff to me is like, what interests me also is like, you know, growing up as a, as a nineties basketball fan, these guys fucking hated each other. Like, wanted to fight like Oakley Rodman, they were like down to fight you and mind games and shit. And now they all play a a u ball together. So they're all buddies and that, so part of it's kinda lost a little, it's weird. Like the, the camaraderie's beautiful and it's not, and now the trades are so off and that like, you're gonna end up on this dude's team at some point anyway.

4 (4m 13s):
Mm.

3 (4m 14s):
Yeah. Well, I guess it's probably the best players can figure out how to always play as a team while playing their best. You know, if

4 (4m 25s):
Your ego allows you to Yeah.

3 (4m 26s):
That's the thing. Some people are stubborn. Like, I'm, I'm definitely no basketball expert, but I, when I watch like high performing athletics, it's in a team sports environment. It's always this dance between what is the best thing to do to score versus what do I want to do? Right. What do I wanna do since I have the ball? What's the best for team? Do I want to try to show off? Do I wanna try to pull off something wild or do I pass? You know, like, what do I do? And then people get upset when you don't make, you know, the ladder when you don't pass enough. Right. That's like a big one. Yeah.

4 (4m 60s):
If you, if you slow down like I mean, think about it. If you wanna simplify it to like, kids playing in the park, if you're playing your ass off on D and you have one dude just like iso dribbling the whole time on offense, you're like, you're, you're wasting our energy. You're being a dick. I don't like that. So yeah, I think there's

3 (5m 14s):
Always gonna be guys like that, that just want the ball.

4 (5m 17s):
But you have to know who you are. I mean, it's like anything else. Like, if you know what's funny about you, you'll be a better comic. Right. If you know what's, what your purpose is as a basketball player, I'm a defender. I'm a three point specialist. Knowing who you are is, is all of it really. You

3 (5m 31s):
Know, it's one of the, the classic fumbles of all time is a guy who talks shit while playing basketball and then gets his ass kicked.

4 (5m 37s):
Yeah. But it's so satisfying. It's so, it's the worst thing ever. I mean when I see people shit talking like, Steph Curry. I'm like, you know how this ends. It's like, shit talking Jack Reacher, you're gonna fucking lose. It's

3 (5m 47s):
So ridiculous. Yeah. Why are you doing that? People are so delusional. Like the difference between a world class athlete and the average person is such a gap. But then again, there's some people out there that just genetic freaks and you know, they, they probably, you know, are young and it's super cocky and they might be elite someday and they think they are right now. Right. You know, it's just like, that's just a part of like being a male, you know, involved in competitive sports. They're all just going after each other, whether it's with basketball or football, or especially with fighting

4 (6m 27s):
On the professional level. It can be cool, but when you play with your friends in the park and you have that one guy with your anger problems and you're like, I had a friend who used to yell at people. I'm like, dude, that guy's homeless. You gotta stop yelling at a homeless guy.

3 (6m 37s):
I had a friend who used to do that at the comedian softball game. He would, it would him and this other dude who's also my friend, they would scream in each other's faces screaming like two gorillas, just screaming in each other's faces. It was so ridiculous.

4 (6m 52s):
Some people need that to get them amped up softball. Like Mike Michael Jordan would create shit. He would create reasons to be mad at. Like, there's this famous story about MJ where he, like a guy was like, he, he had a career night about, against Michael Jordan, a career night, 39 points or something. MJ had an off night and at the end of the game he was like, good game to Michael Jordan. Right. And Jordan was like, oh, I'm gonna fucking kill him. Like he said it like in his head sarcastically. So the next time they play Jordan annihilates him, like humiliates him. And then it later came out. The guy's like, I never said that. I didn't say shit to mi, but Jordan is so crazy. He needs fuel to just be like, you wronged me in some way and that's how I'll Right.

3 (7m 30s):
He probably put it in his head that the guy did said that.

4 (7m 34s):
Totally.

3 (7m 35s):
Yeah.

4 (7m 35s):
But that's like psychotic. But

3 (7m 37s):
That's how you get to be Michael Jordan. Sure. Just when you're the elite of the elite, that's just such a special mindset to be able to be that good at anything. Whether it's Tiger Woods at golf or Michael Jordan at basketball or Mike Tyson at fighting to get that good at anything. Man, that is so rare. You, it require, it requires so much insane focus on one goal. And you're competing with what, thousands and thousands of other elite athletes Yeah. That also have their eye on this one goal.

4 (8m 12s):
Well, tiger Woods is a great example of like, it's almost like, you know, you're a kid and you learn a, you learn a language at like two years old and you're like, well that kid speaks Spanish now. It was easy for him. That's what Tiger's dad did to him. Right. With golf, it's like, oh, you just know that this is what it takes.

3 (8m 25s):
Right.

4 (8m 26s):
With golf and then Of course you need to fuck 40,000 women. You have to childhood

3 (8m 32s):
Like Tiger Woods.

4 (8m 33s):
Exactly. And and I mean Jesus. Yeah. Let him have it.

3 (8m 36s):
Yeah. The whole thing's ridiculous. But also it's like, you see in that guy, the difference between what a elite athleticism applied to golf can. Like he got banged up. Yeah. Well, you don't hear about that many golfers that go through as many surgeries. I know he did one surgery for his leg, but a bunch of it's back stuff. Right? Yeah. And you gotta think that fucking torque that guy puts in that club. Like, how many times can you do that before your back just goes fuck you. Yeah. You know, the way that guy hits a ball

4 (9m 9s):
And and he's one of those dudes where you're like, growing up I'd be like, oh, you'd be a fat golfer. And then you see, no, your body will probably break down. Tiger's fucking ripped.

3 (9m 17s):
Yeah, he's jacked. Show me a video of him hitting like a long drive. Oh,

5 (9m 22s):
That's what I was gonna show you this, which is kind of, it's almost more impressive, his ability to stop mid swing. Who's shooting?

4 (9m 28s):
This is this rear window? Who's shooting this right here? Well, this is

5 (9m 30s):
Like on field stuff. Oh geez. But it's really, it's I mean, it's

3 (9m 35s):
Why did he stop mid-swing?

5 (9m 36s):
Because it's either someone made a noise or something, just distracted him. But like, you're already going and you're so torqued up by the time you're in the back there to stop is, it takes a lot. It's just like a mental, mental fortitude. And then also to be able to stop without fucking up.

4 (9m 53s):
But it is kind of funny the, the abuse other athletes take compared to golfers. Like, this was probably like if you're playing football, physical abuse. Yeah. Well, I mean verbal from, from an audience. Like, oh, right. I mean, if you're, if you're playing, I used to do a podcast with Julian Edelman, who's a Super Bowl champ with a patriot three times. Great guy. But he, he would tell me, yeah, they would throw dildos at me on the field in Buffalo. 'cause they hated me. Now in, in golf they're like, quiet. Quiet and like you can't take any noise. Yeah.

3 (10m 19s):
There's no noise.

4 (10m 20s):
It's a different focus.

3 (10m 21s):
But there is that one tournament that they do where it's a giant crowd. You seen that one, that

5 (10m 26s):
Problem with that This weekend They

3 (10m 27s):
Did this week they had a problem. Yeah.

5 (10m 29s):
What happened? They let in too many people and they stopped selling alcohol at like one in the afternoon. Oh no. We were getting so fucked up.

3 (10m 35s):
Oh no. Yeah,

5 (10m 37s):
It's like I mean that don don't, no one Oh no, no one got hurt

3 (10m 39s):
Or anything like that. Can you show a video? Well, I wanna see a video of him hitting the ball first, but then I wanna show Sam the video of this golf tournament there. I mean they get the dude the way his whole body like swings that club. There's so much force,

5 (10m 55s):
There's a hole. Look at that

4 (10m 57s):
Also to see that emotion. Damn.

3 (11m 0s):
And the years of practice. Like how many times does he swung a club?

4 (11m 5s):
I, I should say I know nothing about golf, but like, he's the dude if he's playing, you're like, yeah, it's fucking cool to watch Tiger Woods. Yeah.

3 (11m 10s):
It's cool to watch. How does he play Jamie? Since he broke his leg.

5 (11m 14s):
He has played Okay. Like he came, well, since he broke his leg, he hasn't played that many rounds. Really?

3 (11m 21s):
Apparently he had a terrible leg break. Like really bad.

4 (11m 24s):
Yeah.

3 (11m 25s):
That's scary.

4 (11m 26s):
Is his sun gonna be good?

5 (11m 28s):
His sun is good. Yeah.

4 (11m 29s):
Yeah.

5 (11m 30s):
His son's out driving him now, which don don't know what that means really. I mean, but like, that's really good.

4 (11m 36s):
That's power at a young age. That's

3 (11m 38s):
Insane. This

5 (11m 39s):
Is that crazy hole. The 16th at the waist management.

3 (11m 41s):
So look at this

5 (11m 42s):
Phoenix Open.

3 (11m 43s):
Look at the crowd. There's like a gigantic crowd and they're loud. People are loud. Wow.

5 (11m 48s):
They make it like a big stadium. Look

3 (11m 50s):
At that.

4 (11m 50s):
It is pretty cool.

3 (11m 56s):
I mean, listen to that. Cheer for golf Trouble around that flag.

5 (11m 59s):
And some of the players like encourage it on this hole, you know?

3 (12m 4s):
Oh my God, they're so loud. Oh shit.

4 (12m 13s):
Holy shit.

3 (12m 15s):
Oh shit. And everybody goes crazy. See, that is so much more impressive to do that in front of a crowd. Yeah. You know, I mean there's something kind of fucking cool about that.

4 (12m 24s):
You have to shut out the world. I mean that's, that's a talent too.

3 (12m 28s):
For sure. For sure. Especially in something that's so touch oriented. Like, you know, you just, you're just, you're concentrating on how many revolutions you're gonna put on a ball on grass. Yeah. You know, it's like, there's so much touch to it that any little ah, and you're, you're fucked. Yeah.

4 (12m 47s):
Golf and tennis. I don't, I've never been to either. and I Tennis when it's on tv, it's one of those where I'm like, man, the the shape you've gotta be in.

5 (12m 57s):
This was the crowd when he, this was the last time he

3 (12m 59s):
Won a big event. This is so insane. Look at this crowd. Yeah. This is

5 (13m 3s):
Stressful. Chasing him down Augusta. Look

3 (13m 4s):
How many people that is. And

5 (13m 6s):
He's gotta keep it together. I think he had pretty much had it like wrapped up by now. But you still have to make the last, you know, two shots. You can easily fuck those

3 (13m 13s):
Up. Dude, there's so many people. That's so ridiculous.

4 (13m 17s):
What do you think of his dad? I mean. It is a weird way to raise a child.

3 (13m 21s):
I'm not really familiar with exactly what happened. Well,

4 (13m 24s):
His dad just turned him into Tiger Woods. I mean, this is like, it's almost like a superhero origin story. I mean You don't have a, if you become this, you don't have a good childhood.

3 (13m 32s):
Yeah. And you, you probably also don't, didn't have a choice.

4 (13m 36s):
No way.

3 (13m 37s):
Yeah, but that's the question. I mean, is

4 (13m 38s):
It different than being a stage mom?

3 (13m 41s):
It's a good question. It's a good question. Like, how much is too much? Right? I

4 (13m 45s):
Mean, look at this. This is kind of dark.

5 (13m 49s):
I, at two years old,

3 (13m 50s):
He's two. He has a golf club and he's two

5 (13m 57s):
I mean,

3 (13m 58s):
Bro. That's insane.

4 (13m 59s):
The dock is in Incredible. That's insane. It's on HBOI think it's, it's incredible.

3 (14m 3s):
His form is immaculate at two. Wow.

4 (14m 9s):
But that's a lot of hours. Like, daddy, please let me watch cartoons. And he is like, fuck you, you're gonna work on your swing. I mean, that's kind of sad.

3 (14m 15s):
There's a little bit of that for sure. Yeah. You would like someone to just gravitate towards something. Yeah. And then you encourage them as far as they want to go with it.

4 (14m 25s):
I think about it in sports a lot too, where a guy like LeBron who came from absolutely nothing and became LeBron. He's got a son now who First of all being LeBron's son can't be easy. Right. You're it's gotta be hard. Lot of pressure. Lot of pressure. And he's a good player. It looks like he's gonna make the NBA, but like, you're not gonna be LeBron. Also, it's like, okay, you have every advantage. You grew up in an incredible home. You have trainers around the clock versus a guy who's like hungry as hell. Yeah. I mean, it's an interesting study. If you had two guys with those talents and it's like, almost like a fucking trading places type thing. Maybe I'm thinking like you put 'em. Okay. Which is better.

3 (15m 1s):
The hungry guy. I agree. Hungry guy with good genetics wins every time. Yeah. Because

4 (15m 7s):
He needs it.

3 (15m 8s):
Yeah. It's a different mindset. So it's gotta be very difficult to engage in something like combat sports or pro football. I'm not saying it's not possible, but it's gotta be very difficult to do that if you come from a really comfortable environment. Yeah. You know, because you're just not gonna have that certain level of anger necessary to get the job done.

4 (15m 30s):
And then in a combat sport, as you said, you need to shut that anger off at some point. And that's got same with football. It's a, that's a violent game, man. Yeah. Watching the Super Bowl, how many people on the 49 ERs I was like, this is like fucking war. Yeah. The people were just carried off on stretchers. I, it felt like I was watching Mash, you know, I was like, yeah, it was rough.

3 (15m 48s):
You just, you don't see a lot of rich people's sons going into that line of work.

4 (15m 52s):
Well, bill Lamb beer on the Bad Boy Pistons came from privilege, but then Isaiah Thomas, he's their general and he came from the worst fucking part of Chicago.

3 (16m 1s):
Yeah.

4 (16m 2s):
But that's kind of an interesting blend, you know?

3 (16m 4s):
Yeah. Kind of is I mean? I could see how they could compete in some sports, but in combat sports, like the, the people that come from nothing have like an extra gear. They just have an extra gear.

4 (16m 17s):
What about a guy like Kimbo Slice though, who's like really from nothing.

3 (16m 24s):
Well also just talented boxer. Yeah. Kimbo Slice was a very, he had very good hands. Yeah. Like if you watch those videos of him out in the, the back parking areas where they would, they would fight on like parking lots and backyards and like dodging satellite dishes and shit. You ever see those videos?

4 (16m 40s):
I've seen some of his stuff. He's terrifying.

3 (16m 42s):
He's a good boxer. And he was boxing people that were not good boxers. Right. They, they just, they just did not know how, you know, they were tough guys but they weren't at his level. And he would just have these bare knuckle backyard fights. Yeah. And the nicest fucking guy too. Yeah. That's the thing about Kimbo rest in peace. He was the nicest guy. Like super sweet guy. Like very friendly to everybody. Took pictures of everybody. He's like, not like a thug. Yeah. Just really tough guy. And so tough that he even entered into the Ultimate Fighter. Like he really didn't have a backyard. I mean he really didn't have a, a background rather in grappling. It wasn't really a grappler.

4 (17m 22s):
And now you kind of need that. Right. I mean

3 (17m 23s):
Gotta learn I mean had to. Yeah. Yeah. He got beat up by big country. Roy Nelson just took him down and got on top of him, just kept punching him in the head. He couldn't do anything about it. He put him in a crucifix and just didn't know how to grapple. Damn. Which is like so unfair. Like to just, if bare knuckle boxing was around like it is now and Kimbo was around, Kimbo would've been one of the best at bare knuckle boxing. He, he would've been that because that was like really where his skillset is was with his hands and his toughness really wasn't a kicker. He really wasn't a, a grappler. He had to learn all that stuff that didn't come natural to him.

4 (17m 58s):
I mean, it's really like just being around at the right time. If you're just a boxer versus now it's, it's like being a silent film star. And then now they're talking right now, now they're kicking, they're doing everything now They're grappling,

3 (18m 9s):
Now Adapt, now they're doing have to adapt. Everything. Adapt. But those fights that he was having weren't like, they were just back backyard fights. They weren't organized in a sense of there, there was no like, you know, athletic commission involved or anything like that. So once he started fighting, like he wanted to fight in like the UFC, he fought for a while in Elite XC and he fought some, some good fighters over there and then came over to the UFC and did the Ultimate Fighter. Just like a very ballsy thing to do. Yeah. You know, to try to learn grappling and you know, and fight in front of the world. Yeah. Because really it did not have that much grappling. And that's such a giant disadvantage amongst like those giant dudes in his division.

3 (18m 53s):
There were guys are so big, these guys are just taking each other down and beating the shit outta you. Well it

4 (18m 59s):
Was like that guy who boxed against Jake Paul, one of the first guys who was a wrestler. The guy who, who's a really good wrestler.

3 (19m 6s):
Ben Asin. Yeah. Yeah.

4 (19m 7s):
I mean it's just a different thing.

3 (19m 9s):
Well, yeah, Ben, I think Ben just took a payday. Yeah. Just, I think he just gave it a sh gave it a go for the money. Yeah. You know, let's see. He's not, he's an amazing wrestler, but he's not really known for being a striker.

4 (19m 21s):
That must be so fucking annoying to be amazing at one thing. And then you have to Yeah. Do another thing that you suck at.

3 (19m 27s):
It's a, well some guys pick it up really quick. There's some athletes, for whatever reason, they're just really good at learning new skills. Like really good at learning how to kick, really good at learning how to punch. They, some wrestlers like Bo Nickel picked it up really quick. Like in a couple of years he looked really good on his feet, like dangerous. But then there's some that for whatever reason, like maybe their style of grappling was more controlled base and less dynamic and not as explosive and like changing from move to move. Because some guys just have like a slow pressure wrestling game and those guys just can never get the punches flowing.

3 (20m 6s):
Everything's just all bunched up. You know, they're just so used to like grabbing and squeezing things that the idea of being like loose and punching it doesn't make sense to them. Yeah. It doesn't work with their

4 (20m 18s):
Body. You used to retrain your body. Yeah. Yeah. It's so weird when I see a guy lunging. I'm like, oh. It's like when you see a baseball player like reaching and you're like, that's not how you, not that I know how to fucking throw a punch, but you know,

3 (20m 28s):
It's a dangerous game to not be good at. It's the most dangerous game to not be good at. Yeah. If you wanna learn how to do it, you gotta really, before you start competing, you better really know how to do everything. At this stage of the game. There's just too many people that can shut down one aspect of your game. You know, if you don't have a ground game, they're gonna figure you out and they're gonna take you down. They're strung of you. Yeah. And if you don't have a standup game, they're gonna keep it in the feet and beat the shit outta you. They're gonna figure it out. Like you can't have any holes in your game at all. Yeah. It's, you gotta be like Mighty Mouse. Yeah.

4 (21m 1s):
You can't be one dimensional. Yeah.

3 (21m 2s):
You gotta be able to do

4 (21m 3s):
Everything. It's like comedy now. You gotta do everything. Yeah. You can't, you can't just do standup. You can't just podcast. You can't, you know, just try to do movies. You really have to do other shit.

3 (21m 12s):
You probably should just, so You don't want, you don't wanna be confined to one thing that you do if you have options. Yeah. It's just more fun to do different stuff. It's more fun to do extra stuff. It's

4 (21m 23s):
Good to challenge yourself too. Yeah.

3 (21m 25s):
It's just fun. It just makes it more interesting to do different things.

4 (21m 29s):
I mean, it's like walking a different route home every day. Okay, I've walked this way home. Let's see what this route does for me. You know, it's, it's just better for your brain. I think

3 (21m 39s):
It's definitely better for your brain. I think it's just as a comic, like you could just get too locked into just doing standup all the time, you know? Yeah. That could kind of, kind of fuck your head

4 (21m 49s):
Up. I'm realizing I do it too much and I'm like, in terms of the road and it, it burns you out. You run outta shit to talk about. Yeah. Because it's been, you know, you work so hard to get to a place where you're always working and then you get there and you're like, oh, I gotta live a life. Yeah. I have to have shit to talk about.

3 (22m 4s):
Otherwise you start faking it.

4 (22m 6s):
Yeah. You start,

3 (22m 8s):
You start faking what you're interested in. You start pretending, you start talking about like things you think they'll be interested in. Yeah. Because you don't know what the fuck is going on in the world anymore. You've just been doing hotel to hotel club to club.

4 (22m 21s):
Yeah.

3 (22m 22s):
Kind of losing your mind.

4 (22m 23s):
I ran into Chris Rock on the street once and I told him I was like, I finally took like my first vacation ever. And he goes, oh man, good for you. He's like, gotta take a vacation. Even LeBron has an off season wise words. Very,

3 (22m 35s):
Very wise words.

4 (22m 36s):
I mean smart. You burn yourself out. Anyone at, when you reach that level of a guy like Chris Rock, they just know what it takes. You know? It's like, yeah. You don't burn yourself out. I mean he's got different, he's got a different, he's like, I'll do a movie in this time to not burn out. He's got, you know, a different Right. A different career. But you know, he's got wisdom.

3 (22m 57s):
Yeah. And that's also another very cool thing that you could still do something creatively that's different than that. You can direct something if you wanted to.

4 (23m 5s):
I want to do other stuff. I standup's always number one and I think, thank God for standup. 'cause sometimes I try to make, I'm trying to make a show now and the amount of fucking emails back and forth, the amount of like meetings, this, that so much work there. And I'm like, man, if this was all I had, I'd fucking put a bullet in my head. Honestly. I really would. Because the amount of people, they're like, oh, they're on va. There's a, a Jewish holiday. I'm like, I'm Jewish. I've never heard of that holiday. That's not a holiday. I know what the hell you're talking about. You know? And then like, then we got MLK day then, then Val, you shut down for Valentine's Day. Oh my God. There's always something that's

3 (23m 37s):
Hilarious. So,

4 (23m 38s):
You know, thank God for standup. It's like, it's always there.

3 (23m 42s):
Yeah. Just like to to what a what a fucking weird time it is today. What a and what a weird time it is to tell jokes.

4 (23m 56s):
It just in in in the culture right now. Yeah.

3 (23m 59s):
It's just such a, it's just, just just strange fucking time. You know? It's a, it's a strange time to be doing standup.

4 (24m 7s):
It's always a strange time to be I mean. I think during the Crusades it was weird to be funny. I think it's always a weird time. It was probably so dangerous. I think it's always a bad time to be, you know? But man, is it people really need it right now. It's great. I love it. Like I, I love that Cities will surprise you. That's my favorite thing. Like, I never go in, look, I've gone in judging a city 'cause I've had a bad time there and I'm like, let's give it another shot. But I never pre-judge. Like, and then you find like little golden nuggets. Like I was at the Omaha Funny Bone a couple weeks ago. I fucking love that club.

3 (24m 38s):
There's a lot of great clubs in this country,

4 (24m 40s):
So many great clubs and, and the repetition is necessary. That's the fucking beauty of this still is like, I think I've cracked a story and then I'm like, oh, that wasn't the ending. You just find it out on stage sometimes, you know? So,

3 (24m 53s):
And you tighten things up. Sometimes you just like take a chunk out and they're like, oh, this is way better this way. You know?

4 (24m 58s):
Yeah. Sometimes your ego keeps a chunk in and you're like, this is for me. And you realize like, that's also, we're the only type of entertainment where like the crowd is really part of the editing process. Scorsese's not, you know, workshopping his shit in Omaha. You know, like we're taking our shit all over the country to make sure this works. Yeah,

3 (25m 16s):
Exactly. It's really interesting that way. Like, music is not made that way. No. It's really the only art form that's made that way. And you know, it's really interesting that so many people love it, but there's no real formal study of it by anybody that knows how to do it. But it's

4 (25m 32s):
Getting there kind

3 (25m 33s):
Of, I think there's

4 (25m 34s):
All the studies are so boring. If you read like Simon Critchley, I think it's on humor. You're like, I'm so bored. Hear talk about humor. You're like, yeah dude. It's about tension release. No shit. Yeah. It's fucking boring. When you read, when you read people dissecting comedy, like it can get boring.

3 (25m 49s):
It's not just about tension release though.

4 (25m 51s):
Oh, it's so much more. There's

3 (25m 52s):
A thing going on when someone's killing and I liken it to a mass hypnosis. Yeah. You know, like if someone, like if Joey Diaz is on stage and he's crushing, like you're under a spell. Right. You're under a spell. You're, you're in his mind

4 (26m 7s):
A rhythm too. It's like you're lulled and Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's the cool thing about comics is guys like Nate Zi or something like that where the jokes like he has a rhythm that's so unique. You're like, oh, I'm just like, I'm just under his, under his spell as he said. Yes. Yeah. It's cool.

3 (26m 21s):
It's kind of like a hypnosis. It really is. Yeah. You know, and then we're just trying to piece it together in the most like, digestible way possible. The, the way that has the best impact. Make sure you scour all the corners. Make sure you cover all the angles. Clear the room.

4 (26m 39s):
Yeah. It's great, man. It's fun. It's a great time. It's fun. And it's a fun thing. The road is people really fucking, like we are in a boom. I mean you started this. Yeah. It wasn't like this right

3 (26m 51s):
When I started Yeah. Standup. No, no. Nothing like this. No, no. This is the craziest comedy boom ever. Because of YouTube. Because of YouTube for podcasts. YouTube for comedy specials and then for Netflix. Yeah. Netflix. It made it a boom too. There's like so many people that can travel now. It used to be like, there wasn't that many people that did theaters. Yeah. You know, when I was coming up theater, nobody did theaters. I, I saw Rich Jenny when he was at his prime when he was on hb. I saw him in a comedy club.

4 (27m 22s):
Damn. At, at his prime. He was a funny

3 (27m 24s):
Dude. Oh my God. He was amazing, dude. He was amazing.

4 (27m 26s):
Underappreciated,

3 (27m 27s):
Super underappreciated. I I sing his praises all the time. I was coming home once from the Irvine Improv and my Bluetooth just randomly went to Richard Jen Bit. Just, you know, like random, you know, sometime I would go to a song. It just went to Richard Jen. 'cause it was on my iTunes thing. And I went, God damn, I forgot how good this was. It was this bit about how he's a fence sitter. It was this bit about like, shitting on all of the liberals and then shitting on all the Republicans and then shitting on himself. It's just, I'm like, God damn. He was good. And so then I listened. I ordered the whole album on iTunes and I listened to the whole thing on the way home.

4 (28m 3s):
It's so

3 (28m 3s):
Cool. It's, it's an incredible album.

4 (28m 4s):
I love, by the way, I love when it's on Shuffle and you hear like, it goes from like a Tom wait song to like Nick DePalo and you're like, that was fucking, that was a big right turn right there. Holy shit.

3 (28m 13s):
I think it's a steaming pile of me. I think that's the one that I downloaded.

4 (28m 17s):
That's one that

3 (28m 18s):
Fuck. And he was

4 (28m 18s):
Good, man. He was excellent. And I think it's important to make fun of both sides. And that's, IIII, it makes me sad to see people get mad at John Stewart right now for, for shit on both sides. I think it's, he's a comedian first and I think it's cool to, when you go to the clubs, they don't know exactly what you're gonna say.

3 (28m 38s):
Yeah. If you're gonna have John Stewart back on the Daily Show and Bidet is making up words, he's gonna bring it up. He's not, he's not gonna just only fucking simp for the Democrats. He's gonna say some funny shit about anything that happens to Democrats too. It's funny. It's part of what the show used to be.

4 (28m 57s):
It's weird that there's a respon there's like a social responsibility people attribute to comedians when it's like, most of us got good at this by cursing at strangers in a bar.

3 (29m 5s):
Yeah. I mean we all have our political opinions, which is fine, but it's like what John's capable of is delivering the news in a very funny way. He's the best at it. He's the best at that role of being like the guy that's doing the satire of the news. You know, just breaking down everything that's wrong and fucking stupid in the world. He,

4 (29m 27s):
He is the peak. And it's interesting 'cause he's like the animal house. He's like National Lampoon's Animal House of, he's like the bar and then a lot, then everyone tries to copy Animal House. Right, right. And you end up with a lot of, like for Keys, van Wilder too. The rise of Taj. You're like, all right, this isn't as good. But Stewart like, if you actually look at his, his standup, like, it's like any form of entertainment to break these rules. You have to know the rules. And Stewart is a great standup. Yeah.

3 (29m 55s):
He's a very funny guy.

4 (29m 56s):
He had jokes. I remember, I remember he had a joke back in the day. It was about like how Jews and black people are similar. 'cause you know, Jews, you know, black people. We have the Blues and Jews, we just complain all the time. We just never thought to put it to music. And I'm like, that's, that's the type of observation that's like, that's like unifying, that's like bringing a room together. Yes. I love that.

3 (30m 15s):
That's a very funny bit too. Yeah,

4 (30m 17s):
He had, he had a, a great special in the nineties called Unle. I remember it. It was on Comedy Central all the time.

3 (30m 24s):
Yeah. So he's back like on the Daily Show sometimes. Is that what it is? Mondays. Mondays.

4 (30m 29s):
He was like, I'll give you one day. That's

3 (30m 30s):
A good move for him. Yeah. Yeah. Why? Why do it? I guess he had a deal with Apple and I don't know if they're saying the specifics of why they canceled the show, but it was something akin to, they didn't want him to say anything that would get them in trouble. Something along those lines. I don, I forget

4 (30m 51s):
What his quote was. I don maybe about China. And they're like, Hey, we make a lot of shit over there. Here it

3 (30m 55s):
Is. Yeah, here it is. Apple. John Stewart says Apple TV canceled his show because they didn't want me to say things that might get me in trouble.

4 (31m 6s):
Okay. Damn

3 (31m 10s):
Boy. Kids. What kind of a world are we talking Apple?

4 (31m 12s):
And by the way, that's like, that's like what comics, that's what gets us excited. The idea that this could get me in trouble like that. That's everything.

3 (31m 21s):
Also, apple, by the way, you distribute all the apps that do all the trouble that,

4 (31m 28s):
And you take a a percentage,

3 (31m 29s):
Everybody in trouble.

4 (31m 31s):
You take a percentage of their profits

3 (31m 32s):
All over the place. You don't want John Stewart to say something that might get him in trouble. Why don't you let him decide for himself?

4 (31m 38s):
What's great about John Stewart too is like, there's so many comics who are like, and I have no issue with this, but speak like recklessly. And John is so careful with his words and so skilled at it.

3 (31m 50s):
Yeah. I wanted a place to unload thoughts as we get into this ele election season. Stewart said, I thought I was going to do it over at, they call Apple TV plus it's a television, television enclave. Very small. It's like living in Malibu. But they decided, they felt that they didn't want me to say things that might get me in trouble. Okay. I don't know what that means. Yeah. You know, that could mean a lot of things.

4 (32m 15s):
Very coded. I think it's talking about, you know, I think China maybe.

3 (32m 20s):
Yeah, I think there was a China stuff like that. There was something about that, that Apple did. Like Apple obviously works with China. That's what the report, what was the subject article says? It says China. Maybe it's

4 (32m 29s):
Something AI in China.

3 (32m 31s):
Okay. Times reported that the duo had disagreements over topics that were to be covered in the third season, including AI and China. Wow. They had a disagreement about AI and China. These people, what are they doing? Members of the US House of Rep representatives later. Questions. Apple, CEO, Tim Cook about whether the tech giants decision to cancel Stewart's show is because the host may have been planning an upcoming episode about China. He says, while companies have the right to determine what content is appropriate for their streaming service, the coercive tactics of a foreign power should not be directly or indirectly influencing those determinations. The leaders of the House representative select committee on competition with the Chinese Communist Party wrote in a letter to Cook.

3 (33m 18s):
Holy shit. While Stewart did not mention the rumors about Apple, Apple's alleged worry over an episode about China. He did say the tech giant did want me to say things that might did not want, didn't want me to get, say things that might get me in trouble. Asford his daily show return. He said he hopes to provide a catharsis to viewers this election season. And a way to comment on things and a way to express them that hopefully people will enjoy.

5 (33m 46s):
Huh. Wow. So far.

3 (33m 48s):
That sounds like China said, don't fucking put that shit on. Yeah, that's what I got outta, what did you get outta that sound?

4 (33m 54s):
Yeah, exactly. I mean, it's like, it's like that Seth Rogan movie. Yeah. About Tator North career. Yeah.

3 (33m 60s):
Is that one that's still available? Can you get

4 (34m 1s):
That? I think so, bro. Remember when there was like tension? Like, are we gonna get nuked over a Seth Rogan movie?

3 (34m 7s):
I remember watching that going like, do you know how dangerous those people are? Do you know you want North Koreans mad at you for he hes and Hahas.

4 (34m 16s):
Yeah.

3 (34m 16s):
Really?

4 (34m 17s):
Yeah. Oof.

5 (34m 19s):
And then they hacked the servers, right? Isn't that how that

3 (34m 21s):
Happened? Is that what happened?

4 (34m 22s):
They hacked the servers. Was that Sony? Right? Yeah.

5 (34m 25s):
And then a bunch of shit got found out. Yeah. And emails. And

4 (34m 28s):
Was that definitely them? Was that That's

5 (34m 30s):
What I was trying to remember. I

3 (34m 31s):
I thought so. Maybe cyber, but it could criminals.

4 (34m 34s):
I think it was, yeah. I don coincidence. I don't, it might've been a coincidence. and

3 (34m 37s):
It could be cyber criminals that decided to attack based on that. Oh,

5 (34m 41s):
No, no, no. According to the Wiki, it says,

3 (34m 44s):
Can I just dream

4 (34m 45s):
Of Boy Dream?

5 (34m 46s):
It was then ance of the piece, A cyber crime group allegedly connected North Korean government.

3 (34m 51s):
Okay. It is con connected, huh? Yeah. Guardians of Peace. What a great name. That sounds like a, like a government bill.

4 (34m 58s):
It is.

3 (34m 59s):
Guardians of Peace. Sounds like a new bill. They would push for the house.

4 (35m 4s):
Man. Some of the Senate, remember when the Senate did, they did a hearing on, it was like during Katrina, I think they did like one day on Katrina and nine days on steroids in baseball because they just wanted like, 'cause you just wanna meet Raphael Palmero remember? They're like, oh, we're big fans.

3 (35m 20s):
Oh my God. That's

4 (35m 21s):
Hilarious. I mean the the shit that they get concerned with is so crazy.

3 (35m 25s):
Yeah. But you don't want to go full communist. Right? You don't wanna say like, the news shouldn't be able to make money. You know, they should be able to make money. They

4 (35m 33s):
Should be able to make money. But the second you combine news and entertainment Yeah, it gets real. It's a dangerous mucky area.

3 (35m 38s):
Squirrely. It gets real squirrely

4 (35m 40s):
Because entertainment is is not news at all. It's not at all. The news is supposed to be boring.

3 (35m 45s):
Boring as shit.

4 (35m 46s):
You're supposed to be like, why am I, why? Yeah. And now we have it in a way where like you watch 12 straight out of the news. That's a fucking problem.

3 (35m 51s):
Well, what's my favorite is the in-between story banter. That is the most uncomfortable hurried kind of weird fake talk that exists in all of television. It doesn't exist anywhere else on earth right now in mainstream entertainment. And the, the banter between the anchor and like the Weather lady as they're throwing back and forth to each other. Then this guy, oh dude, it is the fakest. Well that seems like don don't know what to say about that.

4 (36m 23s):
I still do morning news just to ruin the segments. That's the only reason I go on. Yeah, I I do it all the time. You did a good one in

8 (36m 29s):
Columbus. Do you see that one? Yeah, it's in front.

4 (36m 31s):
I definitely saw that was that was What'd you do? I I can send it to you. It's pretty funny. I I'll find it. Yeah. It's, I I think I have it here. It's, it's, it's probably on my Instagram or something. It's, I just kept making up that they had a human trafficking problem in Columbus and the guy lost it on me. 'cause I, I'll only do those new segments if they're live. 'cause there's no point in doing a tape one. They'll just edit out whatever horrible thing I do. But, you know, sometimes you get someone really cool and you'll just riff with them and be silly. But this dude, I could tell I'll like, I'll throw like a jab to see if it bothers them. And if I can sense it bothers them, I'll go like a hundred miles an hour and just derail the segment I got. I got, I remember I have a pub, I have a publicist, Pam, who hates me.

4 (37m 11s):
She, I just am like, don don't care about morning radio. Just book me on morning shows because, and she's like, they're on to you. They know you're gonna ruin the segment. But Pam, she gets so mad at me. But I But

3 (37m 21s):
Do you ever go on one and the people are cool and you don't ruin the segment? Yeah,

4 (37m 24s):
Totally. But they usually end up, sometimes they think it's funny, but other times, yeah. I did one, we were on a tour bus last year and I pretended my opener. Gary Feeder overdosed on cocaine on the bus. Oh. And they were so mad at me. God. And, and she called me like, you're banned from Good Morning Durham. And I was like, I'll

8 (37m 42s):
Live. But, but

4 (37m 46s):
We've done a lot where I just, I, I I poke and I, see what I can get away with.

3 (37m 51s):
How many people are watching those shows?

4 (37m 53s):
Not a lot, but when I share them they do pretty well. 'cause they're, it's, they're weird to watch me do something bad.

3 (38m 0s):
Yeah.

4 (38m 1s):
I can text it to you. I think I have it on my phone somewhere. I'm trying

3 (38m 4s):
To find it. I have no people under 60 are watching that. Right. Am I correct?

4 (38m 10s):
Probably not. I mean sometimes when I'm in a hotel, I have it on the background just for like background noise when I'm bored on the road. Right. But like, yeah. I don't something the new, it's, it's almost like I wanna watch the news, but don don't want to think. Yeah. Which, you know, it's, I'm not, I'm not gonna watch like BBC. I'm gonna watch Pittsburgh today. Live

3 (38m 29s):
Local men eaten by alligator.

4 (38m 34s):
That was the first one. One Pittsburgh actually, I, I pretended I was molested on air and 'cause she just kept asking the dumbest questions and she goes, when did you catch the funny bug? and I said, well, my uncle molested me and whoa. And he was funny. and I caught it like, Spider-Man. And they just stared at me like, oh, he is a, yeah, that's it. No, that's, that's Springfield. That's I know. I'm all, that's a guy just did

9 (38m 57s):
This joke on Instagram less than 24 hours ago. Talk about what people can expect I mean. Have you been to Columbus before or is this the first time for you?

4 (39m 5s):
No, I've been, I've been, I love Columbus. Great city. Big fan of, despite all the human trafficking going on there, I still find a lot of fun. A great city nonetheless.

10 (39m 17s):
You've got your class

4 (39m 18s):
Before I can tell he doesn't want it. So this is where I poke

10 (39m 21s):
This Friday, October 27th. Tell us what we, what we can expect with that. I'm

4 (39m 25s):
Gonna talk about the trafficking epidemic in Columbus, Ohio.

10 (39m 28s):
What is going on with the human? What are you talking about? Are you a big sports fan? What's going on with that?

4 (39m 36s):
I'll tell you what I'm not a fan of is human traffic.

10 (39m 39s):
We don't know where you're going with that.

9 (39m 40s):
There are a lot of news reports. Yes. All right. Well listen, Sam, enjoy your, this

4 (39m 44s):
Is the best park 'cause he snaps here. And

10 (39m 47s):
We'll look forward to seeing you. Thanks Sam. Sam. Thank

4 (39m 49s):
You guys. Thanks for having me. Alright,

10 (39m 51s):
Have a good one. I don't get, I don't know, I think he, you know, I know he is kind of edgy and funny. I didn't get the human trafficking thing 'cause it really wasn't funny the first time. And then he kept doing it two and three and four times. and I tried to ask him. You saw him try to ask, is this a joke? Are you trying to be funny? What are you trying to do? and it just, wait, I was just trying to explain the audience though. Just saw the same thing too. Okay, we'll go to break.

4 (40m 14s):
Good morning. Yeah, that was it. He really lost it. That's the only way they're worth doing to me though, is if it's like insanely uncomfortable and

3 (40m 22s):
It makes you think like, even just the, the way you do one of those shows, like those people aren't real friends. You know, like you, you're trying to make it fake. Some

4 (40m 32s):
Of them are good,

3 (40m 33s):
Some of 'em are good

4 (40m 33s):
Together. Well, good Morning America. Those two that were fucking, they were real friends. Yeah. They were great. And they were great at their job. That's why they were good there. They shouldn't have been fired. Why were

3 (40m 40s):
They fired

4 (40m 41s):
For Fucking they, well, here's what happened. She just fucked him. He was fucking everybody there. So I think they were like, well if we fire him, oh, I mean. Yeah, we got

3 (40m 50s):
Well,

4 (40m 51s):
But they were good. I did their show once and I didn't. I was just, it was just a regular interview. 'cause they were fun. Well, they

3 (40m 56s):
Should do a podcast together. They, they do think they are a podcast. They're There you go. Yeah. Yeah. You don't want Boss. No. Especially in those kind of environments. It's just too restrictive. and it makes me think if you like look at that guy, like no offense to that guy that you were just talking to, but it, I couldn't imagine some sort of an audition process that yielded such results.

4 (41m 15s):
Yeah.

3 (41m 16s):
Like, this is the best you guys have to fucking,

4 (41m 18s):
It's a big city. Columbus tell the

3 (41m 20s):
News.

4 (41m 21s):
Big city with a lot of human trafficking.

3 (41m 23s):
It's Yeah. She almost backed you up on that.

10 (41m 26s):
Hope

4 (41m 26s):
You heard that. Yeah, she did. She's like,

3 (41m 27s):
There's a lot of reports and a lot of

4 (41m 29s):
Reports. I just think it's a funny rumor to make up to be like, you have a human trafficking problem. And, and I had no research to back that up. But it's, it clearly if you're, you have Columbus pride, it bothers you. There are stories.

3 (41m 40s):
There are stories. There's also, you're doing it on Zoom, which is extra frustrating. Yeah. Because like, you're not even in the room, so they can't even go, what the fuck are you doing? Like, you know, you're so disconnected. They have to be very obvious when they're talking to you.

4 (41m 54s):
But I've done it where I was bad and it wasn't live and they just edit it out. I'm like, God damnit, you know, gotta get the live ones. But it's hard to ask for live because they know you're gonna do something. So you see my predicament. I'm like, I want live. And they're like, what's he gonna do?

3 (42m 7s):
Well, I think the gig is up.

4 (42m 8s):
We'll see, I got, I got one and I got one coming up. We'll see if they unbook me,

3 (42m 13s):
They're not gonna, maybe they'll be prepared and they just let you fuck with it. They

4 (42m 16s):
Were smart. Done. They done that before. And they were, you know, I did one prerecorded for New York one when I was promoting MSG Theater. I, I did that one and they, they were mad. I didn't do it, but it was, I think it was prerecorded and they were like, yeah. He just, they told my friend, they were like, yeah, he just behaved. It was really a bummer.

3 (42m 33s):
And

4 (42m 33s):
I was like, well now I gotta be

3 (42m 34s):
Bad. I guess because you knew it was prerecorded so you're like, ah

4 (42m 37s):
Yeah, what's the point? Why? I was just kind of outta energy. I was like, ah, what's the point?

3 (42m 40s):
Deflated. Yeah. They're playing dirty Prerecorded with you is playing dirty. It

4 (42m 46s):
Is. Yeah. I'm playing dirty too though. But

3 (42m 48s):
You are. But that's the game we play. That's the game we play. It's just fun. You wanna do a morning show? Yeah. When Ur used to do DJ Dad mouth. Yes.

4 (42m 57s):
TJ Miller was another one who would do crazy shit on there. And I was like, I love that.

3 (43m 1s):
Seur was the king of it. Yeah. He came out as non-binary on a morning show. Just fucking total deadpan with a gold chain on. And sunglasses.

4 (43m 15s):
His energy's perfect for

3 (43m 16s):
It too. Oh. Oh. It's

4 (43m 18s):
So, he's got that calming energy too. And

3 (43m 20s):
Just the name DJ dad mouth, like, what the fuck? Oh my God. That's so funny. That's so fucking stupid. Yeah,

4 (43m 30s):
It's fun. but it, you're right, you kind of killed a lot of those types of shows with your show because it's like, would you rather see them on, you know, good morning, whatever for four minutes or on your show for three hours, they'd rather see this.

3 (43m 47s):
Yeah. But it's also, it's just those, that format sucks.

4 (43m 51s):
It's a bad format. It sucks. I still like the idea of a live interview. I still think that's really fun. Like the crowd

3 (43m 56s):
Live interviews are fun.

4 (43m 57s):
I, you know, but yeah, I mean this, you doing three hours is like, you know, it's, it would change that. I think

3 (44m 7s):
I was just lazy. I didn't want to edit anything. Ari, Ari used to tell me, he goes, you, you gotta edit your show. That was his number one complaint. Tell you, listen to me, you gotta edit your show. And I was like, why? Like no one's gonna listen to all that. Then they don't have to listen. Yeah. I was like, then don't listen. Just, I don't care if you stop halfway in. Like listen to as much as you want.

4 (44m 26s):
Well you went against what a lot of people say is about the entertainment world. Like keep 'em wanting more. You're just like, nope, this is the show.

3 (44m 34s):
You know, it's also this idea that everybody has a short attention span. That's just not true. That's horse shit. Yeah. People, even people with short attention spans get into things like the, there might be some subject that someone's talking about that lights your interest, lights your Curiosity and then you get locked into it. Yeah. Where you would never spend three hours ordinarily listening to some guy talk about Egypt, some, you know, you know Graham Hancock type character talking about the people that constructed these things and Turkey and shit. Like you would never do that, right? Yeah. In the normal world. But you could get locked into some a conversation and if it's a three hour conversation, like you come out of that much more energized with whatever that subject is.

3 (45m 25s):
It's

4 (45m 25s):
Not only is that true, but also I think the fact that people can listen to stuff while they're like cleaning the house and stuff. A hundred percent. Yeah. I mean you can't do that with a movie. Right.

3 (45m 32s):
The thing is that the number one attractor is always going to be like the TikTok and the Instagram. Instagram reels. Those are the ones that they suck you in. They suck you in. They work with the human mind.

4 (45m 43s):
It drives me crazy. Do you get addicted to it?

3 (45m 45s):
They're so effective. I

4 (45m 47s):
Mean Instagram

3 (45m 48s):
Reels are so

4 (45m 48s):
Effective ones for me fucking ruin my day. Oh, those are good. It's just some fucking asshole in his car. Yeah. Eating like a sandwich. I'm just watching a dude eat a sandwich. Yeah. You break it down and you're like, this is so sad. Sexy. Then I'm watching It is sexy. Sexy. And he rates the sandwich and I'm like, good enough for me. And then they send me 40 more. Everyone's a food critic now. That's

3 (46m 5s):
Fine. Yeah, it's fine. I mean People will find their way.

4 (46m 9s):
They find their way. Yeah.

3 (46m 10s):
But it's just the addictive

4 (46m 13s):
Nature. I'm more mad at myself, honestly. I'm more mad that that's my, my the food thing. My full algorithm page. Yeah. I'm more, it's, it's mostly food. Well,

3 (46m 21s):
Don don't think you have to worry.

4 (46m 22s):
Slicing a tomahawk steak, someone eating a sandwich. Good. Those

3 (46m 25s):
Are good

4 (46m 26s):
Things. I love 'em. Yeah. Those are good things. I find a lot, Gary Veder tours with me and he just sends me food whenever on the road. He is like, we're eating here. I'm like, what a, he's more high maintenance than any woman I've ever dated. He's like, you're taking me here. It's five stars. You better fucking pay up bitch. Ah,

3 (46m 39s):
That's hilarious. That is a nice thing. If you go to good cities, right? You could always eat nice restaurants on the

4 (46m 44s):
Road. Every city's got a nice restaurant now there. Sure. I mean people

3 (46m 47s):
Once you don't fuck around in the Netherlands and between Res, if you don't go, you know, too far.

4 (46m 55s):
It's weird though. What, what cities now, like every city has this crazy food culture now that Yep. No matter where you are.

3 (47m 3s):
I think the internet is partly to blame for that too. I think there's so many YouTube sort of like mini documentaries on chefs and mini documentaries on restaurants that they're opening. And these,

4 (47m 13s):
There's 9,000 episodes of Chopped. Think about how many chefs there are. It's a lot of chefs. What, four four chefs per episode? Well,

3 (47m 20s):
That you gotta give credit to tv. Right. Like the travel channel and stuff like that, because those are the first people that like put cooking out there. Like an art form. Like with Bourdain show. Yeah. That's the first time I ever considered cooking. I was like, oh, it's an art form. You just eat it. It's like, I thought of it as just cooking as like, like carpentry or something like that. You know what I

4 (47m 41s):
Mean and I related to it as a comic. Just a guy like wandering and being like, oh, let me make the most of Kalamazoo, Michigan. Yeah. Like, I, instead of eating this vending machine, let me try to find a cool diner or something. Right,

3 (47m 52s):
Right, right. So those are some of the most satisfying places. You find like a cool old place that's been around forever. You get like steak and eggs there.

4 (47m 59s):
Nothing gets my dick hard like a box card diner, dude. I, I get so excited. We went, found one in Buffalo and we ate the, we find a good spot. We eat there three days in a row. I'll, I'm obsessed with like, just a, a cool diner. Yeah.

3 (48m 12s):
There was a place called the Star Diner that I used to eat in, in God, I think it was in Mount Vernon, New York. It was so sketchy, this neighborhood. It was so sketchy. But they had cheeseburger, deluxes, and the cheeseburger Deluxe had like cole slaw on it. Ooh. Yeah. It was ridiculous.

4 (48m 30s):
Cole slaw is underrated on a sandwich, and you just, a Ruben is an underrated sandwich. It's

3 (48m 34s):
Two 30 in the morning, you're hanging out with men who've just failed miserably and everyone's eating these disgusting cheeseburgers at two o'clock in the morning.

4 (48m 45s):
There's something. So it

3 (48m 46s):
Was such a vibe.

4 (48m 47s):
That's like a late night waffle house. Anytime. Oh, there's

3 (48m 50s):
Something that's a New York vibe too, like those kind of diners.

4 (48m 53s):
There's something, so there's something about like, when you're on the road and you're in a sad place that's like weirdly romantic to me too. Like Gary and I stayed at a residence in, in Omaha, and it was just U-Haul truck after U-Haul truck of just shit in the parking lot. I'm like, it's us and 40 divorce men here. There's something so sad about this.

3 (49m 11s):
Yep.

4 (49m 13s):
But

3 (49m 13s):
Get out.

4 (49m 14s):
Yeah. I love a late night diner. Or what's your diner order when you go?

3 (49m 18s):
Well, it depends on if I'm Drunk. If I'm Drunk I might go off the rails, but most of the time I'm pretty disciplined. Most of the time I'm just eating like whatever healthy options they have, like meat or eggs or something like that. Yeah. You know, most of the time

4 (49m 36s):
Eggs, eggs is I mean, the obvious move. But if like a tuna melt or a diner can be so clutch. Ooh,

3 (49m 41s):
Those are so nice. They're so good. Such a nice invention. How about a tuna patty melt?

4 (49m 45s):
Yeah. Or like a souvlaki. Oh,

3 (49m 48s):
A

4 (49m 48s):
Souvlaki. Love a souvlaki.

3 (49m 49s):
Yeah. Yeah. Fuck a Euro dude. A late night Euro.

4 (49m 53s):
Look at you pronouncing it correctly. Yeah.

3 (49m 55s):
I know a lot of Greek people. If it's,

4 (49m 58s):
I, I don't pronounce it correctly, I know how to pronounce it, but I just forget

3 (50m 1s):
If it's done the right way with the, the best bread.

4 (50m 4s):
Oof. I love it. Yeah. That like toasted pita.

3 (50m 6s):
Oh yeah, bro. Come on with it. Ooh. Ooh. Oh man. If I had to choose though, like one option for late night, if something's open, it's legit. It would be between Mexican and Italian.

4 (50m 21s):
Yeah.

3 (50m 21s):
Yeah. If, you know, if, if someone tells you like there's a place that serves insane lasagna at two in the morning, I like, like, we have to go to

4 (50m 33s):
Pizza All day Go pizza. It's like pizza. Late night pizza's just so it's, so E I mean especially

3 (50m 37s):
Good pizza, real good New York pizza. You get a good slice. Just a, just a regular cheese and tomato sauce slice when it's just perfectly seasoned and it's melting in your mouth, the cheese. You're like, oh my God, this is so good.

4 (50m 53s):
I watched so much of that guy just randomly Port Noy on Barstill doing those reviews. Oh, he's the best. I just like, I say how much I hate watching these food things, but I fucking can't. I just like the, I like how he likes all the same types. I like, like that flop. The, the New Haven Pizza's my favorite pizza.

3 (51m 8s):
It's the best pizza in the world apparently. Yeah. And according to Portnoy, he knows more than I told him. I said, you should get 10% of all the profits for pizza. I I bet if you had like a pizza chart between when Portnoy started doing those reviews to how many people are going and buying pizza now. I bet it's not a small number. Yeah, I bet he is impacted the pizza world significantly. I'm not bullshitting. He makes me wanna buy pizza.

4 (51m 33s):
Yeah, you watch it and you But

3 (51m 34s):
He bites the crust too. His fucking, yeah. I was like, I'm like, oh, he looks like he's having a good time. We

4 (51m 40s):
Did, when I was in Chicago with Mateo Lane, he, we, he did a Chicago theater one night, did the next night. So I just gotten early. We hung out, we made Pizza Lu Malnati's Deep Dish in the, they let us in there to just make pizza. And then I was like, all right, now I don't like Chicago Pizza that much. It's like, it's, it tastes good. It's just not my style pizza. It's like, it's it's not, it's a pie. It's not pizza. Right. So I was like, all right, we'll see if Arturo's in the Village will let, like, that's, this place is Colin Quinn's stamp of approval, which to me, like, he's the most New York guy I've ever met. So if Colin Quinn likes your pizza, you're legit. And we made the Pizza Arturo's on Houston, one of the best pizza spots. Also the vibe. There's a fucking piano player just playing in there.

4 (52m 20s):
It's like, it's so New York, dude.

3 (52m 22s):
Yeah. Those places are fantastic.

4 (52m 25s):
I love 'em. And they make good everything.

3 (52m 27s):
If you could find a good old Italian hole in the wall spot in New York, like that's one of the cool things about like Mulberry Street.

4 (52m 36s):
Yes.

3 (52m 37s):
You know those places. There's some places down there that have been around forever.

4 (52m 42s):
Yeah. You'll just Google it and you'll be like, 1909. What the fuck? What the fuck are you kidding

3 (52m 47s):
Me? Did you ever talk to Fitz Simmons about when he lived there?

4 (52m 50s):
I, not about that, but yeah. I I know Greg. I love Fred

3 (52m 52s):
Fitz Simmons lived right above the social club where John Gotti used to go.

4 (52m 58s):
Holy shit.

3 (52m 59s):
Holy shit.

4 (52m 60s):
How about that John Gotti? Man, that guy Simmons

3 (53m 2s):
Yeah. Used to live. Right. I went to his fucking apartment.

4 (53m 7s):
The guy I mean. He was the reason Sparks is popular.

3 (53m 9s):
Yes.

4 (53m 10s):
Like, that's like, like you feel like cool walking in. You're like, this is where the guy got shot

3 (53m 14s):
Right there. This is what happened right there. It's a good restaurant though, too. Fitzsimmons lived right

4 (53m 18s):
There. That's, that's the amount of danger we all like is just to know someone was shot here and you're like, well, they're not gonna do it again. What, what are the, the odds another guy gets whacked here. Right.

3 (53m 27s):
They don't whack each other that often. What year was, what year Did, did Gotti get arrested?

4 (53m 35s):
He got arrested so many times. Didn't was it

3 (53m 36s):
In the nineties? but it was like, but I'm trying to figure out like when Fitz Simmons was there, was he there while the social club was in Operation I know the whole family that owned the building was all like, go meets the meets. Like, he like had deals. We would give the, the mother some money. Like, you know, my Frankie doesn't have to know about this. This is my gambling money. and it like, she would take that money, like they had like little deals. Like they would pay, he would pay like the different, the mother than the father separately. December, 1990. December, 1990. Okay. So that kind of, that must mean he was already in jail by the time Fitzsimmons lived there. Because I think Greg and I, we came to New York in this around the same time.

3 (54m 20s):
And that was like, Greg might have been there first too. I don't know. He

4 (54m 26s):
Was like, he was like the media darling. It's so weird to be a murderer. And you're like on the cover of the post, like with a pun. You know, just like, this guy's fun. You know, because he kept getting off. Right. How many times did he get off?

3 (54m 37s):
Yeah. The Teflon

4 (54m 39s):
Don Teflon Don. Yeah. Yeah.

3 (54m 43s):
That, that was weird. Times where like, you know who the mob boss is and he's wearing a nice suit and he's walking around in front of everybody. Like,

4 (54m 49s):
It's

3 (54m 50s):
Weird. What the fuck?

4 (54m 51s):
It's really weird to be a mob celebrity. Yeah. And then people take like a, like if he was around now, you'd be like, selfie.

3 (54m 56s):
But you know what it's like, it's like you're in a race, but your car's not quite strong enough to do that. And then the federal government shuts the race down. Yeah. Whereas if you're in Mexico, you can actually do that. You're in Mexico and you're a cartel leader. You are a cartel.

4 (55m 12s):
You're the guy you

3 (55m 13s):
Like, that's legit. No one's putting you in jail. But it's

4 (55m 16s):
Weird to be able to do that million

3 (55m 18s):
In New York. Yeah. Very weird. but it was also a different time. Right. You know, it was

4 (55m 24s):
A different time. We glamorized that shit though. We all do. Like dude. 'cause mob movies are the best movies. I mean, like, you got Godfather Goodfellas, you got so Soprano

3 (55m 31s):
One of the best shows of all time.

4 (55m 33s):
Probably my number one. Honestly. God,

3 (55m 34s):
It's good. God damn. It's good. I rewatched an episode the other day. I'm like, God,

4 (55m 38s):
It's so, it might be one of the funniest shows ever too. That's how good it is. It's fucking great show. There's, there's a line in that show where like, you know, Meadow's being a spoiled brat and they're like, we're gonna ground you. You can't do this. And she, she just runs away and, and Carmela's like, what are they going to, what, what are we doing? We realize that we have no power. It's like such an honest, funny line. Yeah. I mean Tony. Fuck and Delini. We were like robbed of so many more good delini projects. God,

3 (56m 4s):
He was good.

4 (56m 4s):
He's the fucking best.

3 (56m 5s):
He was so good. He became that guy. Yeah. Like he did a lot of different characters in different movies. And he was really good at being a creep, wasn't he in What was that? True romance. True romance. Yes. So

4 (56m 19s):
Scary in that

3 (56m 19s):
Movie. That's right. Holy

4 (56m 20s):
Shit. That movie holds up, by the way. Oh my God. I just want my God. Watch it again recently. It's fucking great. Dennis Hopper, dude. And walking that scene is fucking insane. Oh my God. That's some, that's some classic Tarantino nineties dialogue right there. That some good

3 (56m 33s):
Shit. Oh my God. True romance. This is

4 (56m 37s):
One of the more violent scenes I've ever seen in movie.

11 (56m 41s):
I got this in Las Vegas, Nevada. I can't

3 (56m 48s):
Believe. Yeah, let's not watch it.

4 (56m 49s):
But dude, he's in like, get shorty.

3 (56m 52s):
Yep.

4 (56m 52s):
He's in so many fucking movies.

3 (56m 55s):
But when he became Tony Soprano, he like was that guy.

4 (56m 58s):
Yeah.

3 (56m 59s):
It's like to have a, an actor that good playing a mob boss to the point where you are sympathetic. You're rooting for this murderer.

4 (57m 7s):
Yeah. Yeah.

3 (57m 8s):
You are rooting for Tony

4 (57m 10s):
Soprano. They humanized him. I mean when you show him at like a cookout. Yeah. You're like, I go to cookouts. Yeah. You know, I do. I mean they made him human

3 (57m 18s):
And he was just following the rules of his game. That's the game that he did.

4 (57m 22s):
And he was the

3 (57m 22s):
Best at it didn't, he didn't have high, high enough horsepower. But again, if he was El Chapo, I guess they got him too. But we

4 (57m 30s):
Got him and his and his wife too. Right. Who

3 (57m 32s):
Got who? Like, who took over? Like, that guy doesn't have a name. I don know. That's a good move. If you're gonna be a cartel guy, tell everybody

4 (57m 41s):
Reservation night for the cartel guy. You don't know his name. You

3 (57m 44s):
Wanna be John Doe. Yeah. And you, you want everybody to shut the fuck up. You don't want anybody, you, you're running a cartel, sir. But,

4 (57m 50s):
But they would remind you that he was a monster every once in a while. Like, I mean he kills his fucking own guy. He's he's a monster

3 (57m 56s):
Who killed the wrong guy?

4 (57m 57s):
Tony Kills. Oh

3 (57m 59s):
Yeah. Christopher. Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That

4 (58m 1s):
They'd hit, hit you with reminders. Everyone. I mean the show was so fun. Nice. That they'd have to hit you with like, the brutal reminders of, you know, Phil Leotard. Sodomizing a a gay character. It's like they'd have Oh yeah. They'd have to hit you with that. 'cause you'd be like, oh, this is funny. And then they, you'd hit that. You'd be like, Jesus.

3 (58m 16s):
Yeah. There was a lot of Jesus moments in that show. What's really funny is if you watch the first episode of the show, it was almost like satire. Yeah. Did you ever, you ever

4 (58m 26s):
Watch it? Incredible pilot.

3 (58m 27s):
It was very funny though. It was like, like a comedy. Yeah. Like the, the way the

4 (58m 32s):
Card chase thing, which

3 (58m 33s):
She's got the machine gun and like, 'cause there there's, she was outside the machine with the machine gun. She, I think she thought her kid was sneaking outta the house or

4 (58m 39s):
Something. Was that Carmella? Yeah. Yes. Right. Remember?

3 (58m 42s):
Yeah. Yeah. Something happened and she was outside with an AK 47. You're like, what the fuck are you doing? Yeah. What is this show? Yeah. It just, but she became much more like normal. Yeah. Like she, she wasn't like that. Like, it was almost like they were doing like a network Sitcomy version of mobsters.

4 (58m 59s):
They went, yeah. It was cool to see the show grow. But Dim is like, the first season even goes, it's like him versus his uncle, uncle Junior I mean that was a fucking great storyline. Great

3 (59m 8s):
Storyline. There's so many great storylines. I mean, it's just a fucking phenomenal show, man. Yeah. Phenomenal show.

4 (59m 15s):
David Chase I mean. He, he created, I think he used to write for like Rockford files too. It's like interesting career.

3 (59m 20s):
I think about that show. Even that whole opening montage. Yeah. With the sound that woke up this morning Got yourself a gun.

4 (59m 27s):
Yeah.

3 (59m 29s):
Fuck. It was like, you got so pumped for every episode.

4 (59m 32s):
Yeah. I know

3 (59m 33s):
Sopranos is on so

4 (59m 35s):
Excited. It's, it's tough that that was like, there's so many great shows. It's tough to touch, you know, I mean that was really like a golden age in tv. It really was the way, like the sixties, seventies was a golden age in Hollywood. You know, where like you get like all those fucking old movies of like, you know, Bonnie and Clyde starting this off the graduate Chinatown godfather Taxi driver. Like all these insane Apocalypse now, you know?

3 (59m 60s):
Yeah. Comedy movies took the biggest hit

4 (1h 0m 4s):
Recently. Man.

3 (1h 0m 5s):
We took the biggest

4 (1h 0m 6s):
Hit. Isn't it crazy? I

3 (1h 0m 9s):
Everybody loves them. But now you have to rewatch old ones so people don't get offended.

4 (1h 0m 13s):
I think it'll come back at some point. Because I was watching The Hangover on TV the other day and I was like, people are gonna be hungry for this shit.

3 (1h 0m 21s):
Well, what's hilarious is the Daily Wire tried to do something, right? Yeah. They did something right. They made a movie. Right. They made a movie about transgender athletes and a bunch of men who decide they're gonna compete as women. And then after that, there's a new thing that's been happening in Canada where they've got this, this, these two teams are playing against each other. And there's five biological males that are identifying as females and dominating this volleyball game. And the biological females, all of them are sitting on deck. Why these five

4 (1h 1m 2s):
Men? They don't know why they're riding the bench.

3 (1h 1m 4s):
Are crushing it. Yeah. There's five of 'em. Yeah. Like this is in Canada. Like that is so insane. You

4 (1h 1m 13s):
Know, the thing is about those movies, I didn't, I saw the trailer for the Daily Wire thing. I didn't see it. But the thing about those movies is, and I didn't see this one. You gotta remember if you're going that irreverent to have the heart of like a Fairley Brothers movie. Right. Because like, something about Mary is a great movie because like, you forget he's stalking this woman 'cause he's so likable. Right. He's stalking Mary. Right. He hires a guy to stalk her, but in the first scene, she's got a mentally challenged brother and he gets his ass kicked present protecting her. And you're like, he's a good guy. So I think go for the fucking jugular, but make sure that you love the characters.

3 (1h 1m 45s):
Yeah. And also there's not a lot of really good, like how many people are really good at making those kind of movies? You know, there's a few people that like it sell

4 (1h 1m 58s):
Well, Todd Phillips went to serious movies. Right. You know, so he was like one of the last ones making like big hits. But if

3 (1h 2m 4s):
You, if that genre dries up, like that used to be a giant genre. Like

4 (1h 2m 9s):
It bums me out. Dude. I love comedy movies, but you're right. Like, what do I watch? I watch Fucking Back To School. I watch Like, right. Yeah. Have you seen Back to School recently? I haven't, dude. It's every line, every character there is just there to set up. Dangerfield.

3 (1h 2m 22s):
You know what my favorite part is? The Kinison scene. Dude.

4 (1h 2m 27s):
It's one of the best scenes.

3 (1h 2m 28s):
Dude. Pull that up. Pull that up. Well, he just fucking Rodney Kennison and Roddy Dangerfield in the classroom. This is fucking of May turn started from the beginning. You know, a lot of people think Welcome

4 (1h 2m 37s):
Really seems to

3 (1h 2m 38s):
Care. What? I have no idea.

4 (1h 2m 44s):
I love him. So dude, I remember Whitney is making something about Dangerfield and I was leaving her podcast with her once. And she was like, do you want to talk to, she knows I love him. She's like, do you wanna talk to his wife on the phone? and I was like, yeah. So we call her and she's like the nicest woman. She's just like, I, you know, she's like, I loved him so much. Like, imagine getting to wake up to someone that funny every day. Like, it just made me so happy. That's awesome. And and he goes, you want to hear a Rodney joke that no one's ever heard? I was like, yeah. When he went in for some kind of surgery, he was worried he was gonna die. He is like, if I, if I can't be funny. It's like, what's the point? You know, he goes in and when they wake him up, they go, Rodney, did you cough anything up? He goes, yeah, 500 last week to a whore.

4 (1h 3m 27s):
Everyone laughs. They're like, oh, he is okay.

3 (1h 3m 29s):
Right when he wakes up. Yeah. Wow.

4 (1h 3m 32s):
Never I mean, never not funny. So fucking you even see episodes. It's funny where he's on like Howard Stern and Stern's trying to like get him to open up and he just keeps doing like one liners.

3 (1h 3m 42s):
It's so funny. Where

4 (1h 3m 43s):
He's like, sir Child I was like, oh yeah.

3 (1h 3m 44s):
Had a rough childhood. I'll tell

4 (1h 3m 46s):
You. He's like, no, stop with the jokes. I'm trying to connect with you. It's so, he couldn't not be that dude. He was so fucking funny. Yeah,

3 (1h 3m 53s):
He was. He was. We have his handwritten notes for his last tonight show set. Wow. In the club. Oh my God. If you're in the green room of

4 (1h 3m 60s):
The club, I can't wait to see the club.

3 (1h 4m 1s):
Oh, you haven't seen it

4 (1h 4m 2s):
Yet? I haven't been there yet. Oh shit. I tried to, I tried to come in December, but I couldn't line it up. Right. And I was like, oh

3 (1h 4m 7s):
Well yeah, if you look on the wall in the green room, there's his wife gave us these handwritten notes from his Tonight Show set. Wow. So it's breaking down his material and then breaking down stuff to talk about on the couch.

4 (1h 4m 20s):
Oh my God. Yeah. Dude. Those old Carson sets where he's just machine gunning jokes. Yeah. Holy

3 (1h 4m 25s):
Shit. Well his story is so interesting too, because he quit comedy for a long time and he was selling aluminum siding. Yeah. and I. Guess he never stopped writing. Yeah. I guess he kept writing even when he wasn't doing comedy. And when he came back, he had all this material

4 (1h 4m 39s):
And he said that was a famous line. I was the only one who knew. I quit to give you an idea how well I was doing. Right. Yeah. That's, that's the classic. Yeah. But he came back and

3 (1h 4m 48s):
Isn't that interesting?

4 (1h 4m 49s):
I mean, dude, his movies are like caddy shack's great. Oh yeah. Fucking the one with Peshy Easy Money. Yeah. Hilarious.

3 (1h 4m 58s):
Yeah. He had some bangers.

4 (1h 4m 60s):
Even meet Wally Sparks. I I know it like critics shit on the movie. I love it. I love the scene where he walks up to a couple on the dance floor and they're making out. He is like, you two should go get a room. Then he walks up to a fatter couple. He is like, you two should go get a warehouse.

3 (1h 5m 14s):
It's like, that's

4 (1h 5m 15s):
Just like killer joke writing.

3 (1h 5m 17s):
Right. And with that face, he was one of those dudes. Like, his face was always funny.

4 (1h 5m 22s):
I loved him. Yeah. He is so good. Just pure funny. There's not, there's nothing else. It's just, I'm gonna be fun. And and it's like, that's another example. Like you go, he make, you could say whatever he wants. 'cause like, I'm gonna go help my kid at school. Like it's fucking, these are good stories, you know? Yeah. I mean Sandler. Billy Madison is like a, it's going back to school is a funny premise to put a silly guy around kids. Yeah. And he's the most immature one. Yeah. It's just a great, it's a great premise.

3 (1h 5m 48s):
Yeah. It really is. Those movies, SA Sandler's movies don't get enough Respect

4 (1h 5m 54s):
By Me. They do. I love Sandler. but

3 (1h 5m 56s):
It, it drives me nuts when like, people shit on those movies. 'cause I'm like, what do you, what are you expecting this to be?

4 (1h 6m 3s):
Yeah. Because

3 (1h 6m 4s):
This is, this is like a classic old timey comedy movie where it's just funny. It's,

4 (1h 6m 11s):
It's also like, kind of his style of comedy is like wholesome, weirdly kind of vulnerable the way how he's that silly. Yeah. You fall on your face doing that shit. I mean I did a bunch of road gigs with him. He's, he's the nicest fucking dude. Oh.

3 (1h 6m 22s):
He's the nicest guy ever.

4 (1h 6m 23s):
I, I would, I would be more stressed playing basketball with him than I would doing the shows with him because I'm like, I just don't wanna miss an open jump shot on Sandler's team. Mm.

3 (1h 6m 32s):
He, he plays really good basketball. Right?

4 (1h 6m 34s):
He's good. Yeah. He had hip surgery, but he's still good.

3 (1h 6m 36s):
Jesus. What did he have had

4 (1h 6m 38s):
Done? That was like a year ago. But he can still play. And it's

3 (1h 6m 40s):
I mean he got a hip replacement,

4 (1h 6m 42s):
I forgot. Yeah, I think so. Oh yeah. But he's, yeah. He'll make like the No look Passes fun. It's, he's really, he's sick. Oh, wow. But it's funny playing on his team, you get every fucking call like, I'm used to playing with people and they're just like, I didn't fucking foul you. But with Sam is like, I must, I must have hit you.

3 (1h 6m 60s):
That's hilarious. And who are the guys he's playing? He's

4 (1h 7m 3s):
Got a guy, Joe Vessey, who's really good. Joe is joking hoop. And then sometimes it's just his circle. But then, but then sometimes you go to the gym and he's just like playing with people at the gym.

3 (1h 7m 13s):
Real, just random people. Yeah. That's pretty fucking cool. Yeah.

4 (1h 7m 16s):
He's the fucking man.

3 (1h 7m 18s):
It's a very good dude.

4 (1h 7m 19s):
I was, Zohan was on TV the other day.

3 (1h 7m 20s):
That's a great movie.

4 (1h 7m 21s):
It's fucking funny. Dude. Dude, funny movie,

3 (1h 7m 23s):
Man. I was laughing,

4 (1h 7m 24s):
Brushing his teeth with hummus. That's fucking hilarious.

3 (1h 7m 27s):
That was a lot of funny shit in that movie. Yeah. I watched every Adam Sandler movie with my kids when we were locked down for the pandemic. That was our thing. We would just watch

4 (1h 7m 36s):
Sandler movies. They're good. They're comforting watches. Yeah.

3 (1h 7m 38s):
They're fun. Yeah. They're wholesome when they were, you know, nervous about what the fuck is going on in the world.

4 (1h 7m 43s):
Yeah. It's

3 (1h 7m 44s):
Fun. Little entertainment. Yeah. Just disconnect from things. It was nice.

4 (1h 7m 50s):
You need those, those escape movies because it's like so much. I got, look, I wanna watch the Oscar movies too, but some of them, they're like, all right, we get it. It's fucking like 40 minutes in, nothing's happened. And you're like, can something happen? Right. It is a mo it's supposed to be entertaining. Right. Do you watch any of those? Like, I, I just watched Anatomy of a Fall. I thought that was really good. I dunno if you saw that. What's that? It's a French movie. It's a guy Falls out. They're in the Alps, I think. And that he falls out a window and dies. Her husband and everyone thinks she killed him. Oh, Jesus Christ. But it's one of those ambiguous movies where you're like, you kind of don't know. It's, it's really well done. I watched American Fiction yesterday. I thought that was pretty good.

3 (1h 8m 29s):
American fiction

4 (1h 8m 30s):
With Jeffrey Wright. You know that guy?

3 (1h 8m 32s):
No, he's

4 (1h 8m 33s):
Really good actor. He's almost, he's almost like black Paul Giamatti.

3 (1h 8m 37s):
Oh really? Yeah.

4 (1h 8m 37s):
He's like a great character actor. He is. Yeah. This dude you've

3 (1h 8m 41s):
Seen, oh, the guy was in the wa the West Westworld. Yeah. Westworld. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. He's really good in Westworld.

4 (1h 8m 45s):
Yeah. This is a good movie. It's funny

3 (1h 8m 47s):
That guy's been in a bunch of things. Yeah, he's fucking great. He's always great.

4 (1h 8m 50s):
Yeah. And then the Holdovers with Paul Giamatti was really good. If you haven't seen that.

3 (1h 8m 54s):
Westworld was pretty fucking good.

4 (1h 8m 56s):
I gotta watch it. I've never seen That was HBO too, right? Yeah.

3 (1h 8m 58s):
It got a little violent and Mrs. Rogan tapped out and so I got kind of left stranded if she's not into watch,

4 (1h 9m 6s):
I've been there.

3 (1h 9m 6s):
So I stopped watching it. But I really did love, I think the first two seasons and you know, as AI moves into our lives, that show doesn't seem, it seems less and less weird. Less and less possible. Like everything they're talking about doing on that show, I'm like, maybe someday they just,

4 (1h 9m 26s):
That's fucking crazy.

3 (1h 9m 27s):
Maybe someday they're gonna be able to do that. It seems I mean everything from how they explained how they created this environment that seemed like it was another planet, you know? Yeah. That seemed like it was really the West, but it was really just in this domed environment.

4 (1h 9m 42s):
Just even things like the Oculus of the new Apple vision. Yeah. You're like, what is happening, bro?

3 (1h 9m 46s):
They're, we're gonna be so fucked in about five to 10 years. Yeah. Because it's gonna be too late to turn back and we're gonna be embedded. There's something's gonna happen where you're, you're gonna get an advantage from being connected to a network that you don't get without it. That's almost like impossible to live without. Like give it someone You mean like

4 (1h 10m 5s):
Twitter?

3 (1h 10m 5s):
Like cell phones? Yeah.

4 (1h 10m 7s):
But everything, there's

3 (1h 10m 8s):
People that can get by without, there's I know some people that have deleted Twitter. They've just said, I don don't wanna do this anymore. I know some people that have like kicked it. Do you? But, but they don't kick cell phones.

4 (1h 10m 17s):
You can't kick cell phones.

3 (1h 10m 18s):
That's what I'm saying. Yeah. Yeah. So if it becomes like, at that stage,

4 (1h 10m 22s):
But if you're addicted, your cell phone has Twitter I mean. Unless you wanna be one of those people who has, you know, like a fucking 1999 razor now. Right. You know?

3 (1h 10m 30s):
Well, you can get the, what is that Simple phone I know? A lot of people get that. It's like you can't do anything on it. It'll store music. I think all it does is like text message and make phone calls.

4 (1h 10m 43s):
Yeah. No, I've seen people that I don't even

3 (1h 10m 44s):
Know if you can do email on it,

4 (1h 10m 46s):
But that people need email.

3 (1h 10m 47s):
I know you gonna carry a second device just for email. Like what if you're involved in some sort of business decision, you need to be on the fly, able to respond to an email. Do

4 (1h 10m 57s):
You unplug for like a few hours? And you're like, what did I miss? It's a light

3 (1h 11m 0s):
Phone. Oh, light phone. Is that it? I don't know if this

5 (1h 11m 3s):
Is the only one, but this is a saying right here. Get rid of clickbait social media.

3 (1h 11m 6s):
Minimal. Yeah. I think this is it. Yep. That's it. Email. It's an experience. We all call going light. No email, no internet browser. But it's probably better for you.

4 (1h 11m 18s):
It definitely I mean people who dis I Ari will do that. He will dis like, he'll get back to me and be like, sorry, I was in fucking Thailand. Yeah. I was in Thailand.

3 (1h 11m 26s):
Yeah. Yeah. He'll do it. But he's got an iPhone too. He should shut the fuck up. He came in, he gave in Everybody gives in.

4 (1h 11m 33s):
You gotta give in. You gotta give in.

3 (1h 11m 34s):
It's

4 (1h 11m 34s):
Too good.

3 (1h 11m 35s):
Also, also, you miss out on things. Like, if Thom, UR and I almost every day send each other the most horrific accidents, disasters, boulders, crashing fucking cars that are on mountain roads. Like everything fucked up. We send back and forth to each other. And if I didn't have the ability to click on the link, I'm missing a little bit of joy in my day. Or a

4 (1h 11m 59s):
Little. And your connection to your friends.

3 (1h 12m 0s):
Yeah. Yeah. Your connection to your friends. Because that's where the joy, the joy's not in watching people get gored by bowls. The, the joy is that me and my friend have this unspoken agreement to send each other the worst shit we could find every day.

4 (1h 12m 13s):
And, and find jokes in that. And that's like, you know, when people say like dark jokes and stuff, it's like, no, you make, that's a light joke. You took a dark subject and you're finding light jokes about it, you know? Yeah,

3 (1h 12m 23s):
Yeah. You're lightening up the situation slightly. But

4 (1h 12m 26s):
That's the problem is like, you're right. You're disconnected on these phones. Yeah. But then you're also connected. So it's like now you're, it's kinda a catch 22. Whichever way you do it, you're a little fucked.

3 (1h 12m 39s):
Yeah. You're fucked. You're gonna miss out on things if you're disconnected. And if you're too connected, you're gonna be addicted and fucking losing all your life energy and time and attention to nonsense, which is what a lot of people are doing All day long. You are just scrolling through nonsense. You just get nonsense in front of your face. It's just, there's nothing nourishing about it. Nothing is like exciting your mind. It's just dumb thing after dumb thing. After dumb thing. After dumb thing. And the thing that doesn't do that is podcasts. Which is interesting. s

4 (1h 13m 14s):
Like, yeah. I try

3 (1h 13m 14s):
To listen. Like antidote for that. Or books on tape. Books

4 (1h 13m 17s):
On tape. Books on tape are great. Fantastics the great thing to do. I, I do. Because the thing about how much we're on the move. It's great for flights. Great for like in your car ride, you might get nauseous if you read. Yeah. But I think about how invasive it's gonna be because there's wheelchairs now that can be driven by neurological impulses. So it's like, okay. That's your fucking thoughts. It can read your thoughts. Yeah. Like how far we, I have a lot of bad thoughts, Joe. Yeah,

3 (1h 13m 41s):
I bet you do. I bet you do. When you're on those morning shows, imagine if you could get arrested for your thoughts. Like, 'cause I think some things that I would never do,

4 (1h 13m 49s):
You gotta, you gotta erase your browser mind thoughts too. Yeah. Like erase your history.

3 (1h 13m 53s):
Could you imagine if you could, if you had an impulse to just smash someone in the face, but you were resisting it, you weren't gonna do it. Are

4 (1h 14m 1s):
You a good person if you're resisting it constantly?

3 (1h 14m 5s):
It depends on who you're talking to. Yeah. If you're the asshole all the time, you're constantly getting in fights with people. It might be you, but

4 (1h 14m 13s):
You, we all know that person who's like this fucking asshole. I'm like, everyone's an asshole in your stories.

3 (1h 14m 17s):
But there's also times when some people need to be smacked. And there's those in those moments. Like imagine if you could get arrested because you, you tested positive for a potential aggressive episode. Right.

4 (1h 14m 33s):
It's like a covid test. You get two lines, you're keeping

3 (1h 14m 36s):
Your shit together, but you're imagining, you're imagining just teeing off on this guy just smashing this dude.

4 (1h 14m 42s):
He could be a danger.

3 (1h 14m 43s):
Yeah. Like, Hey man. Yeah. Stop doing it. But if you have that thought, I'm about to smash that guy. A light goes off, the cops come in and they arrest you. Yeah. And they arrest you because you had a potentially violent episode. You, you hit redline Sam you

4 (1h 14m 59s):
Your red flag.

3 (1h 15m 0s):
Sam. This is a serious thing. Yeah. You went to redline, but I didn't do anything. But you might've. Yeah. Or they'll tell you you were going to, we know we have predictive technology here in West World

4 (1h 15m 11s):
Technology. Well, like, oh yeah. Movie minority report. Yes.

3 (1h 15m 14s):
They look, that seemed so impossible

4 (1h 15m 17s):
Predicting murders though.

3 (1h 15m 18s):
Now it's, now it's like the World Economic Forum guy was saying that they won't have to have elections in the future.

4 (1h 15m 24s):
Wow. The

3 (1h 15m 25s):
We'll be able to predict with such precision that we don't need save a

4 (1h 15m 28s):
Lot of money though.

5 (1h 15m 30s):
Did you see this story

3 (1h 15m 31s):
Going around? British man acquitted over London, Spain flight bomb hoax.

5 (1h 15m 36s):
He texted and Snapchat to his friends. I'm on the way to blow up the plane. I'm a member of the Taliban then.

3 (1h 15m 45s):
Oh my

5 (1h 15m 45s):
God. The Spanish

4 (1h 15m 48s):
As a joke.

5 (1h 15m 49s):
As a joke. He said to joke to his friends. That's a bet. The two Spanish f eighteens were scrambled to

3 (1h 15m 54s):
Look how close the F 18 is to that other Jet's wing. He's very close. That's insane.

5 (1h 15m 58s):
He was just acquitted though, because the judge was like, there's obviously no threat here. But what was curious is how the message was found. Because Snapchat's supposed to be encrypted and some people think it's because of the wifi network at the airport. And the airport says that's not how it was. And then the UK authorities said, where was it? Right here?

3 (1h 16m 19s):
So is this evidence of some new technology

5 (1h 16m 21s):
That that I mean as you guys were saying this stuff? That's why I brought it up.

3 (1h 16m 24s):
Do you think that's what they're, what are you interpreting this as?

5 (1h 16m 27s):
They said that they have there it is for unknown reasons. It was captured by the security mechanisms of England when the plane was flying over French airspace.

3 (1h 16m 35s):
Yo. Wow. Yo, that's crazy. The message was made in a strictly private environment between the accused and his friends. With whom? With whom he flew through a private group to which only they have access. So the accused could not even remotely assume that the joke he played on his friends could be intercepted or detected by British services, nor by third party parties other than his friends who received the message. See, that's crazy because like sometimes you'll say wild shit to your friends in a text message. Yeah. For fun. You know? And you're assuming if I send you an iMessage, you're assuming that that's encrypted.

4 (1h 17m 15s):
Yeah. I'm, I'm gonna stop telling my friends. I'm gonna murder my girlfriend.

3 (1h 17m 18s):
You have to use signal. Gotta be careful. You have to use Signal for that. Today's

4 (1h 17m 21s):
The day. I'll say that,

3 (1h 17m 22s):
But I bet if you'd have used Signal. Signal, I bet they're looking through Signal too. I bet there's, I bet there is a scanning that's being done on all cell phone communication, looking for key target words that they think would be problematic. Well,

4 (1h 17m 37s):
Well think about how much of our freedom we're constantly giving away. Yeah. I don't, when I fly, don don't wanna wait on the long line. So I give them, you know, my iris, my fingerprint, all that stuff. Now those lines are longer than the other lines. Right. So I'm like, are they? Oh yeah. If I go to LaGuardia, fucking pre-check and Clear are the longest lines now. No shit. Yeah. So,

3 (1h 17m 57s):
So sometimes you just fuck it and you go through the other one.

4 (1h 17m 58s):
I just, yeah. I take my shoes off again. I'm going backward. Wow. But then there's gonna probably be a new line. You gotta give more. You dip your balls in the fucking thing. No, no. You gotta give them the outline of your penis. I get the, I'm like, I gave you my penis. You gotta let me

3 (1h 18m 10s):
Cut. Well, you have to have the update and the chip. Do you have your update? You can five. You have your update.

4 (1h 18m 15s):
Did you update your break your

3 (1h 18m 16s):
Brain?

4 (1h 18m 16s):
Did you update your brain? We only have your flacid penis. We need a hard penis. If you have

3 (1h 18m 19s):
The brain chip, we'll let you pass through. You don't ever have to worry about identification ever again.

5 (1h 18m 26s):
I thought of a new wrinkle for that. They can let you update right there at the airport with some janky terminal that's probably hacked. Or you could do it at home like everybody else will probably be doing it. Mm. When you update. Yep. Update from a safe place.

3 (1h 18m 37s):
Update from a safe place. But you

5 (1h 18m 38s):
Forgot. Or you could do it here. Like, it's like a subway terminal.

4 (1h 18m 41s):
Yeah.

3 (1h 18m 42s):
Yeah. It'll get to the point where you'll just have an account in your head and you won't have to pay for anything with a credit card ever again. It'll all be an account in your head, but only through Central Bank digital currency. If you subscribe to Central Bank digital currency, we can eye on out all the inequality and all the problems of society today.

4 (1h 19m 3s):
They'll get us,

3 (1h 19m 3s):
They'll get us, they'll get us. They're gonna get us with a chip in our head. It's gonna be awesome. That's the problem they're getting. You're gonna put that chip in and you go, God, why was I resisting this? I was so stupid just 20 minutes ago. Like, now I get it. I mean if you, if you imagine like, you can only imagine being as, as intelligent as you are on your best or worst days. But could you imagine being like a caveman, like, like a Australia polytheist, like the early days, you know, just barbaric life covered in hair. Yeah. And then somebody gives you something, just a little shot or something and all of a sudden you could think like you, you'd be like, whoa, I didn't realize how fucking dumb I was.

3 (1h 19m 48s):
I think we're gonna plug in and it's gonna be so, whoa. Oh my God, this is so much better. This is so much better. This is so much better than regular brains. We're just gonna accept the fact that we have access to information constantly. You're seeing it all in your head.

4 (1h 20m 4s):
That's just Adderall right now. I think.

3 (1h 20m 6s):
Well, it it's probably gonna be better than Adderall. Yeah. It's probably gonna be better if you, if you could have something that stimulates various parts of your brain to produce certain neurochemicals, if that's possible. They're gonna be able to do something where you're, you can, people that are paralyzed can use cursors. They can like, can like use their brain to figure out how to navigate computers.

4 (1h 20m 30s):
Yeah. Wow. Yeah. That's pretty. But again, that's, it's intrusive. Right? I mean it, it's, it's your thoughts.

3 (1h 20m 36s):
Right. But if it's, if you, if you're a paralyzed person, it's a really good thing. Yeah. Like it's way better to be able to do that than not. That's true. But once we started doing it too.

4 (1h 20m 48s):
Yeah.

3 (1h 20m 48s):
Sam I know you're not paralyzed, but lemme tell you the benefits of linking up and you just start talking to your girlfriend.

4 (1h 20m 56s):
It's gonna be like Jehovah's Witnesses. They're gonna be banging, doing, thinking

3 (1h 20m 58s):
About linking up I mean my, my, my cousin linked up. He's never felt better. You know, it's, he, he signed a one year lease. You link up for one year. You can't disconnect or they kill you. It'll be

4 (1h 21m 9s):
Like, it'll be like ozempic. You give the linked up people like a year to see how they do. And then you're like, I might link up.

3 (1h 21m 14s):
No, it'll be like military service. Like you have to, if you're gonna link up, you have to link up. You have to commit to one year. 'cause you're contributing to the grid. Yeah. You're contributing to the grid of ideas if you link up. So you have to keep it on for one year. And most people don't take it off. And if you do take it off the parts where they screw it and get infected.

4 (1h 21m 31s):
Yeah. You're gonna have to get a re-up. You

3 (1h 21m 33s):
Look weird. You are like one of those weird people that just disconnected. We're so close to something like that. This apple thing that everybody's doing. The fucking the Yeah. Watching television on a giant movie screen in your house with these goggles on. It's supposed to be incredible.

4 (1h 21m 47s):
Well, the thing is, think about how much of your personal freedom, like we all knew these people that were like, I'm not getting a fucking smartphone. I don't want, I wanna be off the grid. And you're like, and then as you said, they all have the phone now. Exactly. They all give in. Everybody gave

3 (1h 21m 59s):
In. Yeah. I mean,

4 (1h 22m 0s):
And by the way, off the grid, a lot of them were comics. I'm like, you're announcing tour dates already. Yeah. Whatcha talking about off the, you're on the grid. Dude.

3 (1h 22m 6s):
I bought three chickens. Yeah. The off the grid. Off the grid. That's called You're a farmer. Yeah. That's a hard job. Yeah.

4 (1h 22m 16s):
More than a farmers are probably on the grid somewhere.

3 (1h 22m 19s):
You can't just tour if you're a farmer, man. Yeah.

4 (1h 22m 22s):
Your

3 (1h 22m 23s):
Fucking fucking animals are gonna die. You're gonna have to have employees and you have to have somebody, supervisor.

4 (1h 22m 28s):
Even even the farmers are like, you know, they're on something. They're on Facebook. Yeah. They're doing something. They're doing

3 (1h 22m 33s):
Something. They're barely paying attention. Yeah.

4 (1h 22m 36s):
Shit,

3 (1h 22m 37s):
Man. If you really wanna be completely self-sufficient, like, wow. The only reason we can do all the things that we do is 'cause so many other people provide you with the stuff that would take up all your time, which is gathering food, eating it, and Yeah. That, that's like most of what you'd be doing, trying to find food, eat.

4 (1h 22m 57s):
Yeah. Hunting is a sport for people. It's not like a thing they most people do.

3 (1h 23m 1s):
Exactly. I mean there's a lot of people do it by choice, but they definitely don't need to. Yeah. Most places you can get meat. Yeah. You can't get that kind of meat. It's not as easy to get that kind of meat. But there's, you know, plenty of other options. Yeah. You're not gonna starve. The thing is, like in the real world of that not existing, the food system not existing. You, you're not gonna figure out anything. You're not gonna make a car. You're not going to get that outta your head. You're not building a sailboat. Like all you're doing is gathering food and you're barely adequate. Yeah. You're bare. You're gonna do it All day long and you're barely gonna figure it out. And you might start eating rodents. So You don't want to eat. Ugh. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah,

4 (1h 23m 40s):
Yeah. No I mean this is, they don't realize it's a full-time job. Full-time. And most people have like three jobs by the way now. Yep. Teachers are, you know, slowly getting on OnlyFans. You know, everyone's doing their thing to make another, I make handbags on my side. Whatever you're doing, you know, everyone's got like four fucking jobs now. Yeah.

3 (1h 23m 59s):
The OnlyFans one's a wild one. Whoa. That's a wild thing. 'cause if I was a 21-year-old girl and I just graduated college and I was kind of hot, you know,

4 (1h 24m 9s):
It's tough.

3 (1h 24m 10s):
I didn't wanna feel, if

4 (1h 24m 11s):
You look at waitress, you, if you look at your fucking salary as a teacher versus you like, oh, I just made my whole life. Yeah. This year

3 (1h 24m 20s):
I mean I'm not the one to judge. Do whatever you do that makes you happy, but it's just, it's a weird one.

4 (1h 24m 28s):
But if you're contributing to OnlyFans, make sure you have the money and you have, because I, I have a friend who fucking pays for OnlyFans and, and he has never seen The Sopranos.

3 (1h 24m 36s):
If I was a gal, I would be worried about like, dudes becoming obsessed with you from something like that. But

4 (1h 24m 41s):
You get that as a comic, don't you? Yeah.

3 (1h 24m 42s):
But it's a little bit different. It's a sexual thing. True. You know, and you're more vulnerable. It's, it's definitely different. I mean, it's like,

4 (1h 24m 50s):
But if you're a female comic, I think they become obsessed with you too. Yeah.

3 (1h 24m 54s):
That could happen for sure. Oh, definitely. Right? Yeah. I mean Whitney's had a gang of problems. Yeah. I That makes sense. An

4 (1h 25m 1s):
Actress. Whatever. I mean musician. Taylor Swift probably got a shitload of stalking. Oh my God. I mean many. of course she does I mean I mean, you know,

3 (1h 25m 7s):
She probably has people that think they're married to her. Yeah. You know, just real nuts.

4 (1h 25m 11s):
Yeah. Just got arrested.

3 (1h 25m 13s):
What's that? I think somebody just got

4 (1h 25m 14s):
Arrested for that.

3 (1h 25m 15s):
Did he think he was married to her? Something?

4 (1h 25m 18s):
Those stalkers always think, they always think that all of your posts are for them. Yeah. They're like, I see what you're doing. Well,

3 (1h 25m 24s):
They're schizophrenic. Yeah. That's what it is. And they, they believe they have some sort of a connection with you. You know, a lot of them say that they have a chip in their head. It's, it's like a very common thing. They say, I've got a chip in my head. Elon Musk talks to me like that kinda shit. For real. It's a like, that's a thing that schizophrenic start believing.

4 (1h 25m 43s):
I just read that Elon Musk book. I thought it was pretty interesting. The Walter Isaacson.

3 (1h 25m 48s):
No it didn't. It's

4 (1h 25m 49s):
Good. He's a guy

3 (1h 25m 49s):
Is an autobiography.

4 (1h 25m 51s):
No, it's Walter Isaacson wrote it about, about Elon Musk. Oh,

3 (1h 25m 55s):
It's a biography.

4 (1h 25m 56s):
Yeah. Yeah. But he did like jobs in Einstein. He did those books. He's a fucking awesome writer. But yeah, I mean, I, you know him. I, I don't know. So it was, I was like, it was an interesting window into like who he is and like how, how, what made him that way. I'm always curious to like the origin story of like bullied kid in, in Africa. Like interesting, interesting life.

3 (1h 26m 16s):
Yeah. He's not a normal guy. You can't be, he is a very, very unusual person. And when you talk to him, you can tell like in the back of his brain, his, his mind is just firing. It's just going all like, I asked him like, I'm like, what is it like to be you? Like what is it like to have all these? He's like, you wouldn't wanna be me.

4 (1h 26m 33s):
Yeah. He's not, he doesn't seem happy. He

3 (1h 26m 35s):
Didn't even know that it wasn't normal until he was like an older kid. And he is like, oh, everybody's not like this. Where you just got ideas just fucking bouncing around your head. Like laser beams just constantly go I mean the guy's running three different companies simultaneous, or four different companies

4 (1h 26m 52s):
Simultaneously. Yeah. I think at the time he was doing like five or six too. It's something crazy. It's insane.

3 (1h 26m 56s):
Insane. It's like buys Twitter. Yeah. Posts on it all the time. I mean posts fucking dunks on people, posts, memes, you know, gets people mad at him. And then is also running SpaceX and is also running Tesla and is also running the boring company. Like, what the fuck man, he,

4 (1h 27m 17s):
It's having similar characteristics of like a degenerate gambler to be that successful in business like that because you have to be willing to go all in all the time.

3 (1h 27m 26s):
Well he is one of the very few people that's like the head of a business like that. That's also, you know, he's a extraordinary human in terms of like the way his mind functions. It's not, it's not a normal person.

4 (1h 27m 41s):
No way. No, you don't get to that level.

3 (1h 27m 43s):
There's none of those other guys that run A lot of the companies that are run by CEOs. You know, you remember when that guy was running Microsoft, the, the bomber guy that would jump around and scream. It's one of my all sweat

4 (1h 27m 55s):
Time.

3 (1h 27m 55s):
Yeah. Favorite videos. 'cause it's so insane. Yeah. It's all Microsoft employees. And Steve Balmer gets out there and he goes nuts. I mean nuts. Like to the point of almost having a fucking heart attack. Hold on. Oh, they're all dancing

4 (1h 28m 12s):
Now. He owns the Clippers.

3 (1h 28m 15s):
This is a different one. This is when they were all just dancing together, which is also hilarious. Who told them that this was okay? Who told them that this was okay? If I was their friends, I would've said, guys, guys, guys don't do this. Do

4 (1h 28m 28s):
Don. Like can you stop using our music? You're making a look. It

3 (1h 28m 30s):
Doesn't make any sense. You're on stage. Yeah. You're well lit and you're dancing publicly. You're gonna be so awkward. Let's not do this. But a lot of

4 (1h 28m 38s):
These guys are, they were pariahs their entire childhood. So this is like their chance. This is their first set.

3 (1h 28m 43s):
Put this back to back to the beginning. Put it back to the beginning.

0 (1h 28m 46s):
Look at them. Yeah. Get off.

3 (1h 28m 51s):
Look at him.

0 (1h 28m 57s):
Look at this is his insanity. This

3 (1h 29m 6s):
Is insane. He's software. Imagine you're in business with these guys. Like, oh my God, we're in business with maniacs.

4 (1h 29m 15s):
Well this is either getting you, this is either getting you fired the fuck up, or you're like, I'm out. You know? Are

It's

4 (1h 29m 41s):
Amazing. You don look. Get to say. Yeah. After your thing though,

3 (1h 29m 44s):
Man. That's the kind of guy I want running my company. That's,

4 (1h 29m 46s):
He seems like a great owner for the Clippers. He's

3 (1h 29m 48s):
All in. Whoa. Cut. He's super sweaty. That's

4 (1h 29m 51s):
What I was saying. That's, I remember this video.

12 (1h 29m 55s):
Yeah.

3 (1h 29m 56s):
He goes nuts. But that's like part of his act, you know? Yeah. His act is that he would go nuts. You know, it was fun. So if you're gonna have to do those kind of things where you go out in front of all the fucking employees and dance around.

4 (1h 30m 8s):
He's fun. He's having fun.

3 (1h 30m 9s):
Why not go nutty? Yeah. Why not go nutty. Then people will talk about it forever. Yeah.

4 (1h 30m 13s):
Can I do a drink by any chance?

3 (1h 30m 15s):
Yes. Now it's the time.

4 (1h 30m 16s):
Yeah. Now's the time. What?

3 (1h 30m 17s):
Now's the time. Sam,

4 (1h 30m 19s):
Whatever you got. We got whiskey. I've got your glasses, but, all right, well, yeah. Whatever you got. There

3 (1h 30m 22s):
We go. That's what I wanted to hear. Yeah. I mean. That's the kind of guy you want running your dominating software company that's constantly getting shut down for anti-competitive practices.

4 (1h 30m 32s):
It's so weird though. I first other guys

3 (1h 30m 34s):
Didn't shut down with they, they did get sued a bunch of times. Right? Didn't they get what happened with Microsoft? Like there was a bunch of, there was a gang of lawsuits. When Jamie comes back, try to figure it out. There was,

4 (1h 30m 43s):
It's it's a different leadership style than like a Musk or a, or a Steve Jobs. Right. A guy who's like those dude Steve

3 (1h 30m 49s):
Jobs doing that.

4 (1h 30m 52s):
But it's like those dudes are much more like, fuck you deliver. Like, you know, driving you insane. Right. This dude seems like a a more friendly Yeah. Boss

3 (1h 30m 60s):
Look like he's having a good time. But he was definitely screaming, but it looked like he was smiling.

4 (1h 31m 4s):
But like jobs and Musk, I feel like they will put you to your breaking point doing shit you didn't think you could accomplish. And you either break or you do something insane. Yeah, I've

3 (1h 31m 13s):
Heard that about both of them, but, but I guess what, just grab anyone. That one's good. Jamie? The one your right hand. Yeah. They're both good. That's good. Or the buffalo Trace good too. Put that on there. Yeah.

4 (1h 31m 20s):
Whatever you got. Let's

3 (1h 31m 20s):
Go. Let's go. Yeah. Yeah. That's like, I don't wanna do that. don don't wanna work like that. No, she would work like that. That's great. You know, maybe, maybe I should get a different job. This is just, I'm not gonna sleep in the office.

4 (1h 31m 34s):
It's too much. I got

3 (1h 31m 35s):
Kids. I gotta go. Bye. Thank you. Thanks for the job. You know, it should be, you should be able to actually have a job and not life. Cheers, by the way. Cheers my brother. I don't run a business though. I mean, I kind of do. But

4 (1h 31m 46s):
You have employees. You run a business. I

3 (1h 31m 48s):
Do, but not that way. It's not the same kind of thing. Different I mean,

4 (1h 31m 51s):
Think think the scenes in Wolf of Wall Street the way where he's like, ah. And you're like all I'm not going

3 (1h 31m 57s):
Anywhere.

4 (1h 31m 58s):
Yeah. It's good. Scene. What

3 (1h 31m 59s):
A great scene. DiCaprio is an animal.

4 (1h 32m 2s):
That's a, I was on tv. The other, that's a great fucking movie.

3 (1h 32m 5s):
Oh my God. That's a great movie. That's a fun movie.

4 (1h 32m 7s):
He's like, yeah. He's like, it's rare for like actors to have mystique. He still kind of has some mystique, I feel

3 (1h 32m 12s):
Like. Oh, he's an animal. Yeah. He's so good, man. Yeah, he's so good. He in so many movies too, man. It's so many different types of characters and just, it's so few of those guys that are just like the last of the real motherfucker movie stars, you know? Yeah. Leonardo DiCaprio is a motherfucker of a movie star.

4 (1h 32m 29s):
He is like,

3 (1h 32m 29s):
When he's screaming at you and his face is red, you're like, dude.

4 (1h 32m 33s):
Yeah,

3 (1h 32m 35s):
He's good dude. Did you watch The

4 (1h 32m 36s):
Killers of the Flower Moon? I

3 (1h 32m 37s):
Didn't love it. I

4 (1h 32m 38s):
Did not. I didn't love it. I, I, I love the book. I think the book is incredible. My issue with the movie is like they focus on the wrong characters. The guy he's playing Ernest Burkhart is a boring fucking idiot. Like, he should have been playing the, or give Jesse Plemons as the Pi a bigger role.

3 (1h 32m 55s):
I didn't see it, so I can't comment. What was, it's one of the best books. What was the pre, what was the premise of the book? I started the book quite a while ago. and I, I never got into it for reasons.

4 (1h 33m 3s):
Oh, get back to it. It's, you'll love it. It okay. It's, it's one of the best because it's like true crime in history in one. It's kind of incredible. I,

3 (1h 33m 10s):
This is what happened, dude. I got really bummed out 'cause I got, I kind of overdosed on Native American history. Yeah. It was a bummer. Yeah. You know, and it was, it was so First of all, it's an amazing history and it's fascinating and I'm really connected to it being here. 'cause like we find arrowheads, like my friend of mine gave me this and then another friend of mine Wow. Just gave me four arrowheads from this ranch, from Uvalde, Texas. Shout out to them. Yeah. And these are over a thousand years old, these arrowheads.

4 (1h 33m 41s):
That's crazy. Yeah.

3 (1h 33m 43s):
Like this, this whole land is all, this is all Comanche land. Yeah. This really is. Yeah. But this, these stories are so depressing. They're so heart wrenching when you realize that they had been living that way for who knows how many thousands of years. And then over the period, a short amount of time, like a couple of hundred years, 90% of them are gone. Yeah. 90 drop just

4 (1h 34m 11s):
Them dead.

3 (1h 34m 11s):
Just drop it dead from diseases. Yeah. And then everybody else is eventually herded off into camps and they're put on these reservations and, and the, the, when you hear the stories of what they did to the kids and the schools. Yeah. You know, and you, when you, you hear the stories of the battles and these people just getting wiped out, you're like, holy shit. Could you imagine living in a place and you've been living off the land in these, these houses that you make out of animal skins and you travel with your family and you've always traveled like this. And then all of a sudden these motherfuckers start coming from another country and they, they don't stop coming.

3 (1h 34m 54s):
Like, your land got infected it got invaded. They, they landed on the east and just started going across the country. And you just watch your whole life go away. Yeah. You watch them shoot all the buffalo. You watch them shoot all the buffalo. That was like a hundred years from Buffalo everywhere to no buffalo. Yeah.

4 (1h 35m 16s):
Now it's just Buffalo Wild wings. There's nothing. Ah, no. They

3 (1h 35m 19s):
Brought, they saved him. The Ken Burns documentary is amazing. It was a new Ken Burns documentary PBS right now about the American buffalo.

4 (1h 35m 26s):
Yeah. It's, he's great. I love it.

3 (1h 35m 28s):
He's amazing. It's a really good documentary series.

4 (1h 35m 31s):
I, I just think like that movie, I love Scorsese and everyone involved. It's just like, it should have been also, if you make a three and a half hour movie, dude, you gotta leave with with not being like, what else?

3 (1h 35m 41s):
I can't comment. Like I said, I didn't see it. I,

4 (1h 35m 43s):
I love everyone involved, honestly. but it was just like, for me, like that's a, that's a book that they should have. I think he got criticized for saying something like I was telling it from the white man's perspective. And you're like, well, you are a white guy. Like, that is your perspective probably. Right? Yeah. There's nothing wrong with that. But I just think he chose the wrong white guy. Like the Pi that guy's real life. I forgot his name. You could probably find it, but I mean holy shit. This guy, like, he was like the CIA fucking Jer fuck. FBI rather Jer Who? Yeah. Treated him like shit. 'cause he wasn't like, he wanted the, you know, the vibe to be college boys, like, you know, Harvard educated and he wasn't that.

4 (1h 36m 25s):
So he always was like, didn't show any respect. Yeah. This is the guy he played Tom White, very interesting guy.

3 (1h 36m 34s):
Scroll down, scroll higher, what is it? And his brother was, what is it? What does the article say? The full, this is just like fact or fiction about the movie.

4 (1h 36m 41s):
Yeah. I know what happened. The guy Leo played is just like a dumb fuck who kind of went along. Oh. It just, it was a character I didn't think had a lot of depth. It's like just spending three and a half hours with a guy who's like going along with murder and was is kind of dumb. That

3 (1h 36m 53s):
Is a weird thing they do when they take what is an, an actual piece of history and have someone play, like when Viguera

4 (1h 37m 2s):
In GUE events,

3 (1h 37m 2s):
Sophia Viguera is playing Griselda Griselda Blanco. Yeah. Which is insanity. Yeah. Fucking insanity. Like what? She's like one of the hottest human beings that's ever lived.

4 (1h 37m 13s):
Gotta sell tickets.

3 (1h 37m 16s):
And she's playing. Yeah. She's playing this lady that was a psychopath and a murderer.

4 (1h 37m 21s):
Yeah.

3 (1h 37m 21s):
They just do things like that in movies. They just, they, they'll, they'll monkey with the past if they think it's better this way

4 (1h 37m 26s):
Or they uug up a hot guy. Yes. Instead of just getting a fucking weird looking actor. Yep.

3 (1h 37m 31s):
They uug up a hot guy or Charlie, or, or they pretend the guy was hot. She

4 (1h 37m 34s):
Won an award for being ugly and monster. Yeah.

3 (1h 37m 37s):
But she actually pulled it off. She's

4 (1h 37m 38s):
Great, but it's just fun. Shaved her eyebrows. But they could have gotten an uglier actress.

3 (1h 37m 43s):
That's a good point. There's a, there's

4 (1h 37m 44s):
Solid point. Not privilege.

3 (1h 37m 46s):
Solid point. It's a really solid point. But she also had a famous actress privilege

4 (1h 37m 50s):
For sure. And that's, that's right. That's as, as I said, you wanna sell tickets.

3 (1h 37m 54s):
Famous actress privilege trumps everything for sure. Because they sell tickets for, for sure. Yeah. So if she decides to get fat for the movie, give her a shot at it. Come on. You gonna say she can't do it, but Robert De Niro can do it. Yeah. She was so good in that movie too. Yeah. And she went back to hot again. She's hot. Which is crazy because how many women out there look like Chaise Theron did in Monster who could actually, with the right diet plan, pull it together. It's weird. And start looking like her.

4 (1h 38m 23s):
Some people starve, like don don't know. Christian Bale just like, is that, that can't be healthy. What he does to his body all the time. Well, what

3 (1h 38m 29s):
He did in that movie, the Machinist is dangerous. It's dangerous. Yeah. McConaughey did the same thing in Dallas Fire

4 (1h 38m 36s):
Book, but his face looks fucking skinny still. He

5 (1h 38m 37s):
Was lighter or less weight, I should say, in the fighter, which was after the, or no, this says

4 (1h 38m 43s):
The fighter's good. Yeah. I saw another

3 (1h 38m 44s):
Like picture that said he was, he got more skinny in that when he played I it should Mickey Ward's brother.

5 (1h 38m 50s):
I should say now that it wasn't enough source

3 (1h 38m 52s):
Something. Right? Something. Yeah. Dicky bets. There

5 (1h 38m 54s):
Was a meme that showed their weight. So that

3 (1h 38m 55s):
Might happen. Oh, 66 kilograms. And that was 55 kilograms. This can't

4 (1h 38m 60s):
Be, this can't be healthy

3 (1h 39m 1s):
Though, doing this. No, no. It's real bad. It's real bad. It's real dangerous. Super, super dangerous.

4 (1h 39m 6s):
But the Niro got shredded in, you know, raging bull and

3 (1h 39m 9s):
Yeah, but that's shredded is okay. But that it's different. He's starving to death there. That's why he's so thin. Like when he did the No, no, no, no. It is very, very, very, very, very dangerous. It's dangerous for your heart. It's dangerous for your organs. It's dangerous for your kidneys. It's dangerous for everything. It's very, very, very, very dangerous to do that. Yeah. And so unnecessary for a movie that was mid, that movie was just not that good. You know, that movie wasn't ex Mock. I didn't see it

4 (1h 39m 34s):
Wasn't a didn ex mocking a sick Woo. It's a sick movie talking about

3 (1h 39m 36s):
Ai. But you know what I'm saying? If you just get skinny for that because she left you in that box with nothing but water. Yeah. And they come back and they like, that's, you know, remember like when, when at the end of the movie, when it gets spoil alert, when it gets stuck in there and she just walks away. Killer bro. How far away away from that?

4 (1h 39m 51s):
Yeah. She was pretty A hot robot.

3 (1h 39m 53s):
Oh, she was so hot. Well, do

4 (1h 39m 54s):
You think you would ever fuck a robot?

3 (1h 39m 56s):
A hundred percent. Yeah.

4 (1h 39m 56s):
Me too. If it was

3 (1h 39m 57s):
Her, if she was talking to me like that,

4 (1h 40m 0s):
I think I would fuck a robot. I I'd

3 (1h 40m 1s):
Give her a go. I'd see what it is. You know, especially if I'm some scientist dork on an island somewhere and there's a, a hot robot that I'm supposed to interact with and she knows how to press my buttons.

4 (1h 40m 11s):
I, I'm working on a bit on stage, which is like, you, you we're gonna fuck robots, but I think it's gonna be like a cell phone. Like everyone's gonna need a robot. But like, if you're poor, you're gonna have like a lower level model. Like maybe while you're fucking it, you get ads,

3 (1h 40m 23s):
You know what it's gonna be like. Yeah.

4 (1h 40m 24s):
Liberty, Liberty,

3 (1h 40m 25s):
Liberty. It's gonna be like robot women are real women. That's gonna what it's gonna be like. That's what it's gonna be like. Wow. That's what's gonna happen. Holy

4 (1h 40m 32s):
Shit.

3 (1h 40m 33s):
Robot women are real women. That's what it's gonna be like. Yeah. And these fucking sociopaths with batteries in 'em, I mean it just start running shit. Yeah. They have no fear. She's

4 (1h 40m 43s):
A hot robot.

3 (1h 40m 44s):
She's so hot, dude. And once they put the skin on her and you know, she looks normal. The movie is so good. Yeah.

4 (1h 40m 52s):
It

3 (1h 40m 52s):
Was good, man. One of my all time favorites. I've watched that so many times on planes when I'm like going through my laptop, it's, I'm like, what do I got on here?

4 (1h 40m 59s):
It's, I like a good psychological thriller with three characters. So it's like, it's almost more like a play. It's like all dialogue heavy and just fucking like, that could have been a play. Yeah.

3 (1h 41m 7s):
And it's so fascinating. Watch this kid trying to work all this out. You know, like work out that he got this opportunity work out that he's there. He was so, so who's the actor?

4 (1h 41m 17s):
Dom Hall Gleason. Isn't that him?

3 (1h 41m 19s):
Perfectly awkward. Yeah. Every you know, everything about him. His origin story. Yeah. Everything perfectly vulnerable, you know, and when, when he gets stuck at the end of the movie, like, oh my god, that's real. That's real. Because

4 (1h 41m 35s):
You kind of know it's coming, but you kind, you also kind of wanna believe a little bit. Yeah.

3 (1h 41m 39s):
Just 'cause a baby deer is cute. Doesn't mean the mountain lion won't get it. That's the problem he got fucking, we think he he's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's doing the right thing and then him banging on the glass and you don't hear a sound. You're like, oh my god, you're gonna die in there.

4 (1h 41m 59s):
Yeah.

3 (1h 41m 59s):
You're gonna die in there.

4 (1h 42m 1s):
A 24 makes a lot of cool shit.

3 (1h 42m 3s):
Yeah. Just banging on it and knowing you ain't putting a fucking dent, denting it. You are going nowhere forever.

4 (1h 42m 13s):
It's, I like

3 (1h 42m 14s):
When she just shove the knife in them.

4 (1h 42m 17s):
I love un Hollywood endings, dude. I love when, when they don't give the pe and a lot of those movies bomb because people want to happy ending. Like I think one of Woody Allen's best movies ever is Purple Rosa. Cairo. And it's a fucking downer of an ending. and I think that's probably why it's one of his biggest bombs.

3 (1h 42m 34s):
You know what it's gonna be like? You can have a robot and you can have a robot for a wife, but that robot for a wife, if she catches you doing anything, if you do anything that's illegal, yeah. You get a, like a red light code and she detained you. 'cause your robot wife is stronger than you. And you could fuck this like really hot robot wife and she looks like just a really hot woman.

4 (1h 42m 56s):
We're all gonna be subs

3 (1h 42m 57s):
Super sexy. But what she really is, is a, a murderous robot capable of pulling your fucking head right off your body.

4 (1h 43m 4s):
How far away from are we from robot wars then? Like, we'll have American robots versus Russian robots. We're going with drones. That's true.

3 (1h 43m 10s):
We're what? What is a missile? That's

4 (1h 43m 12s):
A good

3 (1h 43m 12s):
Point. What's a guided missile? It's kind of a robot. What's supersonic?

4 (1h 43m 17s):
But drone veterans are fucking not as cool as actual on the ground war veterans.

3 (1h 43m 21s):
No, they're definitely not. But do you know that they suffer from a very specific type of PTSD? They

4 (1h 43m 25s):
Prob they probably should. They're killing people. Yeah.

3 (1h 43m 28s):
Yeah. And imagine watching that on a screen.

4 (1h 43m 30s):
But your scars are not from being on the battlefield. They're from tripping over like a fucking router or something. You know, it's, it's a different type of PTSD. It's

3 (1h 43m 37s):
Definitely a different type of PTSD, but apparently they're haunted. Yeah, they're haunted. Like they

4 (1h 43m 42s):
I'm sure. Yeah. To you're, you're playing God, you're killing people and

3 (1h 43m 47s):
You're doing a you're doing it a weird way where you're watching a screen, so you're kind of like, it's familiar. It's like a video game. Yeah. And you gotta imagine if you see those kids that are like really good at World of Warcraft and all that shit, just

4 (1h 43m 58s):
Thinking Call of Duty. Call

3 (1h 43m 59s):
Of Duty. Yeah. Yeah. Quake. Any of those games that require fast twitch. If you give them a responsive enough interface and some sort of insane weapon, they could do fucking damage. Yeah. You're, you get like a really good video game player weapons.

4 (1h 44m 13s):
Isn't that funny? That teacher gonna

3 (1h 44m 15s):
Re for the next war weapons 100%.

4 (1h 44m 16s):
Not your strongest, but your your quickest fingers.

3 (1h 44m 19s):
Think about it, man. I mean, if you're watching like a really, there's some games that are like don don't know how to play StarCraft. But I guess it's more like strategy and moving things around. It's not fast twitch, but there's a lot of these games, like the third person shooter halo or first person shooters. Halo. Yeah, halo Unreal's. Another one. Quake where you're, you're moving fast, you're gunning things down. You know, it's like, if you can get a person who is elite at that, where they just wipe out, there's certain guys that will, they'll, they'll have these death matches and these certain guys that will literally wipe out 60% of the other team. Yeah. They're just so good at fucking people up. They're so good at it. If you could get that guy to somehow or another pilot a drone, and if it's that responsive that it allows him to instantaneously move the thing and it's shooting real guns.

3 (1h 45m 7s):
Yeah. He'll fucking kill everybody. He'll fucking kill everybody. It'll be insane.

4 (1h 45m 11s):
Instead of like an incel. Now you're like a war hero. Right?

3 (1h 45m 14s):
Think about those quake characters. Jamie, pull up like Quake Arena. What's the, what's the newest one? What is the newest one? The one that we all got addicted to? Again? Champions. Quake champions. If you're, if you are actually doing this in the real world, now imagine you're attached to some sort of a machine. You're using all of these like remote controls that you would use on an Xbox. You're totally familiar with it. So it's totally tuned to your need. On the other end of it, there's a fucking robot with chain guns running into a, a, a, like a, a military complex and gunning people down,

4 (1h 45m 53s):
Da

3 (1h 45m 54s):
Da. And you're controlling this thing while it's getting dinged up. You're in another place. This thing can fly. It shoots through the air and you just try it on people in Yemen, just try it. And you have this fucking guy, a guy can do this. Like, watch this game. Imagine if you can move a thing that moves like this and has this kind of weaponry, we can switch it back and forth between different weapons. I

4 (1h 46m 18s):
Mean this is making me dizzy how good this guy is. Look

3 (1h 46m 20s):
How good this guy is. Just fuck that dude up. Yeah, you're dead. Bitch up. You're dead bitch too. You're

4 (1h 46m 25s):
Dead. Because then this would actually be you dead bitch. This wouldn't be a waste of time. This would be training. 'cause I think hundred percent I think about it all the time about how like, all like, this is different. It's like lasers and shit. But I think like some of the war games, you're just like, or GTA, like they're fun as hell. But like, what do you do when you play GTA? I have friends that are just going on, there're just murdering random people on the sidewalk. I'm like, at a certain point, this is not great for your brain. Do you know what I mean?

3 (1h 46m 47s):
It's not great for your brain, but it's no different than golf. It's a thing that people get really good at and super hyper competitive at. It's a, it's just, it's no different than any of those things.

4 (1h 46m 59s):
It's in between golf and porn. Because, because you watch porn for two minutes. Right. You're like, ah, I don't feel great about myself. Yeah. But if you're, it's not real, but like you're simulating something in your head. Real. But

3 (1h 47m 10s):
Is that our head there? There is that for sure. But if something like that is really valuable, like if you're making a lot of money doing that, which some pe what is like the most money? A

4 (1h 47m 19s):
TT streamer or something? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Some of them are like rich, they

3 (1h 47m 21s):
Make a lot of money. Right? Yeah. Like millions. Right. Shaw a hundred percent. So who could argue against that? Like, Billy, you need to get your law degree so that you can be a partner and you can fucking work weekends and 17 hour days and make a small fraction of what you would do with a blue wig on. And fucking the, the Terminator sunglasses, glasses screaming at people. The, is

4 (1h 47m 47s):
It any different? The internet on a comedian I mean it's not much different there I mean because you're, you're kind of like, well this is not a real job in my mind. Right. But if you are in the top 1%, yeah. You could do pretty fucking well

3 (1h 47m 57s):
Man's worst enemy killer, killer robot dogs that are controlled by soldiers' minds are trialed by Australian army. See what I'm saying? Yeah. I'm telling you, this is that quake thing. We're not far away from that. Yeah.

4 (1h 48m 9s):
It's all, oh, look at that thing. Shit. But

3 (1h 48m 11s):
If you can make millions of dollars playing quake, why wouldn't you just play quake? Exactly. It's like we think of it's bad because it used to be bad and we gotta get over that idea.

4 (1h 48m 20s):
Same goes for OnlyFans. It's your fucking body. Right? Yeah.

3 (1h 48m 23s):
I mean. Well, listen, I'm all, I'm a, I'm a fan of people doing whatever the fuck they want. Yeah. and I think there's a lot of pressure from people shaming people and people getting upset at other people's choices. Like, worry about yourself. Yeah. Be way better off. You should worry about yourself. You know,

4 (1h 48m 39s):
A lot of times it is your own issues with that, right? Mm. Like for me, like, you know, I think it's just, I think, I don't think everyone should go to therapy, but I think some people could benefit from talking out loud and looking at themselves. You know?

3 (1h 48m 53s):
What do you mean by that?

4 (1h 48m 54s):
I think people who are judging other people's lives. Oh, okay. What do you mean? What do I mean by that? Just fucking around. Oh, I thought so.

3 (1h 49m 0s):
Just fucking around. Oh, no. Yeah. No, for sure. It's

4 (1h 49m 4s):
Just, I, I just think sometimes if you're really mad about something that doesn't affect you in any way, that's probably your shit.

3 (1h 49m 11s):
It's a hundred percent your shit. 'cause you're wasting time. Yeah. Like, don't worry about that.

4 (1h 49m 14s):
There's types of really religious people who are into charity and, and love and Yep. And not judging people. And there's people who are really religious who are like, you're going to hell.

3 (1h 49m 22s):
Yep. Yep. There's like, there's good cops and bad cops. Yeah. It's really the same thing. Yeah. It's just human beings at all levels. There's just such a variety of people and you lump 'em all into the same thing. That's why it gets so offensive when someone, you know, just wants to like single out one specific swath of people that's responsible for everything. Like, no, we're still individuals, man. Yeah. We still have to be individuals. This idea that we, everybody has to pretend that they're on a special team. That's a a an opposed to the opposite gender or the opposite sexual orientation. Like, shut the fuck up. That's so fake

4 (1h 49m 59s):
And it doesn't really affect you.

3 (1h 50m 1s):
And you know, where, you know it's fake. Where the comedy world.

4 (1h 50m 4s):
What

3 (1h 50m 4s):
Do you mean? Because in the comedy world, no one gives a fuck what you do. You just have to be funny. Well,

4 (1h 50m 10s):
If you care about comedy, funny is your language. Right? It's

3 (1h 50m 12s):
All that we met. It's all that we care about. Yeah. Like, I loved Tim Dylan to death. Yeah. You know, I, the fact that he's a gay man, I don't believe First of all don don't believe it. I think it's a scam. I've never seen him have sex with guys. Dude, I've never heard

4 (1h 50m 26s):
Gay guy with that voice. Yeah. He's,

3 (1h 50m 28s):
He, he, he's one of the funniest human beings that's ever lived. I love, that's what's important. No one gives a shit if he's gay. Like no one gives a fuck. No one gives a fuck if you're trans, if you're funny. No one gives a fuck if you're Asian. If you're Bobby Lee, no one cares. Yeah. All they care is, are you cool to be around? Are you funny?

4 (1h 50m 42s):
First two? I was cool with Asian. Is the bridge too far? I think, but no, he's, I I'm with you. Like, we don't care. Comedy is a weirdly accepting place. That's why it's funny that we get considered like, you know, the, like, this is a dude's club. Like, no, we want to be around funny. If you care about comedy, it's

3 (1h 50m 59s):
Just harder for women. The women whoop

4 (1h 51m 2s):
The road. Yes. That's why it's harder for women. The road's

3 (1h 51m 4s):
Dangerous.

4 (1h 51m 4s):
The road is dangerous. It's creepy. I mean, especially when you're starting out and you have to stay in a comedy condo and shit.

3 (1h 51m 9s):
100%.

4 (1h 51m 10s):
Yeah. That is where women really have it harder. I think. So.

3 (1h 51m 13s):
Well that's one aspect of it. But also even just the act of standup. Like when you're going on stage and you're a woman and you're starting to talk about politics. Yeah. You're gonna get a certain percentage of the guys in the audience. Like that guy that was doing this with you. Yeah. He was doing that because of a woman. Yeah. Right. He was doing, do you know how how bad it would be if an actual woman was on stage? And she's saying, and the girl wants, she wants to be there. Like, come on, she's really funny. Let's go see her. You'll laugh at a woman. Women are capable of being funny. Greg and I said, and then Greg gets a little Drunk. It's like, boo. You know, and now you're intimidated. Instead

4 (1h 51m 52s):
A boo they're yelling, show your tits. What if

3 (1h 51m 53s):
This guy's gonna punch me? It's worse. You're, yeah. It could be. Show your tits. It's worse. It could be a lot worse. And it's also, it's like, so there's, there's a certain amount of men that are gonna be prejudiced about what you talk about. Yeah. Like, you're not allowed to talk about politics. Don't fucking tell me who the fucking real president is.

4 (1h 52m 9s):
Don't do that with any comic. But I think with women, they get unfairly condemned for like sex jokes. Sex jokes.

3 (1h 52m 15s):
Like, 'cause you're slut. Oh, look at her. She's

4 (1h 52m 17s):
A slut. No, she's, A lot of jokes are about sex. Sex is right. The way they use violence in a movie. 'cause it's extreme. We use sex as a punchline sometimes

3 (1h 52m 25s):
Also when a woman tells a joke about sex, if a guy in the audience is like, yeah,

13 (1h 52m 30s):
Yeah.

4 (1h 52m 33s):
He got horny from the joke. Yeah. Yeah. No,

3 (1h 52m 35s):
You're right. That right. That's creepy. That's possible. If a man is on stage and he tells a sex joke and a woman goes, yeah, you are like, look at this crazy bitch. I love her. Like, immediately you gotta diffuse it. It's not a threat. Exactly. So it's a completely different dynamic. So that part is more dangerous. It's more dangerous to be sexual. It's more dangerous to be vulnerable. Late

4 (1h 52m 54s):
Nights walking home in a random city. Yep. I mean, I, I was attacked on the road once I, I can't think like, you know, how'd you get attacked? I was at a bar right after the gig in Vermont and some guy walked up to me and he goes, he goes, university of Vermont. And I was like, no. And he goes, master's degree. and I said, you're getting colder. And he just looked at me and he goes, I'm gonna beat the shit outta all of you to me. And like three people I was with. and I just kinda like shrugged it off. I like, he's Drunk. I'm ignoring him. So I turned around, he takes a punk glass and smashes it over my head. Oh, Jesus Christ. Yeah. And he ends up running out the cops. They called the cops on him. I was all right. I had, honestly, this sounds ridiculous, but I had a Jew fro at the time and it did provide some support for my head.

4 (1h 53m 35s):
It really did help. And he runs for it. The cops get him. He went for one of the cop's guns. Oh, Jesus Christ. But he was in a blackout. They they

3 (1h 53m 44s):
Did they shoot

4 (1h 53m 44s):
Him? No. No they didn't. And they, were

3 (1h 53m 48s):
You upset about that? No.

4 (1h 53m 49s):
Don don't want him to die.

3 (1h 53m 50s):
What were you rooting for? I a wound, a foot

4 (1h 53m 52s):
Wound. I the ankle. A little, a little police brutality. I would've been okay with just

3 (1h 53m 56s):
Above the knee.

4 (1h 53m 60s):
But, but they, they arrest him and I get a call and they're like, Hey, we're like, we're the victim's advocate or whatever from Vermont. And they said, yeah, that was a therapist. He was in a blackout. He's going through a divorce.

3 (1h 54m 12s):
The therapist. Yeah.

4 (1h 54m 13s):
The guy who hit me was a therapist. And, whoa. Therapists or a lot of therapists are fucking insane. I used to date a therapist. She was removed from my show earlier this year. Whoa. Yeah. I mean a lot of them are a little cuckoo,

3 (1h 54m 26s):
You know. Well that's, well that's like El Ron Hubbard. He was like trying to self, self-diagnose. Well

4 (1h 54m 31s):
It always starts good with these guys. Same with Jim Jones. They always start, they always start nice. Yes. And then it ends up at a place where you're like, you believe the fucking, for lack of a better word, you drink your own Kool-Aid. Right. Exactly. And I mean Elron Hubbard, Jim Jones. Anyone you wanna fuck a lot of the, a lot of crazy people are very intel. Ted Bundy. I mean I mean not Ted Bundy. Kaczinski very smart guy.

3 (1h 54m 50s):
Oh yeah. He was really smart. A lot of these

4 (1h 54m 52s):
Ted Bundy was probably pretty fucking smart too. Yeah.

3 (1h 54m 54s):
In a creepy way. Creepy as fuck. Just because you're smart doesn't mean you're nice.

4 (1h 54m 58s):
Of. course not.

3 (1h 54m 58s):
He could be a real monster. Totally. Be super intelligent. But

4 (1h 55m 1s):
Like a lot of therapists just 'cause like you're a therapist doesn't mean you're not fucking insane.

3 (1h 55m 6s):
Right. You could be insane. So they ask me

4 (1h 55m 8s):
If I wanna

3 (1h 55m 8s):
Fly back. And the whole reason why you got involved in it could be because you're insane

4 (1h 55m 12s):
And you wanna read people. Yeah. And you can read people well and you can manipulate people. I mean there's

3 (1h 55m 17s):
A therapist that convinced her patient to kill her ex. She convinced her patient to kill her ex.

4 (1h 55m 25s):
That's like a great movie premise.

3 (1h 55m 26s):
Yeah. No it's, but it's real. That's, see if you can find that story. Jamie I know I saved it. I can find it if you can't. But this therapist talked, this guy, she talked this guy into killing her ex.

4 (1h 55m 36s):
That's fucked up. Like, gosh,

3 (1h 55m 37s):
You're killing me. I'm gonna sucker crook. You know, like he was telling her stories. He was telling her his stories and she was telling him she loved him. And you know, something happened.

4 (1h 55m 47s):
Something kind of hot about that though. Something

3 (1h 55m 49s):
Hot, fucking hot as shit. Look, everybody

4 (1h 55m 50s):
Died. Female therapists. It's can be really hot.

3 (1h 55m 52s):
Counselor attempts to enlist patient in her plot to have her ex-husband murdered. Cynthia got, wait a minute, is that her? That Cynthia don

4 (1h 56m 0s):
Don't know the nervous people.

3 (1h 56m 2s):
Like an old

4 (1h 56m 2s):
Lady. 250 an hour and then trying to get you involved in this shit.

3 (1h 56m 6s):
Cynthia Guy wanted her ex-husband dead. But her patient teamed with investigators to take her down. Oh. The patient's a snitch. That's why you don't get any good crazy pussy

4 (1h 56m 16s):
This season. Six A Fargo already

3 (1h 56m 18s):
A deal's a deal is a deal, dude. A deal is a deal. That's, you know, you shoot my ex I was like, yeah, come on. You should have taken it. What are you gonna do dude, the rest of your life? You're gonna go, what would've happened if I shot that guy?

4 (1h 56m 31s):
There's something hot about fucking a therapist though. It's like fucking the teacher. It's like they're in a position of power over you. Right. Most porn is fucking people. You shouldn't be fucking,

3 (1h 56m 40s):
There's the real power struggle is like, when do we get to fuck before I kill your ex? Or, or after. I want

4 (1h 56m 45s):
I, I

3 (1h 56m 45s):
Need, I'd like one for the road. I need to know. I need to know for sure. You're really on this program.

4 (1h 56m 50s):
Dude. I a hundred percent did.

3 (1h 56m 53s):
Nobody guys just imagine. Okay. Sophia Rega we're talking about her. Yeah. Imagine someone, not her Of course 'cause that would be offensive. But imagine someone who looks exactly like her. Yeah. And she's trying to convince you to kill some terrible, terrible, terrible person. And if you do, she's gonna suck your car.

4 (1h 57m 11s):
Yeah. Do I have to take a picture though? More recent

3 (1h 57m 13s):
Version of another one. New Jersey therapist asked patient to help her find a hit man and attack her ex.

4 (1h 57m 20s):
Wow. You know what I would say if my therapist said, you know what I would say if my therapist said this to me, I'd say, this is my time that I pay for. Why are you talking to me about killing your fucking husband? I would

3 (1h 57m 30s):
Say keep talking. What kind of deal we talking about? It depends on who I am. Yeah. If it's me right now. Yeah. I'd be like, this is crazy talk. Yeah. I'm very

4 (1h 57m 37s):
Really I mean. I'm turned on and I have an erect. But I'd like you to stop. I gotta go. but it was, I'm gonna jerk off in your bathroom.

3 (1h 57m 41s):
But if I was 24-year-old me, I might kill that dude. Dude. I would fucking strangle that guy.

4 (1h 57m 48s):
There's that movie about this. You ever see that movie to die for with Nicole Kidman? It's a great movie. Oh yeah. Buck Henry wrote it. He wrote the Graduate and she gets a young Joaquin Phoenix to murder her husband. She's his teacher. It's kind of hot there.

14 (1h 58m 1s):
Well, hell hath no fury. Like a woman's gone.

3 (1h 58m 8s):
There's crazy human beings that happen to have vaginas. Yeah. Okay. That's a real thing. Sure. And to ignore that is just as crazy as to say that anybody who says they're trans can use the women's room. 'cause both of those things are equally crazy. Why

4 (1h 58m 23s):
Can't, yeah. Why can't I think anyone can be crazy. I think of anything that's inclusive.

3 (1h 58m 27s):
But there was a time where that was really shunned. That kind

4 (1h 58m 30s):
Of thing. Well there are women, there are men who gaslight women and call them crazy when they're the ones manipulating them. Hundred. So I think that's where that comes from. But like, it doesn't mean a woman can't be crazy.

3 (1h 58m 40s):
It 100%. but it also does mean the guys will say a woman's crazy if they're trying to gaslight them. Totally. That's true too.

4 (1h 58m 47s):
It's a, it's lazy. Point out why they're crazy. Don't just use that. You know, like show, show. Give some examples.

3 (1h 58m 52s):
Right. It's, it's inept. It is. It's not effective because lazy is easy to count. Like no, you are losing, like now you're in a, now you're playing fucking pickleball. You know? No, you are losing. You know, like, it's like this is stupid.

4 (1h 59m 3s):
Yeah.

3 (1h 59m 3s):
The the correct thing is to say exactly why what you're doing is lazy and what you think is actually behind that thinking. Yeah. And the way

4 (1h 59m 11s):
You behave. Be constructive. Yeah.

3 (1h 59m 12s):
Be constructive or just be communicative to the point of like saying, I have a real issue with this and don don't wanna play stupid games. Yeah. So either we're nice to each other or we're never gonna be nice to each other anymore. 'cause I'm gonna go away. Like I'm not interested in, you know, arguing about dumb shit. That shouldn't really be something that anybody

4 (1h 59m 33s):
Argues about. Most. About most is dumb shit. Every time I'm in an argument I'm like, this is fucking dumb. Mm. It's because it, here's what it should be. Yes. One of you says something that bothers you. And the other person, if you're, if you love them, you should just be like, alright.

3 (1h 59m 45s):
100%. There's no

4 (1h 59m 47s):
Why you fight when you see couples fighting in public. I'm like, yeah, you two should not probably be together.

3 (1h 59m 52s):
Yeah. Especially

4 (1h 59m 53s):
If you're calling one, calling each other. Like, I, I used to neighbors who would scream at each other in ways where I'd be like, this is not healthy for either of you.

3 (1h 59m 59s):
No, I I never do that. I never, I can't scream and I can't say names. I just can't do it. I don't wanna do that. don don't ever wanna do that in my life. and I think it's a dangerous area to get to. 'cause I think if you're screaming at each other and calling each other names and saying mean shit to each other, you're real close to violence. Yeah. You're on violence's door and you know, if there's any like one constant in my life it's been like avoid violence at all costs. Yeah. Other than like competition but avoid, avoid. 'cause that's kind of different. That's like, I'm trying to figure out myself. That's like what, like martial arts competition's about, you're really trying to figure out how far you can go and how good you can get at this.

3 (2h 0m 43s):
But like real world violence at all costs. Fuck your ego. Get outta there.

4 (2h 0m 48s):
Yeah. It's not worth, none of it's worth it out. It sometimes in the moment you think it's fuck I mean? I got into a fight with a guy in the park the other day 'cause he was like, me and my friend this fight. No, we got, we were exchanging words. It didn't get physical, thank God. But I, no, we were arguing 'cause they were like all these skater kids and they just kept coming through our basketball court. And I was like, guys, come on. Like, we're not going in your area. Just could you just stop coming here? And he goes, skaters were here first. I'm like, oh great. Now this is like the Middle East we're fucking arguing about like, dude, just let us have a, and then we, it kind of escalated and I was like, Hey man, I don't want to argue. And he was like, meaning I was like, alright, good. That's good. But you get the wrong guy. You're like, fuck.

3 (2h 1m 20s):
Oh yeah. Well, so there's guys who look for things like that. Yeah. Especially guys who know how to fight a little bit. And they'll, they'll just decide.

4 (2h 1m 26s):
They wanna show off a little. Yeah.

3 (2h 1m 27s):
They wanna show off and they wanna tee off on your face. Yeah. You know, especially if they come from abused backgrounds or their dad beat 'em or something like that. Yeah. Those are fucking dangerous people. 'cause they're bad dad.

4 (2h 1m 37s):
They're

3 (2h 1m 38s):
So used to violence. They're so used to violence. That violence to them is like first choice. You know, they're ready to like smack you because people have been smacking them their whole life.

4 (2h 1m 47s):
My biological father was just distant. So I'm like, I think I'm passive because of that. don don't wanna argue. Even I'm, I like shrink kind of. I'm not that. But you know, I think if you had an abusive dad, yeah. You're gonna wanna fucking throw down. Probably.

3 (2h 1m 58s):
Yeah. There's like a, there's a a fine line for with every interaction. Like how much could this interaction have been different if I approached it different. Right. You know, how much of it could have been avoided if I was less defensive or if I was more friendly and disarming or if I was just more careful with my words. Yeah. How much difference, how much could I have manipulated this conversation or massaged this conversation? And you know, that's the thing you always have to think about when it comes to like, two people that don't know each other interacting with each other. Especially if they're Drunk. You know, like after a show or something like that. I

4 (2h 2m 35s):
Hate bad drunks 'cause I think I'm, I'm not a bad Drunk that's at a certain age. I'm

3 (2h 2m 39s):
A happy Drunk.

4 (2h 2m 40s):
Me too. I'm a nice, I'm a nice Drunk. I will deny that I'm Drunk. When I'm Drunk. That's the one thing that's like, I will literally come home, shit face and I'm like, I had one drink. I two drinks. Dude,

3 (2h 2m 50s):
If you wake me up at four in the morning, I'll swear I was already awake.

4 (2h 2m 54s):
I won I don, why

3 (2h 2m 55s):
I lie? No,

4 (2h 2m 56s):
I was awake. It's the only lie I'll tell. That's my

3 (2h 2m 57s):
Said. I'm not my lie. My lie is I was asleep. I wasn't asleep. That's my lie.

4 (2h 3m 3s):
Fo. Why?

3 (2h 3m 4s):
I don't know, man. I wish I knew. It's worth the fucking, there's an answer in there somewhere. But that's the one time I'll definitely lie. Not really. Yeah. Most of the time I would probably tell the truth now, but like in my life, how many times have I lied when someone called and woke me up like 99% of the time? Like I'm always like, no, I'm awake. I'm awake. What's

4 (2h 3m 22s):
Up? I, I've gotten better at this shit. Like, I've gotten better at saying I'm, because I was at a Knicks game with my girl the other night and like, I was screaming at the ref and she was like, you're fucking Drunk. And I was like, yeah, you watched me drink. Like what? I don't know why That's surprised you saw me and I was yelling at him. It's this funny NBA ref. He was like, this guy Tony Brothers. He's like a funny ref. So I'm, I'm like, you stink. You're the worst ref. Har. And he just looks around. He gives me one of these like, just like annoyed. He's a funny, he's got a funny like face. It's very sarcastic ref. So, but yeah, no, I, I've gotten better at admitting it. But for years I was like, I'm not Drunk. It came from just being a kid and coming home Drunk and my mom being furious at me

3 (2h 3m 59s):
And just learning how to be like a good Drunk

4 (2h 4m 1s):
Actor. My parents would lock the door, so I would just keep hitting the doorbell. My face passed out half against the door. So they'd open it and I'd fall flat on my face. How old were you? I was like 16 probably. But I remember I was just puking my guts out and my mom would, she doesn't know where to deal with a Drunk. My mom doesn't drink. So she would come in and bring me chamomile tea as I'm puking. I'm like, perfect. Yeah. This will, this will sell. That'll do

3 (2h 4m 21s):
It. That'll do it. You got any zucchinis back there?

4 (2h 4m 23s):
Zucchini

3 (2h 4m 24s):
Serve with it. The fucking gimme lady cam

4 (2h 4m 27s):
Guilty. She didn't know she was just trying to help.

3 (2h 4m 28s):
That's so insane. But

4 (2h 4m 30s):
No I mean, I, I can't stand bad drunks because Oh, they're terrible. I don't mind like, if you're just a little sloppy, but if you're like an aggressive Drunk man, there's something I I, nah, I got no time for that shit.

3 (2h 4m 42s):
And it's always like, how much do I have invested in you? Like, how much do I know? You know you. Yeah, I really know. You know you. and it is just an off night and like, you're all right dude. Don't worry about it. You give him a hug and go, bro, you were crazy. You were crazy. You're trying to fight cops.

4 (2h 4m 56s):
Exactly. That's the thing too.

3 (2h 4m 57s):
I was, I really? Yeah. You tried to fight a cop man. Come on.

4 (2h 5m 0s):
Well, that's the thing. I'm compassionate 'cause I drink. So I, if someone's badly behaved, I'm like, hey, just, I'm usually, as long as they're not like a huge asshole, I don't want people kicked outta my shows ever. So I'm very Yeah. Very gentle with that. But at the same time, I think people I mean. I remember a guy threw a fucking bottle at David Tell's Head and he was just like, he gave, I think he gave the guy's friend bail money for the guy

3 (2h 5m 22s):
Jesus Christ.

4 (2h 5m 23s):
Because he's that fucking nice. That's

3 (2h 5m 25s):
Amazing.

4 (2h 5m 25s):
Yeah. I'm not that nice. That's, no, I'm

3 (2h 5m 28s):
Not that, that

4 (2h 5m 29s):
You throw a bottle of my head.

3 (2h 5m 30s):
Yeah. The Comedy Store In the dark days. The dark days of like the nineties, the Comedy store was totally unpoliced.

4 (2h 5m 37s):
I hate

3 (2h 5m 38s):
That. And there was no crowd control. It was terrible. and it was not good, but it was good. 'cause it was like working out a crunk gym where they kept the temperature at like 98 degrees all the time. And you just are so hard to work there. But you'd go on the road and you're like at the improv in Fort Lauderdale and you're fucking slaying your shit's tight. 'cause you're dealing with animals also. You have, you have the ability to flow if something happens to the crowd, you know, if something happens, you're so accustomed to things going sideways. Yeah. We were comedy store, like the Comedy store, nineties comedians, you know, and I, count Diaz in one of those were constantly involved in these chaotic shows. They were nuts, man.

3 (2h 6m 19s):
They were nuts. People would pile in there, but it

4 (2h 6m 22s):
Makes you who you are, makes

3 (2h 6m 23s):
You who you are. It's, it's not easy. It's, that was a hard room. It was really loud. The hallway was really loud. People were always out there in the hallway yelling.

4 (2h 6m 31s):
And that was Broadway Comedy Club for us in New York. That was a rough room. I I used to work the door there for a couple years and it sucked. I I, they'd give you stage time to like, go on, but like, I remember a guy fucking spit on me during my set and I'm like, oh my God, this is like, this is maybe a bit much. Joey

3 (2h 6m 45s):
Cola told me that he was doing Pips in Brooklyn and the guy showed him his gun. Yeah. Showed him his gun. And he said, you fucking suck. You fucking suck. You're not funny at all. You fucking suck. I'm gonna shoot you in your fucking head. And he's like, Hey buddy, whatever I do. And he's trying to like, like choke around. And Joey Cole is like the sweetest, nicest guy ever.

4 (2h 7m 5s):
Lot of pressure. Whoever's on next. Yeah. Joe better fucking turn this around.

3 (2h 7m 9s):
Yeah. Joey's a funny dude, man. No, he

4 (2h 7m 10s):
You ever seen Joey Cola? I haven't. But I know, I i's aware of his reputation as being a killer. He's

3 (2h 7m 15s):
He's a killer dude. Yeah. Especially like the, the nineties. Oh my god. Joey Cola was an animal. He was an animal so fast. You

4 (2h 7m 23s):
That showed him

3 (2h 7m 23s):
Title a Pips, mob started out

4 (2h 7m 27s):
Mob guy.

3 (2h 7m 27s):
Oh yeah. Or a killer. Just some hit man or a crazy person with a gun. Could be all the above. But there's a lot of You're in Brooklyn, you're in Sheepshead Bay. Yeah. I was like, what do you think is happening there? You know, you're in Chinatown and you's some guy, you know, talking Chinese. You get hit in the net with a dart.

4 (2h 7m 42s):
Dude, I had an incident once I was leaving terrible club to catch Rising Star in Princeton. As many, it was probably like 12 years ago or something. And you know, one of the rare clubs that would headline me back then. And I'm getting, I'm coming back that night on the train on Amtrak, whatever, wait. Or New Jersey Transits or rather. And I'm on the platform and I'm just like, I got a bottle of whiskey with me. I'm like, that's, I'm like, I'm going back tonight. I'll have a few drinks, I'll chill on the train. And I'm, I'm a little buzzed. And this dude just walks up to me, something's like off about him. And he's like, fucking with people on the platform. And he said to me like, he's gonna, everyone like, how do you feel about immigration? And I'm like, what is wrong with this guy? So when he gets over to me, I'm like, I'll fuck with him back. I was, I had that much alcohol in me.

4 (2h 8m 23s):
And he goes, where do you stand on immigration? I was like, they're ruining the damn country. And like, I shouldn't have said that. I was just trying to be silly. Like, obviously don don't believe that, but he, he's like, he goes, you're a bad fucking person. He goes, I should fucking hurt you. And I was like, what is like, he's a creepy little dude. So I'm like, what, whatever. But I'm like, maybe he's got a weapon. I get on the train, I'm hiding from him. He's trying to find me. I'm like hiding because I just, I don't wanna deal with this.

3 (2h 8m 44s):
How'd you get away from him? So he keeps

4 (2h 8m 45s):
Fucking with people as he is looking for me. I'm like hiding. I see him. But

3 (2h 8m 48s):
How'd you get away from him initially after he

4 (2h 8m 50s):
Said that? I just, I just kept walking away and he wasn't like, he was kind of like still keeping his eye on me and trying to find me. But he wasn't like chasing me. You know?

3 (2h 8m 57s):
Who's sizing you up?

4 (2h 8m 58s):
Sizing me up. Yeah. And I'm on the train and I'm hiding because I'm like, don don't wanna fuck this guy's insane. I didn't realize how crazy he was. I thought it was like, and it was a rookie move by me. I'm a New Yorker I know better than to do this shit. I'm on the train, I'm sitting down, I'm hiding. I'm texting my friend and I'm like, this guy's fucking with me on the train. He is like, ah, fuck, I'm sorry I'm whatever. I see him do it to another guy. How do you feel about immigration and this? And he just keeps fucking with the dude. And it's a big black dude. And he goes East New York motherfucker. and I'm like, this is like my guardian angel right here. Oh. He like gets in the guy's face. He's like, I'm gonna fucking kill you. And then like some ticket boy tries to get in the middle. They have to stop the train. This dude was about to get fucking pounded. I got like saved by some weird

3 (2h 9m 38s):
Yeah. There's people out there in the world that you should not fuck with. Yeah. And you find those in those prankster guys. Every now and then they run into the wrong dude. It's not a smart move. I get it. You're trying to get a lot of people to pay attention to you and that will be effective. But you might get concussed. Do

4 (2h 9m 52s):
You see Old Clips of Tom Green? I'm like, thank God he didn't get to ask I mean. This is like ballsy though. He

3 (2h 9m 56s):
Was crazy. Tom Green

4 (2h 9m 57s):
Was crazy. He was innovative. I mean he was, he was. I

3 (2h 9m 59s):
Credit him to being one of the inspirations for me starting this. For sure.

4 (2h 10m 3s):
I love him. Do

3 (2h 10m 4s):
You ever see his show?

4 (2h 10m 5s):

And he'd be like, we're under Cutters pizza. We will charge you less to the guy he was delivering it to. And I'm like, and the guy fucking tried to kick his ass. He was

4 (2h 11m 12s):
He's great. Underappreciated.

3 (2h 11m 13s):
Yeah. I feel so. I feel like that. and I really like to

4 (2h 11m 16s):
Stand up. I know.

3 (2h 11m 17s):
He's, he's

4 (2h 11m 17s):
A big, he's a big name still, but I'm just he

3 (2h 11m 19s):
Is. But I don think people like that. Well, the Freddy Got Fingered is a fucking great movie,

4 (2h 11m 23s):
Man. Insane. I was, it's great movie. I was one of three people in the movie theater opening day when it came out. The other two, my friends, my friend Empty movie theater, my friend, it

3 (2h 11m 31s):
Was an empty movie. It didn't pan out commercially. But my friend Eddie Bravo told me about it. He goes, dude, he goes, I know. Everybody says it sucks. Go see Freddy got fingered. It's, I went,

4 (2h 11m 40s):
Really? It's insane. He goes,

3 (2h 11m 41s):
It's so funny. It's so good. He

4 (2h 11m 43s):
Jerks off a horse.

3 (2h 11m 44s):
It's amazing.

4 (2h 11m 45s):
An elephant. Whatever, whatever. No, he,

3 (2h 11m 47s):
It's amazing. It's so silly.

4 (2h 11m 50s):
He's ahead of his time. That was, he was

3 (2h 11m 51s):
Ahead of his time. Yeah. He sucks off a, a cow or something.

4 (2h 11m 54s):
He's out of his mind. Yeah. It's one of, you know what, it's one of the last movies I feel like that got destroyed by critics. It's when critics still had their power and it was like a 0% under Rotten Tomatoes or whatever. And they were like, it's like back, like think about critics.

3 (2h 12m 7s):
I don't do this. I don think that had Rotten Tomatoes back then,

4 (2h 12m 8s):
But it, whatever it was, it was like, it was like

3 (2h 12m 10s):
Roger Ebert and Gene Cisco

4 (2h 12m 12s):
Being like, this sucks. Yeah. and I Ebert's a great reviewer. He doesn't always get comedies, but like, if you read Ebert's old reviews, they're incredible. They're, he's one of the best writers. Did you ever read the

3 (2h 12m 21s):
Script that he wrote?

4 (2h 12m 22s):
No, I never did. Is it good or

3 (2h 12m 24s):
Not? He wrote some crazy movie. What was the movie that Roger Ebert wore? It's like, it's so insane. You're like, like, what are you doing? What

4 (2h 12m 33s):
Is this? It sucked. It

3 (2h 12m 34s):
Is. I I mean I'm not the one to judge. I'm not a movie critic. and I don don't know how to interpret scripts. Maybe it could have been made amazing, but his but most people thought it was preposterous. Well,

4 (2h 12m 44s):
His reviews though, I mean that was his talent, his reviews. Yeah. Because he would write shit and look, he's

3 (2h 12m 49s):
A really

4 (2h 12m 49s):
Good writer. He would, he would articulate things like, fuck, I didn't realize I felt that way. And that's what a good writer can do, you know? Yeah.

3 (2h 12m 55s):
But it's also, he's a different human than you. Like an Adam Sandler movie for me, I'm like, I can review an Adam Sandler movie and I Go. It's fun. Silly. He was great. The Zohan, he fucks everyone cuts hair kicks everybody's ass. Yeah. It's really fun. Yeah. At the end of the movie you're like, I had a good fucking time. But

4 (2h 13m 10s):
You can like both. That's the

3 (2h 13m 12s):
Thing. And also he did Uncut Gems, which is a complete polar opposite of that. What did you see? That movie makes my fucking hand sweat. Yeah. And I'm going, oh Jesus, don't fucking do this, man. Don't fucking do this. When you watch that gambling junkie, keep placing those bets and you feel the anxiety. You

4 (2h 13m 28s):
Feel it? I feel it. No, I was, it was, that's one of the most stressed inducing movies I've ever seen, ever. But man, he's grading it.

3 (2h 13m 36s):
He's so good in that movie. That movie.

4 (2h 13m 37s):
That movie is so good. They're great directors. Those guys. They're, they're really good. Who did it? The Ty Brothers. Oh, okay. They did like, good time. You ever see that? They're fucking great. What's good time? It's with Robert Pattinson. It's like another crazy adrenaline rush type movie like that. It's really, it's really cool.

3 (2h 13m 51s):
Did you see Sisu?

4 (2h 13m 52s):
I I, it was on TV the other day and I was loving it and I had to run out. It's that war movie, right? It's fucking great. Yeah. It violent as shit. It's fucking great. I'm I'm putting on the list right now. It's

3 (2h 14m 1s):
Fucking great. It's so ridiculous. And it's like, basically like John Wick in World War ii.

4 (2h 14m 6s):
I, I gotta see this. It's amazing.

3 (2h 14m 8s):
Man. Guy

4 (2h 14m 8s):
Gets it's World War

3 (2h 14m 9s):
I,

4 (2h 14m 9s):
World Wari guy got stabbed in the head and then I and I had to run out.

3 (2h 14m 13s):
It's fucking incredible. This dude is the shit. Yeah.

4 (2h 14m 16s):
That was it. and I had to fucking run out.

3 (2h 14m 18s):
I'm telling you, this dude's the shit. He's amazing. He stole his golden, he just wants it back. Oh, he fucks everybody up, man. and it way

4 (2h 14m 25s):
Tell about revenge movies, dude.

3 (2h 14m 27s):
I love him from behind John Wick. Yeah. Yeah. It's a fucking fun movie, man. It's a really fun movie. Gotta

4 (2h 14m 34s):
Of check it out.

3 (2h 14m 34s):
Doesn't he have like one line the whole time also? Yeah. You can watch it. Like, it doesn't matter. It's like my favorite moments of John Wick and I, not of him talking all due respect to Ke Reeves. I love that dude. But my favorite mo moments in John Wick are him just fucking everybody up.

4 (2h 14m 49s):
It's just Incr. It's like beautiful. Yeah. The way it's choreographed, it's like beautiful violence, bro.

3 (2h 14m 55s):
John Wick won. I don't care what anybody says, it's like one of the best movies ever in terms of like what it's trying to do. What is it trying to do? It's trying to excite you and get you fired up and, and get you engaged in wanting this guy to be successful and kill all these bad guys.

4 (2h 15m 8s):
And you're on his side immediately. A

3 (2h 15m 10s):
Hundred percent. And he's doing things that you know can't possibly

4 (2h 15m 12s):
Happen. No. There's not a person who is okay with you murdering a dog. Exactly. You can't fucking I mean maybe Michael Vic 10 years ago. Other than that,

3 (2h 15m 20s):
It's also redemption denied. So this guy has this redemption story. He's decided to settle down with this amazing woman. I'm not gonna be a hit man for the Russian mob anymore. Which is kind of problematic already. Yeah. Because she probably killed a lot of nice people. But you have beautiful hair and you are Keanu Reeves, so I'm gonna let it slide for now. Yeah. So, but this woman, obviously, they were really in love and then, you know, when she dies and then they steal his car and kill his dog,

4 (2h 15m 45s):
You don't fuck with a man's car or their dog.

3 (2h 15m 47s):
Okay.

4 (2h 15m 48s):
Yeah.

3 (2h 15m 49s):
Okay. And you're so, you're rooting for him every step of the way. And then the fucking guy who was the guy who played the father that was the head of the Russian mom, he

4 (2h 15m 57s):
Just passed away. That guy A great actor. Yeah.

3 (2h 15m 59s):
God damn. He was incredible. He's so good in that movie, man. He's so fucking and to

4 (2h 16m 3s):
Fucking

3 (2h 16m 4s):
Good when he's explaining to his son what he did wrong. Yeah.

4 (2h 16m 7s):
You know, because he kind of, you could tell he's kind of on, he's more like Wick. He's more on his side. But he is like my fucking son. Well,

3 (2h 16m 13s):
He knows what's gonna happen. Yeah.

4 (2h 16m 14s):
You're fucked.

3 (2h 16m 15s):
Yeah. And when he says to him, he goes, we called him Bubba Yaga. Yeah. Here, play this. The book. This is one of man my favorite scenes in any movie when Aribert, Tom and I were having sober October Fitness challenge. I watched this on a loop. I watched this like 50 times in a row. Look at the fucking greatest scenes in any movie. I love this. The fucking ultimate boogeyman ugh. Rich guy's son piece of shit.

4 (2h 16m 45s):
He's hateable he has a hateable face too.

3 (2h 16m 47s):
Just admitted he killed some people in Atlantic City. Yeah. Could keep it going. Oh, this is Barbie for men, ladies. Yeah. I just want you to understand it is, that's what that is. You know how you love Barbie? I enjoyed Barbie too. I don't like it. I thought it was fun. I thought it was a silly movie. I enjoyed it. I went with my wife and my daughters. Yeah. We had a good time. Yeah.

4 (2h 17m 7s):
I, I look, I understand. It was beautiful looking. I I think they're,

3 (2h 17m 11s):
That's Barbie for me. Yeah.

4 (2h 17m 14s):
It was. It's not for me.

3 (2h 17m 16s):
Well, I enjoyed it. Yeah, I did. I'm not faking enjoyed it. I thought it was a fun, silly movie. What did you not like about it?

4 (2h 17m 22s):
Hmm. I just didn't think it was that funny. I just thought it was kind of like, I, I'm, I'm gonna get trash for this, but I, I just thought it was because I know everyone loves this fucking movie. But I just thought it was, I didn't laugh. I just didn't like

3 (2h 17m 34s):
You didn't laugh ever.

4 (2h 17m 35s):
Not really, no. I

3 (2h 17m 36s):
Laughed a few times thought Right. I looking to laugh was pretty funny. and I was looking to laugh. I went into it with a really good mood. You know, I was looking to laugh. I was looking to have a good

4 (2h 17m 42s):
Time. I was too. No, I I never go in wanting to not like a movie. I love movies, man. I, I think Greta Gerwig is crazy talented. I just didn't really, you know what else I couldn't fucking stand is what everyone's talking about. This movie, Saltburn. Do you see this

3 (2h 17m 56s):
Shit? No. What is that? It's

4 (2h 17m 57s):
Like talented Mr. Ripley for retards. I guess. Who,

3 (2h 18m 2s):
It's like

4 (2h 18m 2s):
If you fucking can't, if you don't like nuance and you need to see a dude's dick every three minutes, what

3 (2h 18m 7s):
Is it? Why

4 (2h 18m 8s):
It's Saltburn.

3 (2h 18m 9s):
What is this movie about? Have you heard of this, Jamie?

4 (2h 18m 11s):
It's, it's basically talented. Oh, I

3 (2h 18m 12s):
Heard of it. I haven't seen it.

4 (2h 18m 13s):
It's just not a nuanced movie. It's like so over the top. He's, look, the actors are very good. It and it looks beautiful. It's just, I think the script was like,

3 (2h 18m 21s):
I've never heard of this until right now. Oh,

4 (2h 18m 23s):
It's huge. It's a huge, huge

3 (2h 18m 24s):
Movie. Really? Yeah. I'm so outta the loop, dude. Yeah.

4 (2h 18m 28s):
I didn't, I didn't like it.

3 (2h 18m 29s):
I'm outta the cultural loop. Do you think you want to get into films? Is that why you're So,

4 (2h 18m 32s):
I love movies. Yeah. I'm working on Normand and I wrote a movie with Oh, great. With Noah Gardner Schwartz and Esther Steinberg. It's like a drinking buddies movie. It's fun. It's really funny. So hopefully we do something with that. Yeah. I'm trying to develop a TV show right now. I like, I like writing. Yeah. I like writing plots and, and dialogue and stuff. And I worked on one for a while with Dana Gould. We worked on an animated show for so fucking long and we couldn't sell it, but, you know. Hmm. But I loved it. I will make it someday. But yeah. I think this, this show I'm working on, I'm writing it with, do you know Mike Lawrence? A comedian

3 (2h 19m 6s):
I know the name.

4 (2h 19m 7s):
He's a fucking Beast.

3 (2h 19m 8s):
Maybe I do know

4 (2h 19m 9s):
Him. He was a roast battle champion back in the day. Okay. But he, he's a great standup too. But he we're, we're creating this show and it's, I think it's gonna be really cool. But yeah, I love movies. I, I like

3 (2h 19m 19s):
Pull up Mike Lawrence.

4 (2h 19m 20s):
I love standup the most, and that'll always be number one. But like, I, I want to try other avenues. You should. Yeah. and I

Him The lines, he's written for this. I'm like, fuck. They're beautiful.

3 (2h 19m 35s):
I like, I think everybody should like other stuff too. don don't think it's bad to like other stuff.

4 (2h 19m 40s):
I love sports. I love movies. I love, yeah. I love, I I have so many interests. But I mean, like I told you, like Golden Age Hollywood for, I love film noir. I love like old school movies and shit. Wouldn't

3 (2h 19m 52s):
You love to be a fucking a spider on the wall during like a James Cagney movie,

4 (2h 19m 56s):
Dude. Okay. Imagine what that was like for I, can I give you a book recommendation? Yeah. It's called, I think it's called Look Up the title exactly. It's called Lunches with Orson. I think it's about Orson Wells. It's literally Orson Wells shit. Talking every actor and director from the thirties to like the eighties. It's one of the funniest, but he's incredibly funny. Oh,

3 (2h 20m 15s):
He was brilliant. Because

4 (2h 20m 16s):
He I mean. Yeah, he

3 (2h 20m 17s):
Underperformed. It's

4 (2h 20m 18s):
Brilliant. I mean he underperformed.

3 (2h 20m 19s):
But

4 (2h 20m 20s):
Think about making Citizen Kane I

3 (2h 20m 21s):
Know, but he under underperformed. But, but that, that had always drove me crazy. Like, why, why did he go to sell wine after that? He was like, why, why did he become He was, he

4 (2h 20m 29s):
Was broke.

3 (2h 20m 30s):
I understand that. I understand. I I'm criticizing him for selling wine. I would do it too. My my criticism is like, you were the fucking man. You were War of Worlds. You know, you, you played that on the radio and freaked out half the country. Yeah. You were Citizen Kane. You know, he was going up against touch of evil William Randolph Hearst I mean he was essentially making a, a film that was about William Randolph Hurst. Yeah. William Randolph Hearst was very aware of it. So was everyone else powerful?

4 (2h 20m 56s):
A motherfucker too

3 (2h 20m 56s):
Scary. Powerful. So scary that marijuana is still a schedule one drug today because of William Randolph Hearst. That's a fact. Yeah. That's a fact. Yeah.

4 (2h 21m 4s):
William Randolph

3 (2h 21m 5s):
Hearst with Hearst Publications. They, they started printing. They're the ones that came up with this whole idea with, along with Harry Anslinger, that marijuana was a different drug. 'cause they, they were using hemp for everything. They were using hemp for clothes. Hemp makes a superior fabric. It makes a superior paper. It's way better for paper. It's way more sustainable. You could repopulate, if you have land and you're growing hemp on it, and you cut it all down, you grow it back in a year. If you have land where you're growing trees and you chop them down to make paper, you're fucked for 20, 30 years, man. You know? Wow. Wow. So different thing you're doing. And it's far superior. But for years they had used paper because, because they used to have a, there was a machine that came out called the Decorticator.

3 (2h 21m 51s):
And when the machine came out, it could effectively process hemp fiber with a machine. Wow. Because they used to use slaves. So when, when, when they used slaves, it wasn't as cost effective as cotton was. So then they start cotton picking. Eli Whitney comes out with the cotton gin. And then Kemp gets kind of put on the barn burner, back burner rather. 'cause it's not as easy to do. Like you gotta beat the fuck outta that stalk to break it down into fibers and weave those fibers. But if you do it's way superior. Wow. So this invention comes out called the decorticator. Pull up a decorticator so you can see what it is. So it's this big steel wheel with these like, like rods poking at these pokey points poling at. And they grind down the hemp fiber with this so that you can make superior paper so popular.

4 (2h 22m 35s):
It's a machine that does this. Yes. Wow.

3 (2h 22m 36s):
So popular mechanics or popular science on the front cover says hemp, the new billion dollar crop. So there's a competition with these people that have paper mills. So William Randolph Hearst not only has Hearst publications, he also has paper mills. And he has huge forests that he's chopping down to make paper for his newspaper. So instead of like switching everything over to hemp, he decides to demonize hemp. So he creates a new name. They create a new drug called marijuana. And marijuana was the name they used to use for a wild Mexican tobacco. And so they attribute this marijuana name to cannabis, which they've always used. 'cause it's hemp. It's the same thing that they've always used for.

4 (2h 23m 18s):
But he villainized it.

3 (2h 23m 18s):
They villainized it. Interesting. And then came out with Reefer Madness and those crazy hilarious propaganda movies. Hilarious.

4 (2h 23m 24s):
It makes you shoot up a school. They started writing

3 (2h 23m 26s):
Stories in Hearst Publications. Yeah. About blacks and Mexicans who are taking this marijuana and raping white women. So they put everybody into a fucking fever pitch, and then they outlawed it.

4 (2h 23m 38s):
Wow. Yeah. That is fucking nutty. And that

3 (2h 23m 40s):
It's 2024 and it's still schedule one.

4 (2h 23m 45s):
That is crazy. Crazy. I did not know that was hers.

3 (2h 23m 47s):
That's William Roff hers. So that's the guy that Orson Wells was up against.

4 (2h 23m 50s):
Incredible I mean, isn't that wild? Dude, I highly recommend it. It's like the amount of shit talking I mean everybody gets people, it's like basically a podcast, but in text. But like, people, so Richard Bird will like walk up to a mid-interview and he's like, can't you see I'm not talking to someone else. Like, he's like a psycho. But there's one part where like this guy Henry Jalan, like warships Orson Wells. Like, he's like, he's my hero. He's a Genius. So I guess he knew Peter Bogdanovich. And he goes, how about like, setting me up with him? I wrote a movie part that'd be Kill it for him. He's like, he's never gonna do it, but if you wanna meet him, he's staying at this hotel in New York. So, you know, he is like a fucking dude. He is like, every time he's at dinner, you know, he is got an eating problem. So like, I'll have one bite of this. And then he goes back to his room and orders six ribeyes and fucking gorgeous.

4 (2h 24m 32s):
But this guy goes to meet him and he's like literally knocking on his hotel room door to be in his movie. And there's a guy who's interviewing him in the book. They became buddies, but he knocks on his door and he goes, please be in my movie. And he goes, I've I'll never do a director's first film. Fuck you. I'll never do it. And he goes, you acted in your first film. And he goes like, he goes, no, I won't do it. And he goes, you, you love magic. Please. You know, please do this. I know You, you, you're an amateur magician. And he goes, never. And then he pauses and he's like, in this film, could I wear a cape? And he is like, yeah. And he's like, all right, I'll do it. That's all it took. He's a fucking weird dude. That's wild. But he, the amount of people, he shit talks in the book where he is like, fuck. He's like, fuck Woody Allen. And he'll just go on like a, a, a, but it's like everything he says, like, I love Woody Allen.

4 (2h 25m 15s):
But everything he says, I'm like, it's pretty fucking funny.

3 (2h 25m 18s):
What was he saying about Woody Allen?

4 (2h 25m 19s):
You know that his type of self deprecation is insincere and he can tell he loves himself. Ooh. He's like, I don't buy it. I think this guy loves himself. And like, whoa. He's like, anyone who's this, who's this self-deprecating, it's fucking bullshit. He loves himself the way he acts about himself. He, he a lot of stuff like that. He was shit on like,

3 (2h 25m 36s):
Ooh, I like it. Not only was he skeptical of Alan's approach to comedy, but he was vehemently averse to the Hungry Ego. It served. I hate Woody Allen. Physically. I dislike that kind of man. He said adding. Oh yes. I can hardly bear to talk to him. He has the chaplain disease. A lot of people hated chaplain. Oh, don't, don't say this about Chaplain. Well,

4 (2h 25m 58s):
You know a lot of people, I love Fatty Ruckle that the book about Fatty Arbuckle fucking hated chaplain. They, I think they ended up all right. But, but they were like, he was like, team Buster Kean. You

3 (2h 26m 6s):
Know, I don't know if you want to get on Team Fatty Arbuckle. Really?

4 (2h 26m 8s):
He didn't do it.

3 (2h 26m 9s):
He

4 (2h 26m 9s):
Didn't do it. He didn't do it. That's bullshit. Really? Yeah. He was a bullshit. He was framed. Yeah. What happened? Great book called Frame Up. I don't know exactly who framed

3 (2h 26m 16s):
How much of your He was life savings.

4 (2h 26m 18s):
He was exonerated.

3 (2h 26m 19s):
Was he? Yeah.

4 (2h 26m 20s):
Oh, he was? Yeah. It's, but that's the fucked up thing is we're talking about is if he did it. Oh,

3 (2h 26m 23s):
And this was 1930. What?

4 (2h 26m 25s):
Yeah. And you know what the fucked up part is? He had to do like four trials to get properly exonerated. So it ate up his life. And he died like a year later from a heart attack. Oh my God. But no, he was, dude I mean his career was, he created the pie throw. Think about how fucking crazy that is. Fatty Arbuckle invented the pie throw in the face.

3 (2h 26m 42s):
So what was wrong with Chaplain?

4 (2h 26m 44s):
I think they thought he

3 (2h 26m 45s):
Was Is Chaplain like Michael Jordan?

4 (2h 26m 47s):
No,

3 (2h 26m 47s):
I think, but seriously?

4 (2h 26m 48s):
No. I think

3 (2h 26m 49s):
If you think about like, you are that guy back then. You are the comedy guy. You're the fucking king of comedy.

4 (2h 26m 55s):
I don't know. I think he, I think obviously a Genius, but I think also like, think of the circles. Like he rolled with like Einstein.

3 (2h 27m 3s):
Right? But that's what I'm saying. Remember that speech that he gave in that movie? What was it, the Dictator? What was that movie that

4 (2h 27m 9s):
I think, I don don't know his movies that, but it pointed every night at the Cellar site that speech, speech. I know silently. There's

3 (2h 27m 14s):
A speech that he gave that is, it's relevant today. Like this speech about humanity. You know? Do you remember that?

4 (2h 27m 25s):
I don't.

3 (2h 27m 25s):
It's it's brilliant because

4 (2h 27m 27s):
It's been a while since I've watched his stuff. I mean, I, I I was more into Buster Kean personally. Well,

3 (2h 27m 31s):
Buster Keaton was amazing. Yeah. The stunts that that guy did. Holy broke

4 (2h 27m 35s):
His fucking neck

3 (2h 27m 35s):
Shit. Man. Broke his everything. He broke everything. Dude. That guy was doing wild shit. He was falling off buildings, going through awnings, like legitimately going through awnings.

4 (2h 27m 45s):
It's, it's insane. See

3 (2h 27m 46s):
If you can find that Charlie Chaplin speech. I wanna get to Buster Keaton. But there's a speech that he did. Do you know what I'm talking about, Jamie? I think this is it. I don't, lemme see what it looks like. Yeah, that's it. Let me hear this. So he's got the Hitler mustache. Yeah. He looks like Hitler. They've added the on Zimmer inception music to this. I'm

4 (2h 28m 4s):
Sorry,

15 (2h 28m 5s):
I don't want to be here

3 (2h 28m 6s):
A little more dramatic.

4 (2h 28m 7s):
That's

15 (2h 28m 7s):
Not my business. don don't want to rule or conquer anyone.

3 (2h 28m 11s):
Do you want me to keep the music? Yeah. Okay. No. Unless you can find one that doesn't have the music. Yeah. I feel like this is gonna make a different Yeah, it it, it definitely does.

4 (2h 28m 18s):
Yeah. Fatty Arbuckle is definitely framed though. And he, here it is. Oh, here. It's

3 (2h 28m 24s):
Fatty. We got your back from Beyond the Grave. All I have to say is fuck Fatty R Bundle.

4 (2h 28m 31s):
All I have to say, it's not a lot of laughs per minute on that speech. You know? That's

3 (2h 28m 34s):
A good point. I don't think that was a comedy. No, no,

4 (2h 28m 35s):
It wasn't. But it wasn't. But you know, what was, what

3 (2h 28m 38s):
Was the movie? The Greatest Dictator? The Great Dictator. What was the movie about

4 (2h 28m 43s):
Don? Don't know. I don't, I don't know.

3 (2h 28m 44s):
But that was pretty fucking good. It was good. and it was applicable today. and it gives you, it actually makes me sad sometimes.

4 (2h 28m 51s):
Yeah. I mean about machines. Holy

3 (2h 28m 52s):
Shit. But also, it's like, it was so obvious they were, they saw the writing on the wall.

4 (2h 28m 57s):
Yeah.

3 (2h 28m 58s):
So did Ted Kozinski, by the way.

4 (2h 28m 59s):
Yeah. He made a lot of good points when you take out the murder. He

3 (2h 29m 2s):
Did you take out all the bombings? He was saying the technology was gonna replace us. Yeah, he's right.

4 (2h 29m 7s):
That's the worst part when these monsters are like, man. But he obviously was a bright mind. That

3 (2h 29m 11s):
Was a satire. It says 1940 American anti-war. Political satire. Black comedy. Black comedy, written, directed, produced, scored, and scored by and starring Charlie Chaplin. Yeah. Following the tradition of many of his other films. Wow. He did everything man. Yeah. Of course. He was a dick. If you're doing all those things, you're Steve Jobs, but you're doing it in a movie. It's the same kind of animal. You know,

4 (2h 29m 33s):
I know, man, I like Louis, you know?

3 (2h 29m 35s):
Yeah. But he's different. Yeah.

4 (2h 29m 37s):
Lou's different. Lou does everything. He did everything on Louie.

3 (2h 29m 39s):
It's, I'm not saying that it's impossible to be like a cool person and also be all those things. It's just harder to do, you know? Yeah. I I get it. I just, I I I feel like guys like that probably don't have Charlie Chaplin as friends either. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Which I think is one of the critical things about our occupation, is that we're constantly surrounded by people like us. Like we're all kind of very, like-minded animals. And we have an appreciation for each other that is very different than most occu occupations. You know, I have like a reverence for like elite professional comedians. Like, I'll do anything for

4 (2h 30m 13s):
You. Me too. Yeah.

3 (2h 30m 14s):
That's how I feel. I feel like we're all in like a very sacred tribe of, there's only, like I always say, there's probably a thousand of us on planet Earth. Yeah. If we're really, if we're really being kind and generous and, and giving people like a great amount of curve. The reality is it's probably about 250 that I would want to hang out with that I would would say is are legit.

4 (2h 30m 36s):
It's, it's a, it's a fortunate, it's fortunate that we get to be part of this fraternity of comics who are like, we're so lucky, who are just very cool. And, and luckily most of the people that I've wanted to meet have always ended up being pretty cool. That's nice. And if they're not, look, there's, there's exceptions, but

3 (2h 30m 53s):
The exceptions I think existed in the TV world. Yeah. Honestly, the exceptions that I encountered and I don't wanna throw anybody under the bus, but there's some people that I like now that in the like 2001 I wanted to smack. Yeah. You know, there was some people that were just like really rude and shitty because there was the culture of being rude and shitty. That was almost encouraged. Like, when Phil Hartman came over to News Radio from Saturday Night Live, he had this very Bazar kind of anticipation of hostility from other cast members because he was very highly paid, obviously. He was like, I wasn't famous at all when I was on news radio. I was a nobody. I had been on one show called Hardball that was on Fox that bombed, it aired like six episodes.

3 (2h 31m 39s):
and I was the star of the show. That show got canceled. I got a development deal with NBC and all of a sudden, like, dude, I had never taken acting lessons. Right. They, they'd made me take, I had to get an acting coach. Like I was all of a sudden sitting next to Phil Hartman and I was 27. And

4 (2h 31m 54s):
He is brilliant. Yeah.

3 (2h 31m 55s):
He's brilliant. And I mean, like, I had never even thought about being an actor. Yeah. They just gave me money. And they said, do you want to act? I'm like, I, okay, what do I have to do? Like, to pretend I had no experience acting at all. and I did that show. And then, and then Phil Hartman had this, like, this like distrust of all the other people in the cast. And he had like this like real like arm length thing and I, I was always like, dude, you're Phil Hartman. Like, what are you talking about man? You're the man.

4 (2h 32m 19s):
Why do you think that was

3 (2h 32m 21s):
Saturday Night Live? He told

4 (2h 32m 22s):
Me, oh, they're trying to take your throats.

3 (2h 32m 24s):
Yes, dude. They were cutthroat. They were cutthroat.

4 (2h 32m 28s):
The pressure that show

3 (2h 32m 29s):
Back stabby ways. Like they would get your assistant fired. They would do weird shit. You, you had too. You were too close to one of the PAs. Fuck him. Get him outta here. Like, one of the other cast members would turn on one of the PAs that you had become friendly with.

4 (2h 32m 41s):
I've heard it's tough. He

3 (2h 32m 43s):
Was screaming at each other in the hallway. Fuck you. Stealing each other's jokes. It was creepy. It was creepy. And so Phil and I became friends and as we became friends, especially after the first season, 'cause the first season was like really long hours. They were trying to work out the show. And you know, I got to become, we got, we were hanging out 15, 16 hours a day. We're on the set all the time. And we get to become friends. And then he just sort of loosened up and they explained like, it's like a cutthroat, cutthroat environment over there.

4 (2h 33m 9s):
What a bummer. That that's what that does to you. 'cause I have obviously a great appreciation for Phil Hartman and like, I thought that was a great show and I mean shit. I was watching, I watched Jingle All the Way on the holidays. I fucking loved that movie that Arnold and Sinbad. And he was

3 (2h 33m 25s):
A great dude, man.

4 (2h 33m 26s):
He, he's a great, great comic actor.

3 (2h 33m 28s):
He was a funny dude too. He would do standup for the, he would do warmups for the crowd. Wow. Just fucking around. He would do like his, you know, he had an amazing Bill Clinton impression. He had a bunch of, but he had a like, routine. He was like thinking about doing standup, but

14 (2h 33m 42s):
He just was, had a terrible marriage. Poor guy. Terrible.

3 (2h 33m 47s):
Terrible. and I was the, the one guy on the show that was like, if get the fuck out like right now. Yeah.

4 (2h 33m 56s):
You were like, be honest with her. Tell her what you did. And I'm sure she'll take it really well. No, it

3 (2h 33m 59s):
Wasn't even that.

4 (2h 33m 60s):
No, I'm kidding. It was

3 (2h 34m 1s):
The opposite. It was just get away.

4 (2h 34m 2s):
She I know like, fucking around. She

3 (2h 34m 3s):
Would insult him at parties and stuff publicly. Like, like it was gross. It was scary. It was like, you know, there's sometimes that people are together and they fucking hate each other, but they, they for whatever reason do, do not leave each other. Yeah. and I don't know what it is. I don't know what it is. I don't understand it. But some people, they just, it's stuck in a

4 (2h 34m 25s):
Pattern. They sometimes they don't see how quite how bad it is. Right. Even, even when your friends point it out, you don't really see it till you get some distance from that relationship. But, well,

3 (2h 34m 32s):
It's also you, you learn from your parents. And if you're, you come from parents that beat the shit out of each other or scream at each other, throw things at each other. You get accustomed to thinking that's how relationships work, how they function. It's real sketchy. So

4 (2h 34m 49s):
Bad parenting is so fucking was was gonna tell you about Fatty Arbuckle. He fucking, his dad, his dad walked out.

3 (2h 34m 55s):
So what, what did Fatty, I'm sorry don, don't want to interrupt this part, but I need to know like, we, we should clarify. Like why, what did Fatty do?

4 (2h 35m 3s):
He was accused of raping and murdering a woman. He didn't do it.

3 (2h 35m 6s):
Murdering. Yeah. Wasn't it like a bottle broke inside of her or something?

4 (2h 35m 11s):
Yeah, that was the fake, fake. I forgot the exact, because I read this like years ago. But it's, what, what was it, Jamie?

3 (2h 35m 16s):
Do you, so how did she get murdered?

4 (2h 35m 20s):
She, it was a frame up. don don't know. don don't know who framed him, but someone framed him up and I

3 (2h 35m 24s):
Don't did what was the reason for,

4 (2h 35m 26s):
I don't remember. 'cause I've read this years ago. But it's, but he is innocent and he was exonerated, but if we could find it, that'd be awesome. I'm reading

5 (2h 35m 34s):
An article about it right now. It's, it's hard to find the

4 (2h 35m 36s):
Actual answers, but, but he was a dude who, his dad fucked him up 'cause his dad walked out on the family and like, I think the mother was like mental, but he was supposed to be raised by his father. So he took, his dad owned a hotel and they were like, take him, take a train to the hotel. Your dad, this is where your dad is. So he, his dad hears that he's fucking coming and he sold the hotel and disappeared. Oh my God. So then he just shows up and is like a fat kid, like 13. He's like, what do I do? And they're like, we can give you a job here. So he started working at the hotel at like 13. Oh my God. And then he joins, he finds out he's good by joining the talent show. And they're like, this guy's got an incredible voice. And then he was being silly and funny. They're like, this guy's like kind of a Genius.

4 (2h 36m 17s):
He starts becoming like an incredible touring performer. And of course the dad wants back in, oh

3 (2h 36m 23s):
God.

4 (2h 36m 23s):
Of course. Of course. Of course. Classic. But it's like, but yeah, I, I remember being like, his wife who he was divorced from was like, he's fucking innocent that like, they divorced on like not amazing terms. And she's like, he didn't do shit.

3 (2h 36m 36s):
So what did they frame him for? Was he becoming too big of a star or,

4 (2h 36m 40s):
I don't,

5 (2h 36m 41s):
I was trying to read through this. It does, it's to explaining the entire story in the Smithsonian article about it. And it's like, it's long. It's

4 (2h 36m 48s):
Yeah. I'm sorry for bringing this up if I don't have fully have a grasp on this, but it

3 (2h 36m 51s):
No, it's okay. but it's a brief that happens every day during my life. Okay. There's a party having, where should we start here? Right. Just right up here I think. Okay. According to Arbuckle Fish, Bach arranged everything from the rooms to the guests of the liquor, despite Prohibition. And on Labor Day, September 5th, 1920 1, 19 21, Arbuckle awoke to find that he had many uninvited guests. He was still walking around in his pajamas, bathrobe and slippers when he saw Delmont and rap and expressed concern that their reputations might alert police to the gin party in Los Angeles, Delmont was known as a madam and Blackmailer rap had made some a something of a name for herself as a model clothing designer, aspiring actress and party girl.

3 (2h 37m 41s):
Oh. Just regular LA under 30 woman. But the food and booze were flowing by then the music was playing. And Arbuckle was soon, no longer focused on his exhausting work schedule. The burns on his backside or just who all the guests were. What happened in the ensuing hours would play out on the front pages of William Randolph Hearst. There you go again. Yeah. That motherfucker. National chain of newspapers in lured headlines before our buckle had a chance to tell his side of the story. Virginia rappers 25 years old when she arrived at the St. Francis Hospital in San Francisco for a Labor Day weekend party hotel. Excuse me, did I say hospital? St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco for a Labor Day weekend party.

3 (2h 38m 23s):
Maud Delmont Delmon soon painted a sinister portrait of the happy Go go-Lucky Portly Prince of Silent film. This is what she told police after Arbuckle and Rob had a few drinks together, he pulled her actress into an adjoining room saying, I've waited for you five years and now I've got you. After a half hour or so, Del Mall heard raps screaming. So she knocked on and then kicked at the locked door. After delay, Arbuckle came to the door in his pajamas wearing rap's, hat cocked at an angle and smiling his foolish screen smile behind him. Rap was sprawled on the bed. Moaning.

3 (2h 39m 4s):
Arbuckle did it. The actress said, according to Delmont, rap was taken to another room. A doctor was summer and he attended to her. He stayed, this might take forever for me to read this.

5 (2h 39m 13s):
Yeah. So this was a, this was a, she, she died. That's why I was like leaving it there. She

3 (2h 39m 16s):
Died. She died September 9th of a ruptured bladder and her So what actually happened though?

4 (2h 39m 22s):
I don't know. Then

5 (2h 39m 23s):
I went to the newspapers and then he turned himself in. Right. And that's where I was like, I think we, this it's getting way too long. Right. But

3 (2h 39m 30s):
But like, what was the actual story?

5 (2h 39m 32s):
Charges with manslaughter. That's why don don't

3 (2h 39m 33s):
Know exactly. He's charged. We

4 (2h 39m 34s):
Mans Uck in a hole here trying to chase get some, I think they were trying to blackmail him.

3 (2h 39m 39s):
Hmm. We have, okay, hold on a second. There's the matter of the telegrams that she sent to attorneys in both San Diego and Los Angeles. We have Roscoe Arbuckle in a hole here. Chance to make some money out of him. Oh, big. Yeah. Oh, okay. They were trying to railroad him.

4 (2h 39m 56s):
He was making a million a year in 21. That's a lot of ch What is that? Yeah. So they were trying to fucking

3 (2h 40m 2s):
A million a year in 1921. What was that? Money? I know. What's that today?

4 (2h 40m 6s):
That's gotta be like,

3 (2h 40m 7s):
Let's guess the doctor that the, the hotel testified. She had told him Arbuckle did not try to sexually assault her, but the prosecutor got the point dismissed as hearsay. Whoa, there

4 (2h 40m 20s):
We go.

3 (2h 40m 20s):
Yeah. Whoa.

4 (2h 40m 21s):
I forgot this specific.

3 (2h 40m 22s):
So what happened to her? It's

4 (2h 40m 23s):
Been a while. I, I don't know. Her

3 (2h 40m 25s):
Bladder rupture.

5 (2h 40m 26s):
No marks of violence on the body. No signs of girl been attacked in any way.

3 (2h 40m 29s):
Oh. So she might have just had like a said

5 (2h 40m 31s):
She a chronic bladder condition according to this.

3 (2h 40m 33s):
Oh, so she might have just died. Yeah. Fatty Uck was making a million dollars. Before we go any further. Yeah, let's find out what A million dollars?

4 (2h 40m 41s):
I'm guessing at least 20.

3 (2h 40m 43s):
I'm gonna guess more. Maybe

4 (2h 40m 44s):
25, 30.

3 (2h 40m 45s):
I'd say 50 million. Really?

4 (2h 40m 46s):
Maybe. Yeah.

3 (2h 40m 47s):
A million dollars in 19 20, 21 in, in 2024 money.

4 (2h 40m 51s):
You're probably right.

3 (2h 40m 52s):
I say it's 50 million. 'cause inflation is stupid.

5 (2h 40m 57s):
It says it's about 15.8 million. That's

3 (2h 40m 60s):
It.

4 (2h 40m 60s):
Damn. Damn. They're both

3 (2h 41m 1s):
Off. So he was just only minor balling for a while. Dude. Were balling way harder than him.

5 (2h 41m 7s):
I mean that depression, his money would've went down and then it started going back up.

4 (2h 41m 11s):
Oh, okay.

3 (2h 41m 11s):
From the depression? Yeah.

5 (2h 41m 13s):
After the thirties. That million he had in 1921 would've only been worth 750 K. Oh wow. 1932. So 10 years later if he just let it sit, I guess then it went up. Yeah.

4 (2h 41m 23s):
He was a party animal. But he wasn't, he wasn't a rapist

3 (2h 41m 26s):
Or murderer. No. So she just had a disease. Yeah. And she died of that disease and they just had him for money. Wow.

4 (2h 41m 33s):
Dark shit. It's a book's called Frame Up. It's really good. It's hard to find. He

5 (2h 41m 36s):
Was acquitted the first trial and then they tried to get him again. Jury deadlocked, third trial Ruck was allowed to call witnesses for the first time.

3 (2h 41m 45s):
Wow.

4 (2h 41m 47s):
So he got off and it's, and he, he made a comeback, but he died like a year after

3 (2h 41m 51s):
The Charlie Chaplin thing. And that thing makes me say it's always been fucked. Yeah. I mean it's almost kind of always been fucked. It's,

4 (2h 41m 57s):
This is the best time for comedians, dude. 'cause we like, it's not as, at least with comics, it's like more, as you said, it's more fraternal. I mean, we're like, we're kind of all cool. And there's so much room now. There's

3 (2h 42m 9s):
So

4 (2h 42m 10s):
Much. There's like two of them back then, dude.

3 (2h 42m 11s):
The people that are complaining about other comics now, it's like, listen, figure it out. Figure out your own shit. Figure it out. Stop, stop complaining about other out.

4 (2h 42m 19s):
Twitter's not your journal. Show the fuck out. And, and

3 (2h 42m 21s):
Neither is Instagram. Stop. Yeah. Stop being stupid. You just, you just,

4 (2h 42m 25s):
Just make it funny. If you're gonna do that

3 (2h 42m 26s):
Shit. Yeah. Just be better than what you are. Figure it out. Or don't Or stop doing it. Sell

4 (2h 42m 30s):
Shoes. I remember Iel said that to me once. I was complaining years ago and he goes get maybe he said to someone else actually, he goes, but he goes get funny. Or, I like

3 (2h 42m 37s):
How he said it was at you and then I was like, nah,

4 (2h 42m 39s):
I remember it. Someone else but I don wanna use his name 'cause he's a great comic. So I don't wanna put don don't wanna put it on him. But, but he didn't mean it like, you're not funny. Right. He meant it like, well, you get better, you better get funnier. Yeah. Because what else can you do? There's nothing else can do. That's all that's in your control is Yeah. Try to be fucking funny

3 (2h 42m 53s):
And all the other things that are out of your control. The more attention that you spend on them, the less attention you will have towards the thing that you can control. It's that simple. It's like an allocation of resources issue. You can't, you can't allocate resources to things that are completely unproductive and in fact counterproductive. They fuck with you psychologically. You get up in the middle of the night, you, you go to pee, you think about it, you're like, fuck. And then you can't go back to sleep.

4 (2h 43m 15s):
You grind your teeth. Yeah. Now you have to get a fucking dental procedure.

3 (2h 43m 18s):
Not good man. Don't be involved in, in unnecessary conflict. It's just not good for you. It's not good for anybody. It's not good for that person. It's not good for you. It's not good for the people that you're gonna encounter after the conflict. It's not good for the people they encounter after the conflict. There's a butterfly effect that happens with stuff like that. It's pointless.

4 (2h 43m 35s):
And the business is gonna keep changing. Yeah. That's the thing is like, this is not what it was 20 years ago. In 10 years it's gonna be different. Yeah. Like think about how big I think about this all the time. Comedy Central was the fucking king.

3 (2h 43m 45s):
They're useless now. They're useless. It's also what, what's happening now is like a very organic merging of like, you know, for a lack of a better word, artists. 'cause we are artists, but we're, we're art. It's like a calling it comic and artist. It's almost like for us it's like, shut the fuck up. It's

4 (2h 44m 5s):
Not, it's

3 (2h 44m 5s):
It is art, but it's like, it's also don't get go goofy

4 (2h 44m 9s):
With me. We're not supposed to be the pretentious ones. Right. and it sounds pretentious. It's like it

3 (2h 44m 12s):
Does sound pretentious. We,

4 (2h 44m 13s):
We were looked down upon at the award shows. Yeah. 'cause they are like, we're artists.

3 (2h 44m 18s):
I say we should look down upon the award shows. When I saw Joe Coy do that award show, I didn't get upset that Joe Coy didn't, his jokes didn't hit. I got upset that he was willing to do it. Joe Co You sell out arenas. Yeah. Don't do that terrible thing.

4 (2h 44m 30s):
But you want, you always wanna be a part of that club.

3 (2h 44m 32s):
Don't, don't do it. It's First of all it. I think you to go handicap. You're doing it with 10 days notice. What kind of goofy

4 (2h 44m 38s):
That you shouldn't have done. What

3 (2h 44m 39s):
Kind of goofy ass fucking organizers hire top talent? No one wants to do it. Nobody wants to do it more should day.

4 (2h 44m 45s):
To Kevin Hart where they were like you, you made, you said the word gay, gay jokes

3 (2h 44m 47s):
In the

4 (2h 44m 48s):
Nineties. And and guess what You fucking awarded Roman Polanski like man of the year, 15 years ago. Accused of rape. Yeah. So not accused. He did it. Well,

3 (2h 44m 57s):
Will Smith's slaps Chris Rock on stage and then they give him a standing ovation. Disgusting.

4 (2h 45m 2s):
The

3 (2h 45m 2s):
Whole thing's ridiculous. They're ridiculous people. The point is it fucking shun Award shows

4 (2h 45m 8s):
For anytime someone calls us, US artists. I think of a comic asking an audience member, are you taking a poop or a pee as they're walking into the bathroom? We're not artists.

3 (2h 45m 15s):
But the problem is the word art has been hijacked by douche bags. Yeah. We are artists, but we're artists in the sense that we create things. Everybody who creates things is an artist. Just like a chef is an artist. I bet chefs probably the pretentious ones will refer to themselves as artists. The fucking down to earth dudes tell

4 (2h 45m 32s):
You are chef. Those are my favorite chefs. So the ones exactly Of course, the the fucking fine dining chefs. You're like, all dude, gimme something I can that will fill me up. Just,

3 (2h 45m 39s):
You know, there's a fine line where you can cross over into pretentious land.

4 (2h 45m 44s):
I think the problem is we got into this to be funny and some people lose sight of that and they start pandering. Like, I can tell when a comic stops fucking touring. I can tell when your act, you stop taking it through Missouri. You gotta take it through every fucking state. You gotta you gotta, you gotta make this, I don't wanna use the word marketable, but you gotta make this palatable for the country. Yeah. There's a reason if I do a joke about New York, it's for everybody. Yeah. If I do a joke about riding the subway, it's hitting in Kansas City because it has to. Otherwise you were working for your small bubble. And when, when I see comics put out specials, I can be like, this dude only worked it out in LA or New York or whatever. And you need the road. 'cause the second you stop relating or remembering what got you into this for the right reason, you're doing it for the wrong reason.

4 (2h 46m 27s):
You

3 (2h 46m 27s):
Also have to remember when you were first starting out, the idea of being on the road, headlining a comedy club would be the craziest fucking dream you could ever imagine. Yeah. I don't have to go to my day job anymore. Now I get to fly Yeah. To Cincinnati and go do standup comedy to packed crowds. Two shows on fri Half packed, half packed, half packed. Yeah. Pretty good crowds.

4 (2h 46m 51s):
Yeah. Go bananas

3 (2h 46m 53s):
Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday sometimes. Yeah. It's a dream. It's the ultimate dream because the, the idea of being a professional seems so impossible to achieve.

4 (2h 47m 1s):
I just, yeah. I, it, it felt amazing. And, and I romanticized the road as I still do. Like it was a different thing. It was like, thank God I can do this to now I'm like, gotta hone it.

3 (2h 47m 10s):
Well that was the thing about Jenny. You know, when I was first doing the road, one of the things that I would always ask I was like, who's the biggest douche bag that you had to take?

4 (2h 47m 19s):
I asked that too. and it

3 (2h 47m 20s):
Was always Jenny. He just hated it. He hated being on the road. He was

4 (2h 47m 24s):
He was a douche to people.

3 (2h 47m 24s):
Yeah. Unfortunately. It's just, he was very uncomfortable. Like obviously he's, he

4 (2h 47m 29s):
Wanted to be a bigger movie star. Right. He

3 (2h 47m 30s):
Wanted to be a movie star. He

4 (2h 47m 31s):
Was a great actor.

3 (2h 47m 32s):
Well, he was really good in the Mask and he great movie, but he really, what he was was a great standup. Yeah. But great stems, standups weren't appreciated the way they are now. If Jenny was alive today, he'd be doing arenas, you know. Yeah. I mean that's what would be going on. He would be like one of the biggest standup comics alive. But during his time, no one did anything other than comedy clubs. There's a few guys, like Sam Kinison used to do like Great Wood Center for the Performing Arts. Rodney did that. Bill Cosby did that. But for the most part, standup comics did comedy clubs and that's it, including Jenny. And he just felt like a failure when he was on the road headlining these clubs.

4 (2h 48m 8s):
What a, what a sad thing.

3 (2h 48m 9s):
It's crazy. It's crazy. They all wanted the Golden Egg. And the Golden Egg was what Roseanne got or what Tim Allen got. It was a sitcom.

4 (2h 48m 17s):
That generation doesn't get it. I did Letterman show on Netflix and he was like baffled by me putting out YouTube specials. He and, and not in a way that he was so kind. I mean he was such a nice guy. But I remember he kept asking be like, I don't get how you make money off this. Well I make the money off touring. But he's like, well you gotta understand when I did this shit, it was all about the sitcom. That was the money. Yeah. You know, so it's as, as we said, the industry's changing, like a lot of really funny comics were passed over by these industry streamers. Exactly. And then did their own thing. And then at a certain point they'll find you. The point is to not get bitter. And you look at a guy like Shane Gillis and did he get bitter? No. He stayed fucking funny.

3 (2h 48m 53s):
He got funnier. of course.

4 (2h 48m 55s):
He

3 (2h 48m 55s):
Even got better when, when, when he got canceled. It's just, there's a different world now where there's no gatekeepers anymore. Yeah. The gatekeepers, they still exist. If you want to participate, if you want to do the Comedy Central thing, they still exist. Yeah. You know, HBO still makes specials. You can do it that way if you choose to. But the gatekeepers of real mass media are now non-existent. It's all just YouTube. So then you have to be careful with what are YouTube's, whatever, whatever YouTube's turns of services are, because some of them get real squirrely and you can get banned.

4 (2h 49m 26s):
The goal post is moving in. It's

3 (2h 49m 28s):
Moving, it's

4 (2h 49m 28s):
Moving. They're changing the rules. Like if you make a Nazi joke now they're like, did you say the word Nazi? You're like, I was condemning Nazis. Yeah, I was. That was satirical. But you said the word Nazi in some fucking algorithm that can't detect sarcasm is like timeout. Yep.

3 (2h 49m 40s):
Yep.

4 (2h 49m 41s):
Not good. Yeah.

3 (2h 49m 42s):
Not good. It's also, it's clumsy, but it's also, you know, they're fucking, you're dealing with an enormous number of human beings. You're exactly. You're managing at scale. That's impossible to really even wrap our stupid little heads around the amount of humans that are like just, but which really leads us back to that guy's text message getting intercepted. Like, are they just doing that with everything? 'cause it appears they are. If they're doing that in a Snapchat message group, which is supposed to be encrypted and they find the word, I'm gonna blow up this plane. Terrorist, whatever, ISIS, Taliban, whatever it is, they see those words. If those words like, if they get flagged, that means nothing is private.

3 (2h 50m 22s):
Also you have to recognize, you want, oh, I want everybody to be safe. Okay. Right. But those are human beings. Yeah. Just like you, just like you having the kind of power that it means to have to access everyone's text messages. That's nuts. That's a crazy power. And if you're the guy, I mean, I don't care how many checks and balances there are, there's gotta be somebody at the end of that stream that could just read and see all your dick pics. There's somebody at the end of that stream take

4 (2h 50m 47s):
Good, good angles. That's a secret. Yeah.

3 (2h 50m 49s):
Just

4 (2h 50m 49s):
Somebody that's fluff

3 (2h 50m 50s):
It up sees every time you swipe. Right. Yeah. There's somebody that sees it all great. Yeah. They see everything. And that is probably inevitable with, with the bottleneck of technology being interconnectivity. Right. And the, the, the other problem with that is money. Because if the, if money is just ones and zeros, and it gets to the point where when you get to quantum computing where any sort of encryption is really preposterous and then people have commercial grade quantum computing in their house and you could kind of like, there's no code that can't be cracked. There's no Bitcoin that can't be stolen. And then what happens? Like what happens then? Like how do you, how do you, how do you have money?

4 (2h 51m 28s):
How can you trust anything? How do

3 (2h 51m 29s):
You could trust anything. Yeah. How do we trust anything now when these deep, I'm in so many ads for products that I'm definitely not selling. That's hilarious. I mean so many of 'em man. People send 'em to me all the time. Deep fakes and shit. Total deep fakes.

4 (2h 51m 43s):
But how can you trust not just machines, but any, I remember reading about Leonard Cohen, his manager stole his $5 million retirement fund. Yeah. That's why he was touring in his seventies. Happens.

3 (2h 51m 53s):
Yeah. Happens all the time.

4 (2h 51m 55s):
Machines, people I mean like Yep. With money and your information, you're putting a lot of trust in either

3 (2h 52m 0s):
Yeah. You, you're putting a lot of trust in a lot of different things. But also like, I'm not a communist and I'm not a socialist and I'm definitely pro-list, but I envision a future where all of these things where I think these mechanisms that we have used to achieve power and influence and what will stores had we talked about yesterday, the status, game status, all of these things will eventually lead us to some point in the future where I mean it might, we we we, we could get to a point where any idea of competition that we're having right now, what, what human beings enjoy right now all goes away.

3 (2h 52m 50s):
And we all become a part of some network. Some network that changes what it means to be a human being. Like human beings stop being human. I think we're, we're not that far away from that. And if you look at what we are today versus what Fatty Arbuckle was, imagine you being friends with Fatty Arbuckle and back in the day and William Randolph Hearst, but also having a YouTube channel. You are like, look, William Randolph Hearst a piece of shit. Like this is what he did about marijuana. This is what he did about this, this he did about this is what he did to fatty Arbuckle. This is why they did it to fatty. And this is what actually happened. This is what a woman had a chronic bladder con infection and you know, it could be like a big thing. Yeah. You know, it could be like something everybody talks about and it gets the ruling overturned.

3 (2h 53m 31s):
But back then you had no chance. As things move on, it'd be more of that.

4 (2h 53m 36s):
Well, there's pluses and minuses to more people having voices. Right. I mean a lot of

3 (2h 53m 40s):
Minuses.

4 (2h 53m 41s):
A lot of minuses.

3 (2h 53m 43s):
There's a lot of crazy people out there. There's a lot of legitimately schizophrenic, insane people, aggressive people, sad people like abused people. People that came from terrible childhoods. People that came from, you know, every stretch of the world and they're all, all they have to do is learn English and they're just interfacing with you. And they get the worst roll of dice that's available on planet earth. Yeah. And now, you know, they've killed three people by the time they're 15. You know, like, then now they're online. Yeah. And that's, that's real too.

4 (2h 54m 17s):
Yeah. It I mean. It's, that's the thing, you get into this for acceptance, right. You get into standup 'cause you like, you want to maybe don don't know, maybe you're in your mind. You're like, this wasn't able to be said in my h household, so now I'll, I'll in my mind I'm telling the truth on stage. I'm being funny. I'm making strangers laugh. And you're, you're doing this for acceptance. There was rejection before this. Now it's like the amount of people who could flood your fucking timeline when you make a misstep. Right. It can be overwhelming. I mean, I think of that guy John Ronson all the time. Right. The yeah. So you've been publicly shamed guy. I mean people know you should know what you do when you try to fucking destroy a person. but it is exciting. A lot of people's, what they use social media for is to complain and then to try to bury a person.

3 (2h 55m 2s):
Yeah.

4 (2h 55m 3s):
And it's fucking weird.

3 (2h 55m 5s):
It's just a dumb thing to do. and I think the best thing to do if you're like a public person like yourself, is just like, never engage in that. And also don't read the comments. Yeah. That's my advice. My advice is always never engage. Don't read the comments. If you wanna post something, you feel something about something, you wanna say something about something, that's fine. But don't be upset about people's response to it. And don't Exactly.

4 (2h 55m 25s):
Don't. It's part of the game. We put ourselves out there where

3 (2h 55m 28s):
You're, but it also doesn't mean you have to fucking, while they're throwing fastballs, you have to run across the pitcher and get hit in the head. You don't have to actually go out on the field like it is part of the game. Yeah. But you don't have to do that part. That part is not necessary. It's also not good. It's not smart. It's not a good allocation of resources. It's not good psychological. Right. It's not good for the fans either. 'cause if you actually, what if they're just having a bad day, man, and they're fucking 18. They lash out at Sam, you know, or they lash out at at Normand. They'll lash out at Ari. They did, they're not, they're not really bad people, but they're writing something and it's permanent. It's out there forever. And they, they said some rude shit and they're trying to get a response. And then you come back with the most scathing response and then you show pictures of their mom and them and their fat belly and you shit all over 'em online.

3 (2h 56m 13s):
Yeah. That

4 (2h 56m 14s):
Is, this is going far though, right?

3 (2h 56m 16s):
Yeah. But, but yeah, we've all known people who've done that. Right. Sure. And it's just not wise. It's not good. I've done it before. I've, I've experienced that thing of like, fuck You don, fuck you, you're a fucking loser. No benefit. We've no benefit.

4 (2h 56m 29s):
Last message Bob s ever sent me, I engaged with a fucking psych and he goes, Hey, it's Uncle Bob here. You, you're too good a guy to be doing this. and I like, beautiful. All right. P Bob. Sweet guy.

3 (2h 56m 39s):
That's nice. He is a very sweet guy. He he is a hard one. He was a hard one.

4 (2h 56m 43s):
I didn't know him well. We would just becoming friends when he passed away. So I would fun.

3 (2h 56m 45s):
Became fun. I became friends with him at the store. Yeah. He was such a sweet guy. He was always a nice guy. Always a nice guy. Always like real, like genuinely warm. Like he come around. Everybody liked that.

4 (2h 56m 53s):
We need that. Yeah. He's

3 (2h 56m 55s):
People,

4 (2h 56m 55s):
People who bring positive energy to work are fucking so important.

3 (2h 56m 60s):
I've never met anybody who didn't like Saggot. Yeah. He's always nice. You know, there's like a few guys where don don't know anybody who doesn't like him.

4 (2h 57m 7s):
Got it. There's something. Bobby

3 (2h 57m 9s):
Lee's one of those. Yeah. You don't like Bobby Lee. don don't like you.

4 (2h 57m 12s):
Bobby is

3 (2h 57m 13s):
Don don't like you if you don't like Bobby. Like,

4 (2h 57m 14s):
Is this safe to say He's maybe the best podcast guest ever.

3 (2h 57m 19s):
It's like, he's

4 (2h 57m 19s):
Amazing. It's insane. The the energy he brings. He's so funny. I've

3 (2h 57m 23s):
Known Bobby for 30 years.

4 (2h 57m 25s):
Damn. I've known him long. But I love him

3 (2h 57m 27s):
Close to it. It's probably close to 30 years.

4 (2h 57m 29s):
I brought a friend of mine when he did our podcast. It was an Asian guy I used to live with. And he like, worships Bobby. And Bobby just fucked with him the whole day. and it, my friend Dory, it was so satisfying for him. He's like, Bobby's like, stop talking to me. Fuck you. And and it was like, he was like, that was like the best day of my life.

3 (2h 57m 46s):
He's such a good guy too because he is like so honest about all of his like weirdness. Yeah. His flaws. And like, you know how he thinks about himself and so vulnerable.

4 (2h 57m 55s):
Yeah.

3 (2h 57m 55s):
I love him. He's also very funny man. And he's getting ready to do a special finally,

4 (2h 57m 59s):
I've, I actually, I think it was from when he was on your podcast, I text him, I was like, you better put out a fucking special dude. And and he goes, yeah, why? and I said, you know why? Because you're fucking hilarious and because you deserve it. You deserve to release something and and to move on and to suffer a little bit. He's

3 (2h 58m 17s):
A much better comic than people know in terms of like the amount of tickets he sells. Bobby Lee should be doing arenas and he just did an arena with Bur and Tom. He just did the MM in

4 (2h 58m 27s):
Vegas. Yeah. But it's, it's 'cause he's not releasing it. So now that's it's

3 (2h 58m 30s):
Alling. It's all, it's yeah. It's like his level's very high. There's a few of those guys out there. They're levels very, very high. They just don't have a lot of stuff out there.

4 (2h 58m 36s):
He, he's told me he's scared to, to eat the shit, to build a new hour. And lemme tell you like, I'm thinking when I burn this next one, I am dreading the shit out of this. Like, I, I hate starting from scratch.

3 (2h 58m 47s):
Yeah, man. Just gotta embrace it. Embrace don't embrace it. Suck. It's fun. Get in there. Get

4 (2h 58m 51s):
In there. It's like jumping in a cold ass pool. Yeah. I fucking hate it, but I gotta jump in the pool.

3 (2h 58m 57s):
Yeah. Do it every day. Yeah. Yeah. Just, just embrace the suck. That's all it is. It's all, there's a few of those guys out there that's just, they just need a little gentle nudge to get into the water. And then Bobby Lee will have a new hour in no time because

4 (2h 59m 11s):
He'll have to,

3 (2h 59m 11s):
And it'll be better than his hour before because it'll be more representative of how he feels about things right now. And

4 (2h 59m 17s):
His life is interesting.

3 (2h 59m 18s):
Yes. He's fascinating.

4 (2h 59m 20s):
And he's too self-loathing. I'm sorry Bobby, I, you, you gotta love yourself a little more because you, he's loved that guy.

3 (2h 59m 26s):
He is loved but he needs friends around him. And the problem with a lot of us is that we can become islands. I always describe comedians as islands or tribe members. Yeah. And there's a few of those islands out there that like only have like one opening act that they take with them. They only do theaters and they travel around and every now and then they get to be around comics like us. Like, hey, so let's luck at the club. You know, it's weird, it's, there's a few of those guys, don don't wanna name names, but there's a few of those guys. don don't think it's healthy. don don't think it's a healthy existence. That's

4 (2h 59m 53s):
Literally why I'm still calling it the seller. 'cause I just want see the people and I love Liz, the manager and I love. I

3 (2h 59m 58s):
Can't wait to show you the club. I can't wait to

4 (3h 0m 0s):
Take you the club can

3 (3h 0m 1s):
To do it because we set it up as, as best we could to facilitate all that to make it so that it's like the best environment for comics to hang the best environment to, for comics to work. Everything's set up. The staff is magnificent. Everybody's

4 (3h 0m 14s):
Cool as fucked. But great stuff.

3 (3h 0m 15s):
It's great man. It's, it's amazing. It's, but it's also entirely set up for the comics. Un entirely. There's not one decision that ever gets made that's to the detriment of the show or the comics feelings.

4 (3h 0m 27s):
Most comedy clubs that were made by a comic are often like a comic who quit and has got some bitterness and you're not that guy. So you made it the right way is what I've heard.

3 (3h 0m 37s):
You know. Well, you know, the best aspects of the store were beautiful and there's so much to the store that the mothership will never be able to have because the store had this history, this insane history and this legacy to it of Kinison and Pryor. And so, and Hicks started there. Hicks was a doorman there, there was so many great, so cool, great, great great comics that came out of that place. And so it was, it's, you know, Mitzi, so this is the reason why I have her on my wall. The reason why, why we named the bar Mitzi's. It's like, so we took her philosophy and we just threw a Spotify budget at it.

4 (3h 1m 13s):
I

3 (3h 1m 13s):
Love it. Let, let's go ham. Let's do something good for the community of comedy and create what Louis calls it, the Alamo.

4 (3h 1m 20s):
I love it.

3 (3h 1m 21s):
Yeah. He said, yeah. It's like that's, that's the thought behind it. It's like, let's do it. Like if I can do this and like I can do this and I don't feel any pressure, it doesn't bother me at all. I mean I feel pressure like with like staff stuff and shit's, this is happening. There's something wrong with the AC unit. There's a little bit of that every now and then, but it's not bad. But it's not financial pressure, which is the most intolerable pressure when you don't think you can pay your bills. And you're worried, especially if you're a father, you're like, shit. So if that pressure is alleviated, then you can do something that you really want to do. and I'm like, I wanna really do it like, like fucking Disneyland for comics. I wanna set it up so that it's the best environment ever for people to be able to develop and create.

3 (3h 2m 3s):
And even people starting out like the doorman and the door people, the door women, they're all auditioned by ott. So t he auditions I mean he sees their act. So they're all comics.

4 (3h 2m 15s):
He cares. Yeah. Yeah.

3 (3h 2m 16s):
And they get to see Shane Gillis go up, you know, they, they get to see Howie Mandel stopped by and Jim Gaffigan stopped by and Dave Atel Doucette. And the shows that I'm doing on like Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, it's fucking Ron Whites on there. Brian Simpson. It's crazy. Tony Hinchcliffe I mean These are murderous shows. They're murderous shows. It's awesome. And so these people get to see how we're writing and how we're coming up with new shit and how we change things up. And it's like this, you get an education that we got at the store. We all got that at the store from watching, you know, the guys who were there before us, you know the, the big names when I was 27 and I first came to the store and I'd see Damon Wayins go up and Eddie Griffin go up Beast.

4 (3h 2m 58s):
Right. Beast was weigh-ins in his promised killer.

3 (3h 2m 60s):
Right. Was a beast. Underappreciated man. The last stand, Damon Wayins is HBO special.

4 (3h 3m 6s):
Funniest. That's when he went to the crowd. Right

3 (3h 3m 8s):
When he threw the mic down he said he was quitting. Yeah. That guy is a real professional. Yeah. In the sense of that. He films every one of his shows. He has since the nineties. He sets up his own video camera on a tripod and he films every one of his shows, workout shows any show. And he is not scared of silence. Love. I love that. That fucking, I used to watch him go up when I was, I was a kid, First of all, I was a fan of his from In Living Color Home, the clown. I was a fan of his standup. Yeah. I'd seen him on the Robert Townsend thing. Remember Robert Townsend had those standup shows?

4 (3h 3m 41s):
Of course. Hilarious guy.

3 (3h 3m 41s):
So I was a fan of his already. And then I got to see him work out, like at the store in front of like fucking 30, 50 people, you know, small ass or crowds. And he just didn't give a fuck. He just would find a bit, he would find where it is. He'd, he'd like search around for it. Didn't worry at all about the dead spots. Didn't worry at all. Just he's like, that's my workout

4 (3h 4m 4s):
Role when a comic has earned that. It's a beautiful thing. Oh,

3 (3h 4m 7s):
It's a beautiful thing. But it's also, the store was low pressure back then. Like the way you were describing the seller where you're going on after murders. It's very difficult.

4 (3h 4m 14s):
It's tough. Even the young comics there are so good. There's young comics. There's like a young comic named Maddie Wiener. She's so funny. There's Young Co. Daniel Simonson's. So funny. All these comics, they're like hungry. They're just murderers. And so then you're following them with your new shit and you're like, all right. So I, so I was on a flight coming back here and they're like, what are you, what are you doing? They can sniff the new on you. Yeah. So, so I, I do most of my work on the, what I like to do is like an hour of good jokes and then I'm like, alright guys, now I'm doing 10 minutes of brand new shit and

3 (3h 4m 45s):
Oh you do at the end

4 (3h 4m 45s):
I'll preface it. Yeah. Interesting. I like to, I like to just say, here's my, 'cause sometimes it, and then I get the confidence to just work it in. Yeah. If

3 (3h 4m 52s):
It's killing, you're already killing.

4 (3h 4m 53s):
Yeah. So I get the con and then I'll just, I'll, I'll mold it in once it's, once I get that confidence that it's hitting. Right. But yeah, man, the seller is tough. I, I remember starting there, like the guys who were really murdering, you know, obviously when Rock would drop in or like Louie or, or Colin Quinn and David Tell were kind of the godfathers of the seller. They were, you know, always had new shit. They were always interesting. Colin

3 (3h 5m 16s):
Quinn's another guy, crim criminally underappreciated.

4 (3h 5m 20s):
He really is. and don don't know why. 'cause the shit is, I think it's so universal, the history stuff and the New York story I mean, I, I love Colin's stuff. When he was

3 (3h 5m 27s):
At the club, all the door guys were like, dude, it was like an education. He's so good.

4 (3h 5m 31s):
And he's a great guy.

3 (3h 5m 32s):
He's a great guy

4 (3h 5m 33s):
And he is honest as hell.

3 (3h 5m 34s):
Yeah, well that's the same with the tell like sweetheart guys. 'cause they don't have any excess energy that's being like distracted into nonsense and bullshit. And that's a big factor.

4 (3h 5m 45s):
I learned so much from Mattel. 'cause I used to open for him and he is like just the best guy and like supportive. And I remember a lot of diners leaving him like, you know, we'd leave a diner at like 4:00 AM and he orders an nice coffee large. And I'm like, Dave, what are you doing? Are you just, you never sleep? Like he really is. I'm like, you heard this fucking dude. He,

3 (3h 6m 3s):
He functions on coffee and cigarettes and when he was doing that show Insomniac

4 (3h 6m 8s):
Incredible show.

3 (3h 6m 9s):
Oh my God, that show was a great show. And he was like out, it

4 (3h 6m 12s):
Was like Rugged Bourdain. By the

3 (3h 6m 13s):
Way, skanks for The Memories is still one of my all time favorite.

4 (3h 6m 16s):
I think it's number one CDs. I think it's the best album ever.

3 (3h 6m 18s):
It's a great album, man. It's up there with some of the all time greats. And he recorded that at the Comedy Works in Denver, which is one of the all time rooms.

4 (3h 6m 26s):
Legendary,

3 (3h 6m 26s):
Legendary

4 (3h 6m 27s):
Room. Aldo did his last or did his first one there, I think. Did

3 (3h 6m 30s):
I tell you? I didn't tell you the first.

4 (3h 6m 31s):
Didn't you do a special there?

3 (3h 6m 32s):
Yeah, 2014. I did Comedy Central special there.

4 (3h 6m 35s):
Nice.

3 (3h 6m 36s):
I had the most Bazar mo moment. I went to see Willy Wonka in the Chocolate Factory with my kids. The new one. Yeah, it's really good. I take a leak. I'm leaving the bathroom and I run into this dude. And for two seconds, I think it's Greg Giraldo, he looks exactly like Greg Giraldo. He's just taller. He's like 6 1 6 2. But he's Greg Giraldo and I go, what's up? The guy goes, what's up to me? Because it was me. You know, he is like, oh, it's Joe Rogan. and I'm like, Hey. and I go, God, my God. Greg's dead. This's not Greg. So it it like, it had to like, wow.

4 (3h 7m 16s):
So you rec what a mind. Fuck. That is a

3 (3h 7m 18s):
Mind fuck dude. 'cause for in my mind, for a half a second, I thought I saw my friend.

4 (3h 7m 25s):
That's brutal.

3 (3h 7m 26s):
For half a second, my friend has been dead for it.

4 (3h 7m 28s):
And he recognizes you. That's crazy. Yes. It

3 (3h 7m 30s):
Was crazy. It was crazy because he,

4 (3h 7m 31s):
His son, you know his son is doing standup Greg Gi Geraldo Jr.

3 (3h 7m 34s):
Well, I, no, I didn't

4 (3h 7m 35s):
Know that. And he's funny. Really?

3 (3h 7m 37s):
Is he in New York?

4 (3h 7m 37s):
He's a New York guy and he, he, he was a waiter at The Cellar for like a summer job.

3 (3h 7m 42s):
Oh, Shane told me about this guy.

4 (3h 7m 44s):
Yeah. So he asked me to do his show and I was like, I'll do your show. And he put himself on before me and I watched him. I was like, thank God you're fucking funny. Yeah, right. Thank God. But he is, that's and he's crazy. He, he looks like him and he's got the mannerisms. Well,

3 (3h 7m 58s):
Giraldo was like revered by us, but he's not so funny. I mean not so known that it puts pressure. He was very funny obviously, but not so known that he puts pressure on his son to other people.

4 (3h 8m 10s):
I don't. Yeah. Do you know what I mean?

3 (3h 8m 11s):
Like to regular world? To us

4 (3h 8m 13s):
It is wasn't, he wasn't like mainstream Right. As he should have been.

3 (3h 8m 16s):
Like Chris Rock's kid. Right. Chris Rock's kid does standup. Like holy shit. Right?

4 (3h 8m 20s):
Yeah.

3 (3h 8m 20s):
But Giardo and I did sitcoms on the same lot. Wow. Yeah. So when I was doing, I think it was News Radio, it might have been har I think it was News Radio, when I was doing news radio, I was right next door to him. Hmm. So we would hang out together. Like we were both guys from New York. We both knew each other from Boston Comedy. We both knew each other from the clubs in New York. And you know, we were like, dude can't believe we're here. Like, this is crazy. He had his own show. He had a show. I forget the lawyer one, right? Yeah. A lawyer show. 'cause he was a lawyer originally. Yeah. Like that was the thing back then. Like you would sell whatever you were I'm really into tools. Like, like the fucking They would make a sitcom around you. Yeah. And that's like, that was their, that was the thing that they would do.

3 (3h 9m 2s):
You know, damn Domestic Goddess Roseanne bam. Make a show about you. You were basically, when you were on stage back then, you were auditioning for a sitcom about yourself. And people got giant deals. Man, they got crazy deals.

4 (3h 9m 18s):
Oh, we, we used to hear about the, just for last Montreal Fest, like, did you get a holding deal? I'm like, I got an agent. Yeah. Those, back in the day, it was like a million dollar deal.

3 (3h 9m 27s):
Not not much, but you get hundreds of thousands. Yeah. I didn't do another show after News Radio for like two years. and I made more money than I did when I was on news radio.

4 (3h 9m 41s):
Why? I was

3 (3h 9m 42s):
Just getting development deals. Wow. Development deals were crazy money. They were trying to That's fucking crazy. Yeah. 'cause after News radio, like I could, it was like proven that I can act in a sitcom. Yeah. But could I run a, could I be the star of a sitcom? So I had a bunch of development deals to star in a sitcom. and I got to experience that world, which is a very Bazar world. But I didn't like it. I didn't like the dealing with all the meetings and all the things. So when Fear Factor came along, I was like, hold on. No actors, no writers at all. Like, what do I have to do on the show? Like, and also this is an opportunity for material. 'cause this is gonna get canceled and I'm gonna have a giant bit about this fucking stupid show with these sick dogs on people and made 'em meet dicks. And they, and the show got canceled and then it goes on forever.

3 (3h 10m 22s):
It goes on for six years and it's 148 episodes. It was so nuts. Wow. But I, I specifically did it 'cause don don't wanna do this anymore. I don't wanna do the the the fucking, the, the, the grind of what it means to,

4 (3h 10m 35s):
I don't know how actors do it. Oh, think I mean just the waiting around the waiting for your phone to ring like it.

3 (3h 10m 40s):
Well it's better than working in a coal mine

4 (3h 10m 43s):
Of course, you know, but I mean that's why they do it. I just mean psychologically of course. It's a great if you can make a living at it, that's incredible.

3 (3h 10m 48s):
Also, you're dealing with people that are psychologically damaged already, most likely. Which is why they need exorbitant amounts of attention, which is why they want to be the fucking the star in this new Laura Croft movie. Like this is, this is a normal thing. Like for psychos. Like you got ignored by your dad and now all of a sudden you're you're in this fucking crazy movie, I know, I'll show you pop.

4 (3h 11m 11s):
And guess what? It ain't gonna fucking fill the void. It never does. You think it will, but it it,

3 (3h 11m 15s):
You gotta fill that void on your own. Exactly. But I do think that it's possible for someone. 'cause I definitely think that I came into comedy with like a neediness. Like I just was just like trying to like show that I was worthy of something. And then eventually you get confident and then you realize like, well it's not like, it's not like this can't be turned in a different direction. And then my obsession could now be in getting better at this art and getting better at this thing that I love this, this thing that I enjoy. That's like a really good exchange between audience members and, and, and comic. It's a really good exchange. Yeah. I particularly like it, like as a fan. Like I, I really love watching comedy still to this day Yeah.

3 (3h 11m 55s):
Of all these years of doing it. So I know it's a good experience. Do

4 (3h 11m 57s):
You still watch specials? Yeah,

3 (3h 11m 59s):
I'll do occasionally. Like if I, if I'm home and I have time, I just don't have any time. My time is like really kind of strictly allocated, you know? And when I need to shut my brain off, I don't watch specials. I watch nonsense. I either watch like professional pool matches or watch videos on muscle cars. That's what I watch. That's

4 (3h 12m 18s):
Cool. Stupid shit. Yeah. but it, I get that on purpose.

3 (3h 12m 21s):
I do it on purpose.

4 (3h 12m 21s):
I was watching Reacher last night. I'm like, I need shit like this. My Yes. I need a dude who just beats

3 (3h 12m 25s):
Dudes up damn fucking you can't lose. Yeah, you can't lose. He's gonna fuck you up. I love that guy. Yeah. Well he's a real reacher too. If you read the book, like that's what reacher

4 (3h 12m 33s):
Supposed to be. Tom Cruise. That's what Tom Cruise.

3 (3h 12m 35s):
The Tom Cruise thing was ridiculous. Yeah, but

4 (3h 12m 36s):
You gotta take the a-list guy in that. I get It's, we're talking Charlize you're taking the a-list too, right? You have to, but he's supposed to be a giant.

3 (3h 12m 43s):
Yeah. It doesn't make any sense. That doesn't make any sense. The guy who plays reacher now, who's that

4 (3h 12m 47s):
Guy? Alan Richon. He's awesome. That guy's reacher. He's jacked.

3 (3h 12m 49s):
Perfect, perfect guy for that. He's

4 (3h 12m 51s):
Fucking enormous,

3 (3h 12m 51s):
Perfect guy. And you believe him when he is like spouting all, all smart shit.

4 (3h 12m 55s):
I don't know who's still talking shit to every episode. Someone's talking shit. I'm like, have you looked at him?

3 (3h 12m 59s):
But that's reality, dude. Yeah. I've seen people talk shit to some of the most scary fucking human beings. He's that've ever existed. A big dude. He's your fucking, that's a understate. And

4 (3h 13m 7s):
He is likable. He's a likable guy in the show,

3 (3h 13m 8s):
Guy's. Gigantic. Look at the size of him. He's like six foot five too.

4 (3h 13m 12s):
He's huge.

3 (3h 13m 12s):
He's huge. That's what Jack Reacher was in the novels. Yeah.

4 (3h 13m 15s):
And then Tom Cruise was like, I wanna be richer. He's

3 (3h 13m 18s):
Fucking five eight or

4 (3h 13m 19s):
Whatever he is. Yeah. Tom, you're Napoleon and not fucking Tom Cruise. Yeah, but he's a bad Tom Tom Cruise is, I gotta say though, the first Reacher moves pretty cool with Tom Cruise. He's

3 (3h 13m 27s):
Good in it. It's just like, it's not the same as the book. Yeah. If you can just get past that and this guy's just an assassin, like the gray man, you know, the Gray Man series? The Gray Man. Which one's the gray man? The Gray man. Was it Ryan Gosling? Did I fuck that up? No. You didn. I get it right. Yeah, I get it right. I was fuck up the Ryan's. Which man, it's, well they made a movie for Netflix, but the book, these Mark Greeny books are wild. They're good. They're wild books. Yeah. That's one of my favorite kind of books for like complete escapism. Oh yeah. It's about a CIA assassin and he's the best. I love shit. They call him the Gray Man. This is the movie. The movie is,

4 (3h 14m 1s):
Oh, Chris Evans. I heard of this. Yeah,

3 (3h 14m 2s):
The movie's. Okay. They fucking Hollywood it up. But the books are incredible and the audio books are really good. And it's, but that guy was like 170 pounds. He's just a, a killer. He's not fucking everybody up like, you know, a bar fight. Like no, it's a different kind of guy. So this is a guy who knows how to be an assassin, but it's a realistic if, especially if you read the book Realistic depiction as far as you can take it of a guy who always wins. Yeah. You know, but it's, it's,

4 (3h 14m 31s):
Those are fun though. Yeah. Those like escapists, like, like a Michael Connolly or something just like cool badass.

3 (3h 14m 36s):
We trapped in this guy's world. This guy's trying to make it through fucking eastern block countries with a cash of weapons. and it,

4 (3h 14m 43s):
It's fun. Those are page turners. Yeah.

3 (3h 14m 45s):
Yeah. They're, they're wild. And a lot of it has to deal with stories that are like actually connected to covert operations that happen overseas. don don't know these. There, there really are people that are assassins for the CIA a that they have to send to these countries. You

4 (3h 14m 60s):
Even in the bookstore though, and you see these, some of these authors and they have like 45 books and you're like, I know. How the fuck did you do that? I know. Think about how hard to write one book.

3 (3h 15m 7s):
I think Mar Greeny has, I think he's got six or seven Gray man books.

4 (3h 15m 12s):
It's crazy. Yeah.

3 (3h 15m 13s):
How many Gray Man books are there? I

4 (3h 15m 15s):
Was nine. It might be this guy Co I swear. Got this guy's got like 45 books in Barnes and Noble. How

3 (3h 15m 20s):
About Stephen King?

4 (3h 15m 21s):
It's in, how is he still doing

3 (3h 15m 22s):
It? That motherfucker's been cranking them out. Yeah, it's called Cocaine and Alcohol. That's what he had. But he's got

4 (3h 15m 28s):
All the Great factory though. Doesn't he I mean He must have people there.

3 (3h 15m 29s):
Yeah. Chinese kids. No, he in the beginning,

4 (3h 15m 33s):
Stephen King and iPhones to fucking bang in the mouth. I

3 (3h 15m 35s):
Hate to encourage alcoholism and drug abuse, but that's when he did his best work. Yeah. If you go and read The Shining he was blackout Drunk. Yeah. Mark Greeny book 13. That's crazy, man. The Chaos Agent. This is a new book that just came out. Dude, they're good

4 (3h 15m 48s):
Man. I'm gonna pick these up. These up. Yeah, I'm gonna try it.

3 (3h 15m 50s):
They're great in audio too. The audio book is really good. But if you like to read, they're really good. Yeah. They're just like, for like, take me away. This is like a modern day

4 (3h 15m 58s):
Vacation book.

3 (3h 15m 59s):
Jane Bond type dude. Yeah. It's fucking nonsense.

4 (3h 16m 1s):
Or a flight. You're on a flight. I

3 (3h 16m 3s):
Don't wanna read anything about climate change. don don't wanna freakout about the economy. I don't wanna read about the World

4 (3h 16m 7s):
Economic Forum. I disappear.

3 (3h 16m 8s):
Or the Rockefellers, or I don't want to hear about it. Military industrial complex. Stop. No,

4 (3h 16m 14s):
You need an escape.

3 (3h 16m 15s):
Stop. What's really going on in Antarctica? I don't wanna know. I don't have time. We're

4 (3h 16m 20s):
Gonna be dead soon anyway. Let's just enjoy the ride. Yeah,

3 (3h 16m 23s):
For sure. I mean realistically, if this is all true, if you're not living in a simulation. But I'm not convinced anymore,

4 (3h 16m 33s):
Don don't know.

3 (3h 16m 34s):
I'm not convinced. If I was living in a simulation and I was living in a simulation that was created just a hundred years from now, don don't think I'm capable of discerning. I can barely tell a deep fake now. Yeah. Somebody sends me a deep fake. There's one deep fake that's been overwhelming. My Instagram feed and I do not understand how Instagram can't stop this. But it's a deep fake with Warren Buffet talking about investing in Bitcoin. Oh

4 (3h 17m 1s):
My God. That's like a dangerous one too. Huh? Lemme

3 (3h 17m 4s):
Show you it lemme show you because there's so many of them. There's so many of 'em. It's fucking insane. There's so many of 'em that I, I, every time I go to Instagram, I I see them. See that all one that says the giveaway with the girl's face. Yeah. That's all a deep fake.

4 (3h 17m 20s):
Oh my God. Yeah.

3 (3h 17m 22s):
And how does the information, how does this not get somehow or another flagged? Because if you just say the word Nazi, you get flagged off of YouTube. Right.

4 (3h 17m 32s):
I mean, I don't know, TikTok, YouTube, whatever. It's, they're, they're clamping down for sure.

3 (3h 17m 36s):
Like what you were just saying earlier. Yeah. So how, how do they not flag flag this down. I'm gonna send it to you

4 (3h 17m 40s):
Rather now. Probably now Jamie, it's, it's a more obvious flag if there's a trigger word as opposed to just a fake video.

3 (3h 17m 46s):
These accounts appear to be operating in a coordinated network as they mass upload the same crypto videos under obscure hashtags. See the one that I sent you, Jamie? 'cause this one in particular, this one just overwhelms my feed. I see it constantly. And the the one that I just sent you, it's like, I just don't understand how you can't stop that. This looks almost like that one in the picture I just showed. But it's a different image on the, the the first image when you click on it. Sure. Yeah. I know. I keep, keep seeing this thing is like, you know, you just keep seeing the same I image over and over again and you know, that's it. This Bitcoin thing. So gimme some volume on this so I can hear it. So this

4 (3h 18m 24s):
Is fake. Yeah,

3 (3h 18m 25s):
A hundred percent go. So could you refresh it supposed to only upload five minutes ago? Yeah, they're, they listen, they're constant man. I, well that's why I can't take care of 'em is because I just keep uploading it.

16 (3h 18m 33s):
It's about $12,000. I promise to give away my fortune and I'm doing it. Do not miss the opportunity that will change your life.

3 (3h 18m 44s):
So it's a Bitcoin current us Warren Buffet

18 (3h 18m 46s):
Buffett. Can you tell us about your, your spontaneous decisions lately?

16 (3h 18m 49s):
Yes. Of course. I am launching a Bitcoin giveaway. Take part. If you want to change your future, go to the website. Hell edge.com. Enter promo code gift and enjoy your prize of zero point.

3 (3h 18m 60s):
Yeah.

4 (3h 19m 0s):
Wow.

3 (3h 19m 1s):
Yeah. So there's like don don't know how many accounts that are uploading that same thing over.

4 (3h 19m 6s):
So easy to do people like

3 (3h 19m 7s):
That over and over and over. Yeah. If you, there's a certain percentage of this country that has an IQ of 85 and under. Right. What did we say it was? Was it 16%? Yeah,

5 (3h 19m 18s):
It's standard deviation or whatever.

3 (3h 19m 20s):
16% that have no chance. That have no chance. It's Bushwick Bill versus Mike Tyson. There's no chance. The the world is too cruel. It's too difficult to navigate. They're not gonna make it. They're gonna drown. So with those people, they might have a job or they might have social service money. They might have like some way that they can, I'm gonna

19 (3h 19m 39s):
Invest in Bitcoin. I'm gonna make my way out of this mess.

3 (3h 19m 43s):
And this guy's a moron. He, he can't help himself. He's got a nine watt brain and it's never gonna change. It's never gonna get stronger. Genetically he's fucked. Supposed to be a ditch digger and then they get him. Yeah. And so they get 50 bucks from that guy and a hundred bucks from this guy and a thousand bucks from that guy and 5,000 from this moron. How do

4 (3h 19m 59s):
They get away with it though? Isn't there a way to track this?

3 (3h 20m 2s):
I think they just do it from other countries and they do it with so many different accounts. They do it to a separate website. It's another video's,

5 (3h 20m 9s):
Different stuff on it. Uploaded TikTok? No, it's the same exact video, same exact audio.

Look at this. but it says Warren Buffet has decided to whiten his reputation by just giving money away at the end of his life. May sound fun, but don't lose the fucking opportunity. Oh, look at that. So that's like they're tricking you to getting, getting mad at him for being rich. And it's a different website. So there's probably thousands of these websites and they're probably, all the money goes into the same account and holy shit, they're probably extracting who knows how much money from how many morons.

5 (3h 20m 40s):
It's also, I remember hearing this recent, not how recently this was, but a couple years ago that as the rest of the world has been coming online and getting access to broadband internet and faster and faster and we've had for like the last 15, 20 years, all the scams that we've been having happen to us or now happening en mass to them. Like the Nigerian prince game, if you will. That's like the most famous one. Someone reaching out now they're using DeepFakes to do that. But it's happening to the people that just got the internet. Also,

4 (3h 21m 6s):
They'll they'll get people for a while.

3 (3h 21m 8s):
Oh yeah. Forever. Yeah. They're getting us today. Yeah.

4 (3h 21m 11s):
People

3 (3h 21m 12s):
Are always getting got by these fucking stupid things. There's always something that comes along, whether it's, you know, fucking the, the, the crypto guys from The Bahamas, FTC I mean, how many people did they get? They got like very intelligent

4 (3h 21m 27s):
People. So many. Yeah. And then you look at people who are just catfishing. I'm like, you're just doing it for the love of the game.

3 (3h 21m 31s):
Catfishing. It's still just

4 (3h 21m 32s):
That's a fucking weird one. That's a sport.

3 (3h 21m 34s):
That's a sport. Yeah. It's like catch and release fishing.

4 (3h 21m 37s):
You don't get,

3 (3h 21m 38s):
You don't get anything out of it. You just like, you love this. You just,

4 (3h 21m 41s):
You just love to dupe someone. Yeah. You love to dupe some sad kid from Syracuse

3 (3h 21m 46s):
Or some fucking horny athlete.

4 (3h 21m 49s):
Wow. Yeah. Yeah. What's his name? Fucking That was a great, which one? Netflix thing. Man. Te do you see that shit? Oh, I

3 (3h 21m 55s):
Heard about that one, man. How'd they get him?

4 (3h 21m 57s):
Just like a sweet kid too. It was some woman who was like, wouldn't meet him, but he is like a college athlete. He's too busy anyway. And then, you know, you gotta meet the person though.

3 (3h 22m 6s):
I think something happens when people connect with people online where you develop this like very Bazar attraction to them because you don't really know them yet in person. Sure. And you're communicating back and forth and you're both putting forth your, your best face. And if you're a young athlete who's like a football player and this lady's saying all the right things, untold, the girlfriend

4 (3h 22m 28s):
Did the test. Yeah. Outta touch poor, like she poor, poor guy. Like she's Yeah, he didn't know I mean he's like a sweet kid too. You see, and by the way, like there's a Netflix thing on him and you're like, he comes out looking great and the, and the guy who catfish him, you're like, this is a psychopath that no remorse.

3 (3h 22m 41s):
Right. That's a terrible person. The the, the idea is that you're allowed to do that to a person. You don't even know because that person's famous. Like you, you're allowed to destroy their life and do something horrible to them just because they're famous. That's crazy. But also you also have to deal with like, why couldn't he see that coming? Why didn't he, why couldn't he recognize And then you have to take into account

4 (3h 22m 59s):
He's a kid.

3 (3h 23m 0s):
Yeah. And he's a football player. Okay. You know, you're colliding heads with people all the time. Yeah, dude. All the time. All the time. You know.

4 (3h 23m 12s):
Yeah. It's not healthy. Football is, football is probably the most dangerous sport there is. I mean when you look at like the blackouts in the CTE, like what offensive linemen have to deal with. Like I think that's probably the most vicious sport we

3 (3h 23m 22s):
Had. but it explains Shane Gillis. I do. I'm not kidding. I think that explained Kinison.

4 (3h 23m 31s):
Did he play football?

3 (3h 23m 32s):
No, he got hit in the head by a car. That's right. Yeah. So did Roseanne. There

5 (3h 23m 37s):
Was a comedian on Koni law recently that he was, he was funny. He's new. He is a young guy from Austin. But he was telling a story recently over a pandemic. He fell off of a balcony, landed on his head, broke his face. All his teeth are fake. and it was like, I was like listening to that. I was like, oh, this is gonna be another guy. He's probably gonna be a hilarious comedian. But life probably changed 'cause of a head injury.

3 (3h 23m 55s):
Well it's not guaranteed you're gonna be funny. No, no, no. I'm not recommending you hit by a car. I'm not saying no,

5 (3h 24m 0s):
He didn't do it on purpose.

4 (3h 24m 1s):
This isn't, this isn't in Spider-Man. You gotta fucking it happened is what I'm saying. You just try, you're trying to nail it. You're like, let me just fucking hit my head proper. No, no. That's not, if

5 (3h 24m 8s):
That's how I said it, that's not how I meant it. Yeah.

3 (3h 24m 10s):
You're

4 (3h 24m 11s):
Either gonna be a fucking, you're either gonna be mentally challenged or you're gonna be fucking a pretty solid open micr.

3 (3h 24m 17s):
Yeah.

4 (3h 24m 18s):
We'll see.

3 (3h 24m 19s):
I think I attribute some of my success to brain damage. Yeah.

4 (3h 24m 22s):
Yeah.

3 (3h 24m 22s):
That's probably something

4 (3h 24m 23s):
That you take a lot of, a lot of hits.

3 (3h 24m 24s):
Yeah, for sure. But it's enough that I'm cognizant, I'm unaware, but I also have like a level of don't give a fuck. That's probably not healthy. It's,

4 (3h 24m 32s):
It might be healthy

3 (3h 24m 33s):
And it, but it needs to be like managed all the time with strenuous exercise and you know, like voluntary difficult things like cold plunge and sauna. Like, I need to do stuff. I need to like you need

4 (3h 24m 45s):
To be active.

3 (3h 24m 45s):
I need to force, you're a doer. I need to force this brain into like violent activities on a regular basis to fucking keep it in check. But I think there's a certain amount of brain damage That's not bad. Just a touch. Just a touch of autism. Touch brain damage. Mm. You get

4 (3h 25m 3s):
Shit done. I think you made comics healthier.

3 (3h 25m 5s):
No, that's good.

4 (3h 25m 6s):
I think you did. I you made me wanna be healthier. That's good. I, when I was here last time and I was like, yeah, I gotta take care of myself. Holy shit. Like you were so nice about that, that I was like, yeah, I should fucking, I should watch this a little bit. You

3 (3h 25m 17s):
Gotta think of your body as your vehicle. Yeah. And if you have like a Nissan GTR, you could take a GTR and you could put a fucking big ass turbo and it make 900 horsepower. Like why wouldn't you do that? Wouldn't it be better? If it works better? It's faster.

4 (3h 25m 30s):
Why I come to strip mall in Indianapolis. That's why.

3 (3h 25m 33s):
Yeah. But still you want energy and No, you're right. The energy of your mind is directly connected to the energy of your body. And we, we wanna pretend that it's not because there was like a, a time of intellectual snobbery where taking care of your body was thought as vain and, and, and stupid. It's a, a morons approach.

4 (3h 25m 51s):
No, you really, you made people healthier, I think. And, and in a way where you're like, no, this is smart. This is, we need a

3 (3h 25m 57s):
Yeah dude, I'm pushing 60, I'm 56 years old.

4 (3h 25m 60s):
You don't look it. I,

3 (3h 26m 1s):
But that, that's possible. Yeah. I just want, I'm not doing anything crazy that other people can't do too. You could do it. You just have to be on top of it and you have to not let your body degrade. 'cause once your body degrades, building your body up is very, very, very, very, very hard. But maintaining your body is not as hard. Yeah. You just have to be like really dedicated to it. The same way you're dedicated to brushing your teeth. Same way you're dedicated to eating food. Don't you eat food every day? Yeah. Yes. Well that 'cause you have to Right. Stay alive. You also have to exercise. You should exercise a minimum five days a week I think.

4 (3h 26m 31s):
I think that's smart I mean, look, when we were on the road, we did a tour bus last year a few times. And like we'd be out 14 days or whatever at a time. Every day we would wake up in a new city, we'd hit a rec center. Beautiful. We'd play basketball. Nice. We'd do whatever.

Liquid I.V. (3h 26m 43s):
We'd steam, we'd shower, we'd get breakfast. Good way to start the day. Great way to start. And we drink at night, but guess what? We sweat at the fuck out. Yeah. Take some electrolytes, get some liquid IV pound it, pound some vitamins and glutathione.

3 (3h 26m 55s):
Great. Yeah. You can mitigate it. And you can also like give your body more of a chance to be robust while you're traveling. And avoid sickness and avoid fatigue and all the shit that fucks with bad shows. When you have that feeling backstage, you feel like shit and you gotta go on stage. I hate it. That's a terrible feeling.

4 (3h 27m 13s):
Two show I mean back in the day, three shows, remember the three show nights? Oh. Oh my God.

3 (3h 27m 17s):
The three show nights were so squirrely for me because I'm a marijuana proponent and I would often forget, did I bring this up already? This is the third show is the second show

4 (3h 27m 26s):
Is, is fucking hard. But if you're high and

3 (3h 27m 28s):
Then when you lock in, like when you lock in and you're doing standup, you're just in it. Right. You're in those bits. But then if you're free balling, which often you're likely to do, if you're doing three shows, you want to make it interesting. So you mix up the order and you're like, oh my god, I don't know where I'm going with this.

4 (3h 27m 43s):
Well you find new bits. Yes. And also I would do like start with coffee and with booze. Like Yeah. Ride the caffeine eye. Exactly. Yeah. If I'm doing something long, I want to, I want feel both highs and I wanna feel good. That's good. I wanna enjoy myself. That's

3 (3h 27m 56s):
Why I'm terrified of Adderall. I'm terrified of any stimulants. Stimulants scare the shit out of me.

4 (3h 28m 1s):
They work. Yeah. After I didn't take it. I used to take it all the time. And holy shit, I might have to and I have to start writing a new fucking hour. I

3 (3h 28m 7s):
Like 'em. Are they good for creativity?

4 (3h 28m 9s):
I love it because I can I block out every, I just focus like I'm, I already have like voices in my head. So like when I, what kind of

3 (3h 28m 16s):
Voices? Just

4 (3h 28m 16s):
Like joke. I do joke. I do like, you know, so, so when I'm writing I can't, it's too much. and I can't write. But if I, if I pop an Adderall, I can like focus on, I'll read an article. I'll be like, what's funny about this? That'll like warm me up. Listen to my set. I I'm gonna, I'm gonna struggle to write a new fucking hour, dude. What's

3 (3h 28m 30s):
The, what's the dose?

4 (3h 28m 31s):
Don don't remember. It's, I gotta get new ones. Actually all my shit are You

3 (3h 28m 35s):
Got a prescription? I do. Yeah. That's good. Yeah. You don't wanna get it from the cartel.

4 (3h 28m 41s):
I don't want that shit. I

3 (3h 28m 42s):
Know people who do I know people who get street drugs that take like street Molly. Like what are you doing

4 (3h 28m 47s):
Man? I, I need to get back. I haven't had it in a while 'cause I've been kind of honing this out. But when I need a new hour, fuck I'm, I'm just dreading it. Starting at zero dude.

3 (3h 28m 55s):
Yeah. But you always do it. You

4 (3h 28m 57s):
Do it. You always do it. But it's, it's always, yeah,

3 (3h 28m 58s):
It's wonderful. It's a wonderful terrifying feeling. I love because love it. Love because you have to be a rookie all over again. Like people know you or they're, they love you, they're fans and they come to see you and you're a rookie.

4 (3h 29m 8s):
It's crazy to suck again. I'm like man, and it's also 'cause you're coming off the high of murdering 'cause you're at last hour like you at your peak. So they're like this as good as I get. Yep. And then it's gone and you're like, I'm

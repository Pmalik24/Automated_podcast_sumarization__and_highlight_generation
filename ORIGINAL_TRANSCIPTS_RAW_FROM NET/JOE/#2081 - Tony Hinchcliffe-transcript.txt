We're pumped.

3 (31s):
Wearing pajamas to work.

4 (33s):
I love it. This is a full Jordan sweatsuit.

3 (37s):
I thought it was pajamas. I was like, Tony came in all casual in his PJ's.

4 (41s):
There's stuff that I wanna wear to do standup in that I can't do standup in. But during the day, it's like you

3 (46s):
Can do standup in that. Oh, I

4 (47s):
Can't,

3 (48s):
You 100% could.

4 (49s):
I've literally put it on and then like right before I leave, I go and change into black pants and a black hoodie.

3 (56s):
One of my, my biggest mistakes ever is like I get high and then I get dressed. It's fucking a terrible idea. Yeah, it's a terrible idea. Yeah. I'll be wearing fucking raincoats and shit.

4 (1m 7s):
Yeah. I have a bunch of, I've, I've been dressing very eccentric during the days lately. It's fun. It's fun.

3 (1m 12s):
Yeah. Why not? Why shouldn't you? You're a baller now. Yeah.

4 (1m 16s):
Yeah. And then at nighttime I, at the last second I get scared.

3 (1m 22s):
Sorta. You still wear that crazy belt buckle?

4 (1m 24s):
Oh, I wear the belt buckles everywhere I get. I got more. Someone just sent me a golden pony made of gold that says Golden Pony and big letters. I've been a my homie Bones eye that makes all those leather joke books on Kill. Tony just showed me one that he's almost finished with, which is the alien head of the mothership with the two Kill Tony. Guns crossed over I mean a big one. Dude, you're gonna fucking love it. So now people know that I like belt buckles, so they're going out and fucking getting me custom made by

3 (1m 53s):
Buckles. Oh man. Boom. Cody Garrant gave me a gold chain that his jeweler made. And on one side is one is my face and the other side is my dog's face. Oh.

4 (2m 7s):
Have you worn it yet?

3 (2m 8s):
No.

4 (2m 9s):
Let me tell you something.

3 (2m 11s):
I told my wife she has to wear it. I go, she goes, I'm gonna wear it with the dog face out. I go, the fuck you are? You wear it with my face out. Wear it everywhere you go.

4 (2m 21s):
But if you try that on when you're chilling at home one day and you're like just wearing shorts or something, you throw that chain on, you might never take it off.

3 (2m 28s):
No. I'm afraid to ignite the Italian in me. Exactly.

4 (2m 31s):
Yeah.

3 (2m 32s):
I'm afraid to start wearing gold chains and shit and pinky rings

4 (2m 36s):
A hundred percent. That's what

3 (2m 37s):
Happens. Yeah. I don't want to ignite that part of me. Yeah.

4 (2m 39s):
I got, I,

3 (2m 40s):
You know, like when, when Mike Tyson was fat, one of the things that he said he didn't wanna work out Eagles. I'm afraid to ignite my ego

4 (2m 47s):
Because

3 (2m 47s):
It did ignited his egos. Then he became Mike Tyson again. Like he goes, I'm afraid to, what did he, what was his exact quote when he decided to fight again? He said something like, the Gods of war. Yeah, there it is.

4 (3m 0s):
That's baller is fuck. Oh my God. Cody

3 (3m 5s):
Can wear shit like that because he's, you know, he's a cool dude. I'm an old dork. I can't be wearing that. Oh,

4 (3m 13s):
That's a good gate. It's pretty cool though. That's a good gateway

3 (3m 16s):
Into, I like the Marshall one though. I'll wear that. The dog's the best. Yeah. Golden Retrievers are literally the, the greatest dogs of all time. They're so different than any other dog I've ever, they're like people, they're so weird. Yeah. It's like they, they just, they're so tuned in. Like there's all these different things that I say to that dog where he knows exactly what I'm talking about. But it's not like, sit, gimme your paw. It's like, Hey man, you wanna watch tv? And he just goes running with me into the TV room. Wow. And he hops up on the couch with me and cuddles with me.

4 (3m 48s):
Amazing.

3 (3m 49s):
He's just my friend Mike says, they're all love sponges. It's what it is. It's like a love sponge. Yeah.

4 (3m 54s):
I've been thinking about getting a dog, but everybody's told me not to until I'm done with the road.

3 (3m 59s):
Yeah. Don't, don't. It's a real problem. You feel bad. You feel bad. Your dog is at a like getting dog sit or you know, your friend is over your house and they're probably not paying attention to the dog or Yeah. Walking the dog. You know, this dog's the happiest dog that I've ever had, but he's also the dog that I put the most time with. Like, we spent a lot of time together. Like, I, I throw the ball for him every day. When we lived in California, we ran the hills all the time. Yeah. It's like we have a relationship. I take him to the studio. He sits in the, he always throws up in the car. Unless he's in my car and he's in the front seat.

3 (4m 40s):
If you're petting him, he won't throw up.

4 (4m 43s):
Huh.

3 (4m 45s):
But if he's in the back seat, you can hear, you're gonna hear. It's just something about motion. You know, some dogs, they get in a car and that's why they like to stick their head out the window. I think they don't like the motion too. They don't like the, it just feels, why, why are we moving? Like, they don't understand. They're sitting and they're moving and probably in their dog brain. It's like, what is this?

4 (5m 6s):
I got to see my old dog from LA that I haven't seen in like two and a half years or something like that. Maybe three years. A few weeks ago I did a show in San Diego and my ex came to the show, big theater, and they made it down to the green room and it was like one of those old soldier reunion videos. Oh. It was unbelievable. Aw. She never forgets.

3 (5m 31s):
Aw.

4 (5m 32s):
It was great.

3 (5m 33s):
Yeah. When a dog really loves you. Yeah. My, my oldest daughter has a, a little chihuahua whippet mix named Snoop. And whenever I see Snoop, he just runs towards me like full blast. Like literally knows I'm gonna pick him up. So he kind of like almost launches himself to me. Yeah. He just runs up to me, launches himself to me and I and I carry him. He only wants to be carried like everywhere. He wants to give you little, little kisses on, on your face and carry and you want you to carry 'em.

4 (6m 0s):
Amazing.

3 (6m 1s):
And he's just so cool. He likes to like, but he's a little annoying and that if you watch TV with him, if you're not patting him, he'll paw your face. Oh yeah. He'll start doing this like, Hey man, don't do that. Stop doing that. Wow. But you know, he's like four, right? Like, I can't really train him now, but I Hey dude, don't, don't fucking do that. He's like, then fucking pet me.

4 (6m 21s):
It's like

3 (6m 21s):
This thing where you get this little chihuahua on your lap and I am like, come on man, don't dude my face like that. Come on man. He's like, then pet me, then pet me. And you just gotta keep your hand on him. You can't just keep your hand on him. You have to move it. You can't, you gotta rub him

4 (6m 35s):
The second you stop moving it, he paws your face. Ugh.

3 (6m 38s):
Keep rubbing me bitch. Wow.

4 (6m 40s):
What a life. Dogs have it made.

3 (6m 43s):
This dog does though. He's just, he fucking little love bug. It's funny 'cause little dogs are generally like, they're little weirded out by people sometimes. Not this one. The moment I met him, he just jump, he jumps to everybody. Everybody's like, you're my friend. Like everyone's my friend. He just has no worries about people not being his best friend. Yeah. Just runs right up to him. He's not scared of people. Some little dogs are like just weirded out by people.

4 (7m 11s):
Yeah. David Lucas's, little puppy's adorable.

3 (7m 13s):
Oh, that's a little, he's got a little French bulldog, right? Yeah. Ron had that one that got snatched up.

4 (7m 19s):
Yeah.

3 (7m 20s):
I found some feathers in my yard the other day. and I was worried. One of the chickens got got snatched. but it, it's something else. Some, some other bird. We have foxes.

4 (7m 32s):
Yeah. How, what do this come out at night?

3 (7m 34s):
They come out in the morning. I've seen them in the morning. They're, I've seen 'em at night too, driving. But we've got security camera footage of them. It's pretty cool. 'cause the security camera is very high resolution. So it's get get this video, this cool looking little animal and they make a weird noise. You ever heard of Fox Uhuh? Oh God. It's so strange.

4 (7m 54s):
What does it sound like?

3 (7m 56s):
Don? Don't wanna do it. Let me hear. You're good at animals. I, I'll do it if I hear. I wanna hear it again. 'cause I forgot exactly how it sounds like there's so many animal noises I have in my head.

4 (8m 5s):
We still laugh about the other night. A few weeks ago, we were all wasted for some reason doing wolf impressions in Mitzi's. And you came and sat down, we're like, Joe, show us your wolf impression. And you did an actual wolf. We were just howling like morons. And you sounded like a There was a wolf in the distance. Listen to

3 (8m 22s):
This thing. It's like a scream. It's weird. That's it. Oh,

4 (8m 28s):
That's frightening.

3 (8m 31s):
Yeah. But when you see 'em, they're so cool looking. Like, I wouldn't be sad if you only ate like one of my chickens. Don't eat all my chickens motherfucker. 'cause then I have to kill you. Yeah. But you, you can get one chicken, one stupid chicken fox sounds. Yeah, that's what they sound like.

4 (8m 48s):
Fox sounds is the only Fox channel I don't watch regularly.

3 (8m 53s):
I have so many animal noises in my head. I watched

6 (8m 56s):
This video yesterday. Yesterday. Have you ever heard a cat mimic a bird?

3 (9m 0s):
No.

6 (9m 1s):
Okay. Watch this. Really I mean. I'll be honest, it doesn't sound exactly like a bird, but this does not sound like a cat.

3 (9m 7s):
Oh wait a minute. That's it. Oh yeah,

6 (9m 10s):
It does. Different animals out here.

3 (9m 15s):
Do you know that? I had a bit about that. Really? Yeah. Yeah. I had a bit about this cat that I used to have that was a big old, fluffy cat. This like cute little cat until it saw something outside and then it became murderous. And like they have this, they do this thing when they want to bite. So they, it's they're so, it's so weird that your beautiful little cat that was before the JRE. So I didn't know the statistics about cat murder about, or it wasn't before the podcast, before an episode rather where we talked about how many fucking birds and mammals get murdered by cats every year.

4 (9m 53s):
Yeah.

3 (9m 54s):
Fucking billions. Dude in America, billions of mammals and birds get murdered by cats.

4 (10m 2s):
Scary animal. I had an angry one when I went to, when I went to college, my brother did. and I lived with my brother and there were two cats, hops and misty. And hops was cool as fuck. Jumped up on the ceiling, like had just jumped all the time. Loved jumping. And Misty was like this angry bitch that would just, and it's like You don You don't really get used to that. There's something even as a human that's 30, 50 times its size, it's like, ugh.

3 (10m 28s):
Yeah. You don't wanna fight a cat. Right. If a cat was trying to fight, think of a rat was trying to fight you, you'd be freaked out. Yeah. Just a little rat. Yeah dude. Everything can kill you. Yeah. Everything can kill you. That's one of the more exciting things about hunting in like mountain lion territory. Your hackles are always up. The chances of them trying to kill you are very low. The chances of them killing you if they want to are very high. Wow.

4 (10m 56s):
Damn.

3 (10m 57s):
They're very high. If you get snatched up by a mountain lion, you have almost no chance.

4 (11m 3s):
So for that, you have like a pistol on your side though. Yeah.

3 (11m 6s):
You should keep a pistol if you're in mountain lion territory. If you're in bear territory, you keep a large gun. Not, not, most guys carry rifles, but they'll also carry, like if they're bow hunting, they'll carry probably a 45 or a 10 millimeter. A big gun. A gun with a heavy round. And still you're fucked. They're so big. You don't know how big a bear is until you see one in the, in the flesh on the ground in front of you. Yeah. This is one that's, this is somewhere in Europe. I think that's a stag. And this, this bear is just fucking dragging this 300 pound stag around the way you would drag your luggage. I mean that's a big animal that's bigger than 300 pound.

3 (11m 48s):
I think that might even be an elk. It's either a stag or an elk. But I mean that's a, that's a solid 500 pound animal. Oof. And that bear is just fucking malling it. And it's not even a big bear. That's not a big one. They're, they're really, really, really scary ones. Of the Alaska ones, the Alaska ones are insane. my friend Steve Ella told this story on the podcast, as did my friend Remy Warren who's there as well, where they got attacked by an enormous coastal brown bear. It was like 11 feet enormous. It had claimed the elk that they shot. They shot an elk on a hunting trip.

4 (12m 26s):
Oh shit.

3 (12m 27s):
And the way Alaska is this, they were on this place called a fog neck island. And a fog neck island is insanely dense. And so if you're gonna pack out, if it's like a certain time at night, like say if you shoot the animal and it's like 5:00 PM and it gets dark at 8:00 PM you, you can't get it out in time. It takes a full day and you can't manage your way through that brush in the dark. It's too dense. Right. You go on a mile, it takes you hours. Oh, hours and hours to go a mile because it's just so dense. You're just moving through everything. And so they hung this, this elk up and they went, they took some of the meat back with them and then they went back in the morning to pack it out.

3 (13m 12s):
It's cool. So you don't have to worry about the meat going bad. They didn't realize when they got there that a bear had already found it. Oh shit. And the bear had claimed it. And so they said, let's sit down and eat lunch before we pack out. So a fuel up before we pack out. 'cause of the long packout.

4 (13m 27s):
So they didn at that point they didn't know that there was a Right.

3 (13m 29s):
They had no idea. So these guys are all planning to carry like a hundred pounds each on their backs. And they're gonna go miles and miles through this dense shit that's gonna take forever. So they're like, let's eat. So they, they're sitting there eating and someone hears something and they turn and they see a fucking monster of a bear running straight at them. Oh no. In the camp. And the bear probably didn't realize there were so many of them. And that's maybe the only thing that saved them. 'cause they kind of scattered. And one guy, this dude they called dirt myth. He was actually riding the bear's back at one point for like 10 yards on top of the bear's back and then fell off and the bale ran off.

3 (14m 12s):
And the, so the bear was in the woods like watching them making noises like wooing them, making these noises. And now they got their rifles out. But no one had a rifle out. No one had anything out. They were all just eating sandwiches. Wow. my friend Remy said he had his gun in his bag. Like fucking Ah.

4 (14m 32s):
So let's say you had a gun on your side like that.

3 (14m 34s):
Jesus Christ. What do you do? Because that thing ran past them, right? What if you shot it and it turned around and ran back? Like

4 (14m 40s):
Does the noise scare them at all? Maybe,

3 (14m 42s):
Right? Maybe. Maybe. and it depends on where you are. Some of them have never seen a person before.

4 (14m 48s):
What if you had one of those air horns that's like burn?

3 (14m 52s):
No, no, no. The bear spray doesn't even work all the

4 (14m 56s):
Time. It's just an embarrassing way to die. Just,

3 (14m 58s):
And it just fucking tear you apart. Yeah. Bear spray doesn't even work all the time. There's that spray that they use. my friend John, he runs a hunting camp in Alberta. The the rivets. John and Jen, they're awesome people. And John had an encounter with a grizzly and he sprayed it and he said the bear didn't even react. He said he just kinda walked right through the spray. I was like, oh fuck. Imagine if that's all you have is this spray and you're counting on the saving you from the bear. And he just fucking, it's like you ever seen those videos where dudes get tased and they just fucking take it? Oh yeah. The cops are tasing the guy, you know, get down, get down. He's like, ah. Like this dude's p ped up or something.

3 (15m 40s):
And he fucking pulls those cords out of 'em. Like now what? Right now what?

4 (15m 45s):
Now your cords are on the ground. Yeah

3 (15m 48s):
Bro. I've only seen one grizzly bear in the wild in my life. They look at you so different. They look at you So different. We were talking about this on bottom of the barrel the other day. 'cause like a black bear is a different animal. Black bears look at you like, who are you? You can eat me. I'm not gonna eat you. Like what's going on? Like black bears look grizzly bears look at you like this. Like how fast can you run?

4 (16m 9s):
Oh god.

3 (16m 10s):
There's a, there's a, yeah, there's a darkness in their eyes. Dude. That's just, it's that's a predator. Yeah. With no, that's the apex. They're not scared of nobody other than bigger bears. Right. That's all they're scared of. And the one I saw, man, he wasn't even that big. He was like a six foot bear, like a younger bear. Maybe seven foot, maybe not, not that big. The big ones when you get like 10, 11 feet. Oh my god. Dude. Jesus.

4 (16m 39s):
They're

3 (16m 40s):
Just massive killing machines. And they're so durable. That's the thing about them that's so crazy. When you watch them fight, they beat the fuck out of each other and they don't even seem to have marks on them. They're biting the shit outta each other's necks. Although there is one that I saw recently where it looked like the bear got the other bear in the guts and he just made a giant gash in his stomach and they were going to war like on the side of this while this one person's filming them in, in the woods. So if that thing's coming after you, man you your frame. Like we were talking about a cat, you know, that's what that is. It's like the same kind of thing. It's a wild animal. Just much bigger.

3 (17m 21s):
Like your brain is not even gonna correctly compute how much stronger they are than you.

4 (17m 27s):
Yeah.

3 (17m 27s):
It's an impossible number.

4 (17m 31s):
That's crazy.

3 (17m 32s):
And if you've ever seen them run, they can run faster than people can run. Yeah. So these two dudes, these two dudes going at each other. Like if that, if that's coming after you, man these are a thousand pounds.

7 (17m 49s):
Oh

3 (17m 51s):
They just biting the shit out of each other. They're trying to tell the other one. Get the fuck outta here. This is all my food. These are all my ladies. Get outta here bro. Hell yeah. Imagine you're in the woods. You stumble upon that.

4 (18m 10s):
That one's pretty dominant there on the right.

3 (18m 12s):
Yeah. That's a bigger, bigger bear. I think the the young one is,

4 (18m 16s):
Yeah, these bears don't know juujitsu. There's no benefit of in bottom position of really

3 (18m 20s):
Some of 'em. Do they? No. There's no benefit in bottom position in bear fighting, right? No. No. They don't have submissions. But they do like have some little hip moves. Yeah. Little hip escapes. Yeah. And they, they do like position themselves to, to hold you down. Seems like they've got some experience. Yeah, they'll do side control. You know, they're like biting the neck and holding them down like this. And if you're a bear and you're on the bottom, you're in a bad spot. Yeah. So there's no Charles Oliveira's of the bear world. Right? There's no Paul Craigs of the bear world, but there's a bit

4 (18m 51s):
Of judo. They use the other one's energy

3 (18m 53s):
Against it. Yeah. A little wrestling. Yeah.

4 (18m 54s):
Yeah. I was watching a funny clip earlier. Chappelle said that Prince Judo him, you, have you seen this? Because Prince took the picture of Dave Chappelle playing Prince serving pancakes. He took that picture and put it on an album cover before he passed away and made that the cover to like one of his last albums. And Chappelle said he Judd me and Jimmy f Oh this is it. Yeah. This is great.

8 (19m 20s):
Single gosh. That makes me so happy that that happened. That just made me so happy as a Prince Judo move right there. Isn. Is that Yeah,

4 (19m 31s):
I watch this.

8 (19m 31s):
Well no, it's like, you know, you make fun of Prince in a sketch and he'll just use you in his album. He uses your own joke against yourself. That's exactly what am I gonna do? Sue him for you. A picture of me dressed up like it was impossible. It's his Genius That's Checkmate right there. That's amazing.

3 (19m 53s):
God I love Dave.

4 (19m 54s):
Those fucking sketches back in the day were so impactful.

3 (19m 58s):
His show's the best show that's ever existed. Yeah. The best comedy sketch show.

4 (20m 3s):
No

3 (20m 3s):
Doubt. and it was only two seasons. Yeah. Which is so crazy. That and in living color people sleep on in living color in living color was wild. I remember I was playing pool once my friend John and I had no idea of the sketches. I didn't understand, I think it was like a Super Bowl thing. Like did they do one where the halftime, they had it in Living Color. Yeah. Something like that. They did. Right. So that was the first time I'd watched it at the pool hall and I was like, oh my god, this dude is doing fire, fire Marshal Bill. Jim Carrey's doing I was like, this is crazy. This is the craziest show ever.

4 (20m 38s):
Dude. I, that shit fucking raised me. Yeah. I mean all of it bro.

3 (20m 42s):
Handyman. Yep. He had a, a mentally handicapped superhero. Jesus Christ. He was called handyman. Oh,

4 (20m 50s):
So funny.

3 (20m 51s):
Dude. I, I tell everybody, people forgot how good Damon Wayne is. Yeah. They forgot for whatever reason because he decided to become a TV star and a movie star dude. When that guy was doing standup, he was like Chappelle level. He was, he was at his time. He was the guy that I admired the most like in his prime. 'cause he was in his prime when I was just starting to get to la. Dude, he was so good. His standup was so good. They

4 (21m 21s):
Were all a bunch of store guys. Like Jim Carrey was young on this.

3 (21m 25s):
Well Damon always hung out at the store. Yeah. He would hang out, hang out at the store and create comedy. Like on stage. He would just start to, he didn't worry at all about silence, about dead spaces. He was using it the way Mitzi wanted people to use it. Like as a lab. Yeah. To create stuff. And Damon Films all his sets. So he has a, a tape recorder, like a, A camera in the back. He films all his sets. He's had all his sets since the nineties. He's been doing that.

4 (21m 59s):
Wow.

3 (22m 0s):
He just got that TV money baby. Yeah. That TV money came rolling in and it's like I could just hang out at the house. There's Sam Kenon, Sam Kenon in Living Color and it cut to Jamie Fox sketch. I forgot. Show bro. That's right over.

9 (22m 14s):
And we're gonna try to get some last minute instruction from the coach. We're gonna try to get a word from him right now. Here he comes. Now coach, can we get a word from you real quick? You sure can. Now what did you tell your players before they left the locker for seven in your hand?

10 (22m 25s):
Well what I told 'em was just, just relax and concentrate and play some ball. I mean, you know, you

9 (22m 29s):
Leave the

3 (22m 30s):
Candy. I don't know if the sketch is gonna be No, that's okay. It was a great show, man. So those are, in my opinion, those are the two greatest sketch shows.

4 (22m 37s):
Oh yeah. The cast on. That's absolutely insane.

3 (22m 40s):
I mean, think of that cast. Just the fucking Fly Girls. Is Jennifer Lopez like what? Yeah, she's like one of the dancing girls. Yeah. What kind of a cast do

4 (22m 48s):
You have? Doesn't sing, doesn't say anything.

3 (22m 50s):
Jennifer Lopez like in the background, how much talent did they have on that fucking show? Yeah. And Keenan was a great fucking talk show host too. Kena made some great movies and he was, he was great on the Kenan Ivory Wayne show. You know, he was fun man.

4 (23m 5s):
Fire Marshal Bill was based off of the actual West Hollywood fire marshal.

3 (23m 9s):
Yeah. Who got burnt up. Yeah. It was like an electoral thing, right? Yeah.

4 (23m 12s):
So Jim Carrey was trying to like come up with characters while sitting in the phones room at the comedy store. It's like a legendary thing that you hear about, at least back in when I got hired as a phones guy there, 'cause in the hallway, the straight down the hallway, there was this old fire hose that at the time it's gone now I'm positive. But at the time it looked like it hadn't been changed in fucking 40 years. Like this old, it would never work. It was like dried up, old hose wrapped up and you get told the story that Jim Carrey was sitting at that desk facing down that hallway, tapping the pencil on his head, trying to come up with more character ideas. And this burnt up half, half a hair cross-eyed, fucking missing his top lips scars all over.

4 (23m 56s):
One eye closed guy came in checking everything in the electrical sockets and putting butter knives in the side. So shit. And Jim Carrey's just sitting there writing it all down.

3 (24m 6s):
Oh my God. Oh God. The, the store was such a fun place for like chaos and misfits. Oh yeah. It was, we used to always say like we were in the back parking lot. Like some schizophrenic person would come back there. We were like, this place is like a magnet. Yeah. It's a magnet for insane people.

4 (24m 24s):
Yep.

3 (24m 25s):
It really is. Like all across the board. Like the original talent coordinator of the comedy store when, when he got fired and then Duncan became the talent coordinator. I'm like, who the fuck is this guy? When I first talked started talking to Duncan, we became friends from conversations we'd have over the phone. 'cause I'd call him like, Hey man, did you hear this ROAS thing? Like you start telling me.

4 (24m 48s):
Yeah.

3 (24m 48s):
And we'd start talking about wild shit.

4 (24m 51s):
Dude. He's a fucking Genius bro. So I messaged him yesterday 'cause Little Hobo was a guest on Kill Tony and it was so, so funny. I loved it. A lot of people, a lot of the fans hated it 'cause they didn't like Lil Hobos voice, but like, I don't care.

3 (25m 7s):
Yeah, but that's reading comments. Right?

4 (25m 9s):
Exactly. You, you can't Well no, I get my reports from the producers, but yeah, basically. Yeah, they told me that. But they read the

3 (25m 14s):
Comments. Exactly.

4 (25m 15s):
Yeah.

3 (25m 15s):
Don't, don't read the comments.

4 (25m 17s):
But anyway. Yeah. But I loved it so much. I don't give a fuck what the masses say. So I asked Duncan, I go and it is like a leak of information, but I don't care. I asked Duncan yesterday, I go, Hey, I want little hobo to make a, a video that's gonna air during the arena. Like he's taking over the Chae for a second. Can we come over and shoot just a quick hour shoot anytime this week. You name it, we'll show up. He goes, Lil Hobos agent is with CAA. His name's Steven Lebowitz. He's been a real little hobos, been a real diva lately. And he started sending me AI songs that he can make in like two minutes about how I'm not gonna do this and I'm bigger than everything.

3 (25m 58s):
He just sent me one, he just sent me some AI songs. Oh.

4 (26m 1s):
Oh, it's, they're all,

3 (26m 2s):
I didn't even listen to it. Hysterical. Should we listen to it here? Yeah. Hold on a second.

4 (26m 7s):
He sent me like seven songs. He's like, Lil Hobo is making an album so he is probably not gonna wanna work with you. He goes, he goes, he was complaining the other day that you stole his idea for a variety show. All these

3 (26m 20s):
Texts. Okay. The healthy lifestyle. He said, dude, I found an AI that instantly makes songs about anything you want. And made this in less than a minute. Yeah. So let's hear it. Let's hear it. I haven't heard it yet.

11 (26m 32s):
I got a story to tell about a man named David Lucas. Yeah, he's doing well. He's a leader, a motivator, A true inspiration. I was preaching by health. No exaggeration. He wakes up every morning, hits the gym real hard, lifting the weights, running miles. He's a health rock star. But it's not just about the physical now, it's more than that. He promotes eating clean. Gotta fuel your body fat. David, Luke is showing us the way the box that will keeping healthy every day. Gotta eat right. Gotta exercise. No doubt. He's the one that's pushing us to work.

3 (27m 6s):
It made it in less than a minute. He said,

4 (27m 8s):
David Lucas eat clean. Oh my

3 (27m 12s):
God. Imagine David Lucas made a 180.

4 (27m 15s):
Oh he's imagine, imagine if he made a, he's about four 80. Right. But

3 (27m 19s):
Imagine if he made a 180.

4 (27m 21s):
It'd be great. I hope so. I love it. I, I'd love a story like that. Love I mean I'd get to make fun of all the extra skin hanging off of his body. He would think the jokes would end. They would just begin. Yeah.

3 (27m 32s):
He would have to have an operation. Yeah. That's a heavy operation too. Your skin is an organ. People don't like to think about it that way. But if, if your organ has to get caught open and pieced back together, well that's real shit. That's real shit. And you run the risk of infection and infections can fucking kill you, man. Like you shouldn't take that kind of surgery lightly. One guy apparently avoided that. And this is like don don't know if he's like, see people have different genetics apparently when it comes to skin, which is why some women get crazy stretch marks and some women don't.

4 (28m 10s):
Yeah.

3 (28m 10s):
You know, some dudes they, they get real fat and then they lose the weight and then they look great and ripped and other dudes have all this like weird extra skin. Even guys that don't lose too much weight if you lose like a hundred pounds or 50 pounds, like some guys have like crazy extra skin. Like dudes that I know and other guys just like you don't look like you're ever fat. This is crazy. So this dude apparently went on a water fast for 365 days. He was really fat and he just had IV vitamins and water First of all what kind of discipline? How do you have the kind of discipline to do that? He went from 382 days, excuse me, without eating.

3 (28m 52s):
Okay. In 19 65, 20 7-year-old Angus, he fasted for one year in 17 days, ate no food at all and lost 125 kilograms, which is 19.7 stone. Oh no. Everyone knows what that is.

4 (29m 6s):
Yeah. I have no idea. Fuck idea.

3 (29m 8s):
1 25 kilograms. It's like, I think it's 2.2. So that would be 2 300, 300 pounds. What does that weigh? What does 125 kilograms in pounds?

4 (29m 21s):
2.2. I think that'd be like two 60 ish.

3 (29m 24s):
Two 70. Two 70. Okay. So he lost. He lost that much. So you lost 270 pounds. Jesus Christ. He weighed like four 80 or something like that. Okay. Angus reportedly sick of being obese. So he checked into the University Department of Medicine at the Royal Infirmary of Dundee. He weighed 207 kilograms. So that's 440. 450. What is 207 kilograms? Yeah, roughly that. Roughly four 50. He told hospital staff, he was ready to cut out food altogether. So doctors happily agreed to monitor his progress. Oh. So he did it with the doctors. He's like, I don't want to eat anymore. Wow.

3 (30m 4s):
That's crazy. They didn't expect a fast to last long. But they thought that a short fast would help him to lose some weight to compensate for his lack of nutrients. He was prescribed multivitamins to take regularly, including potassium and sodium as well as yeast. As days turned to weeks, angus's persistence increased. The Scott wanted to teach his reach, his reported ideal weight of 180 pounds. Wow. So he kept going much to his doctor's surprise. Angus would attend hospital visits frequently and often stay overnight. He received regular blood tests, all which revealed his body was remarkably functioning just fine. As weeks turned into months, he compensated for his lack of food by drinking more black tea, black coffee, and sparkling water.

3 (30m 44s):
All of which are calorie free. His body began to adapt to the lack of food by burning its own fat stores for energy. For the last eight months, Angus's blood glucose levels were consistently very low. Two millimole per liter. But Scott did not suffer any adverse effects. As a result in the final few months, he began to have a pinch of sugar or milk in his tea and coffee. For those wondering, he went through the toilet every 40 to 50 days. He shit every 50 days. What is he shitting? Yeah. If you don't eat for 150 days, what are you shitting? Angus eventually called it quits after 3 82 days having finally reached his dream weight of 180 pounds.

3 (31m 27s):
Wow. According to Chicago Chapin report, he had forgotten the taste of food before his first meal. After the fast he ate a boiled egg with a slice of bread and butter for his first breakfast. Telling reporters I thoroughly enjoyed my egg. and I feel very full. Wow.

4 (31m 46s):
Yeah. That's weird.

3 (31m 48s):
I just, I wonder what happened to him after that. If he kept it off.

4 (31m 51s):
He said he died or five years later He was 192.

3 (31m 56s):
He died.

4 (31m 57s):
How old was he? Just say he died. Oh, he remained at a comfortable weight five years later. Oh 1 96.

3 (32m 3s):
So he only gained 16 pounds from eating. That's pretty amazing. It's weird that

4 (32m 6s):
They switched to pounds there at the end. Yeah.

3 (32m 8s):
That is weird. Yeah. Is that an English article? I don't I mean, what's the article? diabetes.co.uk. Yeah. Yeah. U uk. They're weird over there. They spelled tires with a y. Like what are you doing? Can we agree? Isn't this the English language? Yeah. We invented tires bitch. We

12 (32m 27s):
Did America. Henry Ford. Really? don don't know. Good. I think we had invented BS

3 (32m 35s):
Goodrich. Well Henry Ford invented the car. But I feel like there was a French guy that came along before Henry Ford that invented the internal combustion engine. Is that correct? Like who? Who invented the internal combust? Who invented the very first automobile? Ford was the first to manufacture it.

6 (32m 54s):
Yeah. You have just fixed the assembly line. Right. Who invented

4 (33m 2s):
I know in Akron, Ohio? They mastered the tire. They're still kicking 'em out there. That's where the big Goodyear factory is. Yeah. Yeah. BF Goodrich all

6 (33m 11s):
You know, four people popped up.

3 (33m 12s):
You know what's really weird about tires? They have 'em figured out a way to not have them be filled with air and have them perform as good as the ones that are filled with air. It's a stupid thing. First. Commercially successful internal combustion engines created by, say that guy's name UA around 1860. Is that in France? Is that the French guy? I

6 (33m 35s):
Guess we have four people's names popped

3 (33m 36s):
Up. Oh, different guys who made it I know

4 (33m 38s):
Why I'm guessing the guy with the last name Otto. Probably did.

3 (33m 41s):
I like that guy's name. Yeah. Just 'cause I can't say it. 1860. Okay. First modern internal combustion engine known as the Auto Engine. It's located 1876. So one guy created it and the other guy's like I could do it better. And then he made it better. Which is what always happens. Internal bus engine usually refers to an it and it's like, that's just what always happens. You know the

6 (34m 6s):
Diesel engine was invented by Rudolph Diesel. Mm.

4 (34m 8s):
Ooh that's a good name for it.

3 (34m 10s):
Oh no shit. Yeah. Diesel. I'm wondering if Shaq knows that. You think he changed his name?

6 (34m 18s):
He's got so many nicknames.

4 (34m 20s):
Shaq. Yeah. Yeah.

6 (34m 22s):
He's actually really good at making 'em up too. But

3 (34m 24s):
He's got, yeah, Shaq's the fucking man. Yeah. You ever wanna feel tiny shake that dude's hand? He's like shaking a person like a whole person instead of a hand. He's so

4 (34m 33s):
Big. It's insane.

3 (34m 35s):
He's so big. The

4 (34m 36s):
Rock was huge too.

3 (34m 37s):
Yeah. How fun was it to work out with a rock? I called Tony Hinchcliffe at like 10 o'clock in the morning. I'm like, what are you doing?

4 (34m 43s):
It's crazy.

3 (34m 44s):
You wanna work out with a rock

4 (34m 45s):
Today? I was so hungover. It was hilarious. I'm like, I remember like I was still on my side when I took the call. 'cause your phone rings a long way to the top. If you wanna rock and roll. I'm like, oh shit. What is this gonna be? I'm like, yo. He's like, you wanna work out with the Rock? I'm like, yes. It's like up.

3 (35m 4s):
I really feel like sometimes that we're not really doing this.

4 (35m 9s):
Dude, it's so funny you mention that. Literally last night in the fucking green room of the mothership, I go, I'm talking to Hank Big Hank is sitting there 'cause he's a big Sopranos fan and I Go, dude, I did this podcast with the kids from The Sopranos a few days ago. and it was like we grew up together. It was like we're brothers and sisters because we are all the same age. and I kind of lived very different but kind of the same way was living vicariously that type of life but different. But with them growing up, it was a show that I could relate to. and I go. I think I'm like running out of like cool things to manifest. Like I can't, I don't even know what's left for me.

4 (35m 51s):
And right then Brigham brings in some guy who I don't recognize immediately and I shake his hand and I'm like, damn man, look at you. I feel like you've killed a lot of people. Or something like that. I said I was just being goofy. And Brigham goes, you know, Ray and I realize it's Ray Mysterio Jr. One of the greatest wrestlers of all time, who I've been watching for three fucking decades. Multi-time heavyweight champion. And he's famously the small guy. So for me and Matt, Edgar and every fucking guy just under 40, that wasn't huge. Or like physically gifted. He was one of our guys. I mean that's who you like cheered for.

4 (36m 32s):
He was known as the giant killer. 'cause he would beat the big guys. He beat guys that were seven feet tall. He would shock them doing little guy shit. and I didn't even recognize him at first.

3 (36m 43s):
In my day, there were two guys that I really loved. The number one guy was Jimmy Super Fly, snuck up.

4 (36m 49s):
Fuck yeah. Oh I remember.

3 (36m 51s):
And Superfly would get on that top rope. Yeah. And he would do this. Yeah. And he'd fucking fly off and body like, what is that called when you land on someone

4 (36m 60s):
That's technically a full body press?

3 (37m 2s):
Full body press.

4 (37m 4s):
Ah yeah. He would actually, the full body press is when you lift them over your head and do that. Which you would also do. So

3 (37m 9s):
When you throw yourself, that's a splash through the air. A splash. Yeah. So that was Jimmy Super Fly. Snuck a move. Yeah. When he would get on the top rope there, would he go crazy? Oh yeah. And the other guy was Bob Bland. Yeah. And the reason why I like Bob Bland, I'm like, I bet Bob Bland, fuck all these dudes up because I understood technique. Yeah. Because I was like, no, no, no. That's a real wrestler. Like look how he moves. He moves like a real wrestler. All those other guys are doing crazy shit. See if Jimmy Super Fly Snuck did it off the fucking top of the cage. That's so insane. How bad is that for your knees and your back and your brain? The size of him. He was fucking huge dude. Oh yeah. But Bob, guess some Bob Bland. Show me some Bob Bland. Oh man. I hate Bob Bland was a legit wrestler.

4 (37m 48s):
I, he played his role so perfectly. 'cause I hated him when I was a kid. I was part of that last regime where he was still there when I was like 3, 4, 5, 6. Yeah. And Hogan was just about to beat him and start like taking over. But he was just this old boring with his blue tights and blue knee pads. Right. And like, like a real athlete, white shoes athlete. Yeah. And I'm just like, who is this guy? That's

3 (38m 11s):
What I

4 (38m 11s):
Like. Yeah. It wasn't my thing as a kid. I needed something larger than life.

3 (38m 16s):
No, I like that dude who looks like a regular athlete. Like this guy. Oh yeah. Back

4 (38m 21s):
When This

3 (38m 21s):
Is him. Way after I remember seeing him. I, but I remember seeing him and like right away I'm like, oh that's a real wrestler. That guy's gonna fuck that dude up. That's a real wrestler. Yeah. If you know wrestling, like that's what a fucking killer's built. Like look

4 (38m 36s):
At like Fluker looking at this guy. Like what the fuck

3 (38m 38s):
Are you? Killers are never built like that except for Brock. Brock is the only guy who's like a killer. Well even even Alexander Carlan who's the great, he wasn't built like a bodybuilder. What is that move? It's a nonsense. Fucking in. Insane. It's a nonsense move. It's nonsense.

4 (39m 0s):
Yeah. Oh. Oh. The old you mentioned that working in a fight and everybody just going, oh,

3 (39m 6s):
Just tapping your butt. How about that move? Why doesn't anybody do that in a fight?

4 (39m 11s):
The old sunset flip.

3 (39m 12s):
Oh it didn't work.

4 (39m 13s):
I know all the names of these stupid moves. By the way, however, I do not know these. This is, this

3 (39m 17s):
Is so entertaining. He gets off. I can't fucking believe this. This is such bullshit.

4 (39m 21s):
I'm outta here. But he's gotta make

3 (39m 23s):
The 10 count so mad.

4 (39m 25s):
He's gotta make the 10 count. He's gotta turn it around. Look at that. There you

3 (39m 28s):
Go. Glorious haircut. He's got, my God, if I had hair, I'd grow it like that. I'd full Teo on it. Fuck

4 (39m 36s):
Yeah. Absolutely. Come on. You want a piece of me?

3 (39m 41s):
Lemme see. Show me some Bob Blin in his prime. Yeah,

4 (39m 44s):
Because that was

3 (39m 45s):
Video

6 (39m 45s):
I pulled up was 1980 and it was a video of him and Hulk Hogan. Which I, I, this is not the Hulk Hogan I know he comes out in this giant cape.

4 (39m 53s):
Oh yeah. This is pre everybody's a star.

3 (39m 58s):
Hulk Hogan's the fucking man. Oh yeah. How cool was it hanging out with that guy?

4 (40m 2s):
Well, so what's interesting is after hanging out with him and the Rock, it's really interesting to see how blatant his spinal injury is. 'cause you can see after hanging out with the rock, the four or five inches that Hogan lost. Yeah. 'cause like I showed you when we were in here with Hogan, their face off where they're truly eye to eye is legendary. Well I met and now they're not. I met

3 (40m 25s):
Hulk when he was at Full Height. Oh okay. I met him out outside of a cigar bar in Beverly Hills in like the nineties. Wow. Something like that. Yeah. It was early on. It was only what, I'd only been in Hollywood for a couple years and I remember going Jesus Christ. Yeah. He was so big. And then the next time I met him, did you ever see that UFC thing I did with him?

4 (40m 46s):
No. What did you guys do

3 (40m 49s):
Dude, find that Joe Rogan interviews Hulk Hogan for UFC. Wow. It was when the UFC like Spike TV had wrestling on. And so Hulk Hogan came to do a promo with me and him and I got to interview him. Wow. Oh dude. I went full pro wrestling. Really? Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You lemme see it. Oh fuck it.

4 (41m 10s):
You didn't mention this to me. All the arguments we used to have about pro wrestling,

3 (41m 13s):
I went full pro wrestling. I was in on it. I was what? Yeah, yeah, yeah. You gotta watch. Watch how I do it. Oh

4 (41m 20s):

3 (44m 59s):
Yeah. We did the tabatas and the bag at the end. Yeah. It was fun. And then the Rock did three minutes in the cold punch. First time we hit ever been in a cold punch. Yeah. Which is very impressive. Yeah. 'cause my first time I was like, get me outta here. Yeah. Like what the

4 (45m 13s):
Fuck? and I did three minutes, 10 seconds only 'cause I knew I could do longer than the Rock and the sa and have bragging rights in the sauna for 20 minutes.

3 (45m 21s):
You gotta be in the sauna with Brian Simpson. He's always looking for a way to get out. Oh, I forgot my socks. He'll clap out your socks. You don't need your socks. Brian has always got like some fucking new reason to get outta sauna.

4 (45m 39s):
He's so funny

3 (45m 39s):
Dude. He's got a sneeze.

4 (45m 41s):
He is so funny with all that shit

3 (45m 44s):
He got in the other day with his shirt with like his workout clothes on. I go, you gonna, you gonna sit in the sauna with your clothes on? He goes, yeah, I should probably take him off. And then he gets out and I go and I told him at the end we were like, you gotta stay an extra 30 seconds bro. Yeah. This is bullshit. You keep leaving.

4 (45m 59s):
Oh, he's a sly dog. He knows exactly what he is doing. I, I caught him sneaking a cookie the other day outta that Eddie B's bag in the green room. I've been eating clean. I'm at four days no carbs and I walk in. He is just got a cookie sha eating. It's so funny to keep an eye on because I love it. You know, I like I know my vices. Right. I know I smoke too many cigarettes. I know I drink too much coffee. Whatever they may be right. I have a couple drinks every night. But he's funny 'cause it's like, and I love those people. David Lucas exactly the same thing. You know what I mean? It's like I

3 (46m 35s):
Lost 35 pounds

4 (46m 37s):
Every time

3 (46m 38s):
We were in the green room the other day. I go, how do you know? I go, did you have a fucking supermarket scale at your house? The fuck are you talking about? My scale didn't go that high. There's no way you know how much you weigh. You are not investing in that kind of property that, that kind of machinery.

4 (46m 56s):
Oh God. It

3 (46m 57s):
Kills How much is like a regular scale goes to 300 pounds. Right,

4 (47m 0s):
Right. Yeah. No, we actually, like

3 (47m 2s):
Joey used to talk about that. I can't get on a fucking regular scale. Joe Rogan. It's time to lose weight. Yeah. When he first got on Weight Watchers, Joey was like, fucking regular scales don't work.

4 (47m 10s):
Yeah. We were doing fat People weigh-ins live on Kill Tony at one point. And we have a scale now that goes up to four. But it's very hard to find it very. Yeah. Those are like rare and

3 (47m 22s):
That ain't gonna work either. Right. Like what Ralph, you make it got on it. Right? Yeah. Someone's bigger than that. You need like a supermarket scale. Yeah. They put sides of beef on and shit. Yeah. Did you see those, these like these five or four fitness influencers that are like, not fitness influencers, body positive influencers that are telling people like, you know, you could be as fat as you want. They're all dead. They all died. Like within Blair. Blair White has a, here I'll send it to you. Jamie Blair White has this clip. It's fucking, it's, it's mean. But it's also hilarious. 'cause it's just like, oh God. Like yeah. It's not good to be that big Kids just not like, no matter what anybody tells you, if you have a fat doctor, like no matter who it is, that's just a, a massive strain on your body that you really don't need.

3 (48m 12s):
You shouldn't have. It's not something that's normal. It's something that's insane. It's something that's only existed with human beings over the last, you know, 50, 60 years. People were never that big. Jesus Christ.

4 (48m 24s):
I was at a Starbucks at the airport this weekend in Florida and one of the baristas was double masked and I could just see the top of her head. 'cause she was like behind the espresso machine and it looked like a thick head. And then she, and I'm like, 'cause you know I'm intrigued by Oh yeah, the entire thing. I see a double mask. I'm like, what's going on here? And then she moved away for a second to go grab another cup and she was huge. Hugely massively obese. And I'm like, oh, okay. All right. So

3 (48m 55s):
Did you find it? Yeah. There it is. Thank you. Double

4 (48m 58s):
Mask. But unhealthy as fuck.

3 (49m 3s):
But the Instagram one is funny because it's like he's dead. She's dead. They're dead. I'm trying to find it. I swo, I saved it. I love that you can save things on Instagram because Tom and I have this thing we do every day. We send each other the worst shit we find. It's a real problem because like neither one of us is gonna tap out and everyone is trying to find like the most fucked up things. Instagram is they're, they're showing you some of the most fucking insane things. Oh yeah. They're showing you so many insane things. Oh, I love it.

3 (49m 44s):
Murders, car accidents, people getting crushed at construction sites. Like, God damn. Yeah. There's so much. Here it is. I found it jam.

4 (49m 57s):
They are, they're on a whole new level,

3 (49m 59s):
But I don't understand how it's getting through. Like they must know that all that stuff is being shared, but they must also know that they're getting so many clicks from that that they have to like allow it to stay on. They have to, they must know.

4 (50m 14s):
Yeah. It's being shared like crazy. Oh,

3 (50m 16s):
Tom and I are like every day dude.

4 (50m 18s):
Yeah. Every day me and Adam get me and Yoni. I have a, I have a ton of 'em. I mean Shane. Shane's a fun one. Anything,

15 (50m 27s):
A big fruit loop.

16 (50m 29s):
He's dead. Join me on my fat positive radio show. Which didn't last long because she died

17 (50m 36s):
Just because I'm fat. That doesn't invalidate the things that I

16 (50m 39s):
Say. She died. You ready to get supersized? She died too

3 (50m 45s):
May.

15 (50m 46s):
I've got the big

3 (50m 47s):
Fruit loop. Yeah, that's it.

16 (50m 48s):
He's dead.

3 (50m 49s):
Join

4 (50m 50s):
Like, love it.

3 (50m 51s):
Jesus Christ.

4 (50m 52s):
It's real. People need to see that.

3 (50m 55s):
It's one of the worst things. Being overweight is one of the worst things for your health. Yeah. It's one, it's a, it's a constant tax on your body. If we're all

4 (51m 1s):
Born with the same size heart and you have to lug around all that shit and other people don't, it's pretty blatant.

3 (51m 8s):
Also, if you lose the weight, you'll have amazing leg muscles. I was saying that Totoro and he showed me his calves Stavros. His calves are like watermelons. Yeah, they're

4 (51m 16s):
Giant. He's got calves on those cows.

16 (51m 18s):
Yeah.

4 (51m 19s):
He's a big boy.

3 (51m 20s):
Yeah. He's a big fella.

4 (51m 22s):
Sweating. Well,

3 (51m 22s):
If you're carrying around that much extra weight, like boy, if you lost the weight, you'd be so fit. You'd be so strong. Yeah. You'd get into Muay Thai. Be fucking people

4 (51m 31s):
Up. He's into pad tie ba

3 (51m 33s):
You

4 (51m 33s):
Can't, can't help myself myself.

3 (51m 35s):
It's always there. That's so quick.

4 (51m 37s):
Oh man. Kill Tony taped a, we just mass taped a bunch of episodes of Kill Tony so that we could take a few weeks off after these arenas. And so I'm in like,

3 (51m 48s):
Yeah.

4 (51m 49s):
Zip, zip, zip.

3 (51m 50s):
Yeah. Full on mode. Oh yeah. Didn. You do two last night? Yeah.

4 (51m 52s):
Two last night and two the night before. Some epic moments. Perhaps one of the greatest, and this is me tooting my own horn, but one of my greatest interviews ever with a big trans comedian. Like a hefty, looked like a hundred percent. Like, just like a big woman steps up and goes, Hey, so here we go. And like the whole room has its attention. Where at first we were funny. Okay. Very new. Very, very, very new. But I will say this is rolled with everything. It's, it's an epic interview because I'm going pretty hard because she's laughing at everything and I find it to be like, okay, we have this.

4 (52m 35s):
And everybody wanted it, and everybody needed it, and it makes her look good. And everyone won. Nice. But there was a part where I literally go, so I gotta ask, and this might be disrespectful. What direction are we going here? What did you start as? And what are you going for? I know you're trans, but like, don, don't even know. Are you this boy to girl? Girl to boy. Oh man. And she's laughing too, because

3 (52m 58s):
It's like,

4 (52m 58s):
That's funny. She knows what's

3 (52m 60s):
Up. I'm sure you're aware of this. But that lady got arrested who was on your show saying that she stormed the Capitol. Yeah. The, the feds came and got her. They're like, oh yeah.

4 (53m 9s):
I found out about this last night in the middle of a show, but didn't even have time to think about it. Or read the articles.

3 (53m 15s):
Yeah. That they're going hard after people that went into the capitol,

4 (53m 19s):
Redban mentioned that it may have been because of our show.

3 (53m 21s):
It is because of your show, really? Yes. Yeah. That's how the, the Feds are watching the show. Oh my God. Shout out to the FBI. I swear to God I wasn't there. I wouldn't go there. I'm not into that. It's not my thing.

4 (53m 35s):
Damn. That's wild. Oh man. It got her in. Well, she got her in trouble.

3 (53m 41s):
Yeah. It's not good to brag about breaking into the fucking capitol. I was first wave up the stairs, she shout, shouted the microphone. January 6th. Video footage shows I took a little pepper spray. I didn't think I'd ever be sprayed by cops in my own country. I support the police arrest warrant states the FBI confirmed the couple's identity through cell phone and credit card records, flight and hotel bookings and physical surveillance of their Santa Yez home, who failed their homes in June. Jones defended her actions while speaking at a comedy show in Austin Jones said she, she did not do anything that she thought was illegal. She only entered a public section of the building, not a private office or any other restrict restricted area.

3 (54m 22s):
I've been to the Capitol multiple times. There's never been any reason not to go in. Well, that's just, that's just dumb. That's just being dumb. If you see a mob storming into the capitol, like, don't go in there, Don go in there. Because didn't they arrest people that didn't go in?

4 (54m 39s):
I think so.

3 (54m 40s):
Yeah. Well, they put that one dude in jail from Infowars. What is his name? Owen. Owen some, I forget how to pronounce his last name, but he, I think he went to jail for like seven months and he was never even there. What did he go to jail for? It says two months. Two months. Was he sentenced for seven months or was it 70 days?

6 (55m 0s):
Prosecutors said he quote, helped create by spewing violent rhetoric and spreading baseless claims of election fraud to hundreds of thousands of viewers.

3 (55m 9s):
Wow.

6 (55m 10s):
Pled guilty to illegally entering a restricted area.

3 (55m 13s):
What area is that? So did he go into the

6 (55m 17s):
Capitol? Says he didn't enter the capitol, but he let a march to the building and led rioters and chants. Yeah.

3 (55m 23s):
Hmm.

6 (55m 23s):
He's only so this, he's among only a few people charged in the riot who neither went inside the building, nor were accused of engaging in violence or destruction.

3 (55m 33s):
Here is where he fucked up. Should have joined the FBI first. If he joined the FBI and then did that, they'd be like, good job. You got everybody to go in there.

4 (55m 43s):
Crazy I don know what's gonna happen next. The reason why I didn't get to read about that article is 'cause when I checked the news right before bed after a long night last night, all I could see was that Colorado voted to have Trump off the ballot.

3 (55m 57s):
There's so much wild shit going on, dude,

4 (55m 58s):
That, that there and I rarely am like, oh no, with the news. But that one there scares me. The

3 (56m 6s):
Guy that did X Mina just did a, a new movie called Civil War that's coming

4 (56m 11s):
Out. This, this is what I'm, that's that's exactly what I pictured when I saw you seen the trailer.

3 (56m 14s):
Uhuh. Let's play the trailer. 'cause it looks dope. And that ex Mina guy, what is his name? Jamie. Alex Garland. Alex Garland. He's the shit that Exm is one of my all time favorite movies. That movie gives me the creeps every time I watch it. Yeah. Because I'm like, if I was that guy and that robot was talking to me, I'd get seduced too. Yep. She's so hot. She's so hot. And she knows how to pull strings.

18 (56m 36s):
The United States Army ramps up activity.

19 (56m 38s):
The White House issued warnings to the Western forces as well as the Florida Alliance. The

18 (56m 43s):
Return president assures the uprising will be dealt with swiftly.

20 (56m 47s):
Let me know if you wanna try anything wrong. I guess. Aware. There's like a pretty huge civil war going on all across America. We

21 (56m 53s):
Just try to stay out with what we see on the news. Seems like it's for the best

22 (57m 4s):
Citizens of America. The so-called Western forces of Texas and California have suffered a very great defeat at the hands of the United States military.

20 (57m 18s):
Mr. President, do you regret the use of airstrikes against American citizens? We're moving to DC today. We need to go down there. They shoot journalists on site in the capitol. Every instinct in, he says, this is death flooded.

23 (57m 37s):
Every time I survived the war song, I thought I was sending a warning home. Don't do this. But here we are.

20 (57m 47s):
There's some kind of misunderstanding here. What? Who you American. Okay. Okay. What kind of American are you? You don't know. The Western horses will reach the White House on July 4th.

3 (58m 11s):
Yeah, bro, this can really happen. You tell me that dude who said, what kind of American are you telling me he doesn't have a Trump flag in his truck? What are you doing? Those are the people with the guns. You, you, you're picking a fight with them. If you really think, if they really think rather that you're trying to steal the government, they really think you're trying to subvert democracy. Yeah. By using the 14th amendment, which is insurrection, which I believe Check this, make sure this is correct. I believe they created that amendment because of the Civil War. and I believe they created that amendment to keep people that fought against the Union Army from holding elected office.

3 (58m 56s):
Yeah. I'm pretty sure that's what it was.

4 (58m 58s):
Yeah. Former officer, officers of the Confederate army.

3 (59m 1s):
I think anybody who was in the Confederate army, I think anybody who was in the insurrection, like say if you, I I think even if you were a soldier, I think it was to stop that.

20 (59m 10s):
Yeah.

3 (59m 10s):
Which is why the meanwhile it's a, it's a legal term. Again, don don't know if you know this, but I'm not a legal scholar.

20 (59m 18s):
Right, right.

3 (59m 20s):
I think the term is very specific, like what it means. So Trump has neither been indicted nor convicted for insurrection. Right. But if you're pulling him off the ballot for insurrection,

4 (59m 35s):
That seems

3 (59m 35s):
Crazy.

4 (59m 36s):
And again, it's like, of course every other state with a democratic or liberal leaning supreme court is gonna follow this lead. They don't want to be behind Colorado. They're gonna go, we have to show, show America that we're more, we're more woke than, we're more aware than Colorado. Let's get, let's do this.

3 (59m 56s):
If that happens, that's a very scary thing. That's very scary. Because regardless of what you think about Trump as a personality, and this, this air quotes threat to democracy. What is democracy? If it's not people having the ability to choose an elected leader? What, what is democracy like? What are you saying? Threat to What If you are literally subverting democracy because you think someone's a threat to democracy, you are a threat to democracy. 100%. Just by what you're doing. Yeah. You just because people believe that this one person is absolutely the, that's the whole reason why people have elections.

3 (1h 0m 39s):
One case, one group has to make a case that they would be better leaders and they have a better PA plan. They have a better path forward for America if you think they're wrong. The whole idea of democracy is you're supposed to have a better case. You're suppo. That's what the debates are for. That's what the campaign trail is for. And when they stand in front of the people and they tell the people, when I become president, I will fix this and I will fix that. And everybody goes, yay. That's what they're doing. Now if you're saying that they can't do that, that's a threat to democracy. If you're saying they can't state their case, if you're can't saying they can't, they literally can't be on the ballot.

4 (1h 1m 20s):
Right.

3 (1h 1m 20s):
That's because it's insane. Yeah. and it, four out of four outta seven chose that four said yes. Three said no,

6 (1h 1m 29s):
It's crazy.

3 (1h 1m 29s):
Is that correct? Three or two. Four. Three said yes. Two said no,

6 (1h 1m 32s):
It was four to three. Four

3 (1h 1m 33s):
To three. So four said, four said yes. Three said no. Check an

6 (1h 1m 36s):
Article the BBC put out.

3 (1h 1m 38s):
What does it say

6 (1h 1m 39s):
It's for? For now, this only is for the state's primary election. It's gonna probably be held up in court for appeals past the deadline, which is January 4th. So it might not matter.

3 (1h 1m 55s):
Why would it not matter?

6 (1h 1m 56s):
Because it's, it's gonna have, it wouldn't affect his ability to be on the primary ballot is according to what this is saying. If it doesn't go in effect until January 4th, then it's held up in court because of an appeal, then they can't block him from being on that ballot. It's also not for the presidential ballot, which would

3 (1h 2m 10s):
Be in November. It's one thing if there was no allegations of criminal activity from the current president, you know, if the, the current president is someone like Barack Obama, you know, who is way better president than by everyone's account. The way holds whether or not you believe his policies, whether or not you think that he did a good job with whatever, with drone attacks and, you know, whistleblowers all the things that he said he was gonna do that he didn't do. If that put that aside just as a spokesperson. Right. Just as a representative of the country. A guy smarter than us who's out there who speaks, measured and calm, A real statesman.

3 (1h 2m 52s):
But you don't even have that. Like you got this guy who's

4 (1h 2m 56s):
Dead shell of a old sea shell.

3 (1h 2m 58s):
And on top of that, there's a bunch of shit that he's involved with that looks super sketchy A bunch. Oh yeah. A bunch of things.

4 (1h 3m 7s):
Oh yeah.

3 (1h 3m 8s):
There's so many business dealings.

4 (1h 3m 9s):
The money that we've given to Ukraine is just crazy. and I, we weren't really hearing of Ukraine until before he was president. His son's dealings with Ukraine. And then all this stuff with Ukraine starts happening and they get hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars.

3 (1h 3m 27s):
I think it's over a hundred billion. But here's a question. 'cause someone was, they were just talking about this today. Are we really funding a portion of their government? Are we funding our as American taxpayers? I think what this person was saying was that we are funding a percentage of their schools, their elected officials. We're, we're funding a certain percentage of that too. We're like keeping their government afloat.

4 (1h 3m 54s):
It seems like it I mean who wouldn't move some money from that account into other accounts?

3 (1h 3m 58s):
No, but I think that's, that's part of the deal. That's, that's like above board. Yeah. Forget about what's, what's happening. Right. Where money's getting siphoned off. So it's

4 (1h 4m 7s):
Like known that we're funding their government. I

3 (1h 4m 10s):
Think so. That's what this person was saying. I don't know if it's correct. That's why Jamie's gotta get on it. Damn. But it's one of those things where it's like, wait a minute, when does this end? Yeah. Is this another one of them? 20 year deals is another one of those Afghanistan deals. Have you ever seen the breakdown of the amount of money that we spent in Ukraine and what that could have done for America? It's insane. It could have given everyone in Maui, like some, in everyone who lost their homes, some insane amount of money, rebuilt Maui many times over. It could have fixed all of our infrastructure. It could have secured the wall.

3 (1h 4m 51s):
It could have, it could have, there's like so much money that have gone into education, homelessness, all these different problems that we have in America that are like key problems that keep coming up over and over and over again. It makes you wonder. It really does. 'cause if they, they really did spend a hundred and whatever billion dollars in Ukraine that they could have spent in America. What if someone did that? What if someone said, yeah, I know this is gonna raise taxes. I know this is gonna raise inflation. But if we spend this money in America and we fix all these problems, the next generation come coming up, we've showed statistically we will be 20% better off.

3 (1h 5m 35s):
We'll have 20% less crime. We'll have 20% less incarcerations. If they, they could come up with some, some number that they could show you. Everybody would be kind of like, yeah, yeah. Taxes are more, but this is, this is a real plan to like actually rebuild America. And there's discussions of it on the news every day. There's people like, fuck rebuilding America. What we need to do is this and that and that and this and green energy and all this shit. If, if there was that and this was our dispute, how much better would the world be? Yeah.

4 (1h 6m 6s):
It would take a businessman who's like anti-war and could bring like peace to the Middle East and have all the other crazy world leaders in Czech.

3 (1h 6m 14s):
Yeah. Have you, did you see Vivek Grandma Swami? You know who that guy? Oh yeah. I. don Van Jones. Oh yeah. Listened to his speech was saying that it's like he's gonna be around 50 years longer than Trump. And so he does a speech out. He goes, van Jones, shut the fuck up.

4 (1h 6m 28s):
Oh yeah. Oh boy. And and when I saw that, I'm like more of this dude because

3 (1h 6m 34s):
That's Trump. Trump opened up the door Yeah. To that kinda shit. Yeah. He really did. When there was no politicians before Trump that you ever even sw heard swear.

4 (1h 6m 44s):
Yeah.

3 (1h 6m 44s):
Once when Trump was talking about China, he goes, you can say, you know, we, we, we wanna negotiate. We wanna do this. Or you could say, listen motherfucker. And people are like, yes. Talk like a real person. Yes. Talk like a real person. Yeah. That's what the world is missing. People talking like real people. Right.

4 (1h 7m 5s):
Obama was such a good politician, such a good people speaker that it kind, he kind of like beat the video game. Yeah. Now we need a new video game. You know what I mean? And Trump, was that a real human?

3 (1h 7m 22s):
Have you seen where they face swapped that lady? Who's the White House press secretary with, with Obama? No. It's when she's talking about how there is no evidence at all that Obama is secretly running the government. It's simply not true. and it it's her face swap with Obama. Lemme see if I can find it. I'm pretty sure I saved it. I'm really good at saving all these stupid posts that I find every day. This is why I can't be on this phone. This phone has,

4 (1h 7m 53s):
I didn't even know you could do that. I just, I I go a long way. 'cause I, I'm like an old, old man on Instagram. So I, I mail them to myself.

3 (1h 8m 1s):
That works too. Yeah. But you can have little folders. Like I have little folders. I've had folders for conspiracies. And

4 (1h 8m 9s):
Is that what that like bookmark looking thing is? Yeah.

3 (1h 8m 12s):
Okay. Yeah. You click that. Where is it? What do I have it under? I think I have it under government. I have too many categories. I have disasters. The disasters one is insane. There's so many disasters that you could find on the internet now. Yeah. I'm trying to find,

4 (1h 8m 31s):
I like, I think it's thieves getting fucked or robbers getting fucked where people try to steal things and they run into like a cashier with a gun.

3 (1h 8m 41s):
Oh, those are always fun. Yeah. I have an entire folder dedicated to to Kamala Harris. Oh yeah. All the most ridiculous shit. She says

4 (1h 8m 49s):
Everything. She can't even, she can't do anything. Does she ever said anything? Not crazy. Oh, this is hysterical.

3 (1h 8m 56s):
Yeah. There. Oh, you found it, Jamie. Thank you. So please I mean

24 (1h 8m 59s):
Obama be the hidden puppet master for this administration. But there's no evidence there's wait, wait. There's no evidence. There's no evidence that Obama is Joe's puppet master. There's none. Absolutely none. None. And that is just a fact. You can't say that. It looks like my hair is the dirty mop that janitor is looking for. You can't say that. It looks like I lazily slapped on some of Big Mike's lipstick and horrific

3 (1h 9m 28s):
Ai.

4 (1h 9m 29s):
That's

3 (1h 9m 29s):
Wild. AI is insane. I mean we are gonna have no idea what's real or what's what's fake within a couple of years. Yeah. We don't know. We just don't know. Right. You could have everything from people crying about a crime that never committed. Like you could have a, like a disaster that's fake and a bunch of fake people crying about that disaster and telling their story of what happened. And they're not even real people. They're just all, it's all CGI. You're gonna be able to, like, there's no telling committing crimes, natural disasters. Right. You're never gonna know. Yeah. Speaking of national disasters, do you see that video?

3 (1h 10m 11s):
They got a volcano camera that's pointed at this camera in Iceland and they caught it the moment the volcano erupted. Oh, it's wild. Iceland has some volcano sun and they pop, they popped a a few years back. Remember there the flights were fucked up and no one could fly. Do you remember that

4 (1h 10m 31s):
In Iceland?

3 (1h 10m 32s):
Yeah. If it, when the problem is when they eject all that stuff into the atmosphere, you can't see. Right. So it takes like a long time for that stuff to go down where people could fly. Watch this, watch this. It's really cool. The volcano. Yeah. Went boom. Look at that. That's it. Popping. Isn't that amazing? Wow. They call it the moment it blew. So it's spraying and the video of it going down the mountainside. This is the video of it going down the mountainside. How amazing is that? Man,

4 (1h 11m 3s):
That's crazy.

3 (1h 11m 4s):
The the literal blood of the earth. Yeah. Pouring out of a fucking staph infection. Oh

4 (1h 11m 10s):
My God.

3 (1h 11m 11s):
Look at that. Isn't that incredible? Unbelievable. That's how continents are made kids. Wow. That's how Hawaii got made. Fucking these dudes are just chilling. Eh? It goes off every a couple years.

4 (1h 11m 23s):
So,

3 (1h 11m 24s):
So what happened was that volcano went off and there was a Rolling Stone reporter that was embedded, I think it was in Iraq. And they got too comfortable with this dude being around. And they start 'cause he was there. It was stuck. 'cause he couldn't fly out. So he was there a lot longer than he was supposed to be. And he reported a bunch of shit that they had said about Obama. Is that Mount St. Helen's? Oh, that's the other one. It's the

6 (1h 11m 50s):
2010 eruption.

3 (1h 11m 52s):
Yeah. So this was when it happened. Wow. So I know how to say that. What was the guy's name? The reporter? Michael Hastings. Hastings. So he reported that this general was like being very dismissive of Obama and insulting Obama. And he, he printed it in the Rolling Stone. And so this general had to resign. And so when this general resigned, this guy Hastings is fucked. He's fucked. Right. And he starts saying, Hey, I think people are following me. Think people are trying to kill me.

4 (1h 12m 23s):
He's still in He was still in Iraq at the time.

3 (1h 12m 25s):
No, no. He came back to America. And so he was So listen, so he's saying that, you know, and then his car goes 125 miles an hour on Sunset Boulevard. Right into a tree. Yeah.

4 (1h 12m 40s):
He had an electric car, right?

3 (1h 12m 42s):
Oh, no. Or there was no electric cars back then, or it

4 (1h 12m 44s):
Was

3 (1h 12m 45s):
McChrystal's exit. Yeah. Volcanic intervention. So the volcano blew up and this guy got stuck there. It says the runaway general is the title of this story. And so this guy Michael Hastings, this, this is like the conspiracy theory. Yeah. Because his car goes 125 miles an hour right into a fucking tree. Boom. And blows up the engine was like, it wasn't like a regular accident. Like it was a big one. Like it was a big fucking accident. And either he did it on purpose, like he was trying to kill himself. Like this is, it is a video of it. I mean This dude is fucking flying down the street.

3 (1h 13m 26s):
It's funny

6 (1h 13m 26s):
For your reference. It's in LA off La Brea headed down, down LaBrea. It's August Santa

3 (1h 13m 31s):
Monica. Look at that. Look how fast he's going. Boo. And

6 (1h 13m 34s):
He hit one of those giant palm trees. It's in the middle of the road there.

3 (1h 13m 37s):
And look at that explosion.

4 (1h 13m 39s):
It wasn't, I

3 (1h 13m 40s):
Thought it was on South sunset. It was. It was sunset.

6 (1h 13m 42s):
No, he was going down La Brea South, I

3 (1h 13m 44s):
Believe. Okay.

4 (1h 13m 45s):
It wasn't a self-driving car. No,

3 (1h 13m 47s):
No, no, no, no, no. but it was a Mercedes

6 (1h 13m 49s):
2010. They didn't have

3 (1h 13m 50s):
'em then. No. But what they did have is technology that would allow Right. They had computers and cars back then. Yeah, that's, and so the question was, right, do we have the technology to take over someone's car? All you'd have to do is just make it accelerate. You wouldn't necessarily have to point it towards a tree. Oh yeah. You just have it go 120 miles an hour if you don't care about who hits something. Yeah. If you don't care about the other people, which

4 (1h 14m 15s):
Say it's the middle of the night, which I think this was Right. Right.

3 (1h 14m 18s):
Yeah. You just hit it. Yeah. And then all of a sudden this guy can't slow his car down. It's impossible to slow the car down. It takes over the engine takes over. You don't have to be able to steer it. Right. You don't have to have self steering technology. You just have control the accelerator. Oh yeah. And if you have a computer, if the car is run by a computer, which was this a 2010 car? What kind of car was it? I

6 (1h 14m 39s):
Believe it was a, I have to check now. Hold

3 (1h 14m 42s):
On. I wanna say it was a Mercedes. I know it

6 (1h 14m 43s):
Was a Mercedes. But don don't know that the actual year that the car was,

3 (1h 14m 46s):
Listen, they had that ability back then. They had the ability to do that to the enemy if they want, like if you're in Afghanistan or whatever and you wanna make someone's car, you could rig it like that. I'm sure they could do that. Yeah. Yeah. I mean if there's a computer in the car. 2010. It's not that long ago. Right. Seems like it is. 13 years. Yeah. 13 years ago is crazy to think the technology has moved so far from 13 years ago. Like if it was today, you would say a hundred percent they could do that. Yeah. But I think they could do that 13 years ago. And so that was the big conspiracy theory that they whacked this dude because he got my crystal fired.

4 (1h 15m 26s):
Damn.

3 (1h 15m 27s):
Which they probably did.

4 (1h 15m 30s):
Yeah, they can. And the more we find out they might've, the more it seems like that stuff happens quite a bit. And

3 (1h 15m 36s):
Then there, there was some talk about his blood work. They did blood work on Hastings after he is dead and he tested positive for amphetamines. But the dirty secret about journalists is a lot of them are on Adderall. Yeah. A lot of them, it's how they make deadlines. It it, like for the guys that I know that have taken it, they're, they, they've been pretty forthcoming about it and saying it's fucking, it's a life changer. It's just like, I get so much shit done. of course you're on meth. Yeah. You're on amphetamines. Yeah. So they were saying that he was on amphetamines. He was just cranked out of his mind. And he did that on purpose, which is a possibility. You fucking never know. Sometimes if people think the government's trying to kill him, maybe they crack under pressure.

3 (1h 16m 16s):
Yeah. And they just fucking, I, I can't take this anymore. I'm just gonna drive into a tree.

4 (1h 16m 21s):
That's a weird way to kill yourself.

3 (1h 16m 22s):
It is. But it's not outside the realm of possibility. Right. But also, if you wanted to have a juicy conspiracy narrative, you wanted to go off Sam Tripoli on that. Yeah.

4 (1h 16m 35s):
Very suspicious.

3 (1h 16m 36s):
Yeah. He is very suspicious.

4 (1h 16m 38s):
Especially since he could have killed himself going full Joe versus the volcano. Right. That would've been the classy way to do it when he had a chance. Well,

3 (1h 16m 45s):
He wasn't near the volcano, right? Yeah. If he wanted to take a flight over. Yeah. He can't. Yeah. But he wasn't, he didn't know that they were gonna come for him after that. But that's what they do in that world. They try to take things down. You know, if you're a journalist and you're embedded with these guys and they say something juicy and you can take them down with this juicy thing. This is what you do. Yeah. Whether or not it's good for the country or not. And that guy was beloved, apparently. He was just great general. And all of a sudden he is not a general anymore because of a reporter. Ooh. Right. And and who are his people? The people that are like the professional killers of the world. Yeah. Yeah. That are legally allowed to kill people.

4 (1h 17m 23s):
And secretly, yeah.

3 (1h 17m 25s):
Guess what? Fuck face. Yeah. You just made a big mistake. Yeah. Like, I wish I was his friend. That's a I know that's what your jump is. But you can make a juicy article just about how hard it is over there and how crazy it is over there. Yeah. Wouldn't that be better? Yeah. Wouldn't it be better to like, instead of like some backhanded shit that he's saying to the troops, which they all believe anyway. Right? Like, who, what do you care? Yeah. Don't report that dude. So you're gonna get him in trouble. Yeah. Why would you get that guy in trouble?

4 (1h 17m 52s):
Man?

3 (1h 17m 53s):
It's just such a dangerous game you're playing.

4 (1h 17m 56s):
It is wild. It makes me worry about, you know, I I mean Trump is such a threat, supposedly to the military that wants to do things and he wants to bring them back, which he's proven time and time again. And like don don't know, man,

3 (1h 18m 14s):
There's a fucking hilarious video of Rosie O'Donnell she put up, like she was watching the UFC. She goes, I'm watching the UFC and then Trump comes on and ruins it. Come on UFC. You gotta do better.

4 (1h 18m 27s):
Oh, thank you. She's so bad. Thank you Rosie. So bad. So bad. Everyone at the UFC cares about your opinion.

3 (1h 18m 34s):
But it is not just having that opinion, which is like, I get it. 'cause he said a lot of like fucked up things about Rosie.

4 (1h 18m 38s):
Oh, he ruined her. She's gone. Yeah. Because of

3 (1h 18m 42s):
Him. When Megan Kelly was saying that you've said all these disparaging things about not all women, just Rosie O'Donnell. Boom,

4 (1h 18m 48s):
Boom. She was done. It's

3 (1h 18m 49s):
Like a comic. Yep. I mean it's like a, it's like literally a kill Kill Tony guest. Yep. But have you found the video of her saying it? Yeah. Yeah. Well,

6 (1h 18m 57s):
I, I listened to it. I think it's this one.

3 (1h 18m 59s):
Yeah. That's it. That's it. Ugh. Look

4 (1h 19m 2s):
At

3 (1h 19m 2s):
Her. I like Rosie. Well, you

25 (1h 19m 4s):
Racist maga people.

3 (1h 19m 6s):
No, no. This is it. You're killing cover. No, that's not it. It's to

6 (1h 19m 11s):
That. So maybe she deleted

3 (1h 19m 12s):
Or she might have deleted it. She might have deleted it. That was a hard one, man. Because Leon at the end of the fight when he was talking about his dad, and like, he, he was almost crying when he was talking about him, you know, taking his father's murder and turning it into entertainment and, you know, his voice was cracking. I was like, oh shit. Don't make me cry. Leon. Yeah.

4 (1h 19m 32s):
Yeah. Ugh.

25 (1h 19m 34s):
Trump just arrived at the UFC 2 96 because he loves Kolby Covington.

4 (1h 19m 40s):
Donald Trump's biggest guy.

3 (1h 19m 41s):
King Gacy. It was UFC Do better. I love that.

4 (1h 19m 46s):
Why did they all look alike? Why do all these p why does she look exactly like Keith Berman?

3 (1h 19m 51s):
She doesn't, Keith O. Keith Berman's way more insane than her. He's insane. Did you see Keith Overman went after Riley Gaines?

4 (1h 19m 59s):
Who's Riley Gaines? I think

3 (1h 19m 60s):
Riley Gaines is that lady that lost to Leah Thomas or the one who Yeah. Oh wow. So she's the real like winner. Yeah. Female winner. Yeah. And this male competes as a female and, and, and beats her. And, and so Keith Oberman said some ridiculous shit about, she doesn't have any athletic accomplishments and so she makes a video in response showing all the awards that she's won. Yeah. Like she's like a serious fucking accomplished athlete. Yeah. She's an amazing athlete. But for this insane, fuck to say this, but you gotta see the video because it's fall pretty amazing.

4 (1h 20m 36s):
Crazy. He used to be so long ago, but he was part of that essential sports center crew. Yeah. The glory days of ESPN, him Stuart Scott. He

3 (1h 20m 47s):
Was great. Raise

4 (1h 20m 48s):
Your hand if Dan Patrick, it was a dream team. and I would love to know what fucking soup he's been eating or what is in his diet or,

3 (1h 20m 58s):
Oh, he is vegan. Oh, is

4 (1h 20m 59s):
He? Yeah.

3 (1h 21m 0s):
Ah, yeah. There's, there's, clearly it's

4 (1h 21m 6s):
Something, sometimes there's things where it's like, sometimes there's just things where it's like, don't you see? Yeah. Don't you see?

3 (1h 21m 13s):
Yeah.

4 (1h 21m 13s):
Duh. You know, a big one. And I know we're switching subjects here, but a big one that I saw two days ago and I didn't even send it to you. 'cause I'm like, I, I can't even, I have to talk with you about this is Canada's overall life expectancy.

3 (1h 21m 29s):
Yes.

4 (1h 21m 30s):
It might be the craziest statistic in the world right now. You've seen this, right? Yes. Since 1930. Of course it goes this way, this way, this way, this way. 'cause you know, fucking live longer 'cause fucking technology and medicine. And then 2020 at levels, and then it starts to go down. It's down two and a half years since 2020, which is unheard of. Yeah. Unprecedented. What could that possibly be from,

3 (1h 21m 54s):
I don't know, Tony. Weird. So strange. It's not like it was a gigantic medical intervention that was forced upon the population during that time period.

4 (1h 22m 3s):
Again and again in booster and booster and booster.

3 (1h 22m 6s):
And you're not allowed to say it or you're a conspiracy theorist. I guess I, because people are, they're in a fucking trance because being on the side of reality and facts is so against the narrative that the liberals were correct. That they're willing to ignore excess deaths. That we're willing to ignore an increase in all cause mortality. That's shocking. Yeah. They're willing to ignore it.

4 (1h 22m 31s):
And they're the trust, the science people. But only there, only that when it, it leans to their favor. Dude, I stumbled. The science says there's something terrible that happened.

3 (1h 22m 39s):
I stumbled into this group of people talking on Twitter about, I'm always gonna call it Twitter. I tried X for a while.

4 (1h 22m 47s):
Yeah. It's impossible.

3 (1h 22m 47s):
I can't, what am I doing? Am I tweeting or am I x-ing? What am I doing? It doesn't even make any sense. Yeah. But there was a bunch of people that were talking about masking and boosting. And this is the reason why, you know, even though they've got covid five times, every time they get it, it's fairly mild. Yeah. Last time I was only sick for a week. I'm like, what are you talking about? Like, you, they're not reading the news at all. and I think it's baby boomers. You know, Robert F. Kennedy was talking about that. Bobby Kennedy Jr. Was talking about that. He was saying baby, he was talking to Patrick, be David. And he was saying that baby boomers are the ones who believe all the bad things about him because they get their news only from tv.

4 (1h 23m 26s):
We know we, we we know a Texas, we

3 (1h 23m 29s):
Know a guy.

4 (1h 23m 29s):
We know a

3 (1h 23m 30s):
Guy. Yeah. Boy, I get him all the time now. Oh,

4 (1h 23m 33s):
Me too. Yeah.

3 (1h 23m 34s):
We corner him now. Oh. With facts. Well, that one seems like a conspiracy. That one seems legit. Is that true? Yeah. This is, did you know that we're

4 (1h 23m 48s):
Gonna turn him, it's gonna be a glorious day when he comes in fucking

3 (1h 23m 53s):
Yeah. One day

4 (1h 23m 54s):
In the center.

3 (1h 23m 55s):
One day. Just catch him in the right mood.

4 (1h 23m 56s):
It is exactly that, by the way. Of course call Of. course me crazy. But I trust the news. Yeah. And it's, it, it's such a slippery, dangerous road. and it totally is that my mom's 76 and like she listens to me Of course on everything. But some of those things, she's like, you gotta be kidding me, Tony. You don't really think he's a good president. I'm like, look, but everybody's got money. These, there's no war right now. You're not seeing any of this. And then boom, there's bidet and fucking a cantalope is $23 or whatever. But what was I, oh man. Oh fuck. I just had something I wanted to say. and I lost it.

4 (1h 24m 37s):
Oh. I clicked on this article from CNN yesterday. 'cause I still love going to cnn.com just to see what fucking chaos they're pushing. And, and sure enough, there's a good one on then the number two or three spot that says New covid strain dominating the Northeast and I. Click on it and I. 'cause I'm like, okay. Yeah. Okay, let's see. And it's dominating. What it's actually doing is, it's just a new, obviously the evolution of the strain. and it just jumped the main strain that that was above it. It's a natural thing that happens all the time.

4 (1h 25m 17s):
But because it's the new main strain more than, which is always changing. Right. The new one is always jumping the old one. Now it's dominating this new strain is dominating the northeast, which is just it. They're just saying that that's taken over. But the headline doesn't say that. Right. The headline looks like, whoa, here it comes. Yeah. Get buckle down for the holidays again. It's so interesting that people can't see that these people, even the, the, the baby boomers can't see still. But here's the what's happening. It's

3 (1h 25m 50s):
A cold now. Okay. So if it's a cold, now imagine if the news freaked you out every time the cold was going around. Yep. Do you know how nuts that would be if the news was telling you that you had to get an experimental medical intervention every time, time the cold came around? Yeah. Even though you keep catching the cold. The, and the news never tells you, Hey, you gotta lose weight. The news never tells you, Hey, time to get in shape. Hey, time to start taking vitamins. Right. Hey, time starts sleeping better. Yeah. Hey,

4 (1h 26m 18s):
Drink a lot of water.

3 (1h 26m 19s):
The news doesn't tell you that. Right. It tells you you only have to get chemicals, chemicals injected into your body. That's the only way you can fix this. Yep. We have to just keep injecting chemicals into our body. It's the only way to get better.

4 (1h 26m 30s):
And now a commercial from Burger King right after that brought

3 (1h 26m 34s):
To you by Pfizer. Yeah. Yeah. It's wild. But boomers, they grew up with the news. That's, they never really got into the internet unless they get into Facebook groups.

4 (1h 26m 46s):
Yeah. I read another crazy statistic today that I think it's like 13 to 35 year olds are off of Facebook. It was 77% 10 years ago down to like 30%. Today

3 (1h 26m 60s):
The only dude I know uses Facebook is my friend Tommy Junior. And he's 50.

4 (1h 27m 4s):
I could see why Tommy Junior would be on Facebook. He's old school.

3 (1h 27m 7s):
Tommy's always, always on Facebook. Yeah. Yeah. I don't even have Instagram. I don't even use it. He's gonna come on the podcast. We're gonna do a podcast guy. Oh, that's

4 (1h 27m 15s):
Gonna be great. Yeah.

3 (1h 27m 18s):
He's one of my longest running friends. We've been friends for 30 years. Yeah. I knew that dude when he was 19 and I was 24. That's when we met.

4 (1h 27m 26s):
He's so fun to watch Play Pool. Just a real what? Boston slash New Yorkers slash

3 (1h 27m 33s):
Connecticut. Yeah. From Connecticut. That's what New York, that's what Connecticut is. You nailed it without nailing it. Yeah. Like Connecticut really is like Boston and New York had a kid. Yeah. It's like half Italian, half Irish, whatever it is. You know, it's like that's what, that's what Connecticut is. That's a combination of Boston.

4 (1h 27m 48s):
He would love the sweatsuit that I'm rocking. Right, right. But Tommy

3 (1h 27m 50s):
Junior's got his own accent. When when he comes on the podcast, people are gonna go, oh shit. That's maybe my best impression is Tommy Jr.

4 (1h 27m 60s):
Oh yeah. He's great. Hey, you got any of that good stuff? You smoking? You smoking?

3 (1h 28m 4s):
What are we doing? Gonna hit something? What are we doing? Yeah, there's a picture I took of Tommy Jr. When we all did a show together in Atlantic City, remember? And he had, Atlantic City had weed stores. Yeah. And he took a, I think it was like a 250 milligram edible. And we're eating, see if you can find that photo of Tommy Jr. Baked out of his mind. Look at him. How is it? 300 milligrams? What does it say underneath it? 300. 300 milligrams. Look at him. Dude, don't leave me. Stay close. Do you mind if we hold hands? I've been friends with that dude forever.

3 (1h 28m 44s):
Ugh. Forever

4 (1h 28m 45s):
And ever. So much fun.

3 (1h 28m 47s):
Yeah.

4 (1h 28m 47s):
So fun. That's where

3 (1h 28m 48s):
Boy, yeah. And he would've been like a legit top of the food chain pool player if he didn't retire because he realized there was no future in it if he didn't stop playing all the time. Yeah. He, he was one of the best players in the world when he, he was like 19, 20 years old. Yeah. He was a killer. But he was like, there's no future. He tells a story about watching this guy Neptune, Joe f Fredy, Neptune. Joe f Fredy was a legend in New Jersey. Neptune Joe from Neptune, billiards. And he had like half his teeth and he had a cigarette in his hand while he was playing. And he would play with his mouth open like this.

4 (1h 29m 23s):
Wow.

3 (1h 29m 24s):
He was a killer. Yeah. But he would play like, he would like get into this like trance and his like mouth would be open. He goes, I'm watching this guy and I'm sweating it out. We're playing for like $200 and he doesn't have a fucking pot to piss in or a window to throw out of it. I can't win. I can't win. This guy's a killer. And I'm realizing like, is this my future? What the fuck? So he stopped playing pool.

4 (1h 29m 46s):
My favorite when, when I think of funny things about Tommy, a big one. 'cause you're all obviously always commentating. You're in the fucking super zone next to the octagon. But your homies are flank to the back radio. And something that always happens, you might not even know this actually, but it always happens to him, is there'll be a great fight happening and he'll take a picture. He likes taking pictures while thing's happening. I don't play these games 'cause I don't wanna miss a fucking thing. I know how this goes. So he, he'll take a picture and if a knockout happens, you can bet the house that he will be posting that picture and have his head down for that moment and just, whoa, whoa, whoa.

4 (1h 30m 26s):
Like he always misses a fucking head kick or a fucking place goes wild and the lights go up and he doesn't even know what happened.

3 (1h 30m 34s):
Also, Tommy can barely see. Right. So when he is looking down at his phone, right, he's got like, is that a T or a W?

4 (1h 30m 40s):
I gotta post this to Facebook. and it just ball the whole place goes wild shit. Like you didn't see a Tommy fuck every

3 (1h 30m 48s):
Posting important document. Exactly. He's a man.

4 (1h 30m 52s):
Every knock. You could, you could almost, you could almost know there's gonna be a knock big knockout. If Tommy's looking down at his phone, the odds go up tremendously.

3 (1h 31m 2s):
He's one of the funniest non-poor players or non comedians. Totally. That I know.

4 (1h 31m 6s):
I always love when we go to the East coast and hang out with him.

3 (1h 31m 9s):
But pool players are funny, man. They're outcasts. You know, that's what I loved the most when I was a kid. When I went to New York and I started hanging out at this executive billiards place that was near my house. I fucking just loved being around misfits. They were all misfits. Totally. I always felt like a misfit man. I never felt like a fit in anywhere. Yeah. Like with regular people that had regular families and regular jobs. Like, oh my God, what am I gonna talk to you about? Yeah. I, I wanna be around wild people. Yeah. And these people were all wild.

4 (1h 31m 37s):
I was having this conversation with Ray Mysterio Jr. Just the other night. It's like pro wrestlers. Strippers. Comedians, pool players. Rock stars. Rock stars. Pool players.

3 (1h 31m 48s):
Yep. Yeah. Fighters. They're all the most fun people to be with. 'cause they're just living this wild lifestyle. Like, how did you figure out to do that? Yeah. How are you doing that? You know, like when you're hanging out with Gordon Gordon, like how are you strangling people for a living?

4 (1h 32m 1s):
Yeah. We're trying to convince him. Yeah. And my buddy Kyle, we're trying to convince him to do a jujitsu match blindfolded.

3 (1h 32m 10s):
Oh, that's hilarious.

4 (1h 32m 12s):
I think he's, I think he wants to do it could be fun. It's fun pitching ideas to him because he can dominate humans in was mysterious

3 (1h 32m 19s):
Ways. He a lot of his feel, a lot of his feel. There's certain things, standup would suck, wrestling would suck. You wouldn't, you wouldn't be able to anticipate people shooting on you and stuff. But he would just like go to the ground immediately. Yeah. You know, like when he fought Nick Rod in Abu Dhabi, remember he was telling us before the fight what he was gonna do. He goes, I'm just gonna give him a leg and let him take me down. Then I'll submit him. Yeah. He just gave him his leg. Yeah.

4 (1h 32m 42s):
But he didn't make it look like he was giving him his leg. So Nicki Rod thought that he got his leg.

3 (1h 32m 46s):
No, he made it look like he was giving him his leg. He gave him his leg. You remember, you've seen it. Well yeah. Find out Gordon Ryan versus Nicki Rod. By the way, there's like a feud between those guys. Yeah. I have zero side. I think Craig Jones is the shit, you know. I love that dude. He's hilarious. Craig Jones is you ever filed Craig Jones on Instagram? He does these Dick pill ads. He does this ad rather for, it's not, he does dick pill ads, dude. But he does an ad for like some testosterone replacement therapy place. But the way he doesn't is so fucking funny. It's, it's all, it's like you don't know him. You don't know if he's being honest or if he's telling the truth or if it's sarcasm. It's just ridiculous. But he's like a comic.

3 (1h 33m 27s):
He's really fucking funny man. But see if he can find Gordon Ryan versus Nick Rod. I thought I was looking for that video too then. Yeah, that video we could find too. But that's on his Instagram. But Gordon Ryan versus Nick Rod. And Nick Rod is a beast. Like he's a monster to handle like a real physical freak. So look, here it begins. They start grappling and Gordon just gives him his leg. Oh he does? Wow. Yeah, he gave it to him. He gave it to him. Wow. He's like, come on, let's go to the ground. And then Nikki is trying to figure out what to do and Gordon's like, come on, come on in here. It's pretty quick. Once he gets ahold of him, once he gets ahold of him, here it is.

3 (1h 34m 10s):
So he scrambles, he scoots in and he gets inside control. Once he gets inside control, you're in a lot of trouble. So he gets his legs. Nick got out. So, but Nikki's backing out 'cause he knows like, he doesn't want a piece of that.

4 (1h 34m 24s):
But what do you do? You gotta do Juujitsu with the guy. So you're in a real conundrum here.

3 (1h 34m 29s):
Yeah. Well, Nicki Rod's best chances are to take you down and hold you down and, and pass you. He's got a, an amazing guard pass. He's a, a super powerful guy. Like, like a real freak athlete. Genetically like outstanding genes and crazy work ethic and you know, everything. He's got everything. And then he was also with Danaher forever. So that's where they, and they trained together a bunch Scooter ahead a little so you could see the submission. So eventually they lock up. So when Nikki gets on top of him and commits to being on top of him, then Gordon can get ahold of that leg. So he's, he's getting control of Nikki's left leg right now as we speak.

3 (1h 35m 9s):
He's like sneaking deeper and deeper into it. Now he's, now he's really locking onto it. Now he's tying it up. Now he's rolling under now. Nikki's in a lot of trouble now. Now this is real bad because he's got a really firm grip on the ankle and then he laced his legs over. Now it's the heel hook. He's got a tap, he's got a tap here. That's it. It's getting real close. This is fucking super nasty. And so once he gets the inside heel hook or the, this is a regular heel hook, once he gets it, Nick has to tap.

4 (1h 35m 37s):
Wow.

3 (1h 35m 38s):
Yeah. It's just, there's levels to submissions and Gordon is at the highest level, but there's also levels to like physicality and, and Nicki's at the highest level and he's getting better at jujitsu. They're, they're a big rivalry right now. But Gordon is just so far ahead of everybody technically and work ethic wise and just, it's, it's fascinating to watch a guy that is only 28 years old that is dominating this insane sport where most guys are going like back and forth, back and forth. One guy beats one guy and another guy beats another guy. He's just smushing

4 (1h 36m 12s):
Everybody. And he's so fun. He was to Kill Tony last night again comes so often. Oh, he is fun. His mom was supposed to be at my shows in Florida, but it, his his mom's hilarious. Stepdad got sick. Exactly. I mean she's awesome. I mean they just, you know, I think there's really something to having a great sense of humor and being a great martial artist.

3 (1h 36m 31s):
Well that's Craig then. 'cause Craig Jones, you know, everybody calls him like the number two best grappler in the world, like behind Gordon. But Gordon's bigger. Gordon's on the sauce, don don't think, I don't think Craig's on the sauce. Yeah. I think that's part of what Craig is always joking around about. He, he, he always says that you need, you need the correct, he did the this thing where he's like, you, you need the correct balance between steroids and autism. So I've been taking a bunch of vaccines trying to get autism.

4 (1h 37m 3s):
That's amazing.

3 (1h 37m 5s):
It's funny man. It's funny. Also a Stone cold killer. He's ul Kovski jujitsu instructor. Oh yeah. He's always working with UL Kovski. I don't know why they had a separation Gordon and him, but it was, apparently it was the, the whole team, you know, the, they separated the B team and what they call New Wave now. Used to be the Donah Heard Death Squad, but Gary Toin and a bunch of guys stayed with Gordon. So

4 (1h 37m 31s):
All those guys are in Austin now. Right?

3 (1h 37m 34s):
Everybody is Yeah. From both groups. They're both in Austin. Ah. Which is kind of crazy. Yeah. They both, they both moved, they all moved here together from Puerto Rico and then they split off into two groups and they don't talk to each other anymore. Woo. Yeah.

4 (1h 37m 48s):
I like it.

3 (1h 37m 50s):
It's unfortunate, but you know, it's what it is. But it's the world of martial artists like we were saying, like the, those people, they're fun people. Yeah. They're, they're, they're people that are doing a wild thing. A very different thing. They're not regular people that are tied down to regular jobs. There's just so much restrictions in the way you think about things. The way you express yourself, the, the fun you can have the the stuff you can talk about. It's like they're so restricted. Yeah. It's like that's a sucky place to be. Man. You don't wanna be in that spot.

4 (1h 38m 23s):
Yeah. Yeah. I mean sugar. Sean O'Malley never misses an episode of Kill Tony. Oh he's awesome. Israel outta Sonya never misses an episode. It goes on and on and on.

3 (1h 38m 35s):
Well also fighters need something fun Right. To break it up and like re like regular talk shows are not gonna do it for them. Right. They need, they need some wild shit. Yep. And that's, I think that's the thing that killed Tony's really tapped into in this weird culture that we have right now where you don't get wild comedy movies anymore. Yeah. You know, anytime someone puts out wild standup, they get attacked with a million articles about them being whatever phobic you could think of. It's just Kill Tony just resonates during that time. Yeah. It's also like why protect our Parks does so well.

4 (1h 39m 8s):
Exactly.

3 (1h 39m 9s):
'cause we just do it the same way we've always done it. Yeah. Just four comics hanging out together, getting fucked up, drinking beer outta funnels. I love it.

4 (1h 39m 17s):
I love it. I saw a clip the other day someone sent me of you guys watching the I ain't Gay no More, Shane.

3 (1h 39m 23s):
I

4 (1h 39m 24s):
Am delivered. Shane's like, oh, Kill. Tony. I love it. Like these bastards.

3 (1h 39m 31s):
Yeah. And we, we went on this rant about Kanye. Jamie, what were you saying that you thought that Kanye was gonna be on this week because of that?

6 (1h 39m 37s):
Oh, maybe he'll still show up. But no, he is got a new album coming out. He had a crazy

3 (1h 39m 40s):
Rant. Yeah. Kanye, we were, we were saying that all he needs is one good album and he's back. I mean And this new album's I'm guaranteed it's gonna be a banger.

4 (1h 39m 49s):
Oh, I'm a Kanye. Fucking, I'm a Oh yeah. I'm, I'm just a believer.

3 (1h 39m 54s):
Oh yeah. No, you're the biggest Kanye fan alive. Yeah. Yeah. When I told you I was gonna have Kanye in the podcast, you, you fucking, oh

4 (1h 39m 60s):
Yeah. I sent you a Yeah. A must

3 (1h 40m 3s):
Listen to

4 (1h 40m 4s):
A document. Yeah. Yeah.

3 (1h 40m 6s):
You gotta listen to this. Start with this album. Go to that album.

4 (1h 40m 9s):
Yeah. People talk shit about all his new stuff. They, the old Kanye's a thing, but it's like

3 (1h 40m 15s):
You want him a little crazy.

4 (1h 40m 17s):
He's the evolution. So like whatever he does is where the industry is going to be in three to five years. Everybody is so far behind him that everybody younger than him and everybody listening has to catch up years behind. Yeah. Because you can't just copy it. Yeah. So

3 (1h 40m 37s):
It's, well you're always gonna have guys like that. There's wild pioneers. Yep. They're always at least slightly unhinged.

4 (1h 40m 44s):
Oh yeah. Oh, he's above and beyond. He is above and beyond. How

3 (1h 40m 48s):
Do you not be unhinged? Yeah. Do you, do you want greatness or not?

4 (1h 40m 52s):
Right.

3 (1h 40m 53s):
Do you want greatness or not?

4 (1h 40m 54s):
Oh, this next album's crazy. No doubt.

3 (1h 40m 57s):
Guaranteed.

4 (1h 40m 58s):
Noted. We should debut it. And he has so much to talk about. Yeah. You know the, that freestyle part two from, oh God Damnit the one that people don't know whether it's AI or whether it's him. Jamie, do you know what I'm talking about? I listen to it all the time. So there's like a, it's heavily debated whether it's actually Kanye or whether it's ai really this thing. Right? Yeah. Why

3 (1h 41m 21s):
Is it's new

4 (1h 41m 22s):
Because Kanye hasn't commented on it at all. The guy, the actual rapper doesn't talk about it.

3 (1h 41m 29s):
It's another rapper he did a duet with.

4 (1h 41m 30s):
Yeah, it's on Spazz Boy. What's it

6 (1h 41m 33s):
Called? Something, the link I clicked is loading slow.

4 (1h 41m 36s):
It's some freestyle part two or something. The

3 (1h 41m 39s):
Link's loading slow. 'cause probably everybody on planet Earth is listening to it right

4 (1h 41m 42s):
Now. But the lyrics are unbelievable. So now here's the interesting part is like Kanye has so much he can talk about now,

6 (1h 41m 51s):
Which is interesting. So just to add to this, right. I try, I've found the people talking about it on Reddit from three months ago. Yeah. And there's a link to it. That video has been taken down from a copyright claim from the music label.

3 (1h 42m 3s):
Interesting. Right.

6 (1h 42m 4s):
So it might be,

3 (1h 42m 5s):
It might be real then, right? I'm

4 (1h 42m 6s):
Trying to find it. And the lyrics are diabolical as he's talking about Adidas, he's talking about this, he's talking about that. Ooh. It's powerful.

3 (1h 42m 18s):
Are we allowed to play it?

6 (1h 42m 19s):
I don't I mean

3 (1h 42m 20s):
I don. We might not be allowed to play it. We might get in trouble.

4 (1h 42m 24s):
It's so good and it's hilarious.

3 (1h 42m 29s):
He's a wild fella. This place.

4 (1h 42m 31s):
It's funny, it's profound. It's everything that he is. Is this

3 (1h 42m 35s):
It?

6 (1h 42m 35s):
I have to ask Tony, is this

3 (1h 42m 36s):
I'm a man

4 (1h 42m 37s):
Of my word? Nah, this is different That Yeah. Okay.

3 (1h 42m 41s):
Is that how it starts?

26 (1h 42m 43s):
Fuck

4 (1h 42m 44s):
No, it's not that fast. This is like a remix or something.

3 (1h 42m 47s):
Let's hear it though. That

6 (1h 42m 48s):
Might not that a hundred after that happened. If, if it was AI then there's gonna be a bunch of people making copies to steal YouTube.

4 (1h 42m 54s):
It should be on YouTube, on Spotify

6 (1h 42m 56s):
And all sorts of stuff. Really? Yeah.

4 (1h 42m 57s):
Okay. But it's not, you

3 (1h 42m 59s):
Said it got taken down. It's it

6 (1h 43m 1s):
Was on a YouTube video. It was taken down so maybe someone re-uploaded it and they weren't allowed to. That's kind of what I'm saying.

3 (1h 43m 5s):
Right, right. Which is Of course gonna happen.

4 (1h 43m 8s):
Yeah. Yeah.

3 (1h 43m 10s):
Welcome to the internet.

4 (1h 43m 12s):
Yeah.

6 (1h 43m 12s):
Freestyle part two.

3 (1h 43m 14s):
That's what's so cool about releasing an album now.

4 (1h 43m 17s):
Yes.

26 (1h 43m 20s):
That name. Okay.

6 (1h 43m 25s):
You did say the guy's name right there.

6 (1h 46m 22s):
Yeah. So I'm looking on people talking about on Reddit there is a, there is a discussion if it's real or not. But that sounded pretty real. Sounded pretty real. Sounds very real. If it's not AI's got my vote. Right. If it wasn't, that would have to have been a crazy AI experiment that we haven't heard anything that close to it. If AI is that good since then, I welcome them. I welcome them to create our rap songs.

4 (1h 46m 44s):
Yeah. I read a lot about it and what they said was that the inhale, that's one of Kanye's like trademarks in between when he's rapping. 'cause he leaves that in that. That's

6 (1h 46m 53s):
What I was catching on. That'd be really hard to fake. Yeah.

3 (1h 46m 55s):
Yeah. But AI would know that. No.

6 (1h 46m 57s):
So the, that wouldn't, I don't think there's, they're not saying N ai made that what they're saying, how it would've been fake is the guy who wrote rundown spas. I guess they're saying he would've written that recorded it and then used like almost like deep faking to just copy his Kanye's voice over his voice. Well

3 (1h 47m 14s):
They definitely could do that. We just watched that with that lady. Right. The White House SEC Press Secretary lady with Obama. They 100% could do that.

6 (1h 47m 21s):
It's sound, it's tough to do that though with ai. I think at least I don. This was four months ago when this was made and this was a guy in his, you know, not somebody at a laboratory.

4 (1h 47m 30s):
Again. I read a lot about it and they said that the breath thing in AI is kind of like how they can't do fingers in ai. So there's like,

3 (1h 47m 37s):
Do you know how crazy it is to say that four months ago they couldn't do that? Yeah. But now we know they could. Isn't that wild Jamie? Like think about like that made sense to all of us. When you said four months ago they couldn't do this. What? Oh yeah. Four months ago. At what time in history has there been a timeline where four months ago Seems like forever. Yeah, like when someone sends you an article and you look and you go, oh it's from May you like dismiss it Like this is like five months ago. Whatever. Get outta here with that. Oh this is seven months ago. Oh my God. This is 2022. What are you like reading ancient history to me? And when you say that something could do something now, like when we're talking about Michael Hastings car Yeah.

3 (1h 48m 18s):
2010. Could they do that? I think they could do that now. We know they could do that like four months ago. If you said don don't know if they could do that Kanye song like that four months ago. Unless they made it in a lab now. 100%. Yeah. How many times has Duncan t Trussell taken your voice and had you said, say ridiculous things in the green room to us? Oh yeah. He's hilarious with that. It's

4 (1h 48m 41s):
So fast.

3 (1h 48m 42s):
It's so funny.

4 (1h 48m 43s):
And it sounds exactly like me.

3 (1h 48m 45s):
He sounds exactly like you and you're like praising things that suck.

4 (1h 48m 48s):
Yeah.

3 (1h 48m 49s):
What was the last one he did with you? He's done a bunch of 'em.

4 (1h 48m 52s):
He takes people that I don't necessarily like and makes me talk about how much I love them

3 (1h 48m 58s):
And about. I've try to focus on their positive qualities.

28 (1h 49m 6s):
Oh,

4 (1h 49m 7s):
David Lucas hates that Duncan does that. He like gets scared like there's a ghost in the room. Like turn that off. Turn that off.

28 (1h 49m 16s):
Ah.

3 (1h 49m 18s):
Which is why he made that rap song about David Lucas. Yeah.

28 (1h 49m 22s):
Yeah. It's

3 (1h 49m 23s):
So crazy. Having him around is so important. Oh man. We have such a great crew, man.

4 (1h 49m 27s):
Oh, the squad is crazy.

3 (1h 49m 29s):
It's so good. It's when we're all working out together. I'm looking at, I'm like, this is so crazy. It's Brian Simpson Assan. Yep. Derek Poston. Yep. Shane Gillis.

4 (1h 49m 38s):
Yep. Matt McCusker. Tim Dillon.

3 (1h 49m 41s):
So many good guys. Sura, Christina pki. There's so many good guys here. Yeah. So many good comics.

4 (1h 49m 48s):
Holtzman is a big one.

3 (1h 49m 49s):
Oh my god. Having holtzman around is amazing.

4 (1h 49m 52s):
And all the big dogs want to come back all the time. There's people. Yeah. All.

3 (1h 49m 56s):
How about Howie Mandel the other

4 (1h 49m 57s):
Night? Oh my God. He has the time this life. He's like,

3 (1h 49m 59s):
I wanna do this. I was trying to convince him to be a comic again. Yeah. I go, do you have so much money? Like you don't need any more money. If this is what you like to do, this is what you should be doing. Like when he is with us, he's like a little kid. Oh yeah. Like this is so fun. Yeah. When he went up on stage, he had so much fun.

4 (1h 50m 13s):
Oh yeah. Loves

3 (1h 50m 14s):
Like, he just showed up and I was like, do you want to go up? You could tell. He's like, don don't have to. It's okay. I go, I'd like you to go up if you'd like to go up. Do you wanna go up? I was like, yeah, okay. Okay. You go up after Brian, Brian's up next and he's just like, oh my god. Yeah. You could see he gets all giddy

4 (1h 50m 30s):
Because you can't buy that.

3 (1h 50m 31s):
Yeah, you can. And then he comes backstage. He's like, it's so fun. God, I wanna do this again. All the time. I saw he was at the ice house the other day, so maybe he's doing more standup now. Ah.

4 (1h 50m 40s):
He is got the itch. We we know how to do that. Yeah. We brought Ron outta retirement. We brought Roseanne outta retirement.

3 (1h 50m 46s):
Ron's on tour again. Yeah. Then when, when Ron's girlfriend said, come to Ron's retirement party, I go, I ain't going to no bullshit party. Yeah. For something that's never gonna happen. I go, Ron White is not retiring. Like, what are you talking about? He never even, he's always like, well I'll retire, but I'll do your club. I go, Ron, you can do whatever you want, but you're not retiring. Stop saying you're gonna retire. Yeah. You're one of the greatest of all time. You're not retiring. Shut the fuck up. He's so funny. He's, he's better now than he is ever been. Oh yeah. He's so sharp because he is working with us all the time. He's doing sets all the time. He comes

4 (1h 51m 17s):
On nights where he is not, where he doesn't even wanna do sets. Yeah. It's just a home away from home. He needs to be around comedians.

3 (1h 51m 24s):
Well, when we had that Christmas party the other night, we were all huddled up in the, the green room. Like this is our safe space. Yeah. This is like, it's the clubhouse. It's like the ultimate clubhouse. Yeah. So fun man. It's

4 (1h 51m 34s):
The best. The last that we have in that room. Our, it's so

3 (1h 51m 37s):
Silly.

4 (1h 51m 38s):
Insane. The hardness of the laughs.

3 (1h 51m 42s):
It's so silly. Yeah. So fun. It's so fun. Yeah. It's just, we're we're so lucky. You know, like I was saying the other day with us working out with the Rock I was like, is this real life? Like what is this like this fun thing that we get to do? Like it's, we've just engineered this very Bazar life.

4 (1h 52m 1s):
Yeah. I get to golf with Ron. Golf is like a four or five hour adventure. Yeah. And there's unbelievable quiet moments where, you know, it's, it's times like, 'cause it's not like hunting where you have to kind of be quiet. Yeah. So like he could snipe and say something from a hundred yards away, great shot if your shit goes in the woods or whatever. Just whatever. And with his twang, I, I'm horrible at impressions, but he has the funniest execution when he, and that's the thing about that green room when I'm talking about how hard we laugh, like you have protect our parks is one fifth of the room at any given point. Yeah. And we're all together.

4 (1h 52m 42s):
So it's like a super Royal Rumble Ultra podcast. Yeah. And he'll just snipe with a word. Yep. Or something like that. Just something like, it's just chaos.

3 (1h 52m 54s):
Yeah. It's, we're very fortunate man. Yeah. I feel very fortunate. Really do almost too fortunate. Like, while it's happening, I'm like, God, we're so lucky. Like, how did this happen? 'cause when we thought about doing this place, when you and I who were like the first over the pioneers out here, when we were talking about doing this place, like we all had this idea of what it was gonna be, but we didn't think it was gonna work out that well. We didn't think it was gonna be perfect.

4 (1h 53m 17s):
Not that fast. I thought it would be perfect. But we were really, we really had it at Vulcan. Yeah. Yeah. The story starts at that crazy cement fucking paper mache. No walls on the stalls. I don Dunno if you ever went to one of the public restrooms there. Oh, I did. Because we only, oh,

3 (1h 53m 34s):
They were disgusting. It's half, half of them didn't flush. There was a moment where Brian Simpson was high as fuck. And he looked at me and he goes, yo dog, you ever look at the cords that hold up those speakers? I go, what? He goes, you know how heavy those speakers are? I go, no. How, how heavy are those speakers? He goes, oh, hundreds of pounds. I go, really? He goes, yeah. He goes, look at that cord. He goes, there's two, two little skinny ass strands. Yeah. He goes, they got no backup. If one of those breaks everybody dies. I was like, Jesus Christ, Nick. What the fuck? I told Nick, have you ever looked at those chords?

4 (1h 54m 7s):
Yeah.

3 (1h 54m 8s):
Brian had me totally convinced these giant speakers are gonna fall on the people in the front row.

4 (1h 54m 12s):
Yeah. So many memories from that place.

3 (1h 54m 15s):
That place is wild. That was the place where we decided that we were gonna open a club when Ron White grabbed me by my shoulders, whatever the fuck we have to do, we're doing this. Yeah. You gotta open up a club. Yeah.

4 (1h 54m 27s):
That was over three years ago. It was three years in a month or two ago. Yeah. I

3 (1h 54m 31s):
Was like, let's do it. Yeah. It was so wild to be doing shows indoors back then. I just found a stash of masks the other day in my truck. I, they're in my little side thing and I didn't know they were in there. I pull out these fucking stupid surgical masks. My God. Yeah. It's like, I'm trying to forget this. Right. It's like a time where the world went insane. Yep.

4 (1h 54m 51s):
That's exactly how I feel when I see one. They'll pop up and like, you know, like a near fucking socks or whatever. Yeah. Like crazy laundry or shit.

3 (1h 54m 60s):
I was watching a video on YouTube of a car review and these guys were in this car and they both had masks on. I'm like, nope, I don't wanna see it. Yeah. Like, don don't wanna see this. I don't, don don't, I don't wanna, this is like, it's gonna annoy me so much. Right. These guys are doing this stupid thing that everybody had to do.

4 (1h 55m 15s):
Well that's what I'm saying. At the airports, I noticed, especially on the insides of airports, people do it. And like, like I was like, I glazed over earlier when I saw barista wearing two masks. It's almost like, this sounds terrible, but it's like seeing a wild animal in the wild. 'cause I'm like trying to study the situation. Right. I'm like, what are they thinking? Are they sick? Are they super sick? I'm like waiting for them to cough or breathe heavy or something. Because you have to think to yourself like, are you paying any attention to anything? and I, and

3 (1h 55m 48s):
It, it's also an anxiety thing. And some people like the mask. They, some people actually liked wearing a mask because at least part of them was covered. Like, they didn't have to expose part of their expressions to you. Like people that were socially awkward. Maybe they liked being behind a mask.

4 (1h 56m 7s):
You know, one thing I noticed, so at a building I used to live in, one of the guys that worked that you'd see a lot around the building always wore the mask. And I'm like, that's so interesting. I wonder if he has a pre-existing condition. 'cause he doesn't seem, his attitude and his energy wasn't a mask wearing energy. If that makes sense. don don't know. It's I know. But that's what I felt. And then I saw him without the mask and he had a weird, like a a, what's the thing where you cuss sometimes? Tourettes. Tourettes. Yeah. He had like Tourettes, but just with his face, whatever that is. Where it was like a, he would do like

3 (1h 56m 47s):
A Yeah. Little ticks. Yeah.

4 (1h 56m 49s):
Ticks. He had face ticks. Yeah. And then I realized, oh, his life is just a little bit easier. He feels more normal behind the mass. Sure. Because you don't see it if he's wearing it. Yeah.

3 (1h 56m 59s):
And I think some people are hiding behind it. They like to hide behind. It makes him feel better. And then there's also this thing where like some people had like a very high level of anxiety already. Yeah. And they only get their information in little echo chambers, you know, which I think we're all guilty of to some extent. But they get their information from these echo chambers and they really believe everything the mainstream news says. And especially when it's ideologically connected. That's what's so crazy. It's like taking a vaccine, taking a, a medicine somehow or another became ideologically connected with you being a, a progressive, a well-educated, open-minded liberal. Whereas being skeptical of the companies that have the biggest fucking criminal fines in medical history.

3 (1h 57m 45s):
Like giant crazy fines for lying. Yeah. Like those guys you should trust. And if you don't trust them, well you must be some Trumper anti-vaxxer. Right. Some fool. Yeah. Who's taking veterinary medicine? Oh, you fool.

4 (1h 58m 3s):
Right.

3 (1h 58m 4s):
And to see that be a dividing narrative was very enlightening because to me, you know, 'cause I was caught up in the middle of it all. I was like, oh, it's an ideology thing. It's a thing that humans do where you just believe a, a collected group of ideas that matches with your social circle. Maybe your economic circle, maybe the, you know, the, the education circle. The people that you know that are all like operating in your, and you all just believe it wholesale without investigating in it. And if you get critical of it at all, you get attacked. So you back off that. You don't want that.

3 (1h 58m 45s):
I don't know how that happened. I don't know if that was a natural course of events or if that was like socially engineered. If it was socially engineered. My God. It's brilliant. It's brilliant. Like if that was like, if you wanna go full Alex Jones and say that was like a test run for like a real pandemic to see how people would react and how quickly they'd roll over, you would go, wow. That was shocking. Because people that I really respected that were really intelligent people were terrified of discussing the possibility that maybe you're not getting the whole truth about all of it. Whether it's the origins of the virus, the medications that are effective in treating the virus, what's legal and why it's legal and why it's being mandated.

3 (1h 59m 27s):
Like if you're not, even if you're not, even if any skepticism at all, you're attacked for, it's like, that's brilliant. How did they do that? Did that, did they do that? Because it's just like the perfect storm of a terrifying pandemic. A bunch of people freaking out. And then this solution that gets offered that everybody thinks like if you don't get to that solution, then you're a part of the problem. But the orchestrating of it all, it's like, it makes me, it makes me regain this idea that society can be engineered by, like, if you were like some crazy cabal of super billionaires, like the World Economic Forum type, you, you really kind of could engineer society into a certain direction if you just like, you know how they behave when things happen.

3 (2h 0m 17s):
And if you can get a certain narrative out there early enough where it can't, no one can call bullshit on it. Like the vaccine is a hundred percent effective. Right. And if you, you get the vaccine, you're never gonna get covid. The virus stops with you. If you can get that out there and enough people can repeat it, then everybody who's against that is against this idea of us getting back to normal. And then you already know, oh, they'll just start fighting. Yeah. Look at this, this is amazing. And then they'll all comply and then they won't admit that the problems that you were talking about, like excess deaths and all cause mortality, all that stuff, young people dying of heart attacks at a record rate, they, they're not, they won't look at it. Right. 'cause that goes against their narrative.

4 (2h 0m 57s):
And when all that happened, there's two types of people, right. One's that need a lot of socializing. Right. Like we hang out and talk to people, we ask questions. Right. Not just our direct family. Right. Pe other like-minded people and whatnot. And the information. Oh you know, somebody that got it. You know what I mean, like Right. and I think a lot of people don't have that. So they were going to the internet. Right. Right.

3 (2h 1m 23s):
Especially shut-ins.

4 (2h 1m 24s):
Exactly. But also everybody. 'cause we had nothing else to fucking do. Right. I mean that had to be the time when the most data. I bet. I'm sure there's a record for that. Like I'm sure that has to be a record for wifi use and data. Like I mean

3 (2h 1m 38s):
Everyone's home. Yeah.

4 (2h 1m 39s):
Just consuming. And

3 (2h 1m 40s):
Everyone's full of anxiety.

4 (2h 1m 42s):
Which brings me to my next point thing, which is like, I just read a thing about how corporate trolling is a big thing. Like buying these corporations are buying in the ability to inform mis there's a crazy article, I can't remember the statistic, but it's insane. 15%

6 (2h 2m 2s):
Of post on Reddit work from corporate trolls or something like that.

3 (2h 2m 4s):
Like what percent?

6 (2h 2m 5s):
15%.

4 (2h 2m 7s):
I think that thing I read was higher. Holy shit. I don't

3 (2h 2m 9s):
Think it

4 (2h 2m 9s):
Man. But it's like holy

3 (2h 2m 11s):
Shit,

4 (2h 2m 11s):
It's a thing. and it, which means it could have been a thing then. Right?

3 (2h 2m 15s):
So which is why Yeah,

4 (2h 2m 17s):
Go ahead. Even the people that, like we were talking about, the baby boomers not just being spooned the news. Even the people that think they're one level smarter are reading things that are easily bought by a multi-billion dollar corporation. Something we, you know, we wouldn't spend money on information, but why wouldn't they? What

3 (2h 2m 34s):
A wild thing to do to hire someone to get a narrative out and to pretend you're a regular person arguing online. And it's totally legal. It's really deception. New study, at least 15% of all Reddit content is corporate trolls trying to manipulate public opinion. Now is that fraud? What is that? It's not technically fraud. What is it though? I, if you're pretending to be a person, should you have to sign a contract when you use a social media account, like, you know this Nikki Haley lady, I think she wants everybody to, to have to like expose their name and their ID whenever they post. But the problem with that is then that discourages like government whistleblowers and things along those lines. Like if someone has like some important information that they have to get out, you know, and also foreign co countries that'll kill people.

3 (2h 3m 21s):
You can't, if you, if you have the rules apply to America, you're gonna have to have those rules applied to other countries. How, how many, what percentage of people that are on Twitter are from the rest of the world outside of America. It's gotta be pretty high. So how are you gonna enforce that? You're not gonna be able to, but even if you did like this idea that that's a good thing, like I see why they would say that. But you should at least have to somehow or another prove that you're an individual. I don't know how you would do that without giving up your information, but maybe You don't have to do it publicly. But there should be a way where we know you're not a troll. Like fucking man. The only problem with that is like, it's a trap because the way is like a digital id and you don't want to give up a digital id.

3 (2h 4m 5s):
Right. You don't want to have like a thing that shows you everywhere you go online. Because someone would be able to just do things with that. They'll be able to manipulate you from that into having something that's attached to something else. Like whether it's a vaccine passport or a social credit score or you know, centralized digital currency that's on that phone with that app, with your unique id. This is how we're gonna stop bank fraud. You're gonna have a unique id. Nobody's gonna be able to steal your money. Your money's all digital now.

4 (2h 4m 36s):
Yeah. Technically they could track everything about your life. So when you see, look at somebody, your glasses can say how often they eat at this restaurant and everything.

3 (2h 4m 43s):
So the is the solution to just allow the trolls, allow corporate trolls and hope that people are smart enough to realize that they're being fucked with. But like, what if those corporate trolls are shifting public opinion and it actually costs lives. That's where it gets weird. Like, what if they lie about something because they don't want to have responsibility for something that they did. So they obscure the truth with these court patrols and it gets messy enough where people just argue it out and they slide through.

4 (2h 5m 14s):
And you know, when you think about the intentions behind who would they attack, what types of things would they try to manipulate? It's the things that would threaten them. Yeah.

6 (2h 5m 25s):
Need a little clarification on this. As I tried to dig through the article. The article is paid, paid for behind a medium, so I can't get there. But

3 (2h 5m 34s):
Paid for by trolls.

4 (2h 5m 35s):
Right, exactly.

6 (2h 5m 36s):
You have to pay to get in there. I said that wrong, but Right. What it actually says behind it is 15% of the top 100 subreddits found to have content that was likely posted by bots or corporate trolls specifically aimed at promoting certain companies or organizations. don

3 (2h 5m 52s):
Don't know why. That's why that's so hard to believe when we know how many trolls are on Facebook and Instagram. And there's constant trolls. I was looking at someone was, someone was getting attacked for something like pretty minor, but it was just like reading the comments of this page and I do this thing now where I'll go and I'll read something that seems like a little weird or off or something like that. And then I go to their page, oh, you're a fake account. Like this is a fake account. You have no posts. Right. You're, you're restricted. No one can see it. You have no, you know, no followers. Right. You have like 15 followers. Like, oh, okay, this is fake. You gotta fake account. Yeah. How many of these are there, how many of these are there that are just constantly commenting on things and trying to stir up bullshit?

3 (2h 6m 34s):
Right. It's weird. It's, but it, and it's legal. So if right now there's no law that prevents corporations from hiring people to pretend that they're a person or using AI to pretend they're a person to put a narrative out. If that's not illegal, like what is that? Like what kind of deception is that? Like you're not allowed to lie. Right? Like if a corporation has found that they're, they're lying about data, they get fined. If they, if they're, if it's found out that they're lying about environmental problems they've created whatever, they get fined. Right. They get in trouble. People could go to jail. But if you could just have like a bunch of people constantly lying for you, or if it's ai, have AI constantly lying for you.

3 (2h 7m 18s):
Yeah. Obscuring the truth. Publishing misleading papers. Right. AI could just start publishing papers, you know, 'cause papers get accepted sometimes that are fucking loony. Like are you aware of the, the grievance fraud papers? Okay. It's a really fascinating story. So these guys who are legitimate academics, they, they just, it's Helen Pluck Pluck Rose. Do you, do you have it? Can you pull it up? James Lindsay and fuck Peter Ian.

3 (2h 7m 59s):
Sorry. Peter. Brain, brain freeze. But the three of them put together these, these grievance papers where they were fake, like fake papers based on ridiculous things like rape culture, the dog park, you know, like and heteronormative behavior of the dog park. Like weird shit like fat bodybuilding, like fake papers. Yeah. And some of 'em won awards. Yeah. Like put up, put up the, the grievance studies affair. Okay. The grievance studies affair was a project with a team of authors, Peter Boian, James A. Lindsay and Helen Pluck Rose to highlight what they saw as poor scholarship and erosion of standards in several academic fields taking place over 2017, 2018.

3 (2h 8m 46s):
Their project entailed submitting bogus papers to academic journals on topics from the field of critical social theory or in derogatory to terms Ry culture, queer race, gender fat, and sexuality studies to determine whether or not they would pass through peer review and be accepted for publication. Several of these papers were subsequently published with the authors cited in support of their contention. Yeah. Okay. So let's find out what the names of the studies were. 'cause they were very funny. Like some of 'em were really, really ridiculous.

4 (2h 9m 20s):
So basically these are reviewed by other supposedly academic humans.

3 (2h 9m 24s):
Yeah. So Peter Ian, who was, was he at the University of Portland? Right here. What are the names of the papers right here? Okay. Human Reactions to Rape Culture and Queer Performativity in Urban Dog Parks in Portland, Oregon.

4 (2h 9m 46s):
Wow.

3 (2h 9m 47s):
Oh my God. It's amazing. They're all retracted obviously. 'cause people found out that they're fake studies going in through the back door. Challenging straight male homo hysteria and transphobia through receptive penetrative sex toy use.

4 (2h 9m 60s):
Oh my God. Can we read that? What is that? That's hilarious.

3 (2h 10m 4s):
It's amazing. It's amazing. They were saying that like, guys of homophobia, you should get pegged. Oh. And that'll get over, you'll get over the

4 (2h 10m 12s):
Transphobia and it, there's just somebody that has to review that and they're like, well I'm not gonna be the one that gets in trouble for,

3 (2h 10m 18s):
It's basically a study. They're amazing. We like what you're saying. They have retracted. This article has come to light that does not pres present genuine research. This article was not authored by M Smith as stated on submission. But Peter Boggo and Helen Pluck Rose James Lindsay have all publicly admitted it was written by them under false pretense. Nah.

4 (2h 10m 44s):
Oh my God. Oh yeah.

3 (2h 10m 47s):
To date very little research literature exists concerning re receptive penetration. Anal eroticism in straight men of particular interests is impact upon other factors relevant to masculinities sex roles and the studies of sex life. Several, it's hard to read this 'cause it says red redacted over the top of it. It likely could be relevant to straight male sexuality, including masturbatory play with penetrative toys. Specifically this study seeks to explore do men who report greater discomfort with receptive penetrative anal eroticism also report less transphobia, less obedience to masculine gender norms, greater partner sensitivity and greater awareness about rape.

3 (2h 11m 31s):
The study uses semi-structured interviews with 13 men to explore this question. Analyze with a naturalist and constructivist grounded theory approach in the context of sexuality's research and introduces trans hysteria as parallel concept to Anderson's homo hysteria. This analysis recognizes, I can't read that. It's covered over socially remedial value for encouraging male anal eroticism with sex toys. Encouraging. So fucking they were just trying to say, that's unbelievable. The social sciences are bullshit. Yeah. And that all this theory and all this, you're, these are insane people and they're talking about nonsense.

3 (2h 12m 12s):
And so they made these papers and you know, some of 'em won awards.

4 (2h 12m 19s):
Unbelievable. They're basically saying if you shove stuff up a straight guy's ass,

3 (2h 12m 25s):
It'll fix all his problems.

4 (2h 12m 26s):
Yeah.

3 (2h 12m 31s):
Imagine there these people that read that and don't go, what the fuck are you talking about? Yeah. There's people that read that and go, yeah, look, idea. I like it. I wonder

4 (2h 12m 40s):
How long the paper, I think

3 (2h 12m 41s):
That is probably what's going on. Yeah. That's probably what they're missing with Everyone's a misfit. That's what it is. Yeah. Misfits have found themselves and they've, they've formed these groups and universities where they're teaching kids and they're teaching them nonsense. And so when a paper slips through that under a civilization that has its wits about it, the the the highest levels of education would read that and go, what the fuck are you talking about? What are you talking about man? You're talking about, did you, you guys did a study where you're pegged dudes to see if you could clear, clear them of trans hysteria.

4 (2h 13m 22s):
Oh my God. What,

3 (2h 13m 23s):
What the fuck are you doing?

4 (2h 13m 24s):
I wanna know the results.

3 (2h 13m 26s):
Yeah. Results are all fake. They made it all up. All the research was fake. Now that was with a bunch of of 'em, but it's just funny that it snuck through. 'cause that's how nuts things are. Things are so nuts in universities. You have so many crazy people teaching kids. Imagine being a kid too. When you're, you're finally getting away from your dad. Maybe your dad's a dope, maybe he's a Fox News monkey and he just fucking always parroting everything that they say. And you're like, God, I can't wait to get away from my repressive father. And you get to a school and these new people embrace you and you know, they take you in, you get to be a part of this new group. And this new group has a totally different ideology from your parents. Man, fuck your parents and fuck the colonists.

3 (2h 14m 7s):
And like, yeah, fuck the colonists. And next thing you know, you're on board with this shit. And then one day you wake up and you're like 27.

4 (2h 14m 15s):
Yeah.

3 (2h 14m 15s):
And you are working and you're like, where are my taxes going?

4 (2h 14m 20s):
It's wild. We had a, we had like, I think she was 25 or something year old girl pulled out of the bucket yesterday on last night on Kill Tony. And she, and she mentioned that she broke up with her boyfriend because she found videos of him sucking a dude's dick on his computer while wearing her clothes. Whew. So he would, when she was away, he would put on her feminine clothes suck

3 (2h 14m 50s):
And have guys come over and it suck guys' dicks. Yeah. Everybody's got their thing, don't he? Yeah.

4 (2h 14m 55s):
It's a, it's wild times. It's, I asked, I asked her, I go, did he come out as gay after that? Did he come outta your closet?

3 (2h 15m 5s):
Do how much of this trend that you see in society towards whether it's transgenderism or queerness or this acceptance of this, not just accept but celebration of the L-B-G-T-Q lifestyle. Is it possible that a percentage of that is influenced and engineered just like these corporate trolls or influencing narratives? Is there a percentage where China is making everybody gay in Russia?

4 (2h 15m 37s):
Right? Yeah. Do you

3 (2h 15m 38s):
Think, do you think it's possible? I don't think it's 100. I'm not saying that gay people don't exist. I'm not saying that gay people and trans people shouldn't be free Of course you should be. That's not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is how many lost people are being influenced by a narrative that is in some way being influenced by foreign governments. I'm not saying it's all of it, but is it 5%? Like what's the number? Like what, what is the number that where this message gets elevated specifically as a way to, whether it's demoralize or confuse or cause some sort of societal disruption.

3 (2h 16m 19s):
Like if I was in a foreign government and I was gonna figure out a way to fuck with a country, what better way than have a bunch of gender confusion. Right. And people mad about gender confusion.

4 (2h 16m 31s):
I guarantee you that per capita, there's more gays in America than there are in China. If you could hand out that questionnaire. Yeah,

3 (2h 16m 39s):
But maybe, maybe not though. Maybe it's like the Catholic school girl thing where you tell 'em they can't do it and they just wanna do it.

4 (2h 16m 45s):
Alright, let me put it this way. I guarantee you there's more people willing to admit they're gay in America. Oh yeah. Than in China and Russia. Oh

3 (2h 16m 53s):
Yeah, for sure. Well I think in

4 (2h 16m 55s):
Russia's illegal, have you ever seen a Russian admit to being gay?

3 (2h 16m 57s):
I think it's illegal. I think there's something great. Like what are the laws in Russia on gay? That was one of the things that Pussy Riot where we're protesting about back in the day. Do you remember that Russian girl punk band? Pussy Riot? Yeah.

4 (2h 17m 14s):
They were Russian.

3 (2h 17m 15s):
Yeah. Huh. Bro, you wanna be an activist in Russia. That's a different kind of courage. That's a different kind of courage. Yeah. That's a different kind of courage. You want to do protests in Russia? They'll beat the fuck outta you. They'll lock you in jail. Right. But I think there's like laws against homosexuality. Yeah.

6 (2h 17m 34s):
Stalin in 1934 made it illegal for anal sex between men three to five years imprisonment.

4 (2h 17m 42s):
And then you're in a prison butt fucking forever.

3 (2h 17m 45s):
Right. But that was illegal in America at the time too. Lenny Bruce used to have a joke about that Lenny, one of Lenny Bruce's rare jokes that culturally still work today. He was like, dig. So you take these guys that they're into guys and you say, Hey, you can't be gay. That's illegal. So you lock 'em up with a bunch of men and wanna have sex with 'em.

4 (2h 18m 10s):
Yeah. That's amazing.

3 (2h 18m 12s):
They knew that guys were fucking each other in prison in the fifties, in the sixties. Yeah. Everybody knew it. But homosexuality at that time I think was illegal in America. At least in some way.

6 (2h 18m 25s):
It's sodomy is what was illegal.

3 (2h 18m 28s):
Right. But that's what that is. Right. So you could be gay, just can't do anything 'cause sodomy is mouth and and butt.

4 (2h 18m 35s):
Okay.

3 (2h 18m 36s):
Yeah.

4 (2h 18m 36s):
Yeah.

6 (2h 18m 37s):
And then they changed it to same sex tmy in some states along the way.

3 (2h 18m 41s):
Finally. So straight people could do their mouth and butt thing.

4 (2h 18m 46s):
Who was the last,

3 (2h 18m 47s):
The last guy to get convicted? Shit.

6 (2h 18m 50s):
2003.

3 (2h 18m 51s):
What state? His last dude who was eating? Yeah. In the 1860s.

6 (2h 18m 56s):
I bet you could figure it

3 (2h 18m 57s):
Out. Alabama. No, Georgia. No. Tennessee.

4 (2h 19m 0s):
California.

6 (2h 19m 1s):
2003.

3 (2h 19m 2s):
New York, Texas. Yeah. Yeah. Texas, West Virginia,

4 (2h 19m 5s):
Texas. It was 2003. Guy got arrested

3 (2h 19m 8s):
For eating ass, your Honor. He was eating that girl's ass. I walked in, I called him in the middle of something against our lord

6 (2h 19m 17s):
Missouri had a law against homosexual conduct.

4 (2h 19m 21s):
Ooh, wow. We could all get arrested for that.

3 (2h 19m 24s):
The crazy thing about calling it sodomy is like you're talking about Sodom and Gomorrah, you're talking about a biblical thing. Like that's what's wild about that term. Like that's the origin of the term sodomy. So if you're saying that someone can't do gay stuff, you're saying they can't do gay stuff because the Bible says it's illegal.

4 (2h 19m 41s):
Lawrence verse Texas is what

3 (2h 19m 42s):
It's called.

4 (2h 19m 43s):
Wow.

3 (2h 19m 43s):
That's, that's 2003 is a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court in which the court ruled that sanctions of criminal punishment for consensual non adult, non procreative sexual activity, commonly referred to as sodomy laws are unconstitutional. The court reaffirmed the concept of a right to privacy that earlier cases had found the US Constitution provides, even though it is not explicitly, explicitly enumerated it based, its ruling on the notion that personal autonomy defined one's own relationships and of American traditions of non interference with private sexual decisions between consenting adults. Fucking duh. Imagine it took till 2003.

3 (2h 20m 25s):
That is nuts. Yeah. So in 1998, John Geddes Lawrence Jr. An older white man was arrested along with Tyron Garner, a younger black man at Lawrence's apartment in Harris County, Texas. Garner's former boyfriend had called the police claiming that there was a man with a weapon in the apartment.

4 (2h 20m 47s):
What a bitch move. Oh man, what a b ex-boyfriend. There he is. What a

3 (2h 20m 51s):
Bitch move. Garner

4 (2h 20m 53s):
His. His old white man. Ex-boyfriend's just getting imp pounded by some beast.

3 (2h 20m 58s):
Set up a bitch. He's got a gun. Garner's former boyfriend had called the police claiming that there was a man with a weapon in the apartment. Sheriff Deputy said they found the men engaging in sexual intercourse.

4 (2h 21m 9s):
Oh, what the fuck.

3 (2h 21m 10s):
Imagine. Imagine you're in the middle of having some good old butt fucking

4 (2h 21m 13s):
And just a bunch of police with revolvers

3 (2h 21m 16s):
SWAT

4 (2h 21m 17s):
Teams. Texas fucking fucking Hold up. Hold a stop. Stop.

3 (2h 21m 22s):
They got night vision on. She has fucking, they brought a dog. Jesus Christ.

4 (2h 21m 30s):
Roro Roro,

3 (2h 21m 32s):
Lawrence and Garner were charged with misdemeanor under Texas antis sodomy law. Imagine they broke into these guys' house while they were having sex and they charged him with the anti sodomy law. Both pleaded no contest and received a fine assisted by the American Civil Organization Lambda. Legal, not to be confused as Nambla North American man, boy love association. You know that's a real thing.

4 (2h 22m 1s):
Yeah. No,

3 (2h 22m 2s):
That's crazy. South Park. Yeah. Lawrence and Garner appealed their sentences through the Texas Court of Appeals. It's ruled in 2000. Sodomy law was unconstitutional. Texas appealed to have the court. Wow. Texas was like, Nope.

4 (2h 22m 15s):
Suspicious.

3 (2h 22m 16s):
We're appealing that appeal. You ain't but fucking in my county son.

4 (2h 22m 22s):
Look at here.

3 (2h 22m 22s):
Page 25, right here in the good buck says no, but fucking

4 (2h 22m 28s):
Oh my God. You'll let one in. You'll let 'em all in.

3 (2h 22m 32s):
Yeah. A man cannot layeth with another man. Oh

4 (2h 22m 35s):
My God.

3 (2h 22m 35s):
Yeah. I mean, what is the, the origins of the term sodomy. Can you Google that? I'm 99% sure it comes from Sodom and Gaura. Yeah. Yeah. But what is it de describe when it says sodomy? Like when you say

6 (2h 22m 50s):
Like the biblical description of it. Yeah.

3 (2h 22m 51s):
Alright. Biblical. Well, Sodom and Gamora. Right. So they, they were apparently engaging in all these awful things and God decided to smite them. Right. That's the story. Do you remember

4 (2h 23m 1s):
The story I mean? Someone tried to put a bad name on fucking Sodom. He did something.

3 (2h 23m 6s):
Something happened. and I think it was, it was like a town, right? Yeah, yeah,

6 (2h 23m 12s):
Yeah.

3 (2h 23m 13s):
But what was it? Two towns, Sodom and Gamora.

6 (2h 23m 15s):
Yeah. They were next to each other.

3 (2h 23m 16s):
They just both bud fucking just going. Getting outta control. Getting getting crazy. Hilarious. and

6 (2h 23m 20s):
It sounds like Vegas.

3 (2h 23m 22s):
It sounded like Vegas. It was their version of Vegas. And everybody was like, Hey, hey, hey, hey. And they're like, whatcha talking about we figured out a way to fucking not have kids. Yeah. And God's like Uhuh Uhuh. No, not up the butt

6 (2h 23m 35s):
Where it says it right here I guess.

3 (2h 23m 36s):
Okay. This is the addresses. People as from Sodom and Gomorrah associate Sodom with shameless sinning and tells Babylon that it will end like those two cities. So what happened to Sodom and Gomorrah in the Bible?

6 (2h 23m 51s):
Oh that was the fire and brimstone.

3 (2h 23m 53s):
Right? Can you just find out what it says? I just wanna read the description. Oh wow. Is it the top? Wasn't that it? Did we

6 (2h 23m 58s):
Have to do bible

3 (2h 23m 59s):
Study now? Wasn't that it at the top? No. Yeah. We're doing bible study. Jamie,

6 (2h 24m 1s):
This is, this I know this is a long description. It doesn't say anything that you're looking for. It definitely isn't gonna say anything. My butt fucking in the Bible I know that. It's a lot of like inferred. This is what they were talking about.

3 (2h 24m 17s):
Right. I don't think that's butt fucking in the Bible. So it just, it's just, you're talking about sin, but how does it become specifically sin? Like of butt fucking, like if you said someone sodomize someone, you would say they butt fucked. Right.

6 (2h 24m 31s):
Hold on, lemme do like

4 (2h 24m 32s):
Sodomize. It seems like, it's, seems like religion is kind of penetrated society on this one. You know what I mean? Like in the law? 'cause that's what they say is against the law, right? Sodomy. Yes. Was that part of the thing? Yes. and

6 (2h 24m 48s):
It comes from Latin, the sin of sodomy, sin of Sodom

3 (2h 24m 51s):
Sin of Sodom. So why is sodomy a sin? Jesus joins other ancient authorities in viewing the sins of the sodomites as the abuse of strangers neglecting the poor and the needy and the stigmatizing of outsiders. Whoa. Wait a minute. Now it gets weird. Yeah. Now it gets weird. 'cause I like what Jesus is saying. So Jesus is saying, when you commit sodomy, the sin is the abuse of strangers neglecting the poor and the needy and then stigmatizing of outsiders. And then Texas is like, yeah, but fucking, yeah. Basically butt fucking, that shit's illegal. Man. Don't be butt fucking. No, no, no. And Jesus like, that's not what I said.

3 (2h 25m 31s):
Right? Jesus is like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm saying don't be shitty to strangers. Go scroll back down so I can read that again. Don't neglect the porn in the needy and don't stigmatize others. See, this is how we prevent wars. You other people. Right? Jesus is saying don't do that. And everybody's like, yeah, no butt. Fucking Jesus said it. Yeah.

4 (2h 25m 50s):
Try here. Hey. No stigmatizing around

3 (2h 25m 52s):
Here. But imagine if that's what the sins of Sodom and Gamo were. They were just shitty to people. Yeah. And Jesus was like, don't be shitty to people. And then someone was like, I heard they were butt fucking too. That's even worse. That's even worse. There was probably some dude who really wanted a butt fuck and be so angry that he couldn't butt fuck. Nobody gets to butt fuck. Right. Because that's a lot of it. Like when you find people that are like vly, anti-gay, you're always like, Hmm, how long before they catch you in a wetsuit? Ooh. Dildo up your ass.

6 (2h 26m 23s):
Addition to

3 (2h 26m 24s):
This. Okay. Unnatural sexual relations such as those customs imputed to the inhabitants of biblical Sodom, especially between men, but also with breasts from beast beasts. Oh, excuse me. From beast, from old French sodomy. Compare late Latin anal sex. Literally the sins of Sodom from the Latin. Sad in middle English also sin. Mike, did you know that some forms of syphilis apparently came from people fucking animals?

4 (2h 27m 3s):
No.

3 (2h 27m 3s):
Yeah.

4 (2h 27m 4s):
Do you know what animal?

3 (2h 27m 5s):
I think it's sheep. Is that true? I might have made that up. I know that there's different forms of syphilis and one, they're pretty sure came from the, the, the original people in the Mayflower coming over and having sex with Native Americans. Oh. And then going back to Europe and giving them vd and giving them syphilis. The kind of syphilis is just killing everybody because like that's the syphilis that like makes your fucking rot chunks outta your fucking face. Yeah. And your nose falls off and shit. Yeah. And apparently that really started hitting Europe right after the, the, the Mayflower and the Pinta and the Santa Maria. Interesting. Like right after that You got a piss.

3 (2h 27m 46s):
You making that? No, I got a pee move. No. Okay. Okay. Just checking. No. So they were, but there was another version of syphilis apparently that already existed in Europe that they think came from bestiality. He's sick fucks.

6 (2h 28m 1s):
I don't

3 (2h 28m 2s):
Know. Is that true? Is that fake? don don't

6 (2h 28m 3s):
Know. This says important importantly like small smallpox. There is no known animal reservoir for syphilis.

4 (2h 28m 13s):
Animal reservoir.

6 (2h 28m 13s):
Does that mean that they can't keep it? Hold it, store

3 (2h 28m 16s):
It. Yeah. That means you can't get it from them. I thought that, oh, so that means that animals don't have syphilis. So it's not, so what was the origin for the original syphilis in Europe? I, God, I swear I thought I read something about it being connected to animals. Maybe that, maybe that was just a rumor. Maybe that was one of those things that was like, people thought that's what happened. But then they found out it's not the case. 'cause there wasn't an animal reservoir. 'cause you know that animals have covid. What's really weird? Like deer, they've tested a bunch of deer that have covid and they're like, how, how the fuck did they get covid? How did, how did wild deer get covid?

3 (2h 28m 56s):
Right. Like really? How did that spread? But I think during the height of the pandemic, there was like a good percentage of deer that they would test that tested positive for COVID-19

4 (2h 29m 7s):
Maybe 'cause of the, if it's in an area where there's feeders or something. Could be human contamination. Could

3 (2h 29m 13s):
Be, could be maybe people handling the deer. If it's not wild deer, maybe it's deer that get released in the wild and they give it to the wild deer.

4 (2h 29m 23s):
Yeah. Like what deer are getting covid tested? Probably ones near humans.

3 (2h 29m 29s):
Well, definitely ones near humans. 'cause they're, they're probably ones that were hunted. They shot 'em and then they tested them. I'm pretty sure that was the how they found out. don don't know. I'm not sure about that though.

6 (2h 29m 41s):
This article even says that medieval DNA studies didn't come, Columbus didn't trigger syphilis in Europe. They already had it there.

3 (2h 29m 50s):
Yes. That's but, but, but this guy was saying the other day that was telling me that he understand he's a, he's a doctor. He's saying there's really two different kinds of syphilis though. It's like syphilis did already exist in Europe. But he said it's pretty obvious that the syphilis that happened specifically right afterwards seemed to be more aggressive and different. And this was the, the idea that the syphilis had come from America.

6 (2h 30m 16s):
They went looking

3 (2h 30m 18s):
Okay, the team went looking for syphilis. What they found was a much wider array of treponemal strains. Not just syphilis, but also jaws, which today has found exclusively the tropics and it previously undiscovered strain with no modern day counterpart. We see that many different lineages were present in Europe, which we did not know before. Sheneman says what's more the dating range given the two strains is bounded on the lower end by ages in the early to mid 14 hundreds. Potentially the first DNA evidence that syphilis existed in Europe prior to Columbus's contact with the Americas. Interesting.

3 (2h 30m 59s):
So it may be that it existed there, but then they brought back a more virulent strain or something. don don't know. don don't know who's right. but it is wild that that's one of the ways that these infectious diseases got passed on. People would just show up with 'em. And that's the thing, like when people talk about the genocide of the Native Americans, what they leave a lot of folks, maybe no one even know is that 90% of them die because of diseases.

4 (2h 31m 23s):
Right.

3 (2h 31m 24s):
Imagine that country where 90% of the people die. Imagine if like this thing that's happening right now where the borders are open and all these South American people are just storming through. It's crazy. Yeah. If you see the border Yeah. Of America, it's fucking nuts. It's a wide open border, which is just insane. But when you're watching that, imagine if they brought over a disease that killed 90% of the people here. Whoa. That's what happened in 1492. Whoa.

4 (2h 31m 52s):
I never thought of it that way. Yep.

3 (2h 31m 54s):
There was a hundred million Native Americans here at one point in time. They estimate,

4 (2h 31m 58s):
Did you say a hundred million?

3 (2h 31m 59s):
A hundred million. Oh

4 (2h 31m 60s):
Fuck. Damn. Yeah, we were, that was,

3 (2h 32m 3s):
How wild is that? That's crazy. That's the high estimates. What's make, make sure that's true. I'm pretty sure that's true. But

4 (2h 32m 11s):
They, they

3 (2h 32m 12s):
Were just, they used to think there was much less. And then as time was gone on, they've realized also they've been here a lot longer than they thought. They found footprints of people that were here 22,000 years ago. They had this idea of Clovis first, I don't know what the specific time period of Clovis, but the Clovis period. They thought that was the beginning of people in North America and now they're like, Nope. We found footprints of people 22,000 years ago. And they're like, holy shit. Wow. Yeah. A hundred million or more population figures for the indigenous peoples of America prior to European colonization have been difficult to establish. By the end of the 20th century, most scholars gravitated towards an estimate of around 50 million with some historians arguing for an estimate of 100 million or more.

3 (2h 32m 53s):
Wow. In an effort to circumvent the hold in which the Ottoman Empire held on the overland trade routes to East Asia. And the hold that the attorney Regis granted to Portugal on maritime roots via the African coast and the Indian Ocean, the monarchs of the nascent Spanish empire decided to fund Columbus's voyage in 1492, which eventually led to the establishment of settler co colonial states and the migration of millions of Europeans to the Americas. That's nuts. What an invasion. What a crazy invasion. I mean. That is one of the wildest stories in human history, you know, and it's so ironic that at that same place people are bitching that people are storming in from the border.

3 (2h 33m 43s):
Yeah. It's kind of funny. I mean they, they have a good point. You really do have to have secure borders. But still, it's kind of wild that this one country that was literally established as a place to go to when you're fleeing a place that sucks, you're like, yeah, we're, we're full. We're full kids.

4 (2h 34m 1s):
Stay out. I wonder what the study is on that in like Australia. I've never really thought about the number of the natives that were there before.

3 (2h 34m 11s):
Oh, well the crazy thing about Australia, my friend Adam Greentree, you know Adam? Yeah. He was here the other day explaining to us the number of different languages they have and that a lot of 'em aren't even written down. And that these tribes will be, they're called the mobs of Aborigines. That a mob will be 30 kilometers or 300 kilometers away from another mob. And they speak a totally different language and they don't even know what it is. Like they can't communicate with each other. Wow. He said there's hundreds of them, hundreds of different languages. So

4 (2h 34m 41s):
If they needed a cup of sugar, they wouldn't even know how to ask for

3 (2h 34m 43s):
It. They're not ask for it. And they've been around for a long fucking time, man. They've been in that place for a long, long, long, long, long time. And they find like ancient artwork on walls of caves and shit and sides of cliffs. And it's like he's found a bunch of like ancient aborigines art because it's so wild. You're just like, you're looking at this thing like, how old is this? Like no one even knows. Wow. Yeah. But they used to have, was it Australia? No, it was New Zealand. I think they had a ho, they had an eagle that would could kill people. It was called the host eagle. It was an enormous eagle. And they think they went extinct 'cause people decided to kill 'em.

3 (2h 35m 25s):
'cause they were killing people probably. Yeah. So they found the, you know, the whatever fossils and skeletons this fucking eagle. And they found, I think there, don don't know if it's, I don't know if they're connected, but I know they've found primates. There's a lot of primates that get killed by eagles. It's like a common thing. Like especially in South America, there's an eagle called the harpy eagle. It's amazing. I think it's the biggest of the eagles that are alive today. and it kills a lot of monkeys. And when the monkeys see that fucking eagle coming, man, they go crazy. Damn. They scream and run. They run around the tree. They're trying to hide. This motherfucker comes in looking like a demon, just a snatching demon from the sky.

3 (2h 36m 11s):
They keep that sloth population in check though. Oh yeah. Good. Good luck being a sloth.

4 (2h 36m 16s):
Easy pickens

3 (2h 36m 19s):
Nature fucked them. Why did nature do that? Imagine

4 (2h 36m 24s):
They have to eat eucalyptus all the time or they're like, do they start to fucking get antsy? I

3 (2h 36m 30s):
Think that's a koala bear.

4 (2h 36m 31s):
Oh yeah, you're right. Yeah.

3 (2h 36m 34s):
Koala bears are actually like little bears. They're actually, they, they behave like bears apparently when they mate it's like very aggressive and people

4 (2h 36m 42s):
Very, oh yeah. I held one in for the first time. I think the last time I was there. Just finally got around to the stupid zoo visit and fucking they do Have you, have you held one? No. Oh, it's so interesting. So it's like holding

3 (2h 36m 55s):
A bear bear. It is. I'm holding a bear.

4 (2h 36m 58s):
It is. And it's fucking just a little bear heavy. It's like dense.

3 (2h 37m 0s):
Yeah.

4 (2h 37m 1s):
It feels like two or three bowling balls like at once. And you know, they'll have like a hand on you or whatever. So the person or you has to keep feeding it leaves of eucalyptus. And if it goes like, if it goes, it felt like these are, 'cause these were some addicted like child star fucking koala bears that work at the zoo All day. So, so don don't know if they're all like this, but if they go like 10 or 20 seconds without getting another hit of eucalyptus, they're fucking little hands start to fucking claw at you. Well not claw at you, but like you

3 (2h 37m 34s):
Let you know

4 (2h 37m 35s):
A little grip.

3 (2h 37m 36s):
Right? Hey fucker. Right.

4 (2h 37m 38s):
Yeah. They get a little

3 (2h 37m 39s):
Like snoop does and he paws your face. Yep. Pet me bitch. Yep. Yeah.

4 (2h 37m 45s):
Eucalyptus addicts.

3 (2h 37m 47s):
Yeah. That's a weird thing man, that you get a wild animal. You just keep you look, I got 'em tamed. Let, I'm tamed. It's like, hey, hey, hey, hey,

4 (2h 37m 54s):
Hey. Yeah. Where's the fucking food? Right? I know I look cute. Yep. I

3 (2h 37m 57s):
Bite your fucking nose off bitch. Exactly. Now imagine a bear that's a thousand pounds. Yeah, I think that little thing like how dense it feels, right? Oh

4 (2h 38m 7s):
It's crazy.

3 (2h 38m 7s):
Imagine when as big as this room, that's how big they are.

4 (2h 38m 12s):
Does anybody ever hunt them with bows and arrows?

3 (2h 38m 14s):
Oh yeah. Yeah. They do a lot. Yeah. Look at 'em. It's growling. Whoa.

4 (2h 38m 22s):
You gotta remember those tiny little what look like tiny paws are holding up that heavy thing. Yeah, a little heavy thing. Yeah.

3 (2h 38m 29s):
It's gut claws. I mean it's climbing with ease. They climb trees like it's nothing. What a crazy looking animal too. Imagine the first guy to see one of those. You're like, what is that? Yeah, look at that fucking thing. How strange.

4 (2h 38m 46s):
A giant.

3 (2h 38m 46s):
But I guess back then everything was strange. They had so many I. mean Australia's got so many weird animals, man. Yeah. All the marsupials I think come from Australia, which is weird. Like where? How'd that happen? Why you got a fucking hoodie When you get a front pocket you keep your baby in. Like, what the fuck is that? Yeah. No other animals in the world don don't think have it.

4 (2h 39m 7s):
So interesting.

3 (2h 39m 8s):
I think they're the only animal. I think it's only I know if that's true. If Australia's the only place where there's marsupials. 'cause I know that Tasmanian tiger. I think that was a marsupial, which is nuts because it looked like a dog.

4 (2h 39m 23s):
I don't, I don't know that one.

3 (2h 39m 25s):
Tasmanian Tigers a well,

6 (2h 39m 26s):
70% are found in Australia. The rest are found in the Americas.

3 (2h 39m 30s):
Really? What part of the Americas have found

6 (2h 39m 32s):
Primarily South America? 13 and Central America and one species. The Virginia possum in North

3 (2h 39m 37s):
America. Whoa. No shit.

4 (2h 39m 40s):
There's a possum in in

3 (2h 39m 42s):
Virginia. That's a sial. Wow. What are the big, what are the other big ones? 'cause I know there's like, for sure the biggest ones. Kangaroos get fucking giant. There's two kangaroos. There's a red one and a gray one. I forget which one gets huge, but one of 'em gets fucking huge. Like real big. And they'll fuck you up. Like they're, they're giant. They're like seven feet tall and they'll fucking kick your guts out. They get up on their back tail. They'll sit up on the tail and just fucking kick at you. What

6 (2h 40m 14s):
Is it?

3 (2h 40m 15s):
A kangaroo?

4 (2h 40m 16s):
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, they're crazy. Yeah.

3 (2h 40m 17s):
Yeah. You're like, what am I talking about?

4 (2h 40m 19s):
Right. No, I was thinking about how weird it was. I got stuck on that fucking weed. We smoked during the Kanye song was powerful.

6 (2h 40m 25s):
I typed, I said, where the marsupials in South America just, am

3 (2h 40m 28s):
I incorrect that marsupials or the all, they all carry their baby in their pouch. That

6 (2h 40m 33s):
Might not be the correct definition, but I thought so.

3 (2h 40m 35s):
I thought so. So there's marsupials in South America. Yeah. But the big weird ones are Australia. Any members of the mammalian Infa Infra class? Marsupia. All ex extent marsupials are? Yeah. So it's says,

6 (2h 40m 50s):
Oh, you usually have a pouch. Yeah.

3 (2h 40m 53s):
Usually have a pouch. Kangaroos. Wombats, bandit. Cos wombat. Yeah.

6 (2h 41m 0s):
I have, I've seen something recently. Have you seen a shark? I guess egg.

3 (2h 41m 6s):
Wow. don? Don't think so.

6 (2h 41m 8s):
All right. Lemme show you this one. 'cause it, it's like, it was a, it was a very specific kind.

3 (2h 41m 12s):
Oh, I have seen sharks in the, I thought sharks give birth. So this is like the eggs before they're fertilized.

6 (2h 41m 18s):
This is a spiral Shark egg.

3 (2h 41m 22s):
Yo. Whoa. That's

6 (2h 41m 24s):
What their egg looks like. The person that posted this video, like on TikTok or So Yeah, this is the one that was on TikTok recently. They found it on the coast. Holy, holy shit. Like on the, on the edge. And they're trying to figure out what they should do with it. Usually they get like lodged. Cook it. Yeah, you can see the larvae in it.

3 (2h 41m 38s):
Whoa. That's amazing. Philip. Holy shit. Philip

4 (2h 41m 42s):
Would hit that shit with a torch for three seconds and take it right down.

29 (2h 41m 46s):
It's another horn, shark, egg

6 (2h 41m 48s):
Ca horn, shark

3 (2h 41m 50s):
Horn, shark. Have another look how

29 (2h 41m 51s):
Beautiful that is. So a lot of questions about these guys. People were asking me if they were hard because it looks like glass I know, but

6 (2h 41m 59s):
It looks like a Nerf.

29 (2h 41m 60s):
They actually soft and then the, like

6 (2h 42m 2s):
A football we throw soft is

29 (2h 42m 3s):
Pretty squishy. Don't want to squish it. But let me see if we can, there's not really any sun. Wow. Trying to see if we can see through it at all. Okay. So I was actually able to get a little bit of Wow. And you can see the little

3 (2h 42m 18s):
Embryo in the, oh my god, it's alive wash. This

29 (2h 42m 20s):
Is so exciting.

3 (2h 42m 22s):
Oh my god. The embryo's alive. So could they take that and turn it into a shark? Or does it have to do that inside the mother's womb? That's nuts.

6 (2h 42m 32s):
You don. Like if someone could grab that and raise it. don don't know

3 (2h 42m 34s):
I. don, can you break them in them chicken places? Will they do it with chickens?

6 (2h 42m 38s):
But it an incubator? Yeah,

3 (2h 42m 39s):
An incubator. don

6 (2h 42m 41s):
Don't know. don don't think I doubt it. Why can't you I don I mean? I, I've

3 (2h 42m 44s):
Never tried 'cause they hate sharks. 'cause people hate sharks.

6 (2h 42m 45s):
We could go look for one and try, I guess

4 (2h 42m 47s):
I wonder what happens after that.

3 (2h 42m 48s):
It's just, oh, it's watching a fishing video in Key West and there's a bridge that these dudes fish on and when they catch a fish, it's a mad rush to get the fish to the surface. 'cause there's so many bull sharks there. It's like infested with bull sharks and they lose fish All day long to, and so this guy catches a bull shark and cooks it and eats it. And that's a real controversial thing nowadays. 'cause for whatever reason, it's like one of those ideological things. People have decided that, oh my god, you, you eat sharks. Don't you know sharks are endangered? Like no. Maybe some, maybe all the over the world, their numbers are down because of shark fin soup. 'cause they cut their fucking fins off and, but for the most part, no.

3 (2h 43m 32s):
Like, especially in certain spots, there's a lot of 'em. It's like saying, are there grizzly bears? Are grizzly bears an endangered species? Well, they're not even in most of the places where they used to be, which is probably a good thing. But that's it right there. Well,

6 (2h 43m 46s):
It's gonna hatch here in a second,

3 (2h 43m 47s):
But they're not, they're not low numbers. If you go to where they live, there's a lot of them there. Yeah. It's just like they're not in San Francisco anymore. Right. But, but they're, if you go to the north, they're there. You can find, go to Alaska, you'll fucking find a lot of 'em, man. They're there.

6 (2h 44m 1s):
So it comes out like that. I guess you Wow. In theory could put one in an aquaquarium. 'cause that's where they have.

3 (2h 44m 6s):
So they just lay 'em. Yeah. And then they come out like that. Okay. So that's a different kind of shark. 'cause I think some sharks give birth to live offspring.

6 (2h 44m 15s):
Yeah. I've never even heard of a horn shark. and it looks a little bit like a, like a, A hippo's face. It's

3 (2h 44m 20s):
Wild looking.

6 (2h 44m 22s):
Like, look at that. It looks kinda like a hippo to me.

3 (2h 44m 24s):
Yeah. Yeah. What a cool egg though. God, that's amazing. Yeah. That's amazing. That's one of the wildest things about the ocean. If the ocean did not exist and we found a world somewhere that was filled with the creatures of the ocean, we would be freaking the fuck out. We'd be like, dude, it's so nuts. They got mammals. They speak languages. They have these creatures that hide from each other by, by literally mimicking the floor of the ocean until something comes by.

6 (2h 44m 53s):
It's only a few sharks like a cat shark, which I've never heard of.

3 (2h 44m 56s):
Lay eggs. So most sharks give birth to live offspring. Wow. Interesting. Cat shark. Whoa. That's cool. You know the weird one is like, you can't keep a great white shark in an aquarium.

6 (2h 45m 14s):
I also noticed that horn shark had two dorsal fins. Maybe there's some sort of differentiation between like, this is technically not a fish, but it is a shark, but it's eggs.

3 (2h 45m 24s):
Right, right. Like a cousin. Yeah. Yeah.

6 (2h 45m 27s):
'cause it doesn't really look like a shark traditionally. Like

3 (2h 45m 29s):
Well it looks a lot different than the sharks that fuck up surfers. Yeah. That's the thing. It's crazy. That keeps me from surfing, bro.

4 (2h 45m 36s):
Yeah. Oh, I'm not into it. It,

3 (2h 45m 38s):
I watched a video yesterday, don don't, I don't know if it was real, but it was a guy on a surfer surfboard where the shark just up and just gets his whole chest. Ugh. God sends him into the air and is just getting his whole chest with a bite. And you're watching it. don don't know if it was real though. That's the thing about today, right? It's it looked real. Yeah. Looked like a surfer. And then all of a sudden he gets bit,

4 (2h 46m 2s):
I don't fuck around with the ocean at all. The river's here, the lake's here. All nice. Very fun. I, I'll never get in the ocean again. Never liked it when I did not my thing. It's

3 (2h 46m 13s):
A spooky

4 (2h 46m 14s):
Place. Yeah, it's crazy. You're very, very, very

3 (2h 46m 16s):
Vulnerable in that

4 (2h 46m 17s):
Spot. It doesn't make any sense.

3 (2h 46m 19s):
Yeah. You can't move good

4 (2h 46m 21s):
Uhuh.

3 (2h 46m 21s):
You go into a place where there's a bunch of monsters and you can't move. Good.

4 (2h 46m 24s):
Slow moving compared to them. You're

3 (2h 46m 26s):
So slow. You're like,

4 (2h 46m 28s):
Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

3 (2h 46m 29s):
Boom. And they're like, sh.

4 (2h 46m 31s):
Yeah. We're like a cheerio. We're the one Cheerio left in a cereal bowl for them. It's just scoop.

3 (2h 46m 37s):
I was watching a video yesterday of a shark attacking another shark. It bites his shark's tail off. So this one smaller shark is swimming and this big shark comes up behind it and bites his tail off. You wanna get in there with that? They kill each other. You wanna get in there with that? They're monsters. They move so much faster than you. You're so vulnerable and they kill each other. What are they gonna do to you? They're gonna try you. We think they're gonna, oh, that's a person. don don't like you people. They're just mindless black-eyed. Like no, no nothing. Just death in that eye. Yeah. That's like space. That eye, that eye has no emotion. Just, and you're gonna get in there with that.

3 (2h 47m 17s):
What for thrills. Oh, you like the way the water feels under the board? Yeah. Okay. I have a lot of friends who do it. God bless you. Yeah. Not me.

4 (2h 47m 26s):
Wild. Not

3 (2h 47m 27s):
Me.

4 (2h 47m 28s):
Crazy.

3 (2h 47m 29s):
Not me. I'd wanna be in an Iron Man outfit with missiles. Yeah.

4 (2h 47m 33s):
Fuck outta

3 (2h 47m 33s):
Here.

4 (2h 47m 34s):
That'd be a fun way to do it.

3 (2h 47m 35s):
That video of that guy getting eaten off the Egyptian coast is absolutely horrific.

4 (2h 47m 41s):
You know, I still haven't seen that one.

3 (2h 47m 42s):
Oh my God. It's horrible. Heard about because the guy's getting killed while Stand by Me is playing.

4 (2h 47m 48s):
Ugh.

3 (2h 47m 49s):
And you're watching the guy Bob up and down the, and he's screaming for his dad while the shark is eating him alive In front of everybody. In front of a resort.

4 (2h 47m 60s):
Damn bro.

3 (2h 48m 2s):
It's a scary way to go, man. Yeah. Imagine resorts. Imagine if there was a resort and the resort was at the edge of the forest. If you go in the forest, you go at your own peril because there's werewolf out there. And most people are like, yeah, but it's really fun. They're like skirt along the edges of the werewolf park. As long as you don't go in the park too deep, like hey, just, I really love being in the trees. It's worth it. It's worth the risks. Werewolves are only a werewolf. Once a month the Moon has to be full. Oh right. Every other day you can just like, you can go fuck in the woods. You don't have to worry about shit. Right. You could, you could go camp, you could have a good time. But when that fucking Moon is full, there's way

4 (2h 48m 45s):
More sharks than werewolves. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. They,

3 (2h 48m 50s):
They could only be a couple of werewolves. Right? Yeah. This is the new thing in Colorado. They just released wolves. So, oh, population of this area where the wolves are being released. Two thirds of the people voted against wolf release.

4 (2h 49m 7s):
Colorado's releasing wolves and taking Trump off the ballot at the same time.

3 (2h 49m 11s):
Yeah. They're releasing wolves. And you know, they have this ideological idea. The problem with releasing wolves is, yeah, wolves used to be there and wolves are cool, but they, the world's different now. They have ranchers there. And these ranchers, they're gonna get attacked by wolves. Their, their cattle are gonna get slaughtered by wolves. People are gonna lose their dogs. Like every, everything around there is gonna have to deal with these repercussions, these people that are actually around wolves. Whereas the people that voted for it, for the most part are in these urban areas where they're like, oh my God, wolves are amazing. Let 'em let 'em go. Yeah. But they don't know what a wolf is 'cause they're never around them. It doesn't mean that wolves aren't cool. They're the coolest fucking animal of all time.

3 (2h 49m 52s):
But boy, you wanna bring them in. Like you want to get, you know, were they big bad wolf? You want 'em really in your neighborhood?

4 (2h 49m 58s):
Were they there and not there anymore because the ranchers killed them. Yeah. Right.

3 (2h 50m 1s):
Yeah. They killed them. The, the people coming across America killed them because they were killing all the cattle and they were killing people's dogs. And you know, it was, you know, not good that they made 'em extinct but not good. Also, if you let 'em populate unchecked. So the problem is they, a lot of times they get them in, in the pretense from these wildlife biologists. When they hit a specific number, they'll open up a season for wolf hunting. But most people are opposed to wolf hunting ideologically. 'cause you're like, wolves are amazing. They're beautiful. You shouldn't hunt them. Right. But the thing is, you let 'em go. And now if they're there and they overpopulate, like historically that's been terrible.

3 (2h 50m 42s):
And I know people don't remember because we've never had like wolf issues during our lifetime because the settlers killed the wolves. If they didn't, there would be wolf issues. That's just a fact. If you let a large population of wolves exist in a place where people exist, you're gonna have wolf problems. Yeah. And people in Canada are well aware of this. And people are in Alaska, they're well aware of this. And now people are gonna find out in all those areas where they've brought wolves. And if they don't manage the population, it could get to be a problem. I've talked about it ad nauseum, but I'll bring it up one more time. In World War I, there was a ceasefire between the Germans and the Russians.

3 (2h 51m 23s):
'cause so many of 'em were getting killed by wolves. They decided to band together and hunt the wolves. Guess what? That can happen here.

4 (2h 51m 30s):
Yeah.

3 (2h 51m 30s):
That can happen everywhere. That can happen where wolves are. Especially if you let wolves go unchecked. And if the people that live in the city is like wolves are amazing. Yeah. I wish there was more of

4 (2h 51m 40s):
'em. So it said they're just releasing five, is that what it

3 (2h 51m 42s):
Said? What does that mean though?

4 (2h 51m 44s):
Right.

3 (2h 51m 44s):
They're gonna fuck. Yeah, they're gonna stick together and they're gonna fuck. And then, you know, there's also wolves that are making their way into Colorado organically. 'cause Colorado border borders, Wyoming. Wyoming has wolves and wolves are coming in organically and they think maybe grizzly bears. There's been reports, my friend Adam Greentree that we were just talking about before, he got video footage of what he says is a grizzly bear. Looks a lot like a grizzly bear in the San Juan mountains. There's been reports of people seeing them. It makes sense. They can, they can walk over there, you know. But to bring them in and to want more of them, more want more wolves like y you better be willing to manage their population.

3 (2h 52m 25s):
Because it'll get to a point where then people will revolt. It's gonna get, it'll get sketchy. It'll be like a lot of other things that happen in this country that are ideological decisions. You know, that like people, they think about like a wolf with their emotions. Like wolves are amazing. They're incredible creatures. I wanna see a wolf. Do you, are you sure? Do you wanna die by a wolf? People die by wolves. That's little red riding hood. That's what that's all about. Those kids stories about the big bad wolf, that what that was was about. Humans used to get attacked by wolves. They'll fucking kill you.

4 (2h 53m 4s):
I don't think we had 'em in Ohio. Right. That's

3 (2h 53m 6s):
Not a thing. Of course we did at one point in time. Wolves have larger than life places than the human imagination. The stories we all grow up with and tell each other, said polis, to see them in their natural habitat and turn around cautiously, curiously at us is a really special moment that I will treasure for my entire life. So that's the governor who was really smiling and clapping. 'cause he thinks he's doing the right thing. When they release the wolves, he thinks he's doing the right thing. And you know, you just have to manage the population. And it's really hard to do that. That's the reason why they poisoned all the wolves back then is because that was really the only way to significantly affect their population numbers.

3 (2h 53m 46s):
You can't hunt them. You can, but you're not gonna put a dent in them. They're just too good. They're too smart, they're too good at moving. They're gonna smell you from a mile away. Once they realize that you're hunting them, good luck. Unless you're hunting 'em from helicopters and you're doing it as like a really barbaric way. You just have like a hunter go hunt them. The best hunters are, you know, not that successful wolf hunting like wolf hunting's difficult. It's a really hard thing to do. You know, they get smart and also you have to go to where they are and they're very nomadic. They can move around. They travel, they, they can traverse a mountain so easily. They can get away from you so easily. You

4 (2h 54m 25s):
Ever see one when you're hunting?

3 (2h 54m 26s):
Never. See, I saw one once going across the road, I believe, I'm not entirely sure, but it looked like a big dog. and it was really late at night and it was in Alberta where they have a lot of wolves. And we were in the woods. It was going across the dirt road and it was, but it was at like, at darkness, like past dusk. It was starting to get dark. Yeah. But I saw this thing run across the road, but I've never seen one up close. Yeah.

4 (2h 54m 50s):
That was the one striving us through past Yellowstone. Is that Wyoming?

3 (2h 54m 55s):
Yellowstone is in Montana and Wyoming. Yeah.

4 (2h 54m 58s):
But we were going through I think Wyoming for some reason and maybe Montana. But anyway, I had something like that where I thought, I saw bison and the whole Kill Tony crew that was in the car is, I'm driving, but I'd been driving for hours. So I don't really, but I'm, I was positive at the time

3 (2h 55m 18s):
They have 'em out there. Yeah.

4 (2h 55m 20s):
But everyone else, there was someone in the back, I can't remember, but someone was like, no, I saw that it was a blah blah blah. I'm like, no, that was a bison.

3 (2h 55m 28s):
But they might not know. Yeah. You, you could both, either one of you could have been. Right. They definitely do have them there though.

4 (2h 55m 36s):
Have you seen one of those? Yes. Oh,

3 (2h 55m 38s):
Okay. Yeah. I've seen 'em in Yellowstone. Yellowstone's weird. 'cause it's like this open air zoo over the animals behave so much different. Like the elk just hang out over by like where the fucking vending machine is. Whoa. They were just laying on the ground. I took a couple selfies with 'em. Wow. Yeah, I gave myself some distance. You know, I didn't like run up on 'em, but I'm like, you know, they're, they're everywhere. And they're, they've realized that the wolves don't come to the visitor center. So they, they hang around the visitor center so they don't get jacked by wolves. 'cause when they reintroduce wolves into Colorado, that's where they reintroduce them. Excuse me. When they reintroduce wolves into Montana, that's where they reintroduce them. They reintroduce them into Yellowstone and they spread out from there and went all over the place.

3 (2h 56m 21s):
Wow. Yeah.

4 (2h 56m 22s):
And what was the thought behind that? Yeah, the Yellowstone people wanted that.

3 (2h 56m 26s):
They, well, I think it was wildlife, biologists and conservation groups. And they, people voted on it and I think the idea was to reintroduce them and then manage their numbers. But then the thing becomes, once they've reintroduced them, then the wildlife activists, they don't want you to hunt them. And so it becomes a lot of disputes about whether or not they should open up a wolf hunting season. They have in Montana. They haven't in other places. I think you can hunt wolves in Montana. You could definitely hunt wolves in Canada. I think you can hunt wolves in Idaho.

4 (2h 57m 1s):
So you can trap

3 (2h 57m 2s):
'em. No, you can trap. There's a bunch of different laws in different places. Right. So I don, I don't wanna speak outta tone right out of a line, but I know you can hunt them like legally, you could shoot them in a bunch of states. Now Montana believe is one of them. But where, what states can you hunt wolves in?

4 (2h 57m 21s):
What do you do with, can you eat beat a wolf?

3 (2h 57m 23s):
You can. No one does though. Right. But like some of the trappers, like there's like ancient trappers and one of, one of these guys who was a famous ancient trapper, I forget his name, but his favorite food was wolf. Wow. He liked to eat wolves. The only time it's acceptable to shoot a wolf in Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming states where wolves have had to undergo reintroduction is when a wolf attacks a person or threatens livestock. Well, well where are they hunting wolves then? Is this still true? Co. So ranchers can shoot 'em only ranch. There's gotta be, so it must be only Canada and Alaska. A wolf tag. Okay.

3 (2h 58m 4s):
Wolf permit can be purchased under the deadline, but a purchase after the deadline requires 24 hour wait period For use. The cost of a non-resident wolf tag is $50. So that means you can buy a tag for wolf hunting. Is this an old

30 (2h 58m 16s):
I just typed in? Where can you, I literally typed

3 (2h 58m 18s):
In states, can you hunt wolves? But is that an old article where it says there's no wolf hunting? Oh, it's no wolf hunting inside the park itself.

30 (2h 58m 27s):
Yeah. This one was for

3 (2h 58m 28s):
Yellowstone. Right. You can't hunt wolves, you can't hunt anything in Yellowstone. Right. But where can you legally hunt wolves? Just, can you just Google? Where can you legally hunt wolves? Right here. Okay, there it goes. Wolves in. Where can you legally hunt wolves in Canada or the United States?

4 (2h 58m 51s):
So yeah, it's like province to province.

3 (2h 58m 54s):
However, wolves have been delisted from the Endangered Species Act are now managed by state wildlife agencies. That means hunting and trapping of gray wolves is allowed in certain states, but with specific regulations and hunting seasons in place. So that's when they delisted 'em, when they realized they had gotten to a point. But they think they've gotten beyond the point where they initially said they would start hunting them. Which states hunt wolves. This is from point 12 though. Okay. Minnesota and Wisconsin bad day be a gray wolf in Wyoming, which today begins the first wolf hunting season in more than half a century. Okay. Wyoming, you can hunt them. It's one of three states. The other two are Minnesota and Wisconsin that will offer hunts for the first time in decades this fall.

3 (2h 59m 35s):
It is not easy. I talked to a guy who was a wolf hunter on Instagram. He's killed quite a few wolves

4 (2h 59m 42s):
With a gun, with

3 (2h 59m 43s):
A rifle. Yeah. Right. And he was telling me it's not easy. It's very difficult. It's, it's hard to get to them. They're very smart. And the whole idea behind it is that like, oh my god, these hunters are gonna kill so many wolves. He's like, most people are not gonna go through this to get a wolf. He's like, it's very hard to

4 (3h 0m 0s):
Do. And they travel in packs,

3 (3h 0m 3s):
They travel in

4 (3h 0m 3s):
Packs. And if you're out there on your own and you only have one rifle and they want you Right, you got a

3 (3h 0m 9s):
Problem. Yeah. And if you're going to be out there, you're gonna have to probably be in a small party of people like you and maybe one or two other people, you know, to avoid detection and to be able to sneak up on 'em. And then you're super vulnerable.

4 (3h 0m 22s):
Oh my god. Oh

3 (3h 0m 23s):
My God. If they find out you're hunting them and they find out you have to do this every time you wanna reload.

4 (3h 0m 30s):
We got all the time in the world.

3 (3h 0m 32s):
I mean.

4 (3h 0m 33s):
Oh my god. It takes a

3 (3h 0m 34s):
Second or two. Oh yeah. If one's coming in this way and one's coming in that way and you shoot that one, they just fucking,

4 (3h 0m 40s):
Just sprinting

3 (3h 0m 41s):
Gets you from the sides. Ah. If wolves realize that, people like have to reload. Oh

4 (3h 0m 46s):
Yeah.

3 (3h 0m 49s):
Shit, then you're gonna have to have semi-automatics. You're gonna have to have people on the sides of you. Yeah. You're gonna have to have wolf proof outfits.

4 (3h 0m 57s):
Where was he hunting wolves at Alaska?

3 (3h 0m 59s):
I'm not sure. It is one of those states. I guess maybe it was Wyoming. I thought it was Montana. But I know. I've seen wolf hunting videos. There's this guy Ryan Lambers, who's a fascinating dude who's a hunter, who is just like very articulate, very intelligent, interesting guy. And he hunted a wolf and put it on YouTube. and I was watching this like, this is wild. You can watch someone shoot a wolf on YouTube wolf hunting. But wherever he was, it was legal. He had a wolf tag. That's why I was asking, I was like, what states? So I guess Wyoming's one of them don don't know if I know what the seasons are when you know if you could do it at only specific times.

3 (3h 1m 40s):
But they're not putting a dent in the population. That's the point. The point is they're gonna keep growing. They their, their packs are gonna keep growing unless they do something about it. And they're never gonna do what they did when they killed them off in the beginning, they just left a bunch of dead horses and they filled 'em up with trick nine and the wolves would go and eat the horses. Oh yeah. And the alphas would get it first. Right. So the alphas would get sick and die off and then it would confuse the population and the rest of 'em would go and eat it and they, they'd all die. Wow. Yeah. Pretty amazing. Pretty amazing that they, they killed off the wolves that way from

6 (3h 2m 14s):
What you read before to now this is updated last year. This year it's changed in Wisconsin at least. Maybe Minnesota

3 (3h 2m 22s):
Also. So they can't hunt them anymore in Wisconsin. And they're re-listed under the Endangered Species Act in February of 2022 after the hunting and trapping season. Killed 218 wolves, which represented 83% more than the state's goal. So that was Wisconsin. Hmm. Interesting. Scroll back up again. In Alaska wolf season generally stretches from August 1st to April 30th. Though different game management units may have different dates. Idaho allows wolf hunting year round on private land. Public land is more restricted depending upon the game management unit. The season could span from August 1st to June 30th or be earlier and shorter from April 1st to November 14th.

3 (3h 3m 5s):
Trapping also has a more restricted season on both public and private land. Trapping is rough.

6 (3h 3m 11s):
Yeah. That's weird.

3 (3h 3m 12s):
Trapping is rough. That's a rough one. Yeah, that's a rough one. You fucking clamp them down right? Or strangle 'em. Yeah. And then just trap there. Freezing to death. Yeah. They find 'em like rigor mortis.

4 (3h 3m 28s):
That's crazy.

3 (3h 3m 29s):
Yeah, it's wild. You know what's wild? Fur is offensive to people like Tim Dylan came in the other day, had his giant raccoon coat on. Amazing. Yeah. Fur's offensive. But leather's not

4 (3h 3m 43s):
Right.

3 (3h 3m 44s):
Leather's. Just skin without the hair. Yeah. That's all it's But skin with the hair is like, hey. Right. You're a terrible person. And the person probably has a leather belt on. Yeah. Might have like leather sneakers on. Right. Leather's fine. Yeah. Like you are also participating in death.

4 (3h 4m 3s):
Yeah.

3 (3h 4m 4s):
That where they just get the skins off this thing and turn 'em into your clothing and you're fine with that. Yeah.

4 (3h 4m 8s):
It's hairless death.

3 (3h 4m 9s):
That's okay. Yeah. Long as you take the hair off and it Right. Make it black and shiny. Yeah. It's crazy. It's most people's shoes. What percentage of shoes, especially dress shoes are leather. Oh yeah. Super high percentage. Right.

4 (3h 4m 24s):
And purses and, oh my

3 (3h 4m 25s):
God. Luggage. Yeah. Here's how goofy California is. California made it so you can't have python anymore.

4 (3h 4m 34s):
The skin. Yeah.

3 (3h 4m 37s):
So if you wanted to buy Python boots, you can't get 'em in California. It's illegal. Wow. You son of a bitch. What are you doing? Meanwhile, Florida is overrun with pythons. Yeah. Florida has so many pythons. They have a bounty on them. I

4 (3h 4m 50s):
Literally was gifted, this is how crazy Texas texases. I was gifted last night. Someone had it sent up to the green room. I was gifted python cowboy boots last night. Less than 20 hours ago.

3 (3h 5m 4s):
You'd be arrested in California, they'd arrest you.

4 (3h 5m 6s):
That's amazing.

3 (3h 5m 8s):
Yeah. And then charge you all kinds of crazy taxes. Yeah.

4 (3h 5m 12s):
Yeah. Hilarious.

3 (3h 5m 15s):
It's

4 (3h 5m 15s):
Nuts, dude. Normal day.

3 (3h 5m 17s):
It's nuts. God. It's like this country might as well be a bunch of different European states. Oh yeah. Like, like European countries that have like completely different languages. Completely different cultures. Yeah. It's so different here. It's so different in so many ways. It's so ridiculously different that you look at like what people are tolerating in these other places. You're like, why? Why are you letting them tell you what to do?

4 (3h 5m 45s):
It's crazy, dude.

3 (3h 5m 46s):
Pythons aren't endangered. You fucking idiots,

4 (3h 5m 48s):
Bro. San Francisco's a different fucking world.

3 (3h 5m 51s):
Yeah. You went, huh?

4 (3h 5m 52s):
This tour, this standup tour that I've been on has been crazy 'cause it's been a real like, okay, let's see where they're at. You know? 'cause you're in downtown, you're at a hotel downtown, you're at the airport. So you get the same type of barometer for each city and how they've, you know, what they're going through or how they've recovered in San Francisco, downtown San Francisco. and I can't believe, and of course they're not. But I can't believe how the news or any mainstream things don't cover this more. 'cause it is crazy. The damage control or the pre, however they, however, this isn't a huge story. It should be a as big of a story as remember like Flint water. Yeah. Like, it's like that except it's the streets.

4 (3h 6m 35s):
So unless you're getting out of a fucking, you know, out of a door and walking straight across the sidewalk into where you're going, you're at massive risk at any point in San Francisco, the streets are rampant with everything and anything. Wow. I saw more people shooting up on the sidewalk. I saw more people shitting. I saw humans shitting. Multiple. Multiple. It's just a normal thing. You just poop on the sidewalk. You get out of a wheelchair and you lean over next to your wheelchair, you go poop and you pull your pants up and you get back in the wheelchair and they keep going down the street. It's like grand theft auto at nighttime. You know what I mean? Things. People are just straggling along.

4 (3h 7m 17s):
It's just, but nothing, nothing's really,

3 (3h 7m 18s):
Were you driving?

4 (3h 7m 20s):
I wasn't personally driving. We had, we had a car service there.

3 (3h 7m 24s):
Jesus Christ, what is it?

4 (3h 7m 25s):
But, but let me tell you what stood out is the fucking hotel had massive private security guards that looked like cops. But they're not cops. They're security guards because the cops are whatever. They can't, they're busy or defunded or whatever's going on up there. They're nowhere to be found. And so these, the, like say a nice hotel or a nice venue has to hire not off-duty cops, but fucking security. Massive. Like old football players and shit. Just huge dudes with fucking

3 (3h 7m 56s):
Just to keep the kooks

4 (3h 7m 57s):
Out. Exactly. Because we, the weekend that we went there, they had just raised, I can't remember the thing, but they're like, you're here on a special weekend. Whoever picked us up from the airport, they're like, so this is the weekend that goes in effect where you can now loot up to a higher amount. Like last week it was 800. Now it's 2000 or 10,000. It's something crazy.

3 (3h 8m 17s):
That's a good idea.

4 (3h 8m 20s):
What is

3 (3h 8m 21s):
The looting thing? Oh, make it so that you could just loot.

4 (3h 8m 24s):
Well, I mean there was, there's a point where we're standing out there smoking, it'll fix everything. Looking at a store across the street and we're like, we could go in there and fucking take something like we could us and we're not being serious. But it's literally like, you could go and you can take something. You know

3 (3h 8m 39s):
How they have everything locked up in plastic?

4 (3h 8m 42s):
Yeah.

3 (3h 8m 42s):
Oh yeah. Whitney sent me this video of this guy in New York City and he brings a blowtorch into like a, a Walgreens god. And he just, oh my god. Blow torches those plastic things and pops 'em open and takes all the medication out and all the stuff that he wanted out. Oh my God. Puts it in a bag. No one stops him. Like what do they, who again, how much of this is engineered? How much of this is, you know, the great conspiracies about people that are trying to engineer the downfall of America? What better way than destabilizing all the cities with rampant crime and constantly changing the laws to make it easier and easier to commit those crimes. And never adjusting.

3 (3h 9m 23s):
Never adjusting. When you see that there's more chaos, more looting, but never adjusting. Constantly defund the police. Constantly do all the things you did that led to this mess. Double down, double down, double down to when to when till it's that movie. Till when Right to when.

6 (3h 9m 44s):
You might have seen this guy before. He runs a channel called Channel five now. It used to be called All Gas No Brakes. I watched this video he made, this is not all the footage he got, but he has a 45 minute documentary on the streets of San Francisco. And just here at the beginning, he's interviewing a guy. I think this guy's about to smoke crack. And while it's happening, a big reach driver gets their car robbed right in front. He goes with in depth crazy. He meets some crazy people.

3 (3h 10m 10s):
All the car's just rolling with no car, no one's driving it. What did I

6 (3h 10m 13s):
Do? Yeah, someone took it. He he goes with this guy.

3 (3h 10m 16s):
Is someone driving that? It looks like he's

4 (3h 10m 17s):
Just rolling in reverse with the car door wide open after I said Grand Theft Auto. So Oh my God. Where else do you see that other than Grand Theft Auto? That is

3 (3h 10m 25s):
So crazy.

6 (3h 10m 25s):
So he goes deep into the, like the Tenderloin district. He, he, some of these guys are giving him really in-depth interviews admitting to stuff that would probably get him arrested. But they're explaining why they're not afraid of saying it. Why? Like, it's, it's wild. This guy that there's another 45 minute or 40 minute video with this guy named Jack the Bier. This guy goes around and steals stuff and he explain to him why, how he does it. He goes with him on one of his like robberies.

3 (3h 10m 50s):
Wow.

6 (3h 10m 50s):
Some of it's tucked on his Patreon, which I have not seen. And some of that looks even crazier. One of the videos, he goes, Jack

3 (3h 10m 56s):
The Viper's got a Patreon.

6 (3h 10m 57s):
No, no, this guy Oh. That made this whole thing.

3 (3h 10m 59s):
Andrew Callahan. Yeah, Andrew Callahan. He's got an OnlyFans.

6 (3h 11m 3s):
He goes into a harm reduction facility. There's, this isn't a 30 minute video showing like what they're giving people. The drugs, they're getting the, the needles, the, it's, it's some of the footage he got is insane.

4 (3h 11m 16s):
And that's in San Francisco.

6 (3h 11m 17s):
And this is just what's on YouTube again. Right. Some of it is not on YouTube and it is crazier. Wow. And this is very recent footage. I he put this out within the last couple weeks. So it's all with like up to date. This is what it's like on the street there.

3 (3h 11m 30s):
Okay. Why is that engineered? Is that just a failure of government, just incompetent government? Or is someone trying to fucking ruin the country? Are they doing a really amazing job of it? Is that what's happening? Something's up. If it wasn't happening. If it, let's pretend it was, let's pretend there's some guy like the Joker and he's engineering the collapse of America and, and he's doing it and it's, he's doing a really good job. Look, if this was a movie Yeah. And you watch this movie in 2015, you'd be like, there's no way anybody could do that. Yeah. They couldn't do that. They, it's not 2000 fifteen's only eight years ago.

3 (3h 12m 11s):
You're telling me that eight years ago someone could re-engineer society and have like a total collapse of law and order in the streets of San Francisco. Right. Dude, I filmed triggered in San Francisco in 2016 and it was great. Yep. It was 2016. Yeah. It was great. San Francisco, we go to nice restaurants, hang around. Yeah. There's a few homeless people back then. There's still people pooping in the street. Yeah. but it was a small number. Right. There was no tents. There's no none of that. Right. So from 2016 to 2023, the whole thing has completely changed.

4 (3h 12m 42s):
And that's one of the weirder parts is it's the same architecture and beautiful hilly streets and all of these San Fran, the, the font on the, you know, street signs, iconic, all the little comic. Exactly. Yeah. And it's all still there except it's fucking just dropped I mean, and they're

3 (3h 13m 2s):
Chaos paying people. Yeah. Paying people to live on the streets. And it's

4 (3h 13m 5s):
A lot of it, a lot of downtown. Like you have to go like over a bridge and then you still see, you see the outsiders scattered around and then boom, it gets less and less. But you have to go. I'm talking out of the city. We didn't stop seeing chaos until at least 15, 20 minutes into our drive out of the city.

3 (3h 13m 29s):
Apparently in Seattle, Bellevue has none of it. Bellevue is the rich area of Seattle. Yeah. That's the beautiful downtown shopping area. Gorgeous area. Apparently. They're like, eh.

4 (3h 13m 39s):
Right.

3 (3h 13m 40s):
Get the fuck outta here. Yeah. No. This is where the rich people live. Get the fuck outta here. Right. but it, San Francisco, they're like, we need, we need to help these houseless people.

4 (3h 13m 49s):
Oh. It's the ultimate conundrum. 'cause it's like,

3 (3h 13m 51s):
What are they doing? Right? What are they doing? Is it, is it engineered? Are they, because they're, look, if it was

4 (3h 14m 0s):
Yeah.

3 (3h 14m 1s):
Way to go. I mean you guys fucking nailed it. Who would've ever thought

4 (3h 14m 5s):
I'll say this, is that one thing I noticed was we went to dinner at a, or basically lunch after we landed at a really, really, really good Chinese restaurant there in Chinatown. I can't remember the name of it, but it's like legendary. Anyway. and I did notice that a ton of the people around us sitting around us were gay couples. Like gay men, gay San Francisco men, the other stereotype of San Francisco, right. Downtown at least. and I thought to myself, I wonder if there's a correlation right? Between having an extremely high gay population and homelessness and looting and stuff running rampant. 'cause I thought about West Hollywood and Beverly Hills, right.

4 (3h 14m 48s):
and I thought to myself, Hey, maybe they're just butt fucking, and then, you know, who gives a shit what's going on out there? And by the time you get down there, you, you're so virtue signaling and progressive, right. That these, there, there has to be a correlation. I'm also so high by this so high.

3 (3h 15m 5s):
I was trying to figure out where you're

4 (3h 15m 6s):
Going with this. I have been fucked since that whatever that fucking thing is.

3 (3h 15m 9s):
Yeah. Good stuff. I think it's a, it's a progressive thing for sure. Elon talked about it. It's this like, there's a mind virus. This is woke mind virus. And to go against that in any way and to oppose these people camping out is to be, to dehumanize them and to, you know, to degrade their choices. And it's just nuts. It's just nuts that they've allowed it to get so far gone to the point where, how do you fix that? And how did they fix that? When Xi Jing Ping came to town, did anybody ever figure that out? And what happened to those people? Where'd they put 'em? Nobody ever explained it. They just moved everybody out, cleaned up the streets, put up fences.

3 (3h 15m 50s):
No more camping. Cleaned it up, put up them China flags. Yeah.

4 (3h 15m 55s):
Or they cleaned up his route.

3 (3h 15m 58s):
But

4 (3h 15m 58s):
It doesn't matter his specific route with fences and everything, it

3 (3h 16m 0s):
Just shows that they could have done it all along.

4 (3h 16m 2s):
Yeah.

3 (3h 16m 3s):
So why wouldn't they, if they could do it all along and they did it for the leader of China.

4 (3h 16m 10s):
Right.

3 (3h 16m 10s):
What, what? Why wouldn't you do it for us? Why wouldn't you, why wouldn't you do it for the people that live there to make it nicer? Yeah. What, what are you doing? And did you let it go back? Like what happened after Xi Jingping left? Did you just like Yeah. Go back to shit in the streets. Yeah. They fucking pressure washed the streets. They did everything.

4 (3h 16m 28s):
Dude, you have to have avoid they cleaned up the poop. 'cause it's not dog poop. So you have to look down at the sidewalk.

3 (3h 16m 33s):
Runny diarrhea. Junkie poop. Yes.

4 (3h 16m 36s):
Blatant human poop.

3 (3h 16m 38s):
Oh

4 (3h 16m 39s):
God. Oftentimes at a lean of a 90 degree leans worth away from walls.

3 (3h 16m 43s):
Jack, Jack in the box and meth.

4 (3h 16m 46s):
Yeah. Yep. Yep. Thick. Girthy, runny soft. Soft. Yet thick and long shit.

3 (3h 16m 55s):
And you probably smell it. And by the way, that's how plagues get

4 (3h 16m 58s):
Started. And you also see other shoe prints in the shit. You know what I mean? You're like, oh, someone's already, 'cause it's like smeared. And then you have to look for that second step. Jesus.

3 (3h 17m 6s):
You come home, your dog's sniffing your shoes. Like why are you sniffing? Oh God. Damnit You didn't realize you stepped in human shit and your dog's like, what the fuck are you bringing in the house? Yeah.

4 (3h 17m 16s):
Oh my God.

3 (3h 17m 17s):
I found out that in Skid row they, they found some medieval diseases. I think they found typhoid in Skid row. See if you see if that's true. Typhus with Typhus. That's right. Which is just nuts, man. That is like a medieval disease. and it came back in the day. Look, if you go back to ancient societies before they had indoor plumbing, people just shot out in the streets. They shot in buckets and they threw it out into the streets. Oh my

4 (3h 17m 47s):
God.

3 (3h 17m 47s):
They, they, they had public outhouses in New York City in like the 18 hundreds. They had public outhouses where people would go out there and just shit. Damn. And they had these tenement buildings where everybody stacked on top of each other. Just 2019 living in each other's shit. Oh my God. 2019. So who knows what. There's now inside the squalor on Skid Row as typhoid scare grips. Los Angeles fucking typhoid. Look at that. Good

4 (3h 18m 12s):
God. What's a, what is that the crazy thing

3 (3h 18m 14s):
About Skid Row Dude? Skid Row was really bad when I was filming Fear Factor. Skid Row was really bad. I had no idea. It was never discussed. It was not a thing that anybody talked about. Right. We were filming downtown in like 2000. It's the early two Fear Factor started in 2001. So it's somewhere after that. And we're downtown. So it's way before the pandemic. Way before anything. and I remember I drove down these streets and one of the streets was like Skid Row. I was like, holy shit. Just row after row of people camping and living in washing machine boxes and refrigerator boxes and just open air drug use and zombies wandering on the street.

3 (3h 18m 58s):
Thousands of people. Like you can't believe it. And that was engineered. Yeah. Skid Row was engineered. Skid Row was a place where cops would take people that were derelicts and all fucked up and you know, they were in the way in Beverly Hills. Just bring 'em to Skid Row. Get outta here. Yeah. And they kept them in there.

4 (3h 19m 16s):
Oh yeah.

3 (3h 19m 17s):
And they put the, the treatment places there and the food shelters there and the homeless shelters there and like stay here. Crazy. And so they all stayed there. They don't have any cars. Where are they gonna

4 (3h 19m 26s):
Go? When I moved to LA right outta high school, my brother told me, you don't need to go downtown unless you absolutely have to go downtown. Yeah. Like that's it. You can go west, you can go all the way to the ocean, but don't

3 (3h 19m 41s):
Go downtown.

4 (3h 19m 42s):
East is not the place to go. You can go north kind of, you can kind go

3 (3h 19m 46s):
South. It's telling a major city where downtown's a

4 (3h 19m 48s):
Disaster. And that's exactly what I thought. But all it took was fucking, it wasn't long after that where I missed the bus stop or something like that. And the whole thing fucking drops you off there. And yeah, that was, it almost

3 (3h 19m 59s):
Came back downtown. Almost came back downtown was starting to get gentrified. Yeah. Or you know, established, whatever you wanna call it, where they was. They were putting in businesses in, in a lot of these abandoned places. and it was starting to become kind of cool again. And you know, a bunch of places opened there. It was like a cool bunch of cool bars and cool restaurants and 10th Planet Jujitsu's in downtown. Ah. And it's like, you know, it started to become a fun, exciting place to be. But then the pandemic and all that progress that they had just fucking collapsed upon itself. And now it's just scary again. Yeah. All of LA's weird. Now all of LA has a weird vibe to it.

3 (3h 20m 40s):
Just a different, it's a different place. and I always say it. It's like, if there was this girl that you used to date a long time ago and she was really cute and then you ran into her today and she's on meth and she works for the cartel. Yeah. You're like, oh my God. What happened to you? Yeah.

4 (3h 20m 54s):
What

3 (3h 20m 55s):
Happened to you?

4 (3h 20m 57s):
My neighbor I talked to for the first time in a long time, my neighbor from LA who we lived in the same building for years and years, told me the other day, he goes, yeah, it's, it's a lot better now. It's, it, our little neighborhood is a lot better now. It's like cleaned up. and I thought to myself, it's three years later, three full years since I've been out of there. And you know what I was also thinking is like the vulnerability. You're right there. It's the same thing. But that happened there. Yeah. So how can you trust it again? Because I, I think I mentioned this on the show before, but I was like in it man. Yeah. We were in it and I told him, 'cause again, I haven't talked to him in years.

4 (3h 21m 39s):
I'm like, man, I'll never forget that fucking night. 'cause him and I walked out and at to the actual cross streets of Fairfax and third right after the big riots. And like there was graffiti everywhere. Really Took me back talking with him about it. 'cause you know, people say it's like the end of the Joker movie and things like that. but it was really like the end of the Joker movie. And it's, remember in the 1 0 1 or an amusement park, you're waiting to see like a line of people or people taking pictures or like, but it was real, remember it was like a universal Studios ride. I'm sorry, I'm

3 (3h 22m 13s):
Going. It's okay. Remember it was either 1 0 1 or the 10 that had those cop cars that were on fire. Like a bunch of them. Remember watching that? Yeah.

4 (3h 22m 22s):
And you go, what fuck. And that's, and that's your, and that's your way out.

3 (3h 22m 26s):
What the

4 (3h 22m 26s):
Fuck? Yeah.

3 (3h 22m 28s):
That's like a movie scene. Yeah. You're like, no way. Look at all these cop cars on fire.

4 (3h 22m 32s):
Yeah. There was a mo when we went out there on that big night, the Trader Joe's that's behind us was on fire. The paper source across from that had its glass broken on people just running around putting fucking birthday cards into bags and just running to cars that had no license plate. One after the other, after the other people running from every direction. Yeah. You were hearing broken glass from different distances. Like, oh God, that's right here. Oh shit. There they are. Yeah. One into this

3 (3h 23m 3s):
Store. I saw one, I saw one in Woodland Hills. They smashed into this clothes store and they were running into this clothes store and we were driving by, we're like, holy shit, look at that. Yep. They had just smashed the window and they were running inside of it.

4 (3h 23m 14s):
And that night they had helicopters over Melrose, if you remember, because a couple places were completely on fire that big night. And they were, and the helicopters were filming all the different looting. And that was another one of my hoods was fucking all of that. And, and the big things on fire and that you're watching them empty and you know the people's faces. You know who owns those businesses? You go, Hey Matt. Hey Tony, how's it going? Good to see you grabbing a coffee, whatever. Like neighborhood friends, everything. Mm. The coffee shop. The fucking Yeah wa watch repairman. The fucking every job, dry cleaner. All these people, all those relationships and you're watching shit get taken out.

4 (3h 23m 57s):
Their windows are broken and people are just taking shit wild. It would never happen here. I know that.

3 (3h 24m 2s):
Well it probably wouldn't happen here. Yeah. 'cause too many people are armed. Yeah. But but also, how crazy is it that it happened there? We would've never believed that. Right. Never believed that in 2015 that that things could change so quickly. But again, if you want to go full Alex Jones, that's the test run. That's the test run. If things can get that bad in that very specific area and it takes three years for them to recover, imagine this scenario that you saw in that movie trailer, civil War movie trailer. Fuck dude.

4 (3h 24m 38s):
It's crazy.

3 (3h 24m 39s):
Maybe we'll pull outta the fire.

4 (3h 24m 41s):
San Diego was nice though.

3 (3h 24m 43s):
Was

4 (3h 24m 43s):
It? Yeah, it was military. Still a lot of homeless downtown, but yes, exactly. Military community. Yep.

3 (3h 24m 49s):
Yeah. That's what it is. Yep. A lot of discipline in that town.

4 (3h 24m 52s):
It seems like if people think that you could maybe might have a gun that people behave themselves a little bit better. A little bit more. Yeah. It's interesting.

3 (3h 24m 59s):
It's funny how that works.

4 (3h 25m 1s):
It's so weird.

3 (3h 25m 3s):
Alright, I gotta pee. Let's wrap this up. Tony, you're the man. Rock and roll. Appreciate you brother. Thank you so much. I'm very, very happy for your success. Watching Kill Tony crush it in arenas has been really inspiring. It's very cool. Thank you. And watching what you guys have been able to do in that show, which is, I say it, I'll say it again. It's the cornerstone of community in Austin. It's the cornerstone of the community in this country. And which means it's the cornerstone of the comedy community in the world. It really is. 'cause it teaches people that it's just about being funny. It's about going for the joke. It's You have one minute. There's no room for anything else. Yeah. and it's all wild. It's a wild show.

4 (3h 25m 38s):

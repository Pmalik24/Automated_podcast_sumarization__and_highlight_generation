5 (1m 44s):
For the pros.

4 (1m 44s):
Now I mean that's a good move. Like that guy that we met, the CEO. Yeah. He's he's got it together. Yeah. He gets it. He gets it. I thought you were

5 (1m 51s):
The ceo E now,

4 (1m 53s):

How does that make fun? Come on, man. I'm, I'm so happy I'm fucking

3 (2m 1s):
Punk. No, it could, it wouldn't have happened without this.

4 (2m 2s):
Listen, I'm so happy. I'm so happy that they, it just made so much sense. You never let them go. You never bailed on them. In the heart of all the craziness, you never kid rocks fucking shooting cases of

3 (2m 13s):
It on his ranch. That turn code. That's your nemesis. That's your nemesis. Now I have to fight Bobby. Next time I go to Nashville. You have this,

5 (2m 19s):
You have a dual, a

4 (2m 20s):
Classic dual. I think it was an important moment in culture where people realize, like, you know, there's consequences for certain things. And some people, they, like a guy like Kid Rock can shoot your brand. You got real problems. Be true. Would with that demographic,

3 (2m 35s):
Who would guess, who would've guessed who

4 (2m 36s):
Would've fucking ever thought that

3 (2m 37s):
Was gonna happen? I mean just seeing Kid Rock do that. People must have been like, oh, fuck.

5 (2m 41s):
You think they watched it in the board room? Like guys, they had talk about this

4 (2m 44s):
I mean that lady who was maybe

3 (2m 46s):
The lady

4 (2m 47s):
Who was in charge. The one lady made that one video. Let's, let's move on. Mm.

3 (2m 52s):
Hell yeah. Yeah. Hell yeah. Wow. I didn't see that coming. I think we was

4 (2m 58s):
Nice. I was beating that fucking horse into a pulpit. Yeah. It's a meaty jelly on the ground now.

3 (3m 3s):
Oh yeah. Yeah. It's been awesome.

4 (3m 5s):
Yeah. It's awesome. I'm so happy. I'm, it's, they're smart man. They did a smart thing and they did a smart thing with the UFC too. It's perfect. Yeah, it's perfect. Yeah.

5 (3m 13s):
Yeah. They were with, and they s drink a beer before every fight.

3 (3m 17s):
Yeah. don don't think they'd be you

4 (3m 18s):
Too much. You they have monster cans in the

5 (3m 22s):
Bud Light.

4 (3m 23s):
That probably won't happen though, but why not? Yeah,

3 (3m 26s):
Why

4 (3m 26s):
Can't you, why

3 (3m 27s):
Can't you have a, all all you have to do is put Bud Light on the bottle. Say it's like they're drinking fucking monster during the fight. That's

5 (3m 31s):
What I was saying. Yeah.

4 (3m 32s):
I was gonna say, it's bad for you to have a Bud Light after a fight. That's crazy. He just got punched in the head 185 times

3 (3m 40s):
After the fight. Yeah. Yeah. I don't think that's a tough sell. I think those guys are cracking beers

4 (3m 44s):
After crack beer. Yeah. Yeah. Like the Sean, Sean Strickland, DRI Dcy fight. Those guys drink it beer after beer. Yeah. They deserve a lot of beer after that. Fight us

5 (3m 51s):
As ice packs too. Like a cold. Yeah.

4 (3m 53s):
It's like cold

5 (3m 54s):
Beer.

3 (3m 56s):
It feels good. Done that,

4 (3m 60s):
You know what I've never had used on me is that end swell. They take that piece of heart

3 (4m 4s):
Steel's hurt, like,

4 (4m 5s):
Fuck, dude. And they push all the swelling away from your eye so you could see better.

5 (4m 10s):
Oh man. Where does it go? It just, they just push off

4 (4m 12s):
The, the side of your head. Oh, yeah. Jesus. It's just to clear your vision so you can go out there and get punched again.

3 (4m 17s):
Yeah. You ever see that, that press that just,

5 (4m 19s):
No, I, I didn't know what that

3 (4m 20s):
Was. That was like Tyson Buster Douglass. They didn't even, they

4 (4m 23s):
Didn't even, they didn't

3 (4m 23s):
Have one. They didn't bring it. Yeah. They thought Tyson was gonna fuck up Buster Douglass that bad. They were like, well, he

4 (4m 27s):
Had a bad corner. See, Tyson Tyson's downfall is largely related to many things. Everybody falls, they just get too big. They just, it's too unmanageable. But also Cost DAMA died and then he left Kevin Rooney. And so now, now he's with these guys that were just like around. Yeah. And they're his trainers and it's like, he's Tyson so he could beat everybody. Anybody. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, but then he gets to this one dude in Buster Douglas who's really prepared. His mom just died. And he was always like that super talented guy, like, look how bad his guy was. Jesus. Look how bad his eye was. And they didn't have an end glove.

3 (5m 3s):
They had a glove. They used a glove. They filled a rubber glove with ice. Yeah. So,

4 (5m 6s):
Stupid

3 (5m 7s):
Shit.

4 (5m 8s):
I mean, you need to push on that and push it to the side. And Tyson's still almost won. He's still almost won. He still

3 (5m 14s):
Dropped. Yeah. There was a questionable 10 count on

4 (5m 15s):
That. It was a questionable 10 count. That was questionable. It was definitely. But there's a few of those out there in sport. The, the, the sport should operate on a time, like a digital timer should go off the moment someone touches the ground. That's how it should go. Because if you're a guy and you, you know, you're, maybe you like this guy more. Yeah. You know, like the fighters and the referees, they know each other. Like, I'm, you know, I'm around these guys all the time and MMA and it's just, you get to be friends with them. I'm friends with these guys.

5 (5m 41s):
Damn. So there's no official clock. It's just the, in their head. I didn. That's great. I say, well,

3 (5m 45s):
MMA starts to count. Yeah.

4 (5m 46s):
It's crazy. Obviously this will count. Yeah. But in boxing, I'm sure it's kind of a similar situation when they all know each other. Like, Hey, what's up? What's going on? How you doing? Yeah, dude,

5 (5m 54s):
I, I used to ref kids' basketball when I was in high school, and as soon as a kid talks shit to me, I'm like, in my head, I was like, your team's losing. I'm gonna do everything in my power. Like, like as soon as they're like, are you serious? If a parent, if a parents spoke up, I'm like, you just, you just lost this game for yourself.

3 (6m 7s):
Congratulations. Yeah.

5 (6m 8s):
Like, way to go dickhead. And now just the whole time,

3 (6m 10s):
You're just high as fuck coaching kids

5 (6m 12s):
Basketball, like 15 bucks a game. Some parents

4 (6m 15s):
Are in insufferable.

5 (6m 16s):
Dude, it's insane.

4 (6m 17s):
They're so insufferable. You see it in combat sports too. You see it like, some parents are just so crazy. Yeah. Jesus. And they think they, they almost want to hit the other kid that that fought their kid. Like, Hey, this is the deal. That makes

3 (6m 29s):
Sense

4 (6m 29s):
Though. Yeah. It doesn't make sense. No, no.

3 (6m 31s):
I'm saying like it does though, because you see your kid getting hit. It's not like a sport, like a football or something. Yeah. There's like an instinct to be like, I gotta go beat that kid's ass. Oh, for

4 (6m 40s):
Sure. But you, you know, everybody knows what's going on here. This is like, it's very important. You don't violate that, especially with kids and adults. And it's like when you're, you're allowing another child to possibly knock your kid unconscious. Yeah. And then that's, that's the agreement you're making. Jesus. And you're trying to have your kid as trying to knock that kid unconscious. Yeah.

5 (7m 2s):
Yeah. It is what it

4 (7m 3s):
Is. It's intense, man. When I used to coach kids, I used to take, take kids to fights, like young teenagers take 'em to fights, you know, and, and sometimes their parents would just be fucking freaking out and, you know, it's like, I'm so used to seeing people get kicked in the face. To me it's like, normal don don't have any kids. I'm 21. Yeah. And I'm like, okay, how do I talk to these parents and get 'em to relax and understand, like, this is the agreement that's been made here. Yeah. You can't freakout.

5 (7m 30s):
Yeah. You're gonna freak your kid out. Yeah.

4 (7m 32s):
You're gonna freak your kid out and you're putting too much pressure on your kid. Like Helio Gracie used to give his children toys and presents if they lost.

5 (7m 41s):
That's kind of cool. Yeah.

4 (7m 42s):
He wanted the them to, he just wanted them to get better. And he's like, the, the, the fear of competition, the fear of losing is so overwhelming. He would do everything he could to mitigate it. And so instead of him getting fucking angry and hyped up, he would hug them and give them toys and give them things if they lost. Hmm.

5 (8m 1s):
That's really nice. Yeah. That's kind of a good way to go about it, because even like basketball and football, like I've seen parents like spa dude. Yeah.

4 (8m 8s):
'cause if you think about it, like the kid's gonna try to win anyway. He's not gonna try to get his ass kicked for a GI Joe. You know? He's gonna try to win anyway. If he win, starts throwing the match wins, he gets the win. And if he loses, he gets a fucking toy. Yeah.

5 (8m 20s):
Yeah. Exactly.

3 (8m 21s):
I had a bet once my dad, if I scored three baskets in a game, I would be able to rent Mortal Kombat. Whoa. My whole team was trying to get, my friends were trying to get me the ball that sucked.

5 (8m 33s):
Six

3 (8m 33s):
Points. Yeah. Needed six points, dropping

5 (8m 35s):
Six in a summer league game's. Not easy.

3 (8m 37s):
No, it was young. We were young. Dude, it was tough. It

4 (8m 39s):
Was so hard. There was a wrestling match that was recently. This video went viral because this kid, the, these two guys are wrestling and it looks like this kid doesn't have an arm in it. Looks like he's just on the neck, which is illegal in wrestling. You're supposed to have an arm in. Yeah. And the, the dad jumps in and I think he hits the kid. Oh, no. Yeah. It's the, the dad I believe got banned for life

3 (9m 2s):
That Yeah. Yeah. That should

4 (9m 3s):
Do it. It's pretty crazy. Oh,

5 (9m 5s):
He actually jumped in and beat the dudes ass.

3 (9m 6s):
Yeah. He thought it was WWE rules. Like t it could interfere. It came outta the steel chair. Yeah.

4 (9m 11s):
I don't know what the rules are to wrestling, so I can't tell you whether or not this, I, I really know very little about wrestling, so I don't know whether or not the kid was doing something that was highly illegal and Juujitsu looks normal. Yeah. It's like, oh yeah, he got his neck. But I guess in wrestling you can't just grab the neck. Yeah. You have to have an arm in. I, I shouldn't even be talking about this. I really should. I honestly should know. No, you're right. It's the things that I should know, you know, what the, what the limitations of their sport are. But I just, I'm always like, it's so silly.

5 (9m 40s):
I guess you can choke in wrestling. Like I think you could maybe like a classic headlock don don't know. Yeah. You

3 (9m 43s):
Could hit the fucking can You don.

4 (9m 45s):
But don't you have to have an arm man though, Don? You have to have an arm I don. No

3 (9m 47s):
Clue. don don't know any rules about wrestling at

4 (9m 49s):
All. I don. I don't. I don't. I was also saying

5 (9m 50s):
It's to drop I don. I was saying it's hard to drop six in the summer league game. Oh yeah. I wasn't. Yeah. Yeah. I wasn't poo in your effort. I'm like,

3 (9m 55s):
No, Matt, I'm talking about if I

5 (9m 57s):
Drop six in the summer league game, I was like, yeah.

3 (9m 59s):
Fell down 10 times.

4 (10m 2s):
There's a choke where you put someone completely unconscious with one arm, with the, just the like, like a headlock. It's called like a, a bulldog choke or a school yard choke. Yeah. Yeah. They call it a school yard choke. That's how Carlos Newton beat Pat milit for the welterweight title. Like way, way back in the day. It's a crazy picture. 'cause Carlos Newton is fucking

3 (10m 22s):
Shredded.

4 (10m 22s):
Yeah. And he's just got a whole Is that the one

3 (10m 24s):
You have here? Oh,

4 (10m 25s):
No, no, no. That's, that's ax Alexander cor. That's

3 (10m 27s):
The scary one. That's

4 (10m 28s):
The scariest guy that's ever

3 (10m 29s):
Lived. That's the scariest thing I've ever

4 (10m 30s):
Seen. Yeah. He's the scariest guy that ever lived. That guy used to just throw people around. But that, that, so there's no way that's legal. 'cause you could put someone unconscious with that.

5 (10m 38s):
Yeah. I don't think you're allowed. Yeah, probably not.

4 (10m 40s):
Jamie, what are the rules for wrestling? Are you allowed to grabs someone by their neck? Can you even show me the video with a kid where the dad jumps in? It's kind of, I'm not sure if I found the right one. This one I found was 20. Yeah, that's that. But the one you just showed, showed that picture again, that's Carlos Newton when he caught Pat. Malus.

3 (10m 55s):
Jeez. That's the fucking big brother. Dude.

4 (10m 58s):
Look at that arm son. You don like that. You'd let it sit out the window. All day long. Oh, hey ladies, look at that arm. Good

3 (11m 4s):
Lord,

4 (11m 5s):
Bro. So shredded. Fuck. Yeah. Carl Newton was a sensational submission guy too. He also fought Matt Hughes and choked Matt Hughes unconscious. But Matt Hughes slammed him to the ground and knocked him unconscious. And Matt Hughes woke up first and Matt Hughes was like, I won. What? Like, he didn't even know he won. Oh, no. Because what happened was Carlos got him in a standing triangle and Carlos is putting him out while he's standing up. And then Matt in like a last ditch effort, slams him to the ground as he's going out. Wow. the end of a movie. Carlos goes out and he goes out, and then Matt wakes up and I remember being there. Matt, Matt was like, when?

5 (11m 40s):
And he won from waking up first.

4 (11m 42s):
He was the fucking man, dude, back in the day, he was the man. Matt Hugs was like the first like truly elite wrestler that learned like black belt level submission skills. So they're both out. Fuck, they're both out. And so like, Matt's like, what? He doesn't know what's going on.

5 (11m 59s):
He sat up. So he is good dude.

3 (12m 1s):
Slammed, wearing fucking tidy whitey socks. Dude,

5 (12m 4s):
That sucks. So bad.

4 (12m 6s):
Bad. It

3 (12m 6s):
Was a great fight.

4 (12m 8s):
Matthews was the fucking man. Tidy

3 (12m 10s):
White is a wild move, dude. Yeah.

5 (12m 12s):
Yeah. That is pretty nuts, dude.

4 (12m 14s):
It is a wild move. But everybody wore 'em back then. The, the Brazilian Valley Tuto guys, they all wore Speedos. Yeah, because they fought like they fought on the beach. Come on, boy. Yeah. Pretty boys.

3 (12m 23s):
Yeah. You got in a fight with some Brazilians on the beach. I got

5 (12m 26s):
Robbed in Brazil on the beach.

4 (12m 26s):
Oh no.

5 (12m 27s):
They told me that

3 (12m 28s):
Were in their undies.

5 (12m 29s):
No, they were just in some trunks, respectable trunks. Dang. But yeah, they told me not to walk home on the beach by myself. And you just did late at night or early in the morning? I was like late at night. I could see. But I was like early in the morning. It's sunrise and I got robbed. Gone. All right. At knife point.

4 (12m 41s):
Yeah. Damn. Son. That must've been terrifying getting

3 (12m 44s):
Your ass beat by a guy in a Speedo. Yeah,

5 (12m 45s):
It would suck. What did you,

4 (12m 47s):
What'd you have to give up, would you?

5 (12m 48s):
It's like seven bucks. It was like seven. I had a, I had like a, my wallet and then my, or I had my credit card and then I remembered I had money like in my shoe or something. They were pissed. I'm like, oh, hey, I have this too. They were like kind of nice about it. Oh, that's cool. They were like, sorry, we're really hungry. And I was like, Hey, thanks for not stabbing me guys and I. But I was, I was like out, you get outta your body when you were getting robbed. You're completely outta your body and you're just like,

4 (13m 10s):
That is a, a kind of a cool way to rob someone. It's Sorry, we're really hungry. Yeah.

5 (13m 14s):
They were, they, we had a, I had a phrase book on me and my credit card. They took up, they took up my credit card. I'm like, yo, you guys can take this to the Mac machine, just get a bunch of money out. And they were like, they didn't know what that was. And then they took like seven bucks off me. They went through my phrase book and they were laughing at stuff that I had circled. Just like, it was like, I was like, I want you.

3 (13m 31s):
Oh, they knew.

5 (13m 33s):
They're like, ah. And I was like, yeah. Yeah. And then, yeah, it was like the most, it was pretty like, cordial, the whole experience.

4 (13m 39s):
Wow.

3 (13m 39s):
Damn. Yeah. They made fun of

5 (13m 41s):
That made fun of my phrase book. They were like, ba, they're flipping through it.

4 (13m 45s):
When you land in Rio, you drive through the Ellos. Dude, it's so scary. And it's, it's like, oh my God. Like the, the level of po you ever see City of God? Yes, bro. It makes boys in the hood look like Sesame Street.

3 (13m 56s):
Yeah, it does. Dudes.

4 (13m 57s):
Dude, that movie is crazy.

3 (13m 59s):
Yeah. Just living in Sheds, dude on the

5 (14m 1s):
Hill. It's that game. What was that game you were playing? The fallout where you like, you're like grabbing pieces of metal. Yeah. It's all that metal. That's your house. It's, it's crazy.

4 (14m 8s):
Yeah. I know a lot of people that came from there.

5 (14m 11s):
That's nuts.

4 (14m 12s):
Fighters. Yeah. A lot of UFC fighters came from the favelas. Dude. It's terrifying. Yeah. It's a different level of poverty, man. and it's a different level of scarcity. Yeah. Dude. With no opportunity, nothing. Violence, guns.

5 (14m 24s):
Yeah. They come, the kids are like, when you, when I was walking around there, I was like 21, but they'll like, they'll come grab your leg and like hold onto your leg and like, just like, dude, here's

3 (14m 32s):
Yeah. That rules, that's

4 (14m 33s):
That city of God. Such a good movie. Movie. So crazy. And apparently really accurate. It really is. Like what? It's like, damn, that was Roger Ebert days.

5 (14m 44s):
Yeah. Yeah. When I was there, this like, Swedish guy went to the favela with another guy to buy coke and I was like, like, you wanna come I? I was like, no, thank you.

4 (14m 53s):
Fuck

5 (14m 54s):
All of that. He got back, he was like, he looked kind of like Brazilian a little bit, luckily. But I was like, bro, I'm not going with you to go there.

4 (14m 59s):
Yeah. There's levels. Yeah. There's levels in this world.

5 (15m 3s):
Yeah. That's a, that's scary. Being that poor is scary. but it was nice. I was there. It's like monopoly money. It's like, if it's not your currency, I was out there just throwing that stuff out.

3 (15m 11s):
You love our currency. I do. We were in Australia, dude. We were in Australia. Matt was like, this is USD. I tried

5 (15m 17s):
To pay him $20 and I tried to pay with us money. And they were like, we don't take that. and I'm like, come on man. It's like, come

3 (15m 22s):
On man, this is 10 times your money. s like, dude, this is American.

5 (15m 25s):
I was treated. I was like Honduras. I was like, yo, here's a 20 bucks. And they're like, well we can't take this. I'm like, yeah, they'll give you that. That's, that's good money.

4 (15m 33s):
Some money I, they have like clear little holes in them and there's like little holograms in it. It's

3 (15m 38s):
All bullshit, dude. It's fake. American money is the only thing that matters.

4 (15m 41s):
Isn't it wild though that no one's figured out how to completely, accurately recreate money? It's just pieces of p Like they had to really stay ahead of the curve. Yeah. For the counterfeiters. This technology counter. Yeah.

5 (15m 52s):
Increased. It's true. I didn't even think all the

4 (15m 53s):
Printers,

3 (15m 54s):
That was a major problem when this country was like starting. Yeah. We had, it was an easy thing to do. Death

5 (15m 58s):
Was punishable by death, wasn't it? Yeah.

3 (16m 0s):
Yeah. They used to fuck you up for that.

4 (16m 2s):
I remember the first time I ever saw fake $20 Bill I was like, oh wow. This is weird.

5 (16m 7s):
Yeah,

4 (16m 8s):
It's weird. It's like, feels wrong. Yeah.

5 (16m 10s):
Don don't think you can buy the paper, that's the thing. No. Wow. I think this is a specific money is a specific paper, but people bleach bills and then you can print, you can get the real paper bleach the bill and print like tens on like a one. And then you can do that and sell, you can sell bundles of them to people.

4 (16m 25s):
Oh, no kidding. Yeah. That's what they do.

5 (16m 27s):
That's what I've heard. Yeah.

4 (16m 29s):
Are you involved in this? No,

5 (16m 30s):
I just, I just, that's

3 (16m 31s):
What I've heard, man. How long

4 (16m 32s):
Have you been

5 (16m 32s):
Doing

4 (16m 32s):
This? How long have you been countering? No, I

5 (16m 33s):
Just, I've heard there's bad, like bad money goes around. People sell it in like big chunks and you can get it in. Like, it just

4 (16m 40s):
Seems like if they can make fake Rolexes, how the fuck can they not make fake true. Like, 'cause you know they have the light, they shine on the dollar bills now because it's like things embedded in them and stuff.

5 (16m 50s):
Yeah. I don't know. Well, I think the people who are counterfeiting though aren't just kind of like don don't know. You'd have to be so advanced technologically to like do that. And if you're able to make money, you could probably do all kinds of other stuff. Yeah.

4 (17m 1s):
But that's the case with a lot of things that are illegal. It's like there's some industrious people that just go the wrong way in life. True. But they're really fucking smart.

5 (17m 9s):
That's true.

3 (17m 10s):
I think I had some fake mushrooms recently. Oh,

5 (17m 12s):
There you go. Oh yeah. A

4 (17m 14s):
Vicious man sued Mr. Clean magic erasers while he used Mat rather Mr. Clean magic erasers to transform $1 bills into hundreds magic erasers. So he erased it and then reprinted over it. Yeah. You're supposed to clean your wall with Mm.

5 (17m 29s):
And that way you can get, you have the good paper. But then if, I guess that's why they have the strips, because then you can hold up a strip and be like, that's not a $10 bill. This is a $1. That's a lot

4 (17m 37s):
Of work, man. Yeah, but dude, I don, how much money you made. You go to jail forever, son.

5 (17m 42s):
It's a secret service. Protect the Secret service looks into this stuff.

4 (17m 46s):
Speaking of which, what did they arrest Killer Mike for? Oh yeah. That is one of the most ridiculous, they don't arrest anybody in la. You got people literally doing meth in front of people's houses in tents. Yeah. What did he do? And Killer Mike gets arrested after he wins three Grammys. Yeah.

5 (17m 60s):
What did he do?

4 (18m 2s):
Of course. The online conspiracy theories that he criticized. Joe Bidet. That's,

5 (18m 6s):
That's

4 (18m 6s):
The online cons. Conspiracy. Conspiracy Of course. I like like

5 (18m 9s):
That. I like that.

4 (18m 9s):
That's a great conspiracy. That

5 (18m 10s):
Is. I

3 (18m 11s):
Mean. It's a fun conspiracy. It's they having fun. Why?

4 (18m 14s):
Who the fuck would arrest Killer Mike? Like, what is this misdemeanor? What did he do? Did he have a a license plate missing or something? Like, what the fuck did he do that they're,

3 (18m 22s):
They didn't release Killer Mike do it. They

5 (18m 23s):
Didn't release a charge.

4 (18m 24s):
We're gonna fight out. Yeah. Killer Mike. I guarantee you didn't really killer Mike. Yeah. You think he did something I

3 (18m 29s):
Know. It's just funny. I know. He's such a good guy. Killer Mike.

4 (18m 33s):
As brilliant as he is. That is the name of like a crazy thug. Yeah,

3 (18m 37s):
True. Yeah.

4 (18m 37s):
That's not the name of a guy who's like a philosopher. Yeah.

5 (18m 40s):
Killer Mike. Yeah. Killer

4 (18m 41s):
Mike is like a killer.

3 (18m 42s):
Mike's not even a creative name. It's like a name that's like the dumb guy in the neighborhood. They're like, oh, that's Killer Mike. Killer Mike. Yeah. They're fuck away from that guy. Killer. Killer.

6 (18m 50s):
This is from, this is an hour ago. He said nothing happened, but this is the official report. It says a physical altercation happened.

4 (18m 58s):
Oh. And he

6 (18m 59s):
Was been released Misdemeanor battery and then released in Zero Bail.

4 (19m 3s):
Oh, he bitch slapped somebody.

5 (19m 5s):
That kind of rules. That's awesome.

4 (19m 7s):
But again, in Los Angeles there's people that are like literally pulling knives on sheriffs and being outta jail. Like that

3 (19m 14s):
Day. Yeah. Yeah. He did. One of the guys that attacked Will Smith did at the trail Wards at the ward.

4 (19m 18s):
Right in front of the whole world. And he gets arrested.

5 (19m 22s):
Yeah. That's Bazar. So

4 (19m 24s):
You think it's like Post Will Smith? They've changed the rules.

5 (19m 26s):
Maybe. Maybe. Yeah. Whenever

4 (19m 27s):
Celebrities smack each other, you have to step in right away.

5 (19m 30s):
Yes. Might be a new task force for that. Well,

4 (19m 32s):
It depends on who he smacked. You know?

5 (19m 34s):
True. That's the question. Yeah.

4 (19m 35s):
Right. If it's somebody we want him to smack. Yeah. You know, now I'm, now I'm really irritated. Yeah. You know, if you smack Taylor Swift, that would be a real issue. That would be,

3 (19m 43s):
Yeah. You don't put your hands on our queen.

5 (19m 45s):
Not after last night. She had, she didn't. She do? Well, last night I saw the news. She did a lot in the Grammys.

3 (19m 50s):
Things are going well for Taylor Swift. I find

5 (19m 52s):
It is doing

4 (19m 52s):
All right. I find it so fascinating. How many people are, for whatever reason, are opposed to it. They don't like that. She's so popular. I don't

5 (20m 1s):
Understand it.

4 (20m 2s):
It's really, it's normal. It's normal human behavior. She's

5 (20m 4s):
Ruining the game of football now.

3 (20m 6s):
I can't watch it. I can't even watch it. That's a new thing.

5 (20m 8s):
She's ruined. She has ruined the

3 (20m 10s):
Game of football. I can't even watch it anymore. Listen, because it cuts to her once or twice and it every time during the game and I see her and I go, motherfucker,

4 (20m 18s):
Why do you care?

3 (20m 19s):
No, I don't at all. That's crazy. Although, I will say this, when they're playing against you, when it's your team, I see. And then the camera cuss to Taylor Swift. That's when it builds. I So you go that What

4 (20m 30s):
If Taylor Swift. That

5 (20m 31s):
Makes sense though, because if you're like, if, if a billionaire is laughing in your face while your

3 (20m 35s):
Team and their team's incredible. The chiefs are incredible. And then it cuts to her up there in a box. They were in like Buffalo. Okay. Everyone's outside freezing. It cuts to them like, woo. Oh,

4 (20m 45s):
They're in a perfect heated box.

3 (20m 47s):
I get it. I understand. Bring

5 (20m 48s):
Up deeper issues.

4 (20m 49s):
I

3 (20m 49s):
Feel like outta

4 (20m 50s):
Respect, if you're gonna see a Buffalo game in January, you should be outside.

3 (20m 54s):
You gotta get out there outta respect. You gotta be in the snow outta

4 (20m 56s):
Respect for the players. Yeah. You like, you'll feel it more. Yeah. Yeah. Just bundle up bitch. Where's some muffins? Fucking mittens and shit.

3 (21m 4s):
People, they were giving, they were giving fans like $20 an hour to go shovel the stadium. Yeah, I saw that before the It's incredible. Oh yeah. Yeah. That was a crazy move. That

4 (21m 12s):
Was crazy.

3 (21m 13s):
I can't believe they did that. I can't believe no one died.

4 (21m 15s):
They could have easily died. Yeah, dude.

3 (21m 16s):
Oh yeah. Just drinking and shoveling for 20 bucks an hour.

4 (21m 19s):
Oh yeah. my friend Tommy just blacked out behind the wheel of his car. He was shoveling. Yeah. He crashed his car and fucked himself up.

5 (21m 26s):
Sorry. Sorry. Snow. Snow shovel

4 (21m 27s):
Laughed, left immediately. I'm sorry.

5 (21m 29s):
Snow Shovelers and P or pal truck drivers get so fucked up. When we were in high school, we used to get hired by landscapers in the winter to shovel and they would just feed us beer and weed when we were like,

4 (21m 39s):
That's all you can do.

5 (21m 40s):
Get people fucked up. And you'd stay up all night and shovel kind. And they give you like 20 bucks an hour and you're just like, what the

4 (21m 45s):
Fuck. Yeah. When I lived in Boston, we would always, whenever it snowed me and my friends would go out to places and go, you guys want us to do your thing? We make negotiate a deal. Do the with driveway this driveway's. Th this driveway's 40. Yeah. Depending on how big it is. And some of 'em you get fucked. Like some of 'em you don't realize. It snow's wet and it's a long ass driveway. You're an hour and a half in. You're only a quarter way there. You're like, oh, we fucked up dude.

3 (22m 7s):
My friend owned a you under

4 (22m 8s):
To Price this one.

3 (22m 10s):
My friend owned a landscaping company and I didn't have a job. I was just, I was living with my girlfriend at the time. She was a teacher. I was literally playing Xbox. Like, she was like, you gotta turn it around. I was like, I'm gonna do comedy. She's like, you're doing open mics at the Harrisburg Comedy zone. And I was like, how old are you? Trust me. How old are you? He's probably 24. Oh my God. And then my friend owned a landscaping company. I had $0. I was not working at all. And he was like, come help us shovel. I was like, all right, nice. I got out, I was there for 10 minutes. I put the shovel down. I was like, bro, I'm going

4 (22m 39s):
Back home. It's

3 (22m 40s):
Grueling. Yeah. I quit immediately.

5 (22m 42s):
You're out all night too. Yeah.

4 (22m 44s):
Real world.

5 (22m 44s):
But you put your beers in the snow.

4 (22m 46s):
Oh

5 (22m 47s):
It's kind of nice. That

3 (22m 48s):
Is nice. Oh

4 (22m 49s):
Boy. Just blasted. Yeah. Lifting chunks of snow everywhere. I

3 (22m 52s):
Think I was like four beers in and I was like, I'll just go drink more inside. True.

4 (22m 56s):
I kind

3 (22m 56s):
Of feel bad for, why the fuck am I out here?

4 (22m 58s):
That's true. I kind of feel bad for kids who grew up without snow. Yeah. Yeah. This, that's a fucking pivotal moment in youth bro.

3 (23m 5s):
A snow day, snow

4 (23m 6s):
Days. Oh my God. And then just, just hanging out with your friends in the snow and then the quiet. Yeah. Everything's quiet when it snows out. It's like you're in a movie. It's like, yeah, it's, you're outside. It's like,

5 (23m 18s):
Sorry, my

3 (23m 18s):
Eye keeps warm. It's the best.

4 (23m 19s):
Nothing. No sound at all.

3 (23m 21s):
That's how, alright, sorry. And

4 (23m 23s):
You guys know you got nothing to do. It's

3 (23m 24s):
About watching news fell lam fell yesterday. Oh. Oh yeah, that's, I I was like, but you couldn't hear him fall. He fell behind us. We were walking into the creek in the cave and he slipped and I. I was like, damn, he fell like snow. Like it was dead silent. We didn't hear him fall. He didn't make a noise. Oh. We got the security footage. I said it to Jamie.

4 (23m 42s):
You got the security footage dude.

3 (23m 44s):
I immediately got the security footage. Look at him. Oh my God.

5 (23m 46s):
Oh,

3 (23m 51s):
You gotta get the other angle.

4 (23m 52s):
That was fairly graceful.

5 (23m 54s):
Yeah. I mean he laid

4 (23m 55s):
There. It seems like there's steps there. The fall steps.

3 (23m 57s):
He, he jumped over the curb and he stepped on the bottom of that ball.

4 (24m 0s):
Oh boy. Boy. It doesn't take a lot to trip him.

5 (24m 4s):
No,

4 (24m 5s):
Look at that bro. He just goes down. He

5 (24m 7s):
Does go down like you're sending the snow off of

3 (24m 8s):
A roof. He couldn't hear a single thing

4 (24m 10s):
Bro. He would suck at judo.

3 (24m 12s):
Don't tell him that bro. They

4 (24m 13s):
Just be tripping him. All day long.

3 (24m 15s):
He's, he prides himself on being nimble. So this is like a real No

4 (24m 18s):
No, he doesn't, he

3 (24m 19s):
Was very sad about this. This Come

4 (24m 21s):
On.

3 (24m 21s):
Really? Yeah.

5 (24m 22s):
I mean that was, everything was nimble before he fell though. He did like a little hop like anime jump. Oh

4 (24m 27s):
My God. You have two angles.

5 (24m 29s):
Jamie.

4 (24m 30s):
Do you have that wrestling match where that dad attacks the kid? That's again, I don't know if I have the right one.

5 (24m 34s):
Oh dude,

4 (24m 36s):
This.

3 (24m 37s):
Anyway, snow days rule wasn't

4 (24m 38s):
Brand new. Yeah, they're nice. Is this the right one that you I don? Don't believe so. Lemme see this one. This is, I, I think it probably had, but no damn. Oh Jesus Christ. Oh my God. See that's what I'm talking about. Look at this fucking guy. He, I dumped him. Oh,

3 (24m 50s):
Lemme see that mugshot. Damn fucking

4 (24m 51s):
Oh, oh. He threw the kid down on his head.

5 (24m 55s):
Oh shit.

4 (24m 57s):
Wow.

3 (24m 58s):
Show the mugshot again. That was a good one.

4 (25m 2s):
Yeah,

3 (25m 3s):
He was. That's not, I wouldn't have expected that guy to move like that.

4 (25m 5s):
Yeah, he moved. Yeah.

5 (25m 6s):
That guy's nimble. He's

4 (25m 7s):
Got a kid.

5 (25m 8s):
True. How much of that do you think changes is protection of the kid versus like a

4 (25m 12s):
Hundred percent

5 (25m 12s):
You're, you think it's all protection?

4 (25m 13s):
Yeah. He got dumped on his head. See, watch the watch how the kid goes down. Oh god. Yeah. The kid goes down, down head

5 (25m 19s):
First's like a tombstone.

4 (25m 20s):
Well see how the ref touches his head. 'cause he's freaked out. That's a bad landing. Like you could break your neck like that. Yeah. You get definitely can get a concussion. You might have had a concussion. God

5 (25m 29s):
Damn that. That's

4 (25m 30s):
Fucked up. That's how Corbell used to beat guys. Carlan used to literally hoist guys up and pound them into the ground. Oh yeah. Just pound them over and over and over again. Jesus

5 (25m 42s):
Christ.

4 (25m 43s):
That says it's an illegal move. That's just a comment. I don know that that's a up illegal move. It's, I think it is an illegal move, but also like when you're lifting people up and throwing them and they're resisting wild shit happens. Yeah. But you know, it does seem like he pile dropped him on his head. He seemed like he just should have known in the middle of that move. Not to, you're not gonna, you were talking about a choke or something where Yeah, the kid was apparently doing an illegal choke and the dad jumped in.

5 (26m 8s):
It's also in that kid's defense. If you have someone up in the air in a wrestling match, it's hard not to slam em in the ground. Yeah. It's

3 (26m 12s):
Hard as anytime you pick anybody up, it's like, oh, I'm gonna slam you on the ground as hard as I can.

4 (26m 16s):
Well I'm sure there's different rules in like young amateur wrestling versus what they would do in the Olympics. But Carlin used to just pile drive people. He just hoist them up and he was a, it was a freak

3 (26m 26s):
Dude. There's nothing worse than like, the only experience I was like football. So it's like first play of the game. Like the guy against you just fucks you up and you're like, damn, this is gonna be, yeah, it's a long game dude. I'm gonna get fucked up for two hours. Yeah. Like wrestling. If a dude slammed you right away, you'd be like, all

4 (26m 44s):
Right. They slammed. You

3 (26m 45s):
Didn't fucking call this thing.

4 (26m 46s):
And MMA, they start punching you in the face while you're recovering from being slammed. You know, I was looking

3 (26m 52s):
For it. There's a dart joke pulled off in a wrestling match.

4 (26m 55s):
Yes. I think that is legit because it's one arm in. I think that's the rule. Oh. Oh. We put him out. Damn. Oh shit. Damn.

3 (27m 4s):
And he hit him with the fucking,

4 (27m 6s):
Matt Hughes choked out Ricardo al Maa with a wrestling move where he had a head and arm like from the front and he just, he has such a squeeze and just that he gripped the head and arm and just put him out and

3 (27m 18s):
Kind of squeeze.

5 (27m 18s):
You're just, and you're just cutting off their carotid artery.

4 (27m 21s):
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're cutting it all off. Oh God.

5 (27m 23s):
With math.

4 (27m 25s):
That fucking tank. When he was the welterweight champ dude, he was a tank.

5 (27m 29s):
Yeah. That shit sucks man.

4 (27m 31s):
And for him to grab your arm and your head together like this, which is basically what he had, he had 'em like on the side with his arm and head together and just squeezed it so hard. He went out. I

3 (27m 39s):
Was just watching Who's the, who's like the Mongolian guy or Uzbekistani or Kazakhstan. Fuck he, he, he got a standing fucking,

4 (27m 48s):
He hit a guy. Oh yeah. Rock one off. Yeah. Kott. Yeah. He's a beast. I think that's what you're talking

3 (27m 53s):
About. He had a little brother had lot. Yeah. See,

4 (27m 54s):
See the dad jumps in. Yeah. So the kids on his back and he rolls him over and it looks like the kid's got a choke. But I can't tell if he's got an arm in. Oh damn shit. He does have an arm in. He does have an arm in. He did have an

5 (28m 8s):
Arm in. He's like my bad. My bad. That's my bad, my bad. I got,

4 (28m 11s):
Yeah, he's banned for life. That is, that is it. So he banned for life. Now don don't know what the rules are, but it does look like the kid has an arm in. He has an arm in, he has a rollover. See how his arm is under the arm?

5 (28m 25s):
That is

3 (28m 25s):
That fucking walrus ref dude. Yeah.

4 (28m 27s):
Man. Poor guy.

3 (28m 29s):
No, he looks his, he looks like, yeah, he diabetic's

4 (28m 33s):
Like Dr. Ram. That's, that is a weird, that's a weird situation. But you know, dads fucking lose their cool.

5 (28m 40s):
Yeah. Well there's also like, when you're watching your kid wrestling's in combat's different, but like if they're watching your, if you're watching your kid suck at like basketball or football Yeah. Then you're like taking that personally. 'cause that kid's supposed to like carry you on. Yeah.

3 (28m 51s):
This is your legacy.

5 (28m 52s):
It's your legacy.

3 (28m 53s):
It's also like that at the fucking dog park. Oh my God. If your dogs are playing a dog loses people jump in. Yeah, my sister jumped in.

4 (29m 0s):
Yeah.

3 (29m 1s):
Her dog was losing. And she like into,

5 (29m 3s):
I've punched

3 (29m 4s):
I dogs into

5 (29m 4s):
The mud. I've punched dogs to dog parks. I've had dog like a dog grab my dog by the neck. and I just,

4 (29m 9s):
Some people bring aggressive dogs to dog parks. It's just not wise.

5 (29m 13s):
I've, I didn't know. I didn't know what they were. Did you know you

4 (29m 15s):
My dog was a puppy.

5 (29m 16s):
I didn't

4 (29m 17s):
Know when my dog was a puppy. I used to bring him to dog parks. He started fighting with dogs. He liked it too much. I'm like no more. Yeah. I'm like,

5 (29m 23s):
I brought Nikita, I brought Nikita to dog parks and those things are nasty. You can't

4 (29m 27s):
Discourage that either. It's a weird thing like the, the dog fighting thing. Unless you're a professional trainer and you're with that dog all the time, like you gotta be with that dog and you gotta really do a really good job if it's an aggressive dog of, of getting them around. Socialize them with other dogs because they just fucking dominate each other. Yeah. It's just natural with dogs. Yeah, they do. They bow up on each other. Bow but,

5 (29m 52s):
And

4 (29m 52s):
Start growling like God damnit

5 (29m 54s):
Everyone has a different tolerance. T threshold too. 'cause you go to the dog park, some people want them to get a little rough and some people are like not at all rough.

4 (30m 0s):
Exactly. Well, if you're a woman and you got a poodle, you know the fuck.

4 (30m 43s):
The poodle originated in Germany in the Middle Ages. A dog similar to today's standard poodle. The poodle's Germany's water dog. Just as England had the English water spaniel. French had the barbet and Ireland had the Irish water spaniel and the Netherlands. The western west Weta hun. Among the evidence used to support this theory is the Germanic name for the breed poodle or pude in German, which is derived from the low German word poodle. Meaning to splash water dog. Numerous works by that. Makes sense that they have that hair's like puddle.

5 (31m 19s):
Yeah, puddle.

4 (42m 52s):
If somebody does like funny songs. Yeah. You're fucking dooms. Yeah. You're Doom son. Yeah.

3 (42m 58s):
And it's frustrating 'cause a lot of times a funny song's just like an average joke but somebody's playing a guitar with it. There was

4 (43m 3s):
A guy that was Dam a legend in New England who used to do dirty jokes. He used to be on Dr. Demento all the time, but he used to do Dirty, God I can't remember his name, but he was like a famous guy who did like dirty songs and he would fucking sell out everywhere. Yeah,

Yeah. He's good. There's funny, there's music. Yeah. It's hilarious. You could, you could repeat it. It's still funny.

5 (43m 44s):
It also like joins a crowd together differently too. Yeah. If you just play music, the whole crowd kind of congeals into

4 (43m 50s):
Things. Totally different vibe. You go see a good concert, it's like you're fucking in tune with everybody. Yeah. You know, a really good concert when someone's killing it. Yeah.

5 (43m 57s):
And someone comes on and they're like, oh, I'm fucking jerking off. And you're like,

That's, that's actually extremely funny. Yeah. To hit the eject on a, in the middle of a comedy set. Just hit the eject button. Start singing. They

5 (44m 29s):
Were, they were like visibly discrete.

3 (44m 31s):

5 (44m 32s):
They're old as hell.

3 (44m 33s):
The shows you do when you're starting this. As me and him did a, oh God, they hired, helium hired us to do a bachelor party. Me and Matt just stood in front of a table of like, no, like nothing. We went to a restaurant with the Bachelor party, and in the middle of dinner they were like, all right, comedy. We stood at the head of the table for like 10 people. Dude.

5 (44m 54s):
Oh my God. It

3 (44m 55s):

3 (56m 35s):
It was pretty cool. At the end of Prohibition, they fucking rode those things right down Pennsylvania Avenue and gave the president a case of Budweiser. Wow. Pretty sick. Fuck. I forgot how long prohibition was it?

5 (56m 45s):
It was a while, dude.

3 (56m 46s):
It was like a decade at least.

5 (56m 48s):
Yeah. Isn't

3 (56m 48s):
That crazy? Everyone was getting wrecked. Dude. Isn that crazy. No one stopped drinking at all,

4 (56m 52s):
Dude. But why? That's one of the few things that's ever been made like that that was rescinded. Yeah. I think And prohibition is the big lesson too. It's the big lesson also. It's 'cause it's the rise of the mafia prohibition's. The rise of the NASCAR that came from it too though. Did it really

3 (57m 10s):
Bug? Yeah. Yeah.

4 (57m 11s):
Those are cars that they souped up to get away from cops. What? Yeah. That's the origins of nascar. Yeah. What Moonshiners son. Damn.

4 (57m 51s):
Yeah. He's gonna be the president again. No. Yeah. It's gonna be crazy. He's not gonna, they're just gonna keep him on testosterone and Adderall and people are gonna vote for him no matter what

5 (59m 29s):
But they're handing it out like nothing too.

4 (59m 32s):

This might be the, her lawyer might have wrote all this on a very strict diet, not taking any medication at this moment in time. But this will change it a few weeks. Rosa Atta. I want to heal before I start again with any medication. And due to this strict diet, my level of glucose is thankfully under control. A

When it, it was 16 days in.

4 (1h 5m 3s):
You know? Yeah. All that roughage and fiber

5 (1h 5m 6s):

4 (1h 6m 41s):
Out. Yeah. Now we,

3 (1h 6m 43s):

5 (1h 6m 43s):
Well. They kill more, those pizzas probably kill more people from the house.

3 (1h 6m 46s):
Fires the fucking nutritions on this from

5 (1h 6m 48s):
The house fire. You don't get black out and put those things in the oven and pass out all the

3 (1h 6m 52s):
Time.

5 (1h 6m 54s):
Seems like a leading cause of death. You didn leave. They kill whole blocks of rows.

3 (1h 6m 59s):
There's for real. There's no Yes. That has to happen. Nonsense. We were close. How many

4 (1h 7m 4s):
Of the people eating frozen pizzas are drunk? Oh, what's the percentage? If

3 (1h 7m 7s):
You're sober a frozen pizza, you're a fucking loser. I'll be on the record for that.

5 (1h 7m 13s):
It's just pedophiles eating them.

3 (1h 7m 14s):
Pedophiles are sober. Eating frozen pizza.

5 (1h 7m 19s):

4 (1h 10m 4s):
Bro. We're fine. We're not gonna talk about horses. Is he the panist fish? We're talking

5 (1h 10m 10s):
About shooting horses. Yeah.

4 (1h 10m 16s):
They are fucking impressive though. They're

5 (1h 10m 18s):
Fucking amazing, man.

4 (1h 10m 19s):
I have, I had no idea where they were that I kind of, I kind of knew, but I don don't think I'd ever seen one next to a regular horse

5 (1h 10m 23s):
Before. I did not know they were that big either. That they're dwarfing regular horses. I'm scared of horses, man. I got fucking, I got bucked off of one when I was little. Oh no. We had, like, I grew up next to, so I, I was one of six and my cousins were one of 10. And my, my dad and my uncle bought like a piece of land outside of Philadelphia. Like, it was like a ruler area. It got built up now. But I grew up next to like 10. I had 10 cousins that we'd all just like fuck around. There was behind it. There was a guy who rented land off of us. He had horses. So I was always like, we cut through the horse place to get to the woods and like, dude, they'll charge you and shit. They're scary. Yeah. I'm still to this day, terrified of them. We used to ride 'em. The one just went nuts and just bucked me off. And I was like, fuck this dude.

4 (1h 11m 3s):
I mean, I get it. I, I think riding them looks awesome, but whenever you're riding an animal, like you're on an animal, like hang onto an animal. Dude, I got,

5 (1h 11m 11s):
Is

4 (1h 11m 11s):
This necessary?

5 (1h 11m 12s):
Yeah. And it's like this could beside like, fuck this guy and this thing could kill me.

4 (1h 11m 15s):
A friend of mine was in a trail of horses where they were going into like this deep mountain elk hunt and one of the horses fell Ugh. And broke its leg and they had to shoot it right then and there. Really? Yeah.

5 (1h 11m 31s):
Oh. 'cause they can't get it back. Basically.

4 (1h 11m 33s):
They can't get it back and they don't heal.

5 (1h 11m 35s):
Really?

4 (1h 11m 35s):
So Yeah, they shoot horses. Damn.

5 (1h 11m 37s):
I didn't know that.

4 (1h 11m 38s):
When the horses break their leg, they shoot 'em.

5 (1h 11m 40s):
Jesus. Yeah. I didn't know. They didn't heal.

4 (1h 11m 42s):
They don't heal. Yeah. They never totally heal and I think there's probably, you know, this is quite a few years ago. It's probably methods that they use now. Do they, can they heal horses? They definitely can't run again. Like if it's a race horse, they break their leg and shoot them. Yeah. They'll never run again. But they killing

5 (1h 11m 60s):
Horses.

4 (1h 12m 0s):
Yeah. Yeah. They had to shoot this horse. My buddy was on this wilderness trail and the horse fell. It snapped its leg

5 (1h 12m 8s):
And they blasted it in the

4 (1h 12m 9s):
Head. They had to shoot it. Yeah. You

3 (1h 12m 10s):
Ever see that at the race track?

5 (1h 12m 12s):
No.

3 (1h 12m 12s):
They, if the horse breaks his leg, they'll bring out like a tarp on the track and just, and hide it from the crowd and just

4 (1h 12m 19s):
Eject it. Yeah.

3 (1h 12m 21s):
Whoa. Yeah. That's hard. I mean don don't know how, you know, often there's still doing that. But that was, that was just what they did.

5 (1h 12m 27s):
I probably do. Yeah. Yeah.

4 (1h 12m 28s):
Bones suck. They break too easy. Yeah. They break so easy. They take so long to heal. Yeah.

5 (1h 12m 36s):
It's ridiculous.

4 (1h 12m 37s):
Such a shit design. That's why we have to accept the new, when we get ai. When you're gonna get a new body, gonna get some titanium frame,

5 (1h 12m 46s):
That'd be sick. Yeah. When's that stuff coming?

4 (1h 12m 48s):
Unlike humans horse has heavy bones and light leg bones. This is the way heavy bodies rather and light leg bones. This is the way they've developed many breeds, especially the thoroughbreds. When bones break, they may often shatter and it's almost impossible to surgically reconstruct the fractured leg. While humans have some large muscles and a bit of tissue below the knee, that helps stabilize a broken bone along with a cast. A horse has very little muscle and hardly any other tissue besides tendons, ligaments, blood vessels, and some nerves below the knee. Oh wow. The lack of muscle and other tissue means that even in a cast, the broken bone has little to support it. And it's much harder to prevent a horse from using its broken leg to bear weight.

4 (1h 13m 29s):
Wow.

5 (1h 13m 31s):
Kill

4 (1h 13m 31s):
It. So they have to shoot it.

5 (1h 13m 33s):
Gotta kill it.

4 (1h 13m 34s):
Yeah. This article

6 (1h 13m 35s):
Says that they've figured out some stuff, but that's, that's why that, that's been the most common way to handle it.

4 (1h 13m 41s):
Compound fractures where broken bone penetrates the skin have a much poorer prognosis and are less likely to heal successfully without complications. Such cases are likely to be euthanized, particularly if blood supply to the leg has been compromised. So it says repaired, the less complicated the the fracture, the more likely the horse will recover. Oh. So there are some that recover green stick and stress fractures are incomplete fractures. And these can usually be treated successfully. Simple fractures where there's one clean bake break are more likely to heal successfully than shattered bones.

5 (1h 14m 11s):
Nah, you gotta kill 'em. Mm.

3 (1h 14m 13s):

And he walked in and he, he can't, he couldn't straighten his legs. So he had a walk with like legs permanently bent and he would play like racquetball. That's one of his knees.

5 (1h 14m 40s):
What the fuck, bro?

3 (1h 14m 41s):
Probably all number four,

4 (1h 14m 42s):
Bro. They, they just cut his knees all, all over the place. Oh man. Just covered in scars back then. Man. The surgeries were terrible. Yeah. And the and you didn't really recover. Yeah. You was never really the same again. Yeah.

Poor guys. If you were lucky, if you weren't lucky. Eaten by a jaguar. Yeah cat. Yeah. Dude. Fucking snatches you up by your neck. Drags you up a tree. Yeah dude,

5 (1h 15m 24s):
That was the majority of human history was just brutal. Violent death.

4 (1h 15m 27s):
Well that's why people

5 (1h 15m 28s):
All day every

4 (1h 15m 29s):
Day. Little kids are scared of monsters. Yeah. What experience did they have with monsters?

5 (1h 15m 33s):
No. They'd know

4 (1h 15m 34s):
That represents animals that'll eat you. Represents wolves.

5 (1h 15m 37s):
Yeah. It's instinctual. Yeah. Baby turtles are scared of hawks. That's

4 (1h 15m 41s):
What's gonna happen now. Once again, in about four years,

5 (1h 15m 43s):
What's gonna happen?

4 (1h 15m 45s):
Wolves. Wolves everywhere. No electricity. Small packs of people.

5 (1h 15m 52s):
Isn't that gonna be kind of cool

4 (1h 15m 53s):
Banding together, running outta boat?

5 (1h 15m 55s):
Everyone tells me. I think that would be kind

3 (1h 15m 57s):
Cut. Second grade goes down. I'm

4 (1h 15m 58s):
Fucking no idea how bad it's gonna be. It's gonna

5 (1h 16m 0s):
Be bad. But like, dude, you get your juice. Here's the thing. You're not gonna be like bored and like, what's the point?

4 (1h 16m 6s):
I'm gonna kiss you First of all, there will be no second

3 (1h 16m 9s):
Grid goes down if the power goes outta my house, I'm coming straight. I'm going to your room. Get in here. I'm gonna break down that door.

5 (1h 16m 15s):
I'm gonna get a generator.

4 (1h 16m 16s):
You better. I need

3 (1h 16m 17s):
One. You better charge that thing. 'cause I'm coming.

4 (1h 16m 19s):
Just imagine if just maybe life stays exactly the same. They figure out a way to get us food. They figure out a way to get us gasoline, but there's no electricity. You can drive around but there's no electricity, no social media, no internet. So the eighties. Just imagine that right now. Imagine that right now. It'd be nice, but the world would be in a fucking turmoil. Oh yeah. No one would know what to do. Oh yeah. What do I do? What's real, what's what's going on? I gotta read the newspaper. What? Yeah. There's no electricity so you can't even watch tv. There's no TV at all.

5 (1h 16m 53s):
We should try it for like a month. Have like the whole country just go off for a month. Yeah. They wouldn't

4 (1h 16m 56s):
Even be able to do the newspaper. 'cause they don't have the machines to do the newspaper like they used to do before the electricity. So they wouldn't even have the newspaper.

5 (1h 17m 3s):
Yeah. Well they're, they're clamping down on Facebook and stuff now. Again, I think they've been trying to like get them forever.

4 (1h 17m 8s):
Oh yeah. They were.

5 (1h 17m 9s):
What are they trying to do? Like the government's like don don't, don don't know what they're, if it's like a political ploy,

4 (1h 17m 14s):
If I would guess if I was the government and I was looking at social media, I would say a couple things. One, if you're protecting people, the the fucking, the thing that's valuable no one knew was valuable. Everybody consented to give away their information, but nobody ever thought data was a commodity. That had never been a thing in human history. The data was insanely valuable. And then the people who have that data now with all that money have this insane ability to, to donate to What are you doing? Jeremy? Showing you what they're suing them for. Oh. Oh. More than 40 states in District of Columbia filed lawsuits against Meta. The parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.

4 (1h 17m 54s):
The fa, Facebook and Instagram deliberately manipulate their apps in ways to addict kids and teens and have failed to keep them off despite age limits. Here's the thing though. Why is it their responsibility? Just like, why is it Pornhub's responsibility to make sure that you're 18? Yeah. If you have a kid, it's supposed to be your responsibility to see what the kid's doing. Right. But how are you going to, unless you have to use your ID every time you sign up and they have to verify your age.

3 (1h 18m 22s):
They do that in Louisiana. Did they? Yeah. I tried to jack off in Louisiana. Yeah,

4 (1h 18m 26s):
They make sure you

5 (1h 18m 27s):
Utah can't even get on Utah. You can't even get on dude. Yeah, you can't get on the sites on

3 (1h 18m 31s):
Utah. I found, I found a site.

5 (1h 18m 33s):
No I mean you dig up some og sites

3 (1h 18m 34s):
Boots.com you have to dig up

5 (1h 18m 36s):
Like the OG porn sites. Yeah.

3 (1h 18m 37s):
Yeah. I had to, I had to dig deep and I tell you what you those fucking off the grid porn sites.

VPN Easy (1h 18m 42s):
You gotta use A VPN. No. You should use a VPN. Oh that's a good idea actually. Yeah. Yeah. You should use one. That's A great idea. Yeah. It's VPN Easy. Yeah. One click. It's a sponsor. Nice. Easy to use the Yeah, you could pretend you're in fucking Hawaii. You could pretend you're anywhere you want.

3 (1h 18m 58s):
Oh, do you think I can use it? Bet somewhere else. Maybe not just, I don't know

4 (1h 19m 5s):
I know

3 (1h 19m 6s):
That. Oh, this is your sponsor. VPNs. I'm gonna use it to bet. I think they're our sponsor Bet somewhere else. There're our

5 (1h 19m 11s):
Sponsor.

3 (1h 19m 11s):
I know people have used it

4 (1h 19m 13s):
To collect Pokemons.

3 (1h 19m 14s):
I'm gonna look up all types of stuff

5 (1h 19m 16s):
To collect Pokemons.

4 (1h 19m 18s):
Yeah. They've collect Pokemons in places where they weren't really there. I know people. There you go. Use VPNs to bypass countries. Like, you know, Netflix is like United States.

3 (1h 19m 27s):
Netflix.

4 (1h 19m 28s):
Yeah. You can go to the uk. Netflix. Ooh. You can go to, you know, Asia, Netflix. You can go to whatever you want. That's pretty cool. Yeah. That's pretty cool.

5 (1h 19m 34s):
Fuck. I think there are sponsored too actually.

3 (1h 19m 36s):
Yeah. Shit, I love them. I'll never bet somewhere else.

4 (1h 19m 44s):
That's another thing that was like impossible. Now it's everywhere. Betting was impossible back in

3 (1h 19m 48s):
The day. Yeah. You had a like fucking 10 years ago. Yeah, it was my dad was a

5 (1h 19m 53s):
Everyone, dude. Everyone had,

3 (1h 19m 55s):
What am I doing that's snitch on my fucking dead? Nobody almost

4 (1h 20m 0s):
You got

3 (1h 20m 0s):
Yourself though. What the fuck am I snitching on him for?

4 (1h 20m 3s):
It was a whole MMA organization that existed before betting went down and I think part of their business model was betting. Yeah. Was Bodog. They had some like big fights. They had Fedor fight for Bodog. Jorge Vidal fought for them like some big fighters. I think Chas Sunon fought for them and they, they had fights like on a beautiful beach in Costa Rica with like hot rain car girls walking around and they had the fights outside with like world class fighters. Damnit was street fighter fighting outside. Yeah. It's crazy. Yeah. Some one and I think, I'm pretty sure that was the, the business model was about gambling.

3 (1h 20m 42s):
That makes sense. Yeah. I saw it coming in. England had it before us. and I watched soccer and like soccer teams jerseys would have just like bet.com drafts and all that shit. Yeah, shit. Yeah. Yeah. So it's coming.

4 (1h 20m 52s):
There was another thing, the international pool tour, they had a, the similar situation. Yeah. They had this big like multi hundred thousand dollars, like 300, $400,000 for the winners for these tournaments, which is huge for pool players. but it was all about online gambling. And then the online gambling, they they killed that. They put the kibosh on that. Really? Yeah. They fucked up everything for just telling people what they can and can't gamble on. Yeah. So this is like my same feeling about like this meta thing. It's like, I get it. Yeah. The algorithms are designed to keep you engaged but they keep you engaged with what you're interested in. That's the thing. It's like they're saying they're, they're shoving you only news from one source and Yeah. But that's not their responsibility I don't think to provide, they're not a, a news distributor.

4 (1h 21m 37s):
If you're only into Q Anon, they're gonna send you fucking Q anon. Shit. Get qan on feed. You're gonna get a lot of qan

3 (1h 21m 42s):
Ons. Something happened. Yeah. I mean, I'm sure we've talked about it before. Something happened with the algorithm lately. What's going on on all these don Don't know I mean it's

4 (1h 21m 49s):
Oh, with the violent stuff. All this stuff. Oh God. With that stuff.

3 (1h 21m 52s):

Yeah. It's nice. Dude. We didn't have one for a while.

3 (1h 30m 9s):
You've been shit in there. Dude. You been shit in the

5 (1h 30m 11s):
One I shit. Every time I do stand I ha I can't help it.

4 (1h 30m 13s):
There's a button that says defecate. You ever hit that button? Yes, brother.

5 (1h 30m 17s):
Hit all the

4 (1h 30m 17s):
Buttons. Really? That's a pipe cleaner. I haven't

3 (1h 30m 19s):
Dumped there, I don't

4 (1h 30m 20s):
Think. Oh, bro. Dude, what does it say? North America, through the 17 hundreds, people were still wiping whatever they had on hand. Oh yeah. Most common things were corn cobs and sea shells. Pause

5 (1h 30m 32s):
On the corn cobs You don

4 (1h 30m 33s):
The shells. They scraped their asshole with seashells, seashells shells. But by the 18 hundreds, paper was becoming more widely available. Yeah. Magazines. And finally, in 1857, a New Yorker named Joseph Gaty introduced the first patented toilet paper boss. Wow. Hero. 1870. 1857. So until 1857, everyone was just, oh, the Romans cleaned it behind the sea. Cease sponges. That's nuts. That seems like a good move that feeds the fuck out of a sea to a stick. Yeah.

5 (1h 30m 59s):
Yeah. A lot of places in the world keep like a dish of water in the Middle East. You keep a dish of water above your toilet and use one hand to like splash water on your ass.

4 (1h 31m 6s):
Huh?

5 (1h 31m 8s):
A wiping test.

4 (1h 31m 10s):
Interesting. I think that's the move. The move is the sponge. I like that. 'cause if you use the sponge, then you can clean the sponge off. Yeah. You can reuse it. It's green. Yeah. You throw sponge the sponge away, Jamie. Yeah. It's just like a pile of sponges in the toilet. No, you clean your sponge piece. Share your sponge with, everybody gets one sponge goes with your voter id. It's on the end of a

5 (1h 31m 30s):
Spear. Right. It's a sea sponge. Go get another one. You can go. You don't

4 (1h 31m 32s):
Have to put it on the end of a spear. You hold it in your hand like a gentleman. They

5 (1h 31m 35s):
Would get old though. It's test

4 (1h 31m 36s):
For a stick. It's like you're buffing. Like when you're buffing your hood, you just buff your asshole with a

3 (1h 31m 41s):
Sea a sponge. Actually, that is nice. That seems like a good move. I think that for a car would feel great on

5 (1h 31m 46s):
Sponge. I might. I might.

4 (1h 31m 47s):
So if you have

3 (1h 31m 48s):
Test a sponge, break

4 (1h 31m 49s):
Out the toilet and right next to the toilet, you got like a basin and the water's flowing. You dunk your sponge in there. Clean it out.

5 (1h 31m 56s):
It's a nice sound too. It's

3 (1h 31m 57s):
Not bad. It's Oh,

4 (1h 31m 58s):
Whoa.

5 (1h 31m 59s):
Hey, water dripping in. Oh, that'd be

4 (1h 31m 60s):
Awesome. Unless, unless you just got a mess. Chunky, thick

5 (1h 32m 3s):
Through

4 (1h 32m 4s):
The shower. Frozen yogurt. You're never getting it out the sponge. It's deep. It's all over your ass cheeks. You are wiping your legs. It's all the way up your back. It's dripping down your legs. Now what the fuck did I do? They

5 (1h 32m 19s):
Were used and shared by

4 (1h 32m 20s):
Fellow butt wipers. Oh. They were used and shared. You don't have your own Of course. Why would you have your own Jamie? Dude,

3 (1h 32m 25s):
It's fucking Rome dude.

4 (1h 32m 26s):
The visitor. Okay. So if one of the ika visitors had intestinal worms, all the others would carry them home too. Without any knowledge of how diseases spread. The overall Roman toilet set up could hardly be called hygienic by modern standards. Yeah.

5 (1h 32m 39s):
You know, they, you know, they test, they told me to test kids for worms. They said, put a piece of scotch tape on your kid's butt hole while it's sleeping. And the worms come out of the butt hole at night and they'll get stuffed to the scotch tape. What? Yeah. Did a doctor tell my wife this today? Don't

3 (1h 32m 52s):
You have to like shine a light on your kids' asshole to see the worms coming out at night? They

5 (1h 32m 56s):
Hopefully, well, they want to. It

3 (1h 32m 57s):
Can't happen to I heard that

5 (1h 32m 58s):
Story. Yeah. But they want us to put scotch tape on the bee hole. Mayo

4 (1h 33m 1s):
Clinic says to do that too, press the adhesive side of a piece of transparent tape to the skin around the anus of the person you suspect as pin worms. As soon as the person awakens the eggs, stick to the tape. When you tape take the tape to your appointments so the doctor could look at pin worms or eggs under a microscope. Interesting. Isn't that fucking crazy, bro? This is a crazy sucks video that sucks of a black bear. His black bears walking and it's got worms. It's got worms coming outta his butt. A giant one like garden hose. Yeah.

3 (1h 33m 27s):
Yeah.

4 (1h 33m 27s):
Like garden hoses hanging. Look, look, look hanging out of his ass. How crazy

3 (1h 33m 34s):
Is that? Hit his face. He's like, I

4 (1h 33m 36s):
Know. Dude,

3 (1h 33m 38s):
This sucks. This is embarrassing.

4 (1h 33m 39s):
The size of those worms. What must be going on in their gut? Oh my God. The worms must be getting most of the food. Yeah. Oh, that's so nasty. If they're making their way all the way out through your asshole. That thick, look at that. Those thick covid vaccine like ropes. Those blood clots you find on Reddit. That's what it looks like. Look at that fucking length of that thing. Look at that one. That one you just showed, Jamie. I was thinking it was a video I was trying to see. Yeah, look at the length. Oh my God. Look at the length of that. Someone cool that. Look at the worms behind him. Oh,

5 (1h 34m 13s):
Brother. That tree's not the answer, man. No,

3 (1h 34m 15s):
That's good though for now. True. Imagine,

4 (1h 34m 17s):
I imagine you having no idea what's going

3 (1h 34m 19s):
Get that bear racking his nuts doing that. It's pretty great. He

4 (1h 34m 22s):
Has no idea what's going, going on. His changed

3 (1h 34m 23s):
Subject. Diarrhea and worms,

4 (1h 34m 26s):
Brother. That's crazy. Fucked

3 (1h 34m 29s):
Up. That's

4 (1h 34m 29s):
Terrible. That's crazy.

3 (1h 34m 30s):
It's kind of sad. That's nasty. Did you see that bear get hit in the nuts?

4 (1h 34m 33s):
This one?

3 (1h 34m 33s):
Yeah. It's pretty wonderful. This is great. This is one of the greatest videos ever.

5 (1h 34m 40s):
There we go. Gearing up. What's

4 (1h 34m 42s):
He doing?

5 (1h 34m 42s):
Scratching.

3 (1h 34m 43s):
Scratching, man.

5 (1h 34m 45s):
God, that's gotta feel fucking awesome.

4 (1h 34m 51s):
Yeah, look at him. He's just rubbing his back. Is there any other animal that does that?

5 (1h 34m 56s):
Oh no. Oh, he caught himself nuts. Look at him. It takes,

3 (1h 35m 5s):
I was like,

4 (1h 35m 5s):
Oh

3 (1h 35m 5s):
My nuts. Oh my nuts. Dude. Instantly just a dude. Like as soon as he got there,

5 (1h 35m 9s):
I know. and it took, it took like a good 10 seconds to fully kick in on 'em.

4 (1h 35m 13s):
They are absolutely the coolest animal. Yeah.

3 (1h 35m 15s):
Oh, they're awesome. They're

4 (1h 35m 16s):
The coolest.

3 (1h 35m 17s):
Grizzly would kill would kill a gorilla

4 (1h 35m 19s):
Dude. Yeah, I think so. Really? Yeah.

3 (1h 35m 22s):
Yeah. Bro.

5 (1h 35m 22s):
That's a hot take.

3 (1h 35m 23s):
Aren't, I'm tired of these people saying gorillas would fuck up a grizzly. Yeah.

5 (1h 35m 25s):
How? That's crazy.

3 (1h 35m 26s):
Griz silly. Those grizzlies are fucking, they're huge. They, they're 40 miles. They run 40 miles an hour.

4 (1h 35m 32s):
Well, there's different, they're

3 (1h 35m 33s):
Types. Different

4 (1h 35m 35s):
Types. Crazy mountain grizzlies. And then there's coastal brown bears, which are the same species, but they have much more access to protein. They're just eating salmon. All day and moose. Those things are giant. Damn. They how fast they're fucking

5 (1h 35m 48s):
Thing dude.

4 (1h 35m 48s):
They run so fast. But more importantly, oh my God. But believe it or not, like John Donaher and Lex Friedman had a conversation about this that I saw. It was hilarious. About who would win a, a gorilla. A bear, a grizzly bear or a lion. And what,

3 (1h 36m 4s):
What he was Lion's getting rocked, right?

4 (1h 36m 7s):
Well, a bear

3 (1h 36m 8s):
Easy.

4 (1h 36m 9s):
No, no. Probably not. Really? Yeah, probably not. No,

3 (1h 36m 14s):
No. I'm out.

4 (1h 36m 15s):
Yeah. It's, it's hard to say. I'm out. It's hard to say. Lions are pretty big. You know, a big tigers line fucking lion. A tiger wood. A big like Siberian and those really enormous tigers. But

3 (1h 36m 28s):
I watched, I'm sorry to to tell y'all, I watched a sloth bear hold his own against a fucking tiger recently. Mm. That's just a shitty,

4 (1h 36m 34s):
That's a crazy

3 (1h 36m 36s):
Mangy shitty bear. Those

4 (1h 36m 37s):
Are very

3 (1h 36m 37s):
Aggressive. Griz bears. Griz bears,

4 (1h 36m 39s):
Sloth bears are very aggressive. They killed a lot of people in

3 (1h 36m 41s):
India, I believe. I've seen That was the first time I met you. I showed. Showed you a bear killing a man. The day we met. The first time we did an open mic together. I was like, yo, check this out. There was the bear eating a guy. Yeah. He showed me a guy jump off a building and I was like, that was

5 (1h 36m 56s):
Sick. That was a rough one.

4 (1h 36m 57s):
This is a bear versus a tiger. This

3 (1h 36m 58s):
Is actually very nice. And that's that soft bear is defending its cub. and it is a very nice moment, dude.

4 (1h 37m 5s):
Yeah. That's a small tiger. And

3 (1h 37m 7s):
That soft bear gets rocked and hangs in there. Yeah.

5 (1h 37m 11s):
Damn

4 (1h 37m 11s):
Dude. They're tough dude. They're tough.

3 (1h 37m 13s):
A grizzly would go nuts on that thing.

5 (1h 37m 15s):
Fuck. They're lying.

4 (1h 37m 15s):
Maybe that size tiger. That's not a very big tiger. True. It depends on how big they're, it's just thing about grizzlies and lions. They're the ones that have the giant advantage. 'cause they kill shit all the time. This is one of the things that don her said like, gorillas don't really kill anything. Yeah. Silverbacks have canines that are just for posturing. Yeah. They're just like, for showing their fangs. Yeah. It's weird. It's weird that they have canines. 'cause they don't kill any, every other thing that has canines as big as a girlilla kill stuff. Yeah. Kills things. They just eat vegetables.

5 (1h 37m 43s):
Yeah. True. Yeah. I wonder if they ever ate meat a little. Well, they, they won't. Well, monkeys eat meat at all. Yeah.

3 (1h 37m 48s):
Monkeys

4 (1h 37m 48s):
Do. Yes, chimps do. Oh, they'll eat meat. Chimps are very carnivorous. Chimps are very carnivorous. They eat a lot of meat. They eat a lot of monkeys. They eat monkeys. A lot of monkey monkeys. Yeah. Yeah. Really. They'll eat deer. They eat monkeys. They eat everything they can catch, but they eat fruit if it's available. They eat the fruit. But really what they want is monkeys. That's their favorite thing to eat. Damn. Yeah. They found that out.

3 (1h 38m 7s):
Remember

4 (1h 38m 7s):
Chimp ler? David Attenborough? Yeah. Yeah. They were like fucking with those things. I had the director on, he said, they didn't even show all the chimps eating monkeys. He was like, so often he was like, it's their favorite thing to do. Oh yeah. Look at the size of that cat. Imagine that motherfucker walks in. Fuck dude. Siberian versus Beed tiger. As it said. Yeah. That's a Siberian I know it's the same. Yep.

5 (1h 38m 26s):
Good moves. No, no, that's Show the belly.

4 (1h 38m 28s):
You guy's like, no, thanks. I like that guy

3 (1h 38m 30s):
Chilling.

4 (1h 38m 31s):
Yeah. Look at him. I don't even

3 (1h 38m 32s):
Care's. Like I don. I'm not even proud of this.

4 (1h 38m 34s):
He's just walking around that cage like Francis ano like, get the fuck outta my way. Damn size dude. Yeah. So that thing against the grizzly don don't know, but grizzlies are fucking insanely durable, man. The thing about the, they're designed to fight a cat is not necessarily designed to fight the designed to kill things. Grizzlies fight each other all the time. Yeah. And they fight for like 20 minutes and they tear each other apart and they don't get hurt. Yeah,

5 (1h 39m 1s):
That's a good point.

4 (1h 39m 2s):
It's cra their skin is so flexible and so thick that they get just bit down on and they're shaking each other and then they just shake it off like nothing happened. Yeah.

3 (1h 39m 11s):
I'm still, I'm, I'm grizzly on this.

5 (1h 39m 13s):
What's the gorilla's? What's

4 (1h 39m 15s):
Gorilla? It's good possibility. The thing is like a cat Super strength. Yeah. Yeah. Just strong as fuck and smart. The gorilla's smart. True. But they're gonna get fucked up. They're gonna get fucked up. You're taking a big cat against a grill, a gorilla, bro. No, I'm not necessarily taking the big cat against the grizzly, but maybe because don don't think, don don't think the big cat is used to fighting Grizzlys fight so much. Like they know how to fight. Like I think it would know how to hold the cat down. Those cats fight. Yeah. But I think they have to fight. Don't

3 (1h 39m 47s):
They kill all? They

4 (1h 39m 48s):
Get killed. Yeah, they get killed. They get kicked killed. But it's more like kicked outta the fucking group. Yeah, that's true. But Grizzlies fight like every year. Yeah. Yeah. Grizzlies are out there. They're always out. They're

3 (1h 39m 55s):
Like Tyson in their prime. It's every two weeks

4 (1h 39m 58s):
In front of each other. I've seen bears fight in the wild. It's wild. Really? Yeah. It's wild. See, it's wild. They just, these bears were going at it. I was in Alberta and the way they hunt bears out there, the, the forest out there is like a box of Q-tips. Like, you can't see shit. You can't see shit. Jesus. So the way they hunt bears, they have a enormous bear population. It's like they're infested with black bears. They, they leave bait out and it either like donuts or, or something Sweet. Yeah. And then the bears come to that. So these bears know where this one, or they leave a dead beaver. That's another thing they leave. So the bears know like when the bait is there, and so they'll decide like who gets the bait, or they'll decide that a female is hot and she's ready to have sex and they'll fight over the female.

4 (1h 40m 38s):
But I watch these two dudes just go at it. Just, just just go at it like 30 yards away from him. Like, that's terrifying. This is wild. Yeah, it's wild.

5 (1h 40m 49s):
Yeah. The black bears are prevalent in like the Poconos in Pennsylvania and people like,

3 (1h 40m 52s):
Oh yeah. They're kind of sissies. They are.

5 (1h 40m 54s):
They're not. Do people

3 (1h 40m 55s):
Like walking? Well, I mean they're kind of, they're at least like, they, they don't fuck with people. They

5 (1h 40m 58s):
Like to. Yeah. They don't,

3 (1h 40m 59s):
They run away

4 (1h 40m 59s):
Until they do.

5 (1h 41m 0s):
That's dude, my neighbor, when I was up there, the guy staying next to us was like, I'll walk down the driveway with him. I'm like, dude, you're outta your fucking mind man.

4 (1h 41m 6s):
You outta your fucking mind. I saw, it's

3 (1h 41m 7s):
Crazy, Jamie, there's a video of, I think it was a black bear getting into a dude's cabin. Really? And it's like, he's like, there's no, you can tell it's just a bro. He's like, dude, I think there's something in the kitchen. And then he's like, holy fuck, it's a bear dude.

4 (1h 41m 19s):
Holy

3 (1h 41m 19s):
Fuck. and it comes up the step like it's I know. Dude, they,

4 (1h 41m 23s):
They m

3 (1h 41m 24s):
That because I selling a dumb ass

4 (1h 41m 26s):
Killed a kid at Rutgers. A did his

3 (1h 41m 28s):
Back. He got killed by a black

4 (1h 41m 29s):
Bear at Rutgers. Yeah. Fuck man. Yeah. He was gonna school at Rutgers in

3 (1h 41m 32s):
Jersey. The stress factory.

4 (1h 41m 34s):
New Jersey. Yeah. The stress factory. New Jersey has the highest population of bears per capita in the country. What? Wow. Yeah. New Jersey does. New Jersey State. When the, the governor who's currently in, when he was running, one of the things he was running on a stopping the bear hunt, Chris Christie. Because people were upset. People were upset that people were hunting bears. Like, like the people that live in Newark and in cities. Like, what are you doing? Hack and sack? You're hunting bears. They, they kept that law for two years and then he is like, forget it. Start hunting bears again. Yeah. Yeah. So many bear interactions with people. They were going up so high, they were fucking up people's garbage cans.

5 (1h 42m 8s):
Dude. They come in the Poconos, you gotta lock your thing up. Yeah. Because they come like every Sunday. They're coming. Yeah.

4 (1h 42m 14s):
Deer.

5 (1h 42m 14s):
I was fucking terrified of

3 (1h 42m 15s):
Them. The deer. I've, we, my family and I, we got a house in the Poconos and they're, the deer are everywhere. Everywhere. And they are fucking disgusting. Yeah. You gotta shoot them. They, dude, we walk outside. These just the most manje fucking deer you've ever seen. Well, they

4 (1h 42m 28s):
Also might have chronic wasting disease.

3 (1h 42m 30s):
They're fucked up. Oh

5 (1h 42m 31s):
Dude. That's fucked up. My brother saw that. They just drown themselves and stuff. Oh, it's

4 (1h 42m 34s):
Scary. It's a, they, they call it like a zombie disease. It's a PreOn disease. Look at this bear. Awesome.

3 (1h 42m 39s):
That guy's

4 (1h 42m 40s):
Just chilling. No idea.

5 (1h 42m 41s):
Oh. Said what the fuck? Yo,

3 (1h 42m 44s):
What the fuck is your friend dude? There's one, there's an Asian lady taking a nap and a bear comes over and like starts sniffing her face. Oh my

4 (1h 42m 50s):
God. The thing about bears,

3 (1h 42m 52s):
Sorry.

4 (1h 42m 52s):
Black bears. If you get attacked by a black bear, it's more likely trying to eat you. Oh really? Yeah. If you get attacked by a grizzly bear, it's more likely you, you shocked it. Like you came near its cubs. Yeah. That kind of thing. Or might want to eat you too. Yeah. That's possible too. Like grizzly man with black bears. It's more likely they're munchy that they're trying to, they're just hungry dude. Yeah.

3 (1h 43m 14s):
Grizzly man. Wasn't grizzly man there when they started to get hungry. Isn't that what happened? Yeah. He

4 (1h 43m 17s):
Stayed.

3 (1h 43m 18s):
He hung out. He stayed. They were like, don't be there. That during that season, they, yeah.

4 (1h 43m 22s):
Yeah. There were bears that were so hungry they couldn't hibernate. Oh, they didn't have enough fat to hibernate. Fuck. It was an old bear. And he just didn't have any food. You know?

3 (1h 43m 30s):
He got a good meal. Yeah.

5 (1h 43m 31s):
He became a bear in the end of it.

3 (1h 43m 34s):
He became

4 (1h 43m 34s):
Just sniffing this lady. Just a

3 (1h 43m 36s):

5 (1h 43m 52s):
Yeah.

3 (1h 43m 52s):
I don't want any of 'em. Do you

4 (1h 43m 53s):
Know they used to eat them and not eat deer?

5 (1h 43m 55s):
They'd eat bears.

4 (1h 43m 56s):
Yeah. The pioneers, like when they first started establishing America, they would eat bear and they would use the deer for skins. That's why a BA dollar's called a buck. Oh. That was the amount of money you can get for one deer skin. What? Yeah. They didn't eat deer. Which is crazy. What's

5 (1h 44m 13s):
Bear taste like? It

4 (1h 44m 14s):
Tastes good. Okay. It's closer to beef. That's why. Oh. You know, and so they were, they were eating bear and they were just using the deer for skins.

3 (1h 44m 22s):
I like to think of that though. The guys that got to North America and ran into fucking grizzlies, like from Europe. Yo,

4 (1h 44m 29s):
You're

3 (1h 44m 29s):
Like,

4 (1h 44m 29s):
What? Well, Europe has a lot of brown bears. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Russia has some of the craziest brown bears.

3 (1h 44m 34s):
Oh yeah, yeah,

4 (1h 44m 35s):
Yeah. But Germany has brown bears. I think someone got killed by a, a brown bear. Germany

3 (1h 44m 39s):
Has brown bears.

4 (1h 44m 40s):
I'm pretty sure. No way. Yeah.

3 (1h 44m 42s):
Not anymore.

4 (1h 44m 42s):
Sure. don don't know. Oh yeah. I

3 (1h 44m 44s):
Guess they got those forests. They got a lot.

4 (1h 44m 45s):
There's, there's bears in the forest in, in certain parts of Europe. I know for sure. I know they have brown bears out there. Yeah.

3 (1h 44m 52s):
Lobster

5 (1h 44m 53s):

3 (1h 46m 55s):
Guru. Man. What are we doing? You're in full Notice it in orange sweatsuits. Yeah. Like

4 (1h 46m 59s):
Knowing that you gambled on the wrong guru. That's why I'm so glad I got outta that first building. The first building. I, I bought a first building before we bought the mothership. Before that spot. It was, I bought a place that was owned by a cult. Really? A cult was a documentary on it called Holy Hell.

3 (1h 47m 16s):
Yeah.

5 (1h 47m 17s):
Oh, Duncan told me that. Yeah. He told me you were in like a, how was he still kicking around?

4 (1h 47m 21s):
The guy's in Hawaii now. Yeah. Really? He restarted.

3 (1h 47m 24s):
He's a legend though. You told me this guy's story. Guy's a legend.

4 (1h 47m 26s):
Fucking rules guy's. A legend. So the guy was a gay porn star and a hypnotist.

5 (1h 47m 33s):
A dangerous combo.

3 (1h 47m 34s):
Dangerous combination. That's the ultimate combo.

4 (1h 47m 36s):
And a yoga instructor. And beautiful, beautiful man. What? Like amazing physique six pack taught yoga. And then, but as he got older, he got creepy. Started getting a lot of plastic surgery, lost his physique. And so the Cult Awareness Network, it was like right after Waco Cult Awareness Network. They're cracking down on all these cults, you know? 'cause Waco pops off, right?

3 (1h 47m 57s):
This motherfuckers,

4 (1h 47m 57s):
So this motherfucker says, okay, I'm gonna move to Austin. And just to throw people off who might be thinking I'm running a cult. I'm gonna have my followers build me a theater so that I can dance in front of them. And that was the place that I bought what I bought that place. It was gonna be my comedy club.

3 (1h 48m 14s):
It's a gay hypnotist dancer. Well,

4 (1h 48m 16s):
I found out about it because from Ron White, Ron ride's like, you should buy that theater that was owned by the cult. I played there once. It's fucking awesome. Beautiful place. I go, really? He goes, oh yeah. Fucking the,

3 (1h 48m 26s):
It's a good Ron White, by the way. s

4 (1h 48m 27s):
Amazing. That's pretty

3 (1h 48m 28s):
Good. It's a really good Ron

4 (1h 48m 29s):
White. And you know, I'm just a giant, I, every time I talk to Ron White, I'm like, I'm friends with Ron White. It's weird. Yeah.

3 (1h 48m 34s):
It's awesome. He's the man. He's awesome. He might be the coolest dude.

4 (1h 48m 37s):
Possible. He's one of the greatest humans that's ever walked. He's so funny. I love that guy to death. So when he was telling me to buy the building, I was like, I'm buying that building. Yeah. It's for sale. Let's go. and I took him on a tour and he is like, yeah, I fucking killed right here.

3 (1h 48m 51s):
So

4 (1h 48m 52s):
We all looked at it. We brought in architects and everything. There's I mean, we were in the planning stages. They had like a significant issue that wasn't addressed, that had to be addressed. And, and I got out of it. Yeah.

3 (1h 49m 2s):
It's like buying a house. And they're like, it's all, it's haunted. Well,

4 (1h 49m 6s):
There's, well there was a lot of issues. First of all the people that there were not construction people that made that place. Oh no. But then on top of that, Adam eGate tells me about the documentary. I did not know about the documentary. I just knew Ron said, yeah, cult owned it. I'm like a cult. Yeah. Whatever. No, normal stuff. Yeah, yeah. But you flower people, they probably did yoga and grew squash. No, no, no, no. There was a lot of butt fucking dudes

3 (1h 49m 28s):
Were getting

4 (1h 49m 29s):
Dudes getting, they were getting hypnotized and fucked. And then they had to pay, they had to pay for the therapy. So he'd give them therapy. They'd have to pay 50 bucks and then he would fuck him.

3 (1h 49m 39s):
The idea of did it work? Oh yeah. For the guy. Yeah. That's the,

5 (1h 49m 44s):
For the

4 (1h 49m 45s):
Patients. That's the thing about the documentary. That's wild. This guy was a legitimate hypnotist. Right. And he had these people convinced that he could give them this thing called the knowing. And the knowing was he would like place his hands on you. It would have to be the right time. Yeah. The right moment. But these people to this day were saying it's the most amazing moment of their life. It was pure ecstasy. They connected to God. Like he through the power of suggestion. Yeah. When he put his hands on them, they really did experience that thing. So he really did have that power. Whoa. He really, really actually did. If you're a gullible person who's likely to join a cult in the first place, kind of a sucker. Yeah. Kind of a sucker.

4 (1h 50m 25s):
You're not skeptical. You believe this. And then you find yourself in the woods and you're on your knees and this guy is over you. And he puts his hands on your, your, your temples. Yeah. And they would just go into full bliss. And it's wild because it's in the movie and they're, it doesn't look like they're faking it. It looks like they're having this wild, transcendent experience. Like someone just gives them a full on mushroom trip. Just fucking wha just hits 'em with a giant dose of acid. Damn. And they're just like,

3 (1h 50m 51s):
And then they get,

4 (1h 50m 52s):
And they talk about it afterwards. Even they're talking shit about him. Shit. Even shit afterwards, like 20 years later when they're talking shit about him, they talk about him. They believed in him so much. He was

3 (1h 51m 1s):
Yolk

4 (1h 51m 1s):
Bro. Yo, he was beautiful. He was beautiful. He had a six pack. He was a yoga instructor. See, he would give them this thing, man. He would touch them in the head. And by the way, some of them, he would hold it back from them. He wouldn't give it to them. Oh, no, no, you're not ready. Like, no, I'm

3 (1h 51m 15s):
Ready.

4 (1h 51m 16s):
And so they'd be complaining for years. He, you are not ready. Oh man.

3 (1h 51m 21s):
Show that again. Show that again. No, he's trying

4 (1h 51m 25s):
Freaking people's mouths, bro.

3 (1h 51m 26s):
Yo, look at the side, the way he's tossed it sideways. So now, yeah, it's nice. Dude. This

4 (1h 51m 31s):
Is, this is, by the way, this is later in life when he's getting a little creepy looking. So he starts getting a bunch of plastic surgery and weird shit to his face. And yeah, his body kind of falls apart. But that was him dancing. That was him dancing at the One World theater. What, which was the place that I was gonna buy. That's it. He was, he, he had them build a theater so he could dance in front of them.

3 (1h 51m 51s):
I mean, can you imagine seeing that guy and not hysterically laughing, like, well, as he got older

4 (1h 51m 56s):
He just started looking like real weird men. Like real weird. Like, look at him. Yeah. But when he was young, he was beautiful. So that's the, the torment of youthful beauty. You get older fucking, you become a monster. Yeah.

3 (1h 52m 8s):
But even when he was young, it'd still be like, if I saw a guy, like throw a fruit in some guy's mouth, like,

4 (1h 52m 14s):
I'm out. I'm outta the, I bet. Start throwing the fruit later in life. Yeah. He started getting a little confident. I bet he got a little cocky. Yeah. They've been running that call for a couple of decades. That's older version of the dude changed his name twice

3 (1h 52m 25s):
That fucking hog though, dude. What's this guy? He's like a Clyde sale.

4 (1h 52m 28s):
He's been stuffing in all those butt. That's problem. Look at all those hungry miles behind. Oh,

3 (1h 52m 32s):
Look at him, dude.

4 (1h 52m 33s):
Yeah. Look at that.

3 (1h 52m 35s):
Look at the other guy. Guy. Guy in the back. Was guy his mouth open too?

4 (1h 52m 37s):
Yeah. Was guy was like, don don't want, look at the dude in the back. He's like, oh my mouth. Oh dude, I'm exper I, we probably said to him, I experienced it through you. You I felt it. I felt it. The ecstasy you had of catching master's fruit.

5 (1h 52m 49s):
The gay buttfuck cult. Man. That's tough,

4 (1h 52m 51s):
Man, bro. So they found out, because in the early

3 (1h 52m 54s):
2000 might be worse than Waco, a guy

4 (1h 52m 56s):
Left, a guy left the cult and sent a mass email like, yo, this guy's been hypnotized me and buttfuck me for the past 10 years. And then everybody else

3 (1h 53m 6s):
In the cult, swear to God, he's fucking good at it. They

4 (1h 53m 8s):
Really didn't know how many people he was doing that to. Yeah. And they all started sharing information. What? Yeah. I mean he ran this thing for a long time. The thing they all say though, is in the beginning it was great. In the beginning of the cult, they were just having, it's usually fucking together. And they're, they're going on nature hikes. They're doing yoga together. Yeah. Then as later, I think as he got older, like he couldn't get as many guys, so he needed to fuck them.

5 (1h 53m 32s):
Yeah.

4 (1h 53m 33s):
When you get gross looking, the only people that'll fuck you are the people that think you're a master. True. True. You know, when you're young and hot. True. Whereas,

3 (1h 53m 40s):
Lemme tell you so, Joe. Yeah,

4 (1h 53m 42s):
True. I know. That's why I came to you. He's out there getting it. He probably didn't need to fuck him in the early. I do

3 (1h 53m 49s):
Truly do. I do like the idea of being in a cult. Like the moment of clarity where you're like, oh, it's so funny. Dude. Waco is so funny to think of a guy being in there when they're like, the feds are coming, we've gotta fight them off. And me and a guy in the meeting, like, fuck

4 (1h 54m 4s):
Oh,

3 (1h 54m 5s):
No shit.

4 (1h 54m 6s):
And if you leak, they'll shoot you. Yeah. If you run out that door, you're

3 (1h 54m 9s):
Gonna get shot in the back.

4 (1h 54m 11s):
You gotta run out in the middle of the night. So you gotta, you gotta plan it out. You have a fucking toothbrush and a pair of underwear taped to your leg. You gotta figure out how to get over the barbed wire. Oh, you gotta run out with a roll of carpet. You throw the roll of carpet over the barbed wire. You've got it all

3 (1h 54m 26s):
Planned. You hear crash. Like, where are you going buddy?

4 (1h 54m 28s):
Oh God. Oh Jesus Christ. You hear and you feel the hot lead. I heard

5 (1h 54m 33s):
A lot of those North California grow ops, they had that thing triangle of something on Yeah. On Netflix. I've heard a long time ago. They were like that. Like people hippie kids would be like, I'm gonna go trim on this guy's farm. And it's like thinking it's gonna be like some cool hippie guy. But these are like country Northern California criminals. Yeah. Really hot young hippie chicks running out there and it's getting like drugged and stuff. It's like, well

4 (1h 54m 53s):
That's a documentary series Sasquatch. Really? Did you ever That was, yeah. Very good.

3 (1h 54m 58s):
That was cool. Yeah.

4 (1h 54m 59s):
Very good documentary series. It's about they, they attributed a murder to Bigfoot. They said Bigfoot kill. That makes sense, dude. What? Just like, tell us

5 (1h 55m 9s):
Fucking Bigfoot dude. Dude,

3 (1h 55m 10s):
You have to be, dude. Just be like,

4 (1h 55m 13s):
Oh fuck bro. Bigfoot killed that cartel

3 (1h 55m 16s):
Guy. Broken and killed all the cartel guys. That was nuts. So

4 (1h 55m 20s):
It was so remote and so lawless that guys would come in and steal people's crops and they'd rob people and shoot people. And so it was like these guys started off as hippies and then it became business. That has to

3 (1h 55m 32s):
Be how every like, lochness, monster, Sasquatch, every single monster was definitely just a guy killing a guy and being like, fucking tro came outta nowhere back in the day. Yeah.

4 (1h 55m 45s):
You pour DN aevidence the monsters.

5 (1h 55m 48s):
True. That's a good idea.

4 (1h 55m 49s):
Yeah. Also, that's, if you leave someone's body in the woods, like where there's like wild pigs and animals, they're gonna eat that body quick. They'll watch it up. All you have to do is leave the body for 24 hours and something's eaten and a coyote's going to eat it. I don't remember if we talked about this, bro. Bro. No, I haven't seen this one. This

3 (1h 56m 6s):
This is great. Is so funny.

4 (1h 56m 7s):
Love has won the cult of mother. God. That's one of the rare cults run by a lady too, right? Yeah.

3 (1h 56m 12s):

People we're getting conflicted reports about China.

5 (2h 4m 10s):

4 (2h 4m 30s):
Oh

3 (2h 4m 30s):
Yeah. Yeah. He's been, he's thankfully, he's on the ball. The thing I was worried about, the thing I was worried about with with Trump was, you know, it was like if Trump gets elected, world War II will happen. And then thankfully we avoided that. You know? And there's definitely no chance I know. That's all my, that's my opinion.

5 (2h 4m 50s):
That's true.

4 (2h 4m 51s):
Isn't that funny though, that like anti-war used to be the left

They hate cities.

4 (2h 8m 2s):
Fox News Dads. Oh God, Fox

3 (2h 8m 4s):
Dude. All day. They watch how terrible things are in cities. That's their only, my dad won't go to Harrisburg.

4 (2h 8m 9s):
When you watch those, those, God, I'm not going over there. When you watch those migrants, jumped those cops and beat their ass and then they got outta jail with no bail right away. That's trouble. That is wild.

3 (2h 8m 21s):
I know. but it depends what your algorithm

4 (2h 8m 23s):
Is. and it Tupac in the camera. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They Tupac the camera in the world way out. Yes.

5 (2h 8m 27s):
I didn't see this.

4 (2h 8m 27s):
Yes. Apparently those guys have fled

5 (2h 8m 30s):
And they got released or deported? They

4 (2h 8m 32s):
Got released. Oh, they're just back out. Yeah, bro. They, they interviewed this one guy. I was watching this YouTube video. What's happening in these hotels? This one guy's been there for seven months and he said they give him a nice hotel. It's a nice room. He said it's real clean. They give him breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day. And he's an illegal immigrant. Yeah. And then there's people that are poor. They're like, Hey, what about my family? What about me? What about us Americans that live here have always been here, born and raised here, and people just sneak in and you're giving them all these things you won't give us. Why are you doing this? This is crazy. That's crazy.

5 (2h 9m 6s):
Is it like a vote? Are they trying to like get new voters or

4 (2h 9m 9s):
Something? Yeah, I would imagine. Yes. Yeah.

5 (2h 9m 10s):
But they're not gonna be down with, if you ever meet like a dude from Guatemala, but

4 (2h 9m 13s):
You know you do. They're doing it right now. In New York City. In New York City. They're allowing illegal immigrants to vote. Yeah. This is something they just, is that true? Is that absolutely true? Let's make sure, 'cause this is a big statement, but I'm pretty sure that was one of the things that they were trying to do. They were trying to make it so that these people could be documented. And this is what they keep saying. The the the the way to deal with the undocumented people is find a pathway for them to be documented. Sure. That's how we've always done it. Yeah. It's legal immigration. Now you might think legal immigration is too restrictive. Okay. But you can't just let anybody in. 'cause terrorists are a real thing. Yeah. This, this is not like an imaginary, it's not like orcs like we know terrorists are real. Yeah. And they already caught that one guy where they asked the guy like, who are you?

4 (2h 9m 55s):
He goes, you'll know soon enough. And then they find out, okay, this guy's on a terrorist watch list and made it into America. What a dumb ass. Yeah. Yeah.

5 (2h 10m 2s):
They're not gonna vote left though. These people coming from like South American stuff are gonna like issues.

4 (2h 10m 6s):
A lot of them will because those, those are the people that got them in. Yeah. Those are the people that are giving them money. Those are the people that are giving them free food, free place to sleep. Wouldn't you vote for those people? Especially, all you want to do is get a fucking job. And if you vote for these people and these people are gonna allow you to be documented, you're gonna be able to get a job. And then consi continue to get social assistance, which has been pretty remarkable. Yeah. Getting money and food and a place to live. Why wouldn't you do that?

5 (2h 10m 30s):
Yeah. But then they'll work and they'll get on their own two feet. And then they're super, like, they're pretty

3 (2h 10m 34s):
Conservative. That's when it's time to close the border. Once you get established, you go no one else.

4 (2h 10m 38s):
Well they, they don't. In California, you know, in California, that was what changed California. California. When Reagan was in office, Reagan created a pathway for illegal immigrants to become legal and vote. And when he did that, the Republicans never won California again. Except for Schwarzenegger.

3 (2h 10m 55s):
Nah. You know what's interesting? You know what's interesting about like how like the left has turned to kind of like Warhawks. Yeah. The right has kind of turned to like, like your statement there about like, how about why don't we help Americans? Yeah. It's like now all of a sudden the right's like pro welfare. Yeah. You know what I mean? It's a area where it's like we should be helping our people I know, you know? Yeah. It's just everything's kind of Well

4 (2h 11m 21s):
There people are waking up on both sides, but there's a lot of people that are left wing people that are like, what the fuck is going on with all these wars? Like, what are we doing? Like this is not something that we were supposed to be about. And you know, there's a lot of people on the left that look at what's going on in Gaza right now and they're freaking out. Yeah. So then there's that turmoil on the left.

3 (2h 11m 38s):
Hey, gimme a beer. I'd like to talk about Gaza. I like, I like that. I like, that's a

5 (2h 11m 43s):
Quagmire. The gaza's a quagmire for the left. of course though. of course. They're like,

3 (2h 11m 46s):
It's funny that America's like, what are we doing in all these wars? It's like, bro, do you know who we are? Yeah.

4 (2h 11m 51s):
It's what we do. It's

3 (2h 11m 52s):
All we've ever done. Yeah. Start to finish. Yeah.

4 (2h 11m 55s):
It's

3 (2h 11m 55s):
True. Day one.

4 (2h 11m 57s):
That's how you make a place like this. Here's

6 (2h 11m 58s):
The thing I can find. This is not from this year. This is from 2022. But this is the only thing I can find. Yeah.

4 (2h 12m 2s):
Eric Adams. That is it. This

6 (2h 12m 4s):
Has to do with local elections. First of all right. And then people with green cards and the DACA doc, anyone that's a daca, which is the Dreamers. People who,

4 (2h 12m 13s):
Dreamers people who were born here. Right, right. Parents were brought into this country illegal as children. That's it. Not born here. Rather dreamers. Nice. So they're allowed to remain. Yeah. No, it's great. It does sound nice. That's all great. But they are allowing people that are not legal residents or that are not legal citizens to vote. Right.

6 (2h 12m 31s):
In New York elections.

4 (2h 12m 32s):
Yeah. See, that's all you need to know. Yeah. So that's, that's the beginning. So that's how you win the election over and over and over in the short term. Yeah. That's how you control local elections in New York. Yeah. True I mean that's, it's a foolproof playbook. You give people like way better treatment True than you give the people you, that's the same thing Osho did in wild, wild Country. They bust in all those homeless people and let 'em vote. Remember

3 (2h 12m 55s):
Kind of,

4 (2h 12m 55s):
They, they just brought in homeless people from everywhere and said, you're gonna be a part of our community. And these people are like, finally have a place to be. And then once they vote, they're like, all right, get the fuck out. Get the fuck

5 (2h 13m 3s):
Out.

3 (2h 13m 5s):
They kicked

4 (2h 13m 5s):

4 (2h 13m 23s):
Why not? But you had so many of 'em.

3 (2h 13m 26s):
So many. I'll say that once you buy one nice car, I've been on that. You want a second one or I understand that. What you gonna get? I don't know, but no, I'm not gonna buy another one. Yourself. A fucking, I'm excited. Pickup

Obviously the best real. Yeah.

5 (2h 14m 23s):
I remember

4 (2h 14m 24s):
You driving around that Nazi mobile. You, you need a goddamn American car. That's it right there. Look at that. T

5 (2h 14m 29s):
Fuck. How's America cars? Are they like, are we good at making cars now? Everything

4 (2h 14m 33s):
Bad That thing's. That thing's the shit. I love that thing. I love that. I drive that all the time. I love it.

5 (2h 14m 37s):
Pickup will be nice, actually. They're

4 (2h 14m 39s):
Great pickup. They're

5 (2h 14m 40s):
Comfortable getting wildly expensive.

3 (2h 14m 42s):
Speaking of Nazi mobiles, you know I went and saw a Nazi movie by myself.

4 (2h 14m 47s):
Really?

3 (2h 14m 48s):
Which one? Last Saturday night. Zone of interest.

4 (2h 14m 51s):
What is that?

3 (2h 14m 52s):
I know. It's about Auschwitz. It's,

5 (2h 14m 55s):
I heard This is awesome. It's all right where they live next to the

3 (2h 14m 58s):
Concentration camp. Nothing happens. It's just, it's just an ongoing, like you're uncomfortable the whole time. But I did go see it by myself, which is a weird, 'cause like the movie people, I saw it at a draft house. So you have like a waiter. Mm. And the whole time they're like, are you Shane? Hey, what's going on? Oh, I was like, yeah, I'm just here watching Nazis alone, doing exactly what you thought I'd do on a Saturday night.

4 (2h 15m 21s):
That's on brand.

3 (2h 15m 22s):
It's very uncomfortable.

4 (2h 15m 23s):
You watching this movie by yourself is on brand.

3 (2h 15m 26s):
I, I enjoyed it. But it's, yeah.

5 (2h 15m 27s):

4 (2h 15m 38s):
Look at

5 (2h 15m 39s):
That fucking, it's a cool idea.

4 (2h 15m 39s):
Look at the building they're in. Yeah.

3 (2h 15m 43s):
Feeling

5 (2h 15m 44s):
You deserve the best in life.

4 (2h 15m 45s):
The wildest thing that most people don't know about the Nazis is how many we brought over here.

5 (2h 15m 49s):
Yeah.

4 (2h 15m 50s):
Operation Paperclip. Yeah.

3 (2h 15m 52s):
Get

5 (2h 15m 52s):
'em in here. Isn't, isn't Venezuela one of those countries? They have a ton of

3 (2h 15m 55s):
Oh yeah. Argentina. Argent

5 (2h 15m 56s):
Argentina. Yeah. They

4 (2h 15m 57s):
Have countries in Argent or part cities in Argentina where everybody's white. Everybody speaks German. Yeah.

5 (2h 16m 2s):
I talked

3 (2h 16m 3s):
To Argentina's entire soccer team is white dudes. That's

5 (2h 16m 5s):
Fucking

3 (2h 16m 6s):
Wild. s like, yo,

4 (2h 16m 7s):
Bro.

3 (2h 16m 8s):
What do you guys,

5 (2h 16m 8s):
I was talking to someone

3 (2h 16m 9s):
One time. I guess it is far enough south that you would be white, right?

4 (2h 16m 13s):
Maybe. But also there's a lot of Nazis went to Argentina. Definitely. Yeah. I mean, Tim Kennedy had that TV show Finding Hitler, where there's, there's this conspiracy theory that Hitler moved to Argentina. Really? What is this, Jamie? What it's called. This is the, oh, they were, how they escaped the rat lines were systems of escape routes for German Nazis and other fascists fleeing Europe from 1945 onward in the aftermath of World War ii. These escape routes made mainly, mainly led towards havens in Latin America. Particularly Argentina, but also Paraguay and Columbia, Brazil, Uruguay, Mexico, Chile, Peru, Guatemala, Ecuador, and Bolivia, as well as the United States.

4 (2h 16m 53s):
Canada, Australia, Spain and Switzerland. But a lot of 'em in Argentina. And the Catholic church helped them. Yeah. They had this whole thing about it where they don't went to these towns. They're wearing leader starting in 1947. Some us What does it say? The rat lines were supported by clergy of the Catholic church starting in 1947. Some US

3 (2h 17m 14s):
Intelligence citation page needed. That's not true. I mean it was a humanitarian told you they loved everybody. It actually is humanitarian. They loved everybody. I love that.

4 (2h 17m 22s):
Starting in 1947, some US intelligence officers utilize existing rat lines to move certain Nazi strategists and scientists. Yeah. Like Werner von Braun, the head of N the head of nasa. Yeah. Full on Nazi. Good.

3 (2h 17m 36s):
He's a Nazi saying bring, don't hang him. I. know what you're saying. Let's get our fucking, let's figure out SpaceX spray juice, lemon. You got a juice of lemon. Then hold that juice

4 (2h 17m 43s):
Of lemon. Well, they also were competing because a bunch of 'em went to Russia as well. Yeah.

3 (2h 17m 48s):
Ah,

4 (2h 17m 48s):
I see. So Russia had some scientists. We had some other ones. Yeah.

3 (2h 17m 51s):
They can't have all the good

4 (2h 17m 51s):
Nazis. Not ones the good

3 (2h 17m 53s):
Nazis. We need one to make missiles.

4 (2h 17m 54s):
Yeah. You gotta, you can look past a few things if you need to get a missile quicker. Yeah, true. That's true. Yeah. Well, you have to, you literally have to, if these are the only guys that are making rockets,

3 (2h 18m 3s):
God damn. Can you imagine if they got the bomb first? The us the Soviets got it.

4 (2h 18m 9s):
It'd be rough. It'd

3 (2h 18m 10s):
Be negative.

4 (2h 18m 10s):
Then we would've invaded Mexico. It be negative experience. Yeah. And the Soviet Union would be funding us right now, you know about funding Mexico? They made UFOs and stuff. Oh yeah. Yeah. They made flying sponsors. Yeah.

3 (2h 18m 19s):
See, this is the type of shit. I don't all this stuff. It's like, bro, they were struggling.

4 (2h 18m 25s):
Well, they also, they also had a deep connection to the occult

3 (2h 18m 29s):
I know. But it's like

4 (2h 18m 30s):
A weird occult shit. Yeah. Yeah. In the Nazis. Yeah.

3 (2h 18m 32s):
'cause they were gonna kill themselves. There was a

4 (2h 18m 35s):
Suicide. I think there was also a lot of like evil sentiment. Like they were, they were trying to win, you know, and they were trying to, there, there was a lot of weird shit. Like, I don't want to don don't, don don't really know much about the Nazi occult thing, but I know. It's like very well documented. Yeah. They were heavily into the occult. It also,

3 (2h 18m 51s):
To me, it seems a little don don't know. It's like we, we attribute the most evil shit ever to them. I think they were just a really, really shitty country that was fucking everything up. Like, don don't know. I don't think we need to add like, they were satanists

4 (2h 19m 6s):
A cult. Well, they were definitely cult into a cult. A cult. But I mean, there's other countries that did horrible shit too. Just what the Japanese did to the Chinese and the rape of Na King. Yeah. You read about some of that stuff. Yeah. Like do,

3 (2h 19m 17s):
Yeah. I think it's

4 (2h 19m 17s):
Just surprising here. Like horrific. They were doing what Shit. Horrific shit. And the science experiments they would do, they'd give people blood transfusions from various animals and they would cut off limbs and reattach them. They did a lot. Yeah.

3 (2h 19m 28s):
They're trying stuff to figure

4 (2h 19m 29s):
Out. They try shit out on prisoners. Out. They're

5 (2h 19m 31s):
Trying to

4 (2h 19m 31s):
Figure it out. No, there's a lot of like scientific and medical innovation that came outta that unfortunately. Really? Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. What, what medical innovation came out of the Nazi experiments? I think they like learned some things. Unfortunately.

3 (2h 19m 45s):
What was it, Simon's? What's the company? Bayer.

4 (2h 19m 49s):
Bayer. Bayer's out there. Bayer did it. Yeah, that's right.

3 (2h 19m 52s):
Bayer was getting rowdy.

4 (2h 19m 53s):
Yeah. They, yeah, they, they, they tried some medication out on like 150 people. Wasn't it like something like that? They all died. Joseph

15 (2h 20m 2s):
Mango was the guy. I think you're talking

3 (2h 20m 4s):
Menlo is Yeah.

4 (2h 20m 6s):
Of science experiments.

3 (2h 20m 7s):
He loved twins.

4 (2h 20m 9s):
Oh God. Twins.

5 (2h 20m 10s):
He like twin experiments.

3 (2h 20m 11s):
Yeah. He'd be like, if I fucking cut this twin's head off. How are you feeling? Yeah. Christ. Jesus Christ. Fucking idiot. Jesus Christ.

5 (2h 20m 18s):
Well, dude, they didn't even know about germs. That was the, there was the one guy who like blew the whistle on, I forget the guy's name. They have mustache.

3 (2h 20m 24s):
No, they were Germans. Of course they did

5 (2h 20m 25s):
Joe

3 (2h 20m 26s):
Germs.

5 (2h 20m 27s):
But the Nazis knew about germs. But the guy who like discovered them, there was a hospital attached to where they delivered. They were like a morgue. And then they had where they were delivering babies, so they would like put down a dead body and then just catch a baby out of a woman's vagina. And like women were all dying. And he was telling the doctors like, you guys gotta wash. There's something on those dead bodies that's getting into women's like vaginas. And they're all like, dude, we're doctors. Our hands are clean. We're gentlemen. And then they, the guy like eventually like went nuts. And then they like, like a few years later, like, oh fuck. He was right because he was washing his hands and mortality rate went down. Like,

3 (2h 20m 60s):
Yeah. Who was that? Fuck,

5 (2h 21m 1s):
I forget his name. That

3 (2h 21m 2s):
Was way before World War II though.

5 (2h 21m 3s):
Way, way, way before.

3 (2h 21m 4s):
Not well

4 (2h 21m 5s):
In World War I, Fritz Haber figured out how to make gas to kill people with gas. And he's the same guy who figured out how to pull nitrogen out of the air. What? So at the same time, this guy's being wanted for war crimes at the same time as being nominated for the Nobel Prize.

5 (2h 21m 22s):
What?

4 (2h 21m 23s):
Yeah.

5 (2h 21m 24s):
For being, for pulling. Yeah. Well, the Nobels are all weird too. They were like dynamite makers and stuff. Yeah,

4 (2h 21m 28s):
They did. Because the guy who told Peter Berg told me about that. So the guy died and they thought he died. There was a fake story about him dying. And they called him like the merchant of death. And he is like, oh geez, I gotta change my reputation. So he started giving out prizes.

3 (2h 21m 42s):
Oh, nice.

4 (2h 21m 43s):
That's what he did. The Nobel Prize comes,

5 (2h 21m 45s):
He famous, his own funeral. He hopped Famous, his funeral. And they were like, this guy was a fucking asshole. Uhuh.

3 (2h 21m 50s):
He's

5 (2h 21m 50s):
Like, oh, I'm pretty nice. And he started that whole thing up. That's crazy. Started the

4 (2h 21m 53s):
Nobel Prize trying to cover his tracks. True.

5 (2h 21m 55s):
Yeah. Good worked. Everyone's like, he must be the nicest, smartest scientist ever.

4 (2h 21m 59s):
Of. course. Nobody even knows about the whole D thing anymore.

5 (2h 22m 2s):
Nobody does. It works.

4 (2h 22m 2s):
Never gets brought up. It's like, oh, the Nobel Prize. How prestigious. Yeah.

5 (2h 22m 6s):
Did you ever get into the guy who invented diesel? No. There's a book about him. His shit's wild dude. What

4 (2h 22m 10s):
Did he do?

5 (2h 22m 11s):
His name's, it was like Rudolph Diesel. He came up with the diesel engine and it, it was like, apparently it helped. He wanted to like make a small reliable engine. So like people in rural areas could compete with like cities and people could live in a farm and still like produce stuff and not have to like, live in like fucked up London smoggy city. And governments were like, yeah, we're building fucking weapons of death of these things. And like, it turned out to be like a, it was a wild invention. Like no other, nothing could burn stuff as efficiently before. Like it would, it would capture like 25% of the fuel diesel was like 70% capture in terms of like output. Mm. and it was just, it was completely revolutionary. and it was just found drowned.

4 (2h 22m 49s):
Oh, they killed him.

5 (2h 22m 50s):
Oh yeah. It was like the Ki Helm I think was after him. He made all these

3 (2h 22m 53s):
Governments. Damn. 1913, just in time. The

5 (2h 22m 55s):
Rockefeller. The Rockefeller as well.

3 (2h 22m 56s):
Just in time for the worst thing ever. He

4 (2h 22m 58s):
Disappeared from the Steamship Dresden while traveling from Antwerp Belgium to Harwich, England. On October 10, a Belgian sailor aborted northeast steamer spotted a body floating in the water. Upon further investigation turned out the body was diesels. There was and remains a great deal of mystery surrounding his death. It was officially judged a suicide. But many people believed and still believed that Diesel was murdered. Duh.

5 (2h 23m 19s):
He had the Rockefellers after him too. 'cause they were, they didn't wanna, 'cause they got, they started a

4 (2h 23m 23s):
Scandal. I said like I looked at it and go, oh, it's the history channel. It's gotta be legit. Then I realized that's ancient aliens. That's the aliens. The History channel is basically the ancient aliens

3 (2h 23m 31s):
Network. Now. They sold out. Dude,

5 (2h 23m 33s):
I believe it's,

3 (2h 23m 34s):
I believe facts we're done with facts.

4 (2h 23m 37s):
Isn't history finding Bigfoot? Yeah.

5 (2h 23m 39s):
Probably. Ancient Aliens had me for a line.

3 (2h 23m 42s):
No Ancients carried me that network, bro. It's a fun show to watch.

4 (2h 23m 45s):
It's constantly on. Remember what's his fucking name? Action. Bronson. He would get baked.

5 (2h 23m 50s):

Brilliant idea.

3 (2h 23m 58s):
It's actually not.

5 (2h 23m 60s):
I thought it was No

3 (2h 24m 0s):
Of course it is. It is. But I'm saying it's

4 (2h 24m 3s):
Pretty simple. It's one

Like we should film this. They were definitely getting high. Watching H and Aliens. Yeah.

4 (2h 24m 7s):

3 (2h 24m 8s):
Which is so funny. And they're like, set up a camera. This is

5 (2h 24m 10s):
Incredible. It's just such a good idea. 'cause it requires nothing. They would just walk around high. Yeah. They would fuck

3 (2h 24m 14s):
Around H

5 (2h 24m 14s):
And Aliens.

4 (2h 24m 15s):
And it's hilarious. It

3 (2h 26m 26s):
Gonna talk about Nazis. They go, please don't. That was my favorite part of the the, they're a German company. I know the Budweiser tour we're in there and they're like showing the, the labels from every year in the United States. And then 1930 came around and it was like perfect English. Budweiser. It used to be Likewe German, like Yeah, yeah, yeah. 1933. They were like Budweiser, American, Budweiser, the Beer American

5 (2h 26m 54s):
And Eiser Busch owned the rights to all the diesel engines in America. But

3 (2h 26m 57s):
Those are good Americans. Really? Yeah. Let's

5 (2h 26m 59s):
Go. Dude has Bush rules. He owned all the rights. The guy, what was it? Fucking not a Adolphus Bush, whatever the like the OG A Dolphins bush. Dolphus Bush went over

Adolphus Exactly's. Let's go. Full name. Super

3 (2h 27m 11s):
American dude. No, that's a good American story. He

5 (2h 27m 13s):
Went over, he met Ru, the diesel guy and he was like, how dare

3 (2h 27m 16s):
You dude. That's a great America story.

5 (2h 27m 18s):
He would, he would rent hotels and just rent the whole thing out and just hand everyone like $10, $10. $10. Yeah. Met up with Diesel and was like, how much do you want for the rights of this engine? Diesels. People were try, it was like 800,000 francs. He looked at Bush and was like 2 million Franks. And he was like, no problem player. Wrote him the check and he used to break. He would write him letters. It took, took forever. Dolton Bush might

3 (2h 27m 40s):
Be the guy.

5 (2h 27m 41s):
It took forever. It took forever to like, it didn't work right away. He was like, dude, like they all these guys fronted him a ton of money and like it just wasn't working. So he'd get like mad letters from people being like, alright, what is this? And Bush would break his balls. He'd send him letters and be like, dude, come on man. What the fuck? And just like, fuck it with him. So funny.

3 (2h 27m 60s):
He

5 (2h 27m 60s):
Was the bro. Don was

3 (2h 28m 1s):
The, that reminds me of, it reminds me of Ulysses s Grant when he was like selling his biography. I think he sold it to like just two guys on a train for like 10 bucks. Really? And Mark Twain found out about it was like, no, you fucking loser. Yeah. Obviously Grant was, he was hitting the fucking Budweiser. He was hitting the Ogies in fucking liquor. He was drinking responsible. He was, he was extremely responsible. That's one of his legends. I think he sold his biography on like a train for like 10 bucks while he was responsible. I mean, it's gotta be pumped. Vince is, it was his first book. It was, anyone gives you anything that you write? You're like, really? I swear to God it was Mark Twain that was like, no.

3 (2h 28m 42s):
Yeah. What the fuck are you doing? He saved America. Why are you doing this? Has

4 (2h 28m 45s):
Anybody started taking down u listed his as grant statues, yet?

3 (2h 28m 48s):
They fucking better dude. No way. I mean they've already, he he was the bro, his story. Yeah, he was good. Right. But they,

4 (2h 28m 54s):
They've taken down Thomas Jefferson. They took down

3 (2h 28m 57s):
Tj. Yeah, but Jefferson. Jefferson was, yeah, he was

4 (2h 28m 60s):
A

3 (2h 28m 60s):
Slave. He had him. Yeah. He was up to no good. He had him. Yeah. Ulysses. Did Ulysses have Ulysses own slaves? He, no. No. Hold on. Oh yeah. But he, while he was dead broke at the lowest point of his life. That's true. He freed his slaves. And even his slaves were like, bro, he should. Yeah. What are he doing? Yeah, yeah. He'd sell us. And he was like, nah, bro. Like, nah bros. Actually there's no way they said that. But they were like, thank you. Yeah. So

4 (2h 29m 25s):
He freed them when he was poor, had

3 (2h 29m 26s):
No money while he was poor. He gave away a slave. He, he came from a family that was abolitionists and then he married into a family that had slaves. Whoa. Yeah. And pro slaves. Then he, he would go out and like work with his slave like, and people would like see him be like, what the fuck are you doing? I don't know. He was kind of a weirdo. But he freed slaves while he was poor. Head of his time. Imagine He was like, I'll be all right.

4 (2h 29m 47s):
Time where it was debatable whether or not it's cool to have slaves, bro. And some people like, nah, they like it.

3 (2h 29m 54s):
Yeah. I mean dude. Yeah.

4 (2h 29m 56s):
The Century company was willing to give Grant 10% of all sales after the book was finished. When Twain heard about the offer, he was appalled at how little Money Grant would get from the sales of the book. He believed he could offer Grant a better deal. Thought I did that. Yeah. Twain wasted little time. Make his way to New York City convince Grant that he could give him a better deal. When Twain arrived at his home on 66th Street, grant and his eldest son, Frederick t Grant were reading over the Century company's contract that needed to be signed before publication. Grant was ready to pick up his pen and sign the contract. When Twain asked if he could read it before any signature was made, Twain reviewed the contract and believed the 10% royalty being offered was too low. And he even exploitative Twain tried to convince Grant that he could give him a better deal, which would provide Grant with more money.

4 (2h 30m 40s):
Grant was reluctant to back outta the contract that he and the publishers had negotiated. He believed it would be dishonorable to back out after giving his word. Damn. Twain tried to convince Grant that he should investigate a different publisher. For example, American Publishing Company had published many of Twain's books and the company be able to bring in more profit than the Century Company. Grant was still resistant to the advice when Fred suggested that the contract be set aside. While they investigated the facts behind Twain's advice, grant felt loyalty towards the Century company because of the work that he had done with the company. While he was writing his articles on the Civil War battles. Grant did agree, however, to listen to Fred and the contract was set aside for 24 hours. Huh. Interesting.

4 (2h 31m 21s):
Twain told Grant that by selling the book through a subscription system, the book would produce thousands of dollars in sales, door to door salesman. Often Civil War veterans would promote the book and get potential readers to place an order prior to publication. Oh, wow. Hmm. Back to the day. That was like the new mix tape.

3 (2h 31m 37s):
It saves Grant. Yeah. Grant was poor and then that saved him. All those sales made him rich. But he died right away.

5 (2h 31m 45s):
Yeah. Those dudes used

3 (2h 31m 46s):
To speak to right after he wrote. Oh,

4 (2h 31m 47s):
Really? Probably celebrated with

3 (2h 31m 49s):
Booze. No, no. It was, it was the Ogies dude. Oh, was it? Oh yeah. He was always smoking a scar. He died. Yeah.

4 (2h 31m 53s):
Kler. Yeah. He was

5 (2h 31m 54s):
Smoking like 50. Well, how much was it day? It was crushing stuff. It was like 50 a day dude. 50 something like that. 25.

3 (2h 32m 0s):

It's like some horrific thing that poisons you. And then when you're over, like, thank God that's over. You feel good. 'cause you makes sense. A near death experience.

I'll tell you what I didn't like. I tried an LSD microdose recently. I, I liked the psilocybin better. Man. LSD microdose just is relentless. It doesn't, you just, it's constant. All, it's for like six straight hours. You feel like, like liquidy. It's weird. don don't know. It was, it wasn't awful. But I remember just being like, this is just never

4 (2h 35m 16s):
Fucking, they gotta just hurry up and make all that stuff legal.

5 (2h 35m 18s):
They got it, man. Shit.

Stop. They have to buying it from people, making it in bathtubs with a Grateful Dead t-shirt on. Oh yeah.

5 (2h 35m 25s):
Every, every, every time. So sketchy. I got this straight from the family. I was telling,

3 (2h 35m 29s):

4 (2h 35m 31s):
Yesterday. They're bad dude.

5 (2h 35m 33s):
Bad. That's another one.

3 (2h 35m 33s):
No, I've never had mushrooms. Like, so it was like a chocolate bar and it was like, all right. They were like, four blocks is a gram. Okay. So I was like, all right, I'll have one fucking block. I'm fine. I was high in 15 minutes. It was that fast. Dude.

5 (2h 35m 47s):
They had these analogs. That's not mushrooms. They, they have synthetics they're making now. Well

4 (2h 35m 51s):
It's just, they're not making them in the same places where they make aspirin, you

3 (2h 35m 55s):
Know? That's true. That's

4 (2h 35m 57s):
True. Yeah. Knows who the fuck is making these things.

5 (2h 35m 59s):
That's what I'm saying, dude. And even with the weed edibles dude, they get, they can get gummies and get a distillate of like a synthetic cannabinoids and you're just eating like K two or something.

4 (2h 36m 9s):
Well you're definitely, it is. They're not regular. Like, like you get a 200 milligram once and it's fine. And then you get a 200 milligram and you're on Pluto. Like this is not the same. Oh yeah. I would like and I don't think anybody's doing independent third party testing of wheat gummies.

5 (2h 36m 24s):
No, not at all. No.

3 (2h 36m 25s):
The third party testing is watching the other guy first. Yeah. Who just ate him. And they go, alright, he's fine. You've

4 (2h 36m 32s):
Never seen anybody eat gummy. He's like, Joey Diaz. I had, I was with him on a plane once. He had a panic attack in the middle of the flight. And he told me, he goes, I had a panic attack in the middle of the flight. He goes, but now I'm back. And he pops two more.

5 (2h 36m 42s):
Oh,

4 (2h 36m 43s):
250 milligrams each man. Two stars of death.

3 (2h 37m 3s):
The point of that,

5 (2h 37m 4s):
The release

3 (2h 37m 6s):
When you're just back to how you were earlier.

5 (2h 37m 8s):
Yeah. 'cause it's like mundane reality. You're like, you eat weed edibles and you're like, ah. And then you get the release and you're like, thank God. Yeah, you're back. Finally grateful for once in my pathetic shitty life.

4 (2h 37m 17s):
Yeah. It's a little reality check.

3 (2h 37m 19s):
Yeah. But it's all right. I understand. So, makes you

4 (2h 37m 21s):

5 (2h 37m 41s):
Time. My thing is, you're gonna hang in there a different part of your mind where you go like, yeah, but what if I didn't give into this weird thought loop? And then you, you like, don't give into it for three seconds. We all fucking give

3 (2h 37m 50s):
Up. So last night we were at, we left the comedy club went, we were out at a bar. I was like, I'm, I can't believe how strong that mushroom was. Yeah. I was like, I'm hungry. I haven't eaten. All day. I went, I ate a euro in the cold by myself by a windy bench. Just like,

4 (2h 38m 10s):
Whoa.

3 (2h 38m 11s):
I literally got up from the table while we were all drinking. And I was like, I gotta go outside. I left for 45 minutes just, and then I came back. I, I fought it. I was like, while I was eating the, the hero. I was like, I gotta stop. Why am I being a pussy right now? I'm plow through this. That's

4 (2h 38m 28s):

Euro's. A solid choice. That

5 (2h 38m 46s):
Is a great,

3 (2h 38m 47s):
It was big also. It was very funny. So I left the bar and I was like, I was high on mushrooms enough to be like, how do I get food? And then I was like, man, that's so pathetic. I'm in a city. And I'm like, food. How do you find food? And then there was a flashing Euro light, like it was one of those street benders. And I was like, oh, that's what those lights are for, is for dumb asses that are like F food. Like a flashing light that

4 (2h 39m 12s):
That's exactly what

3 (2h 39m 13s):
They're for. Yeah. I was like, it's a bug light for a guy like me. That's like,

4 (2h 39m 17s):
Ugh. It's a bug light. It's a

Bug. It's a total bug light. I went and got zapped. Dude. I was eating his, it was cold as fucking windy last night. Wow. And then I was like it. It also sucks. Now people know who I am a little. So like the next guy was like looking at me. I'm in the cold by myself.

4 (2h 39m 36s):
Bro, this is a reoccurring theme. People the movie theater, see you by yourself.

3 (2h 39m 39s):
That was rough. I like being by myself. But when somebody, oh, you

4 (2h 39m 41s):
Realize that now you're getting famous. You realize that's a bit of an issue, right?

3 (2h 39m 45s):
Yeah. It's uncomfortable. I don't like it at all. Yeah.

5 (2h 39m 47s):
Go in disguise.

3 (2h 39m 48s):
I hate it.

5 (2h 39m 49s):
Go as s

3 (2h 39m 50s):

Love that mustache.

3 (2h 40m 2s):
That mustache is Mac.

4 (2h 40m 3s):
See so,

5 (2h 40m 5s):

4 (2h 40m 10s):
There's some different strains. Yeah. Dude.

5 (2h 40m 12s):
Insanely powerful pants, cyan and all that shit. They're fucking wild man. Yeah. And now it could be like, you can eat at gram of mushrooms. It could be a regular gram of mushrooms or it can be eight times stronger. So it's like,

4 (2h 40m 23s):
Well this town is filled with those psychedelic adventure characters. Yeah. It was a lot of those. Here

3 (2h 40m 28s):
I got hit, I literally last night. Yeah. It was a lot. I thought that was gonna be an I'm telling easy. Nice evening.

5 (2h 40m 33s):
There's synthetics too now. So like if, if you're running like a giant op where you're selling all the, like you, your grow might get fucked up. You can order a chemical offline, totally legal. You can order those offline. All you gotta do is say research purposes. Yes. And you can get this powder that's like similar to mushrooms. You can just put that into chocolates. And that's what I'm saying, like the people would make these

4 (2h 40m 51s):
Things. Is it, is it psilocybin? Is it It's

5 (2h 40m 53s):
A psilocybin like analogs maybe. So it's like close. Oh really?

4 (2h 57m 0s):
How the false Russia Biolab story came to circulate among the US Far

3 (2h 57m 4s):
Right. Ooh, let's go. So is it false shit, it circulated among me. Hold on.

4 (2h 57m 8s):
It was all lured and difficult to believe claimed the Ukraine was developing biological weapons with the assistance of the US government. In fact, the US assistance to Ukrainian biological labs has been targeted at strengthening public health measures. Both the US and Ukraine have also signed a treaty vowing to never produce or use biological weapons. We

3 (2h 57m 26s):
Promise. Dude,

5 (2h 57m 27s):
We funded Wuhan, but hold a

3 (2h 57m 28s):
Second.

4 (2h 57m 29s):
We saying, but this is their saying. US assistance to Ukrainian biological labs exists, but has been targeted at strengthening public health measures. Come on, bro. So they do have biological labs there. Yes, bro. Now by the way, there's a long history of biological warfare over there that I was on this show called Joe Rogan Questions Everything. And one of the things I did is I, I interviewed this former Soviet scientist and he's like, dude, we had trenches filled with anthrax. He goes, there was all sorts of plans in place that if anything went sideways, that they were gonna figure out a way to poison Americans. They were gonna I mean it's a legitimate biological weapons tactic is to develop. But why would you look, if, why would you think that if we develop nuclear weapons, would you develop hydrogen weapons?

4 (2h 58m 13s):
Yeah, we, we'd, we'd develop all these fucking supersonic missiles. We wouldn't fuck with viruses.

5 (2h 58m 18s):
It's fucking bullshit.

4 (2h 58m 19s):
That's crazy. Of. course they

3 (2h 58m 20s):
Would. But we, we do.

4 (2h 58m 21s):
100%. We do. That's

3 (2h 58m 23s):
What just ha That's what just killed probably. That's just what killed a bunch of people.

4 (2h 58m 27s):
It probably had something to do with

3 (2h 58m 28s):
That. Shut down our whole, yeah.

5 (2h 58m 29s):
The entire,

4 (2h 58m 29s):
Entire world. Most, they most certainly developed that in the lab. That has been established. Now they know. They literally know that the strain that came out the,

3 (2h 58m 39s):
Are you sure the guy didn't fucking eat a bat and a pen,

4 (2h 58m 42s):
A penguin? Are you sure? Yeah. The wet market. It's a wet market. But I, it's weird because a move though, that came political. Yeah.

3 (2h 58m 48s):
Wet market was nice though. 'cause then they filmed the wet market and you're like, yeah, obviously.

4 (2h 58m 52s):
Right? But then the people on the left wanted to believe it came from the wet market. But

5 (2h 58m 58s):
You could be like,

4 (2h 58m 58s):
Because the people on the right were saying it's the China virus. The It was a lab. It was a lab. No, that's a conspiracy stereotype. Yeah. So it became this. I, so people argued as if their side had a win. Yeah. Like it has to be the wet market. Yeah. Because if it doesn't, then the, the fascist win. Like they had this crazy connection to the

5 (2h 59m 16s):
Source

4 (2h 59m 16s):
Of a fucking pandemic disease.

But now they have tissue samples. They have skulls, they have a crested skull, like a gorilla. They nest on the ground like gorillas. Yeah. And they're huge. They're like six, like six feet tall chimpanzees. Whoa. Yeah. And the locals have two different, there's two different types of chimps. Look at the size of them. Damn. Yeah.

It's they, they know it's a real thing now. Yeah. They have videos of them. They're really big chimpanzees. And they, they don't think necessarily it's a different species. They think it's like a different, like the Clydesdales. Yeah. It's still a horse. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But it's like a crazy big horse. But there's this one area called, I think it's called Beli in the Congo that has this enormous, enormous chimpanzee.

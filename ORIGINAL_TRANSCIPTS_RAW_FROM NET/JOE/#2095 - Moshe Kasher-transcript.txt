Are we rolling?

3 (14s):
Hi. It's rolling. Stay. You wanna start the Save the Universe and then they wanna fuck everyone's wife?

4 (18s):
Oh, yes, yes. Yeah. It always begins. Yeah. Yeah. The, the Dimensional portal will open and then it ends with, you can't fuck your wife anymore. But guess who can.

3 (25s):
Yeah. What happens is, first they start stockpiling guns.

4 (29s):
Yes.

3 (30s):
Yeah. It seems like cult leaders have to have guns. 'cause their faith in their ability to see the universe and all the good and everything is not quite good enough. You need an ar.

4 (42s):
You need an ar to really get your point across Quite

3 (44s):
A few. You need maybe some flash grenades and I mean.

4 (47s):
It is interesting. It doesn't feel like, it feels like I wouldn't do that

3 (51s):
If you were running a cult. Well,

4 (53s):
I wouldn't fuck your wife and make you like worship me. I would just

3 (57s):
Well, you're a very nice

4 (57s):
Guy. Worship. I'm one of the nicest guys in America. You're

3 (59s):
A very nice guy.

4 (1m 3s):
Is that true?

3 (1m 4s):
Yes. I've never met anybody like that guy's a dick. Oh,

4 (1m 6s):
That's really cool. No

3 (1m 7s):
One. I love that. Everybody likes you. You're a nice guy.

4 (1m 9s):
I like, thank you. Tha You're a nice guy too. Thank you. Yeah. I, I, I have made that a mark on my life. I wanna be a good guy.

3 (1m 16s):
Yes. It's a good thing to do. I try. Really. I work at it really hard. Well,

4 (1m 21s):
You see people, by the way, and you see that they've made a decision. Yeah. Like I've met, like, I met Sting and I. Go. Okay. Sting at some point along the line, decided I'm gonna be like, awesome. Yeah. That's gonna be my thing. I'm gonna

3 (1m 32s):
Do yoga every day.

4 (1m 33s):
Yeah. I'm gonna come forever.

3 (1m 35s):
He doesn't come.

4 (1m 36s):
Right. He doesn't come. Come. Holes

3 (1m 37s):
Come. Yeah. He's like one of these guys.

4 (1m 40s):
No, what I'm saying is, he was so nice when I met him that he released.

3 (1m 43s):
Oh wow. Interesting.

4 (1m 44s):
Yeah. I have it in So Sweet and I have it at home on my, in my office with a little jar of St. Stink come when

3 (1m 48s):
He goes, he probably really goes I mean, I think. What is the, the deal with that?

4 (1m 52s):
That's why he says, don't stand so close to me. 'cause he blasts you away.

3 (1m 55s):
The tantric thing. They're supposed to have an internal orgasm. Like they're supposed to absorb it internally. Right, right. I've never, I'm too lazy. Well,

4 (2m 3s):
It takes time. Yeah. You have to like, discipline yourself and then you can come forever. I guess

3 (2m 9s):
That seems like you're thinking about your come too much to

4 (2m 11s):
Be, that does seem like

3 (2m 12s):
Spending so much time doing that.

4 (2m 14s):
A lot of time focused on Come

3 (2m 15s):
I mean there's probably a benefit in it, but every benefit that you get off of something that's a difficult endeavor is a detriment to something else.

4 (2m 23s):
What do you think the detriment? Oh, just your mental energy. Just

3 (2m 26s):
Amount of your time. You're thinking about your jizz. Like, it's fucking weird. I'm weird I mean, it's like, you know, I mean, I guess you could say that about a lot of things though, right? You could say that about like, people who body build. You could say that about, you know, maybe you're thinking too much about one thing.

4 (2m 43s):
Well, I guess that's like, kind of in a way, that's what this, this book that I just wrote is, is about, is about these like little, show me your book, these little, you,

3 (2m 51s):
You wrote a book, dude, congratulations. Thank you very much. I'm always very, very impressed and also very, very like, proud of people who write books. 'cause I know this is a, this is a fucking task,

4 (3m 3s):
Man. It's an endeavor, but it's one that I like. A lot of standups really don't like it, and they feel like it's homework. I like, I, on stage, I do a lot of crowd work. That's kind of my thing. And this is the like, creative opposite of crowd work. It's, it's not just your material. It's like, yeah. It's like mega your material. It's like you're, you're, you're, you're a monk kind of creating a thing or whatever. You should write a book.

3 (3m 26s):
I have thought about it many times and I had a deal to write one once, but as I was writing it, they were trying to get me to write it like standup. And they wanted me to write it in a way that like, was funny. Like, you'd be on stage, like, how much laughs would you want per minute on stage? Which I kind of don't really think about even stand up that much. I just try to, I cut out the bullshit. I edit things, you know, economy of words with bits, but don don't think like, how many laughs I have permit. They were like very specific about it. And then they said, how about this? Why don't you just transcribe your standup? And I was like, listen, I have a very different idea of what I wanna write than you do. So I going to give you your money back.

3 (4m 7s):
Yeah. I gave, I gave 'em the money back and I said, I'm, I'm just gonna, if I'm gonna write something, I wanna write it on my own. and I did for a little while and then I stopped. but it was a lot of it, it was just like, I only have so much time to write and I would rather write about ideas that I'm gonna do on stage. But I do have an idea about my time. I've been working on it a little bit lately. So I'm thinking about actually going forward with this. It's about a, my time when I was in my really early twenties and I discovered pool halls.

4 (4m 34s):
Oh yeah. I saw the two pool tables. I didn't know you were a big pool guy. Yeah,

3 (4m 37s):
I'm obsessed. Yeah. Yeah. If I'm not, if I'm like for like my empty my brain time, I watch professional pool matches.

4 (4m 44s):
Is that right? Yeah. Oh, interesting. You like the A lot of trick

3 (4m 46s):
I watch 'em with. No, no. I hate shit. That's

4 (4m 48s):
Bullshit. Bullshit.

3 (4m 48s):
Okay.

4 (4m 49s):
That's what I was gonna

3 (4m 50s):
Say. It's cool, it's cool that you can do it, but I don't

4 (4m 52s):
Care. Do you like that? The Hustler?

3 (4m 55s):
Oh,

4 (4m 56s):
It's a great movie. That's a good movie. That's

3 (4m 57s):
A great movie. That's a great movie. Just as a movie, you know. But the color of money is as well.

4 (5m 2s):
Aren't they connected? Yes.

3 (5m 3s):
Yeah. Same guy. Walter Tevis, who also wrote the Queen's Gambit. Oh, interesting. About that. Amazing chess player, right? She was an orphan. That's right. Yeah. That's a great series. That series is really good. But that Walter Vis guy was amazing. He wrote The Hustler's really like a psychological drama as much as it is about pool.

4 (5m 22s):
Yeah. I I re I saw it a long time ago. don Don't, don don't quite remember it, but I remember it that it's great.

3 (5m 26s):
Yeah. Oh, it's, I fucking, I could literally say every word by heart, this pool hall that I used to hang around at in White Plains, New York. They used to play it on the television all the time. In

4 (5m 38s):
The pool hall.

3 (5m 38s):
In the pool hall. Yeah. my friend Steve, who was the, the, the guy who ran the desk who, you know, ran, you know, administered, gave people the balls, assigned your tables and stuff. He used to just put that motherfucker on like every time we were there. We'd never get enough of that.

4 (5m 55s):
So what, what was your thing? You go into the pool halls when you're, how old

3 (5m 58s):
Were you? Well, I was like 20 when I really started playing. I think I was like 23 or 24, somewhere around then. And it was just my, me and my friend John, who was also a comic, we, we went into this pool hall just for fun. And you know, we were just bored during the day. Well, let's go play pool. Neither one of us knew how to play pool. We were terrible. You know, like we'd played a couple of times. Right. And then we just stumbled into this pool hall that had this insane array of characters, all these people that were criminals and hustlers and homeless people, and people who lived in flop houses and people who were fucking insane gambling addicts that would bet on raindrops coming down a window pan.

3 (6m 43s):
Oh yeah. They would bet on fucking anything, man. They wa they just wanted action.

4 (6m 48s):
And you were teens walking in there? What's

3 (6m 50s):
That?

4 (6m 50s):
You guys were teenagers going in there?

3 (6m 51s):
No, no. We were about, I was, I was, John's a little older than me. I think I was 23 or 24, somewhere around then. It's like, well, yeah, like 90. So yeah, I was probably like 23 and I just remember thinking like, this is a whole world that I didn't know existed. This weird bachelor culture. And apparently it emerged really in America in the early 19 hundreds, in the early 19 hundreds in New York City. There were hundreds and hundreds of pool halls, hundreds of them. And they were filled with these men that were disconnected from society. A lot of 'em had like returned from wars. A lot of them had gotten outta prison.

3 (7m 32s):
And they were, it was, you know, during the depression, there was a lot of illegal activity and people did whatever the fuck they could. Right. And these men would gather in these pool halls. And they were some of the wildest people I've ever encountered in my life. I watched a guy who had just gotten outta jail play chess with his, just with words. Just saying where the pieces moved with a 16-year-old kid who was a chess Genius.

4 (7m 59s):
He wasn't even moving the pieces. He was just saying this

3 (8m 1s):
To this. No, there was no

4 (8m 1s):
Pieces. Oh. They were playing mind chess.

3 (8m 3s):
Mind chess. Oh, wow. I was like

4 (8m 6s):
Some commander Data shit. Yeah.

3 (8m 7s):
These are exceptional people that just happened to never plug into regular society.

4 (8m 13s):
Well, it's like that dude in Malcolm X's autobiography. The guy that, like, he ran all the numbers in his mind and he never freakout a single one. And Malcolm X said like, he could have been like a, a mathematical Genius or a sta statistical professor or whatever. But instead he was like a hustler. He used that Genius to be on the streets.

3 (8m 28s):
Yeah. There's some people that have Genius power that they apply to an art form, but they could have applied it to any like Jay-Z. Right. Jay-Z doesn't write any of his lyrics. Right, right. If you read Jay-Z's lyrics, they don't seem ad-lib. They seem like really well structured and written and, and like funny and like sharp. And there's so many of them. Like how, how are you remembering all this?

4 (8m 52s):
That's why people call me the Jay-Z of comedy. Is that word? You've heard that before. You've never heard a, a person Not say that about me. I haven't heard it yet, but I believe it's coming down. The pi It hasn't gotten here yet. You know, there's a pool hall in LA by the way. Really?

3 (9m 2s):
There's almost none when I left.

4 (9m 4s):
There's one in KTown that apparently that you go there.

3 (9m 6s):
Okay, that makes sense. A lot of Koreans play pool. Yeah,

4 (9m 8s):
You walk in. Yeah. And they're, and you walk into one of them if you're white and they're like, Uhuh. Mm. And you're like, what? I wanna play pool. They're like, Uhuh next, next two doors down. They're allowed to, no, I'll play here. They're like, Uhuh. Well, they do whatever they want. They their own rules. And then you walk down and that's where the white people are playing pool. but it's the same owner. Oh, that's

3 (9m 27s):
Hilarious. But by the way, you cannot complain. No one will listen. Yeah. Nobody, white guy. You can't get into a pool hall. You call the cops and they cops have a pool hall. Four white guys like Right. Shut the fuck up, dude. There's robbery's going on. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got no time for you. People are shooting people.

4 (9m 40s):
The L lap. D why whining? I was rejected access to a Korean pool hall. It feels very wrong.

3 (9m 46s):
Yes. I want, I want someone to intervene immediately. This was horrible. I am a white male.

4 (9m 52s):
Like maybe if you work your way up through the pool tables in the white one, then they'll, they'll, they'll adopt you into the Korean one. It's playing

3 (9m 58s):
Them. If they know you, maybe they're probably gambling. That's probably what a lot of

4 (10m 1s):
It is. I would have. Oh, right. The word

3 (10m 3s):
Pool comes from pooling money together. Really? The, the game is called pocket billiards. It's not called pool.

4 (10m 9s):
That's really interesting. So it was just a gambling game for the people that had returned from

3 (10m 13s):
No, it was a game. Right? Yeah. But with, I think all games eventually evolve into gambling.

4 (10m 19s):
Right.

3 (10m 20s):
People gamble on basketball all the time. People gamble on fights all the time. Like fighters will gamble against their opponents. People gamble. They like to gamble. It makes things more exciting because now there's money on the line as well as pride and everything else.

4 (10m 35s):
Are you allowed to bet on fights?

3 (10m 37s):
I am not.

4 (10m 37s):
You are not allowed to be.

3 (10m 38s):
I'm not allowed to. Now

4 (10m 40s):
When did that happen? It's

3 (10m 41s):
A recent rule that came about because apparently there is an allegation that one of the UFC trainers and I wanna be real clear about this. 'cause I actually like this guy a lot. and I think he's a super talented trainer. and I do not know if this is true. So I won't even say his name. But one of these trainers was apparently aware of injuries and then informing of like a group of people online who are betting. So they're saying like, Hey, this guy's got something wrong with him. Right. He's not gonna win this fight. And then all the money would go on the opponent and then they would rake it in. And this happened allegedly on fighters that he was training or people that he knew.

3 (11m 22s):
And it's

4 (11m 22s):
Like insider stock trading.

3 (11m 24s):
It's similar. Yeah. It's fishy also because it gives the possibility that fights or dives, you know it when a, when a, a coach is betting against their fighter, like, or giving other people information against their fighter. If that happened, don don't know if happened. Again, I just wanna real clear it's allegedly if that's the case that's kind of like you're, it's it's next door neighbor to a dive. And that is the last fucking thing we want in mixed martial arts is fixed fights. Right. Right. Which is weird because it's owned by the same people that own WWE e now. Right. but it is kind of crazy. They've

4 (11m 59s):
Had a good week. It's

3 (11m 60s):
A

4 (11m 60s):
Great week. Yeah. It's a good week to be in the wwe.

3 (12m 2s):
Yo dude that Vince McMahon is wild. That boy's out there. I it,

4 (12m 7s):
I read this. I couldn't get through the text messages. Cool. I started trying to read 'em and I was like, I don't want to read. This is like poison.

3 (12m 14s):
But the thing is, when I see that dude with his shirt off, he's 80 years old. He's got a chain around his neck. What are you shocking me with this information?

4 (12m 22s):
Yeah, yeah,

3 (12m 22s):
Yeah. Don't you think it takes a lot to get that guy going? No, it's,

4 (12m 26s):
You're saying he needed to send all those text messages to get aroused at that day. I think he

3 (12m 29s):
Probably needs a lot just for stimulation. Listen, he's a billionaire, right? He's been running pro wrestling for fucking decades. He's world famous. CEO of this giant fucking multinational company, pro wrestling company. He's also in pro wrestling. Right. He gets out there and competes. He does it. Yeah. I

4 (12m 48s):
Guess.

3 (12m 48s):
Or, you know, performs, I should say

4 (12m 50s):
At a certain point, I guess if you're that through the looking glass of reality, like you become a heel in, in life. Life is heel and, and the, and everything is a match. Yeah.

3 (12m 58s):
If you're gonna be really successful at putting together pro wrestling, probably be pro wrestling, All day long,

4 (13m 4s):
You gotta stick with it. Yeah.

3 (13m 5s):
Like stay in it all fucking day long. Don't go read Nietzsche at the end of the day. Don't be reading Carl Young's thoughts on flying saucers. Get the fuck outta here. Drink beer and go, fuck. Yeah. That's what you should be doing. You're on the road. I want you to Rick flare it until the fucking wheels come off. They

4 (13m 23s):
Do come off too, but

3 (13m 24s):
Well, yeah. On almost all of 'em. Yeah. The only one who hasn't is the rock. Right. The rock is in remarkably great condition. Obviously huge and massive in muscles and everything. But Mobil, he can do things like we worked out together.

4 (13m 37s):
That's interesting. I wonder 'cause he's, he also seems like kind of the most, he's one of those dudes who's got, he like what you're talking about Genius level. He could have been anything. Sure. Yeah. He's kind of got one of those mega IQs feeling like,

3 (13m 49s):
Well he is got a mega discipline is what he has. Right. And if you applied that to intellectual endeavors, he would be a mega Genius. It's like it, I think they're, we wanna think that they're not connected, but I think they are. and I think like a Michael Jordan or someone who gets that good at basketball could get that good at anything. It's just they don't apply themselves in that area. 'cause that's, I think it's just exceptional people.

4 (14m 12s):
Well, you know, there's that weird idea and I, apparently this is proven that the difference between a world championship runner and the number five is like less than a second their speed. Mm. Right. I mean the, the difference between the Olympian and, and the guy that doesn't make the podium is so it's just infinitesimally small. Mm. And then the, the reason that the person wins is because they believe they, it, it's not even a physiological thing. It's like a confidence thing. And you see

3 (14m 39s):
That unless you're running against Ussein Bolt. Right.

4 (14m 41s):
We'll take him out. We'll him

3 (14m 42s):
Out. Fuck what you believe. Because then there's genetics. Genetics are real too.

4 (14m 46s):
Well genetics is probably, I would guess is what gets you to the, to the stage in the first place. It gets you on the track. It

3 (14m 51s):
Exists intellectually too. There's, there's boundaries. I have limitations. I have like certain limitations intellectually. Right. At a certain level I just check out. Sure. I'm not gonna be, but I am friends with some insanely brilliant people that scare the shit outta you. Like if I talk to Eric Weinstein, I'm like, what are we even the same thing? Right? Like, what are we? Right. We're not the we're we're barely the same thing.

4 (15m 14s):
You know, when you really see that kind of Genius is when they start talking to you in a way you'll understand, you go, oh, so you wrote that book that I can't even comprehend, but you're also conversationally able to help

3 (15m 23s):
Me. Eric doesn't even try. He doesn't try with that. He leaves

4 (15m 25s):
Me behind. He

3 (15m 25s):
Does. Sometimes I try to tell him like, you gotta help us out here. But, but it's just 'cause that's how he thinks and that's how he communicates. It's like if like, if you're gonna talk about comedy to someone who doesn't do comedy, you'd probably just start talking like a comic. Right. Like, this is what we do. Right. This is how I do it. I'm not gonna like, I can't hold your hand too long. You're 40 years old. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, just explain how I do it. Yeah. Either get it or you don't get it. But

4 (15m 46s):
I well, I would on that pool thing though. Yeah. The, that universe when you walked into that pool hall and saw like, bam, this is another universe. Yeah. To me like that is, that's the experience of my life over and over again. That is what the book is about is these, like these momentary portals into another universe, you know? Mm. Where somebody taps you on the shoulder and goes like, walk over here. Oh, it's like Luke Skywalker. Right, right, right. Like he's this weak, powerless kid on danene or whatever. And, and then all of a sudden nobody want kenobi's. It goes, look, there's a whole other universe here. Will

3 (16m 19s):
You show everybody your shoes? 'cause I think those are Luke Skywalker shoes. That's what I was gonna say.

4 (16m 23s):
This is

3 (16m 24s):
Bullying Joe. I couldn't remember. I love them. I couldn't remember the name of the planet though when you said tanto.

4 (16m 30s):
Oh, you think these are danen shoes? Yeah. Yeah. For sure. These are cool. Joe came in and almost liked them. I felt pretty good about

3 (16m 36s):
That. I, they're unusual. I love that you wear 'em. They look great with white slacks. Or tan slacks. Those whiter

4 (16m 42s):
Tans. This is so close to a compliment.

3 (16m 44s):
It's, it is a compliment. You, you have a style. You have a certain style.

4 (16m 48s):
They're the most comfortable chain

3 (16m 49s):
Out too. Look at you, Robin.

4 (16m 50s):
Chain out. Yeah. Chain out. Always chain out. All day. If I'm coming to, if I'm coming to Joe Rogan chain out, I'm taking the chain out. Let's go. Yeah. Let's freaking go. Let's

3 (16m 57s):
Fucking go.

4 (16m 57s):
I say, let's freaking go for the kids. Yeah.

3 (16m 59s):
Let's freaking go. Let's

4 (17m 1s):
Freaking go

3 (17m 1s):
Guys. What's less offensive, frigging or freaking Like if you're around a an old lady.

4 (17m 6s):
I think freaking is more fun for an older lady.

3 (17m 9s):
Right. It's not offensive at all. Because

4 (17m 10s):
She's an old freak herself.

3 (17m 12s):
Maybe

4 (17m 12s):
She might just be an old freak

3 (17m 13s):
Herself. She might be an old prude that hung in there. I've never

4 (17m 15s):
Understood the concept of censoring herself for an older person. They've they've heard respect. They've heard the thing.

3 (17m 22s):
Right. But the idea is that

4 (17m 23s):
Every, they shot Nazis.

3 (17m 24s):
That is true. But that every generation gets more and more desensitized to bad words.

4 (17m 30s):
Oh yeah. That's fair.

3 (17m 31s):
I Which is 100% true.

4 (17m 32s):
I yeah, I can see that

3 (17m 32s):
For sure. Like, my kids say things that I would've never said in front of my parents.

4 (17m 36s):
Oh, in front of you. Yeah. But you're also, you're, you also, so you've created a persona where swearing is, it'd be funny for you to be uptight about swearing. It

3 (17m 43s):
Is funny. and

4 (17m 44s):
I bet you did though when you had little kids, right?

3 (17m 46s):
No, I never was. No. My wife was a little bit, but not bad. And I was like, listen, we have to just tell them that. You can't say these words in front of other people, but they're just words. Right. But the only thing, word words are a sound you make. So I know what you're thinking. Right. It's all it is. And to make words good or bad is fucking stupid. But there's a lot of things you're gonna learn that are stupid in the world. But here's the rules. But in the, around the house, they'll use them for funny. And it's hilarious. It's like you raising comics. 'cause we all talk like comics. They'll talk shit. You know? And it's fun.

4 (18m 17s):
Totally. I had a conversation with my daughter the other day. I go, I sat her down. I go, okay, honey, you're funny. And with great power comes great responsibility. I go, you're gonna have to figure out how to, how to like where the line is. Yes. Because people who are funny, take it from me. Yes. Walk through the world offending people because they think they're being funny and they've gone like a step too far in personal interactions. Yes. And go, that's your job now.

3 (18m 38s):
And it's also like when you're doing that, like people have to understand like why could, why would you have said that? Like, I didn't know I was gonna say it while I was saying it completely. Like, there is a thing that you're doing when you're creating, specifically when you're adlibbing, where you, if you're on stage, you're ad-libbing. You are literally, like, you've got these missiles that are coming into silos and you're like, launch it. Yeah. Launch it, launch it. Like you're not even looking at the missile. It's like your mind says, maybe you can connect that to this go. And sometimes it's just like, it's a

4 (19m 11s):
Dud sometimes. Oh. And sometimes you're up on stage and you go, oh, I've, oh, that was the end. Yeah. I wish that that missile, the end, that missile destroyed.

3 (19m 18s):
I shot myself,

4 (19m 19s):
Destroyed the village and everybody in it. I've definitely had that experience. But yeah, there was a moment on my, on my I, my Crowdwork album crowd surfing, where I heard myself when I was listening back to it, I was riffing one riff and in that riff switched back and did the better riff. Like that's a pretty Speaking of like the way the brain works. Yeah. Like that. It's like a hone That's a honed brain that comics have

3 (19m 40s):
Well you've got that, you've done that exercise over and over and over and over again. So he gets like super comfortable in that pocket of, of crowd work. Like Big J SSON is amazing at that.

4 (19m 52s):
One of the best. Yeah.

3 (19m 52s):
He's one of the best ever at that. He's just, so Andrew Schultz is as well. They're just so comfortable. There's a fucking hilarious one that Schultz just put out of. He's talking to some guy in, in the audience who brought a date. And the date turns out to be a trans woman. and it just is hilarious but fun, lighthearted, positive. It's really cool. It's very skillfully done. Right. You know, it's a, and it, the whole audience loved it. It was like they loved it. It was, it was great.

4 (20m 23s):
Well, that's how I think of crowd work when it goes really well,

3 (20m 25s):
Everybody's having a good time. Yes.

4 (20m 27s):
It's like a gift. It's like a gift to the crowd. They, because they know in their mind, I will, this moment will not be re this was for me. Right. This was a gift this comic gave me tonight. and it will never exist again. Except in TikTok form. Hopefully it'll go viral a million times forever. Well, that, I always think about that when everybody's blowing up on these crowd work. Clips is like, how many magical moments. But there's something beautiful about this too. How many magical moments you, you offered on stage in the pre-digital kind of u upload everything era where you're just like, it was just momentary. It was just an offering to that moment. Yeah. There's something really beautiful about that.

3 (21m 1s):
I love that. I think that's like, it's important. I think the artificial reality of digital life. It, there's certain people that wanna fucking film everything. They wanna film every conversation they have. Look, I'm here with this. Let's, let's put this on the gram. Will you tag me in this? Like, stop.

4 (21m 22s):
It's, it's a wild experience. You gotta live. I saw a guy the other day. His thing is he goes to re fine dining restaurants and screams at the top of his lungs. Oh, that's his, that's his career.

3 (21m 31s):
Oh my God. That's what did you see the guy that got arrested that was just dumping shit on people?

4 (21m 37s):
Now that I respect,

3 (21m 37s):
He dumped a whole bucket of shit on some guy that was like on a train, just

4 (21m 42s):
Shit

3 (21m 43s):
On down his back. Yeah.

4 (21m 45s):
And then what'd he say? It's a prank. It's like, no, we're past

3 (21m 47s):
That. Yeah. He's a kid. And, and you know, I mean, I think that is crazy. We were talking about it. I, I said, I think it might be bio-terrorism. 'cause there's so like, shit, human shit is like really dangerous. That

4 (21m 57s):
Is definitely biohazard for sure. Yeah.

3 (21m 59s):
But humans are gross. Like our, our fucking gut bacteria. If that gets in a cut, if human shit gets in a cut, you better wash the fuck outta that

4 (22m 8s):
Thing. Talk about going viral.

3 (22m 10s):
What

4 (22m 10s):
Going viral. This joke is landing exactly where I wanted it to. Viruses.

3 (22m 15s):
Yeah. Yeah. Literally.

4 (22m 17s):
Please don't write in.

3 (22m 18s):
That's where plague comes from.

4 (22m 20s):
From

3 (22m 20s):
I mean. That's the early days. It was a lot of, it was like terrible hygiene and terrible sanitation and no running water. So people were just shitting the streets. They were shitting in buckets and throwing out the streets. There's human feces everywhere.

4 (22m 32s):
Do you know why people think perhaps the Jews didn't suffer as much in plague other than conspiracy theories that they started it during the Black plague? Well,

3 (22m 42s):
There was a conspiracy theories way back then that they did it.

4 (22m 45s):
I'm, I'm pretty sure yes. I I don't know where that rumor would've come from.

3 (22m 50s):
So how did they survive it?

4 (22m 51s):
So Jews, when they eat a meal, every single meal with bread always washed their hands. It's a part of the ritual. It's a ritualistic thing. You wash your hands before you eat bread. And and people didn't really do that. 'cause germ theory wasn't, people didn't know about germ theory. They didn't understand their correlation between washing your hands and eating. And so Jews would always wash their hand before every meal. And that is how apparently they, they sidestep some of the, the ravages of the plague.

3 (23m 17s):
Do you think that that a lot of the religious rules like washing your hands, it has to be based on some ancient understanding of where diseases come from. Like think about no pork. Right? Right.

4 (23m 32s):
The trinos thing. Trinos,

3 (23m 33s):
Yeah. Yeah. It's ubiquitous in porks. Right in in porks

4 (23m 37s):
And

3 (23m 37s):
In porks in pigs and pigs and bears. In mountain lions. They all have it. Like, it's like a giant percentage of bears have it. A giant percentage of pigs have especially wild pigs. So that would prevent you from ever getting that. Let's just say no one eat pig the simple way. Don't cook it to 147 degrees. Right. I know what the fuck that means. I don't know when the right way to cook it. It kills people. Right. Let's stop eating that. And then shellfish, same deal. Red tide, all sorts of other bacteria that you

4 (24m 2s):
Get. What about mixing linens and wolves or whatever?

3 (24m 6s):
That's a weird one. But like the, the shellfish one, people die of oysters are just read about someone dying from a raw oyster. It's super rare. I still eat them. Yeah. Which is a really stupid thing to do. You know, like, why kill am I eating oysters if they can fucking, every one out of a million people gets whack by an oyster.

4 (24m 24s):
I didn't, I did not know that. Yeah.

3 (24m 25s):
Some of you could die. Just recently, my kid, I'm rethinking my oyster consumption. I'm like, what

4 (24m 30s):
Am I doing? My kid eat live sea urchin. Whoa. Oh, she's more adventurous eater than I am. Yeah. I love

3 (24m 34s):
It. Yeah.

4 (24m 34s):
I love that. So straight out of the, straight out the carcass. Damn.

3 (24m 36s):
That

4 (24m 37s):
Is adventurous. It's moving a little bit.

3 (24m 38s):
That's my favorite. Sushi man dies after contracting vbro fictious bacteria from fresh oysters in Texas. Right. It's right here. Oh shit.

4 (24m 47s):
Shit. You're going to, no, you're good.

3 (24m 49s):
The consumption of raw oysters at a Texas restaurant led to an untimely death of a relatively healthy relative is a weird word for a dude in his thirties. You know, like, what are we talking about here? Relatively healthy. What are you trying to say? It's

4 (25m 2s):
A lot of editorial from the USA today. Yeah. It was relatively healthy. I wouldn't

3 (25m 5s):
Say the man. Hold on, Jamie. The man contracted a bacterial infection known as vi vol Vol. Vol vol.

4 (25m 16s):
He's my favorite techno.

3 (25m 17s):
It sounds like a good one. Like from like Germany or somewhere that thrives in warm coastal waters. So it's like local bacteria.

4 (25m 26s):
I think you're good though, Joe. If he died and he said it's one every, every, every million oyster. He ate the oyster. It's

3 (25m 33s):
Probably more than one every million. Oh look it, the guy lost his toes.

4 (25m 36s):
Yo. Oh, this is not good. Yo, I do not want fibro Vulcan fucking news.

3 (25m 41s):
Is it a flesh eating bacteria? It's what? Those are weird. You hear about those in the news every now and again. Fresh flesh eating. Ah, it is a fucking flesh eating bacteria. God damnit. I heard you hear about those. don don't

4 (25m 52s):
Want one. No. That's my official stance on this. I heard about a, a kid that ate a slug as a dare. Oh yeah. You read that story

3 (25m 59s):
Can paralyzed in Australia.

4 (26m 0s):
Super brutal. Oh, horrible. And then you start warn I warned my kid, I go, don't eat slugs. But it's like she's gonna do some other terrible thing that I can't think of. Right.

3 (26m 8s):
You never can protect them fully nor should you. That's the unfortunate thing. It's like you gotta They have experienced a certain amount of like, falling down. Right. It's part of the process.

4 (26m 18s):
I just, but I did tell her don't eat slugs.

3 (26m 19s):
Don't eat slugs.

4 (26m 20s):
The other day we were on the beach though, and my neighbor had a lobster trap out and, and he took out his lobster trap and he was undoing it. And there was this undulating piece of seaweed. I go, I think there's something alive in there. And we shook it off and it was a full giant octopus. Ooh. It was the coolest. And my kid reached in and grabbed the octopus like, just like it was her friend. She was like, baby octopus my friend. And then

3 (26m 43s):
They will bite the fuck out

4 (26m 44s):
Of you. That's what we found out. Every octopus is venom. Oh no. Oh, she didn't get bit. Every octopus is venomous and not most of 'em can't kill you, but every one of them has a beak that will fuck you

3 (26m 53s):
Up. Yeah. They're all

4 (26m 54s):
Beak. But he was very cool

3 (26m 55s):
About, do you know how they kill them when they catch 'em? No. They bite their heads. Who?

4 (26m 59s):
Who? They

3 (26m 60s):
Fishermen. They

4 (27m 1s):
Physically bite

3 (27m 2s):
Fish. Fishermen physically bite their head like right where the brainstem is and then they change color. Whoa. And that's how you know they're dead. Yeah.

4 (27m 9s):
They they become pink.

3 (27m 10s):
They come white. Whoa. Yeah. They just, when you see an octopus in the wild, have you ever seen how well they can camouflage themselves? Yeah. Totally. Fucking insane. Yeah. It's crazy texture. Everything. They can look exactly like whatever the fuck they're near, whether it's coral or rubble on the ground, they, they literally blend in. It's, it's insane. It's amazing. But when you bite 'em, all that shit goes away. Do

4 (27m 32s):
You like meat? Yes. Do you have any com like weird fe feelings about like a, an an animal at a certain level of intelligence? Yes. Like octopus to me. I

3 (27m 41s):
Don't wanna eat a monkey. Right.

4 (27m 42s):
Well, a monkey is. Yeah. That's very intense. Yeah.

3 (27m 44s):
Yeah. That see, watch. Oh shit, he's gonna bite the octopus. He, so this guy caught this octopus and he is gonna bite it, see where he bites it. And then the thing immediately goes, whoa. He bites it like right where the eyeballs are and then it immediately dies. This

4 (27m 57s):
Is the system by which you get octopus at a restaurant. It is just some guy biting. I think so. Brainstem of an octopus.

3 (28m 3s):
I do not know. But I think this is just individuals that are sport fishing. They're doing it for food. They're just getting that oc octopus are delicious.

4 (28m 10s):
They're smart though,

3 (28m 11s):
Aren't they? They're fucking too smart for me. Yeah. It bothers me. I feel like

4 (28m 13s):
You're eating an alien. I

3 (28m 14s):
Feel like I might stop eating octopus. There's animals that are really, pigs are really fucking smart.

4 (28m 20s):
Right. Pigs are smart's.

3 (28m 21s):
They're really smart.

4 (28m 22s):
You're right. That's where it starts to get weird because

3 (28m 24s):
Gets weird. Or crows.

4 (28m 25s):
Crows will bring you gifts. Crows are super smart and they'll warn you that the cops are coming.

3 (28m 29s):
There's this guy, he found this crow. It was in the water. Might have been a guy, might have been a woman, I'm not sure. But anyway, there was a, some TikTok video about it. And this person found this crow picked it up with a paddle. It was in the water like drowning, put it in the boat and then took it home and nursed it back to health. And then the, the crow would just hang out with her.

4 (28m 50s):
They were like oil. They

3 (28m 51s):
Were petting the crow with a brush. And she put the brush back on the shelf. Then the crow flew over the shelf, grabbed the brush, brought it back and said, nah, nah, keep petting me. There's

4 (29m 0s):
A really,

3 (29m 1s):
It's really cool.

4 (29m 2s):
There's like a whole mechanism on how to get the crow to like you too. Really? You start doing a certain, I think it's leaving it gifts. And then it will go, oh, this person gives gifts. Then it will start bringing you gifts. And then if you keep going, it will start attacking your enemies. Yes. Your neighbors will come over and be like, what's up Joe? And then the crow will come down and attack.

3 (29m 21s):
Yeah. This guy Dan Flores, who's on the podcast before, had essentially trained a crow by leaving it food every day. And he would go on a walk with his dog and the crow would hang out with him.

4 (29m 31s):
Would it fly? It would fly next to him or, oh yeah.

3 (29m 33s):
Fly's cool right next to him and hang out with him. Plop down and it would, you know, go looking for him. Like liked him.

4 (29m 38s):
I had a friend who was a falconer. Do you know about these guys? I'm sure you do. Do you know how they catch 'em? It's crazy. No.

3 (29m 44s):
Well,

4 (29m 44s):
Basically they catch 'em. They catch 'em in the wild. They like leave some, some food out and they catch 'em. They with a trap in the wild. But then they take them home. This blew my mind. They take them home and they put them in a dark room for like, multiple days. Whoa. And they walk into the dark room with one of those weird gauntlets or whatever that are made by the same people that make my boots. And they have just meat on their hand. And they just sit there for hours in a dark room with a, with a, an owl or a hawk or whatever. And over the course of a week, the, the, the, the bird bird will get closer and closer and then start nibbling and then start eating. And at that point it's yours and now it's, now it's your falcon. Whoa.

4 (30m 24s):
Isn't that crazy?

3 (30m 25s):
So it just rewires their brain. Yeah.

4 (30m 27s):
To be like, this guy's got the food. So when, so now when he lets me go to hunt for the rat or whatever, I'll come back to the gauntlet. Look at this crazy trap. They used

3 (30m 36s):
To get 'em. Huh?

4 (30m 38s):
And every falcon that a falconer has is caught, captured in the wild. Really? They're not like bread or whatever. They, they just capture 'em. And then they do this weird thing where they train them and then they let them go after a few years of service.

3 (30m 50s):
When I was in Scotland, there was this lady who was, she trained a variety of birds, but she trained owls and falcons. And so she had a falcon there. And she said, the problem with the falcon is when they let it go, it just fucks things up. It just fly. It just finds another bird and kills it. Like she, like, every time she lets it go finds something and kills

4 (31m 7s):
It. It's just like an it, it's violent. Oh,

3 (31m 10s):
It's the worst. It's a monster. Right. It's just a killing machine. It doesn't matter if it's hungry or not. It's, it's flying around looking to fuck things up. She said the owl is the second dumbest bird in the wild.

4 (31m 21s):
Really?

3 (31m 22s):
Yeah. Isn't that crazy? How

4 (31m 23s):
Did they get the wise thing?

3 (31m 24s):
They, someone is got a good PR agent and they just, they got ahead of it.

4 (31m 30s):
Owl baby. It's me.

3 (31m 31s):
Owls are dumb. She said owls are dumb. She said the really smart ones are like, like falcons are very smart. Crows are the smartest. But the only thing dumber than an owl is emus. Emus are dumber.

4 (31m 45s):
They're so big. You'd think that they would have big brains. They

3 (31m 48s):
Don't have to be right. They're just shut d gimme the food. Right, right. They're so big.

4 (31m 53s):
They, they are freaks. I would say Freaks of nature. They shouldn't exist. The imu. Have you eaten imu?

3 (31m 59s):
No. Have you?

4 (32m 0s):
No. But I think people do.

3 (32m 1s):
People eat it. They eat ostrich. I've had ostrich. Isn't it fud? Rutgers.

4 (32m 4s):
At fud. Rutgers. They have ostrich fud.

3 (32m 6s):
Rutgers used to serve an ostrich burger. It was really good. It was good. That was fantastic.

4 (32m 10s):
What's the best game?

3 (32m 12s):
I think elk. I think elk is the most delicious. That's my favorite. Yes. But there's a lot of really good ones. Axis deer, which are very prevalent here in Texas. They're from India. They're really delicious. Yeah. But bison bison's very delicious. But they're very lean. Like if you're going to eat just those things, you gotta make sure you get a a, an adequate amount of fats along with them. You

4 (32m 35s):
Eat moose?

3 (32m 35s):
I eat moose. Yeah.

4 (32m 36s):
What's up with moose? Good Moose

3 (32m 37s):
Is delicious. Yeah. Moose is delicious.

4 (32m 39s):
Seems greasy.

3 (32m 40s):
No, not at all. No, not even a little. What's the worst game? They're very lean. You get a a funky pig. You get a wild pig.

4 (32m 49s):
That's, I've met one of those in my life.

3 (32m 50s):
I shot a wild pig that was kind of funky. A javelina. That one was odd. I ate a javelina. You feel

4 (32m 57s):
When you kill an animal, do you feel bad?

3 (33m 0s):
I don't feel good. I feel good that it's successful. But you don't feel good when you look down at the dead animal. don don't,

4 (33m 7s):
It's like guilty. Guilty thrill kind of.

3 (33m 9s):
Well you're thankful. Right?

4 (33m 11s):
Right.

3 (33m 11s):
You're thankful that I mean this is, it's a very, it's a very different connection with food when you've been there and harvest it. And when you actually go into the wild. So it's one thing if you have a farm and you raise a cow and you kill the cow and you eat the cow, you have a connection with that food that's very different than me who just goes to a supermarket and buys a stick. Right. It's another level of that. When you're going into the woods with a bow and arrow and you're climbing mountains and you're going eight, 10 miles a day and

4 (33m 43s):
You, it's like you swoop into their universe a hundred percent. So if you walk through the portal into their universe and just blip them out of it. and I'm

3 (33m 49s):
Not the only one there. And that's when it gets scary. You mean

4 (33m 52s):
There's other

3 (33m 52s):
Predators?

4 (33m 52s):
I mean mountain lions. Right,

3 (33m 53s):
Right. You know, you meet bears out there, there's there's real shit out there. Right. That is capable of killing a deer with its face.

4 (34m 2s):
Right. and it and a and a hunter from behind. Yes.

3 (34m 4s):
Right. And a hunter from behind and a stealthy hunter that you're not gonna hear until it's too late.

4 (34m 9s):
Have you ever felt that?

3 (34m 10s):
I've seen them. I've never been stalked by one. The biggest one I ever saw was actually inside of a car I saw inside like two years ago. I was with my friend Colton and he goes, look at the cat. He stops the truck and it's at dusk. Like right when the sunlight's going down and I see these glowing eyes under a tree. And we're about 30 yards away from it and I have binoculars. So I put up my binoculars to look at it up close. It was fucking terrifying.

4 (34m 34s):
Mountain lion.

3 (34m 35s):
Huge one. Yeah. A huge male. Like 170 plus pounds. Just massive muscles. The muscles were so impressive. Like it forearms were huge.

4 (34m 45s):
They're so scary because they don't attack you until you're not looking too. You'll never know. They'll just be on top of you. Yeah. You think you could fight one off? No, I'd be done for you. Would you got muscles you could like?

3 (34m 55s):
Nope. Nope.

4 (34m 55s):
You scream and yell. Dude,

3 (34m 56s):
I could barely fight off a house. Cat. A regular house cat will probably fuck me up if it's motivated.

4 (35m 2s):
Dude, I got a, I got a German Shepherd. Those

3 (35m 4s):
Are great dogs.

4 (35m 6s):
Well, do you need

3 (35m 6s):
A lot of

4 (35m 7s):
Work though? Listen, I, I was like, I dunno if you've noticed the last few years things have gotten a little bit weird and I was like, okay, I'm on the road a lot. I know what I'll do. I'll get a German Shepherd and it'll protect my family. But then I entered into a negotiation with Natasha 'cause she didn't want like a, a hardcore one. So what we ended up getting was this giant fucking bitch. I mean, it's just such a little like clown. It's like the DoorDash people come and they, they're wearing a ski mask. It'll be like, well ante right this way. Come on in like it. Oh no. So I have the, I have all of the work of the German Shepherd with none of the none of the event.

3 (35m 40s):
Is it a male or

4 (35m 40s):
A female? It's a male. Is it

3 (35m 42s):
Fixed? Yes. There

4 (35m 43s):
You go. That's my problem. Yeah,

3 (35m 44s):
That's that's a big part of it. Yeah. Damn don don't

4 (35m 46s):
Those balls. I didn't do it.

3 (35m 48s):
Especially when they're young. If you get 'em real young and they're fixed. I had a dog that was fixed when he was a baby. Somehow or another. Like we got 'em. I got 'em from someone else. And when I got him, I was like, he's already fixed. He's so young. It was too young. and it, he fucked. He was kind of fucked it fucked his development up. He had no testosterone as he was growing. Which is just not good for a male dog. There's a lot of arguments that it's, look, it's irresponsible to let your dog have a bunch of puppies. And then, you know, so if you're letting your dog out and your dog is fucking other dogs and getting them pregnant and getting pu yeah that's irresponsible. But my dog's not fixed and he doesn't go out if he interacts with dogs. It's my friend's dogs.

3 (36m 28s):
You know, we play in the yard. I take it for walks. He doesn't get loose to go fuck a dog. It's not irresponsible.

4 (36m 34s):
Does he ever get the fuck,

3 (36m 35s):
He's never fucked.

4 (36m 36s):
Aw, no. That's cruel. In a different way. I'm

3 (36m 38s):
Afraid he would find out about it and then he would never shut

4 (36m 41s):
The fuck up.

3 (36m 42s):
Like, dad, where's the girl? Where's the bitches? Literally,

4 (36m 45s):
I don't know if you know, this has been great. Do you know about this sex stuff? This

3 (36m 48s):
Is my favorite thing and Don don't even know about it until now. And I'm seven. That's

4 (36m 52s):
Funny. That's a different kind of meanness though. You let it keep the balls but you keep it from ever having sex. Well

3 (36m 57s):
Does he They can't not come. And if they're having sex, the girl can get pregnant. Right.

4 (37m 3s):
Right.

3 (37m 3s):
It's not like humans where it's funsies. Right. You know, you, there's no funsies in the animal world. Yeah. That's why deer only have sex once a year.

4 (37m 11s):
We need to. Is that true?

3 (37m 13s):
Yeah. Well they have multiple times in this one time period in a year. But it's called the rut.

4 (37m 18s):
We should make a dog condom.

3 (37m 20s):
It's not gonna work.

4 (37m 21s):
No. We put it on. If you love your dog and you want it to get laid, slip it on. Well you

3 (37m 25s):
Give your dog birth control, I guess. Really? Yeah. But that would probably fuck the female dog up. It fucks women up. Right.

4 (37m 31s):
Birth

3 (37m 32s):
Control's terrible for women. They've been telling women to take birth control forever. Birth control does all sorts of wacky things to the way you perceive people. It's there. I I have a friend and his daughter died. She had a stroke 'cause she had a blood clot that is apparently one of the side effects of smoking cigarettes and taking birth control. It's possible to have that happen. And she died that way and she was like 17 years old. It's like, it's this tricky medication. I mean it's, it's great that women got their liberation sexually and that every time you had sex wasn't like you're gonna have a baby that you could choose Right. When to do it. When not to do it. But

4 (38m 9s):
Because that'll affect your perception up too, having a kid at 16.

3 (38m 12s):
100%. Yeah. Yeah. Listen, there's, there's arguments for both sides of it. And they put some girls on birth control for their acne to control acne. I've

4 (38m 21s):
Heard about that. Yeah.

3 (38m 22s):
So it's like, it's not saying that birth control is entirely bad, but if you're a woman and, and you have to take this thing in order to not get pregnant and the guy doesn't have to do shit. You know, like the guy, like if a guy had to take, if a birth control pill was invented for a guy and I think they did come up with one, but it radically lowers your testosterone.

4 (38m 42s):
It'll be like my dog. Yeah. It'll just be like a really sweet little bitch. Welcoming power. Yeah.

3 (38m 46s):
It probably kills your sperm cells. It's probably the only way it would work. Yeah. So the way to kill your sperm cells would be either to ramp up your endogenous testosterone to where your body doesn't produce testosterone anymore. So you don't produce sperm cells. Or you could kill it, kill the sperm cells, kill, kill the testosterone and kill everything. They turn you into just a feeble version of yourself.

4 (39m 12s):
Well that's why. Tired

3 (39m 13s):
All the time.

4 (39m 14s):
That's what I came on this podcast to talk about is mandated vasectomies for teenagers. And the teenage boys and I think this will go over really well.

3 (39m 21s):
Yeah. As long as you can reverse it

4 (39m 23s):
Isn't Are we the ones that can be reversed or Yeah,

3 (39m 26s):
We could be reversed.

4 (39m 26s):
We're good women, not women, not obviously

3 (39m 28s):
Women get their es removed. Right. With a a dude. They can reverse it but it's not a hundred percent. Right. Right. You know, they might have to do it a couple of times to make it stick.

4 (39m 38s):
People are getting into that now. Vasectomies are are having a moment right now.

3 (39m 42s):
Ari got one of them. Is

4 (39m 43s):
That right? Yep. Okay. I mean good for I get that. Yeah. If they're gonna be single and, and You don't want kids, like why, why not?

3 (39m 48s):
I think Stan Hope did it too. Yeah.

4 (39m 50s):
That's like a psychic permanent condom. Yeah. And and with no condoms.

3 (39m 55s):
Yeah. And then you don't, if you're, you know, you have a wife, she doesn't wor worry about birth control anymore. Yeah.

4 (39m 60s):
Yeah. IIII would not that that would terrify me. Yeah.

3 (40m 3s):
It's a tricky operation. It's a dick operation time. Me operating on your nether regions and you're like, what, what

4 (40m 12s):
I mean? It does sound like a terrifying proposition. They under

3 (40m 14s):
Put you under and operate on your

4 (40m 15s):
Balls and then you wake up and they've, they've castrated you and you go wake up. Things went a little bit wrong.

3 (40m 19s):
Yeah. It went sideways.

4 (40m 21s):
Unfortunately you don't have balls. The

3 (40m 23s):
The, the doctor went, had a psychotic break and just started chopping.

4 (40m 27s):
Well you know about that story of the guy who amputated the wrong limb. Oh yeah. Because apparently they write in Sharpie on your limb like this one. Oh God. Damnit this one off. Oh. And then he did the wrong one. Jesus Christ. It's funny, you know, you remember that? It's like, it's just a person up there.

3 (40m 44s):
I know a guy whose wife had the wrong kidney removed.

4 (40m 48s):
Oh, that's crazy. Yeah. That's death. That's a death sentence.

3 (40m 51s):
Yeah. I don't, it's just like, what the fuck did you just do? And the doctor did not wanna admit fault. It's so the whole story's so crazy Was the,

4 (40m 60s):
The kidney that

3 (41m 1s):
Wanna apologize. Oh,

4 (41m 3s):
That's crazy.

3 (41m 3s):
Yeah. Kidney remains was fucked.

4 (41m 5s):
It was a bad kidney Of course.

3 (41m 6s):
Yeah. That was one they were supposed to take out. They took out the good one.

4 (41m 9s):
Would you ever donate a kidney? Yeah.

3 (41m 11s):
Yeah. I would just save someone's life. Yeah. I know people that have done it.

4 (41m 14s):
Yeah. That sounds really intense. I would be,

3 (41m 16s):
Apparently you can survive on one kidney. The this, the liver's the craziest one. We were just talking about that the other day. If you donate half your liver to me, if you, you and I have the same blood type within six to eight weeks, your liver will have returned to full size. And my liver that you donated that you gave me will be full size as well.

4 (41m 34s):
It feels like they should, they could cure liver cancer by just doing elective half a liver in a lab growth. Mm. And then we just

3 (41m 42s):
Well they're gonna eventually be able to do that. I would imagine they're, they, they're already looking into some sort of reconstruction of organs. Like to be able to create a com completely new heart. It's made of your own tissue so that your body doesn't reject it. Yeah. You know, 'cause your body rejects other people's tissue. So if you gave me a heart, I would've to take these crazy medication to make sure that my body didn't reject that heart.

4 (42m 6s):
Have you heard that? There's that documentary about that guy that was putting artificial traches in people. Oh, this is good or bad. It's horrifying. It was this like Genius doctor that was putting in these plastic. He had this this like breakthrough that you could just replace a trachea with a plastic tracheal tube and bathe it in stem cells and it would eventually, like don don't know what like meld into your body's DNA tissue and just become a part of your body. But he was making it up. Oh god. It did not, did not ever, it did not work one time. Oh no.

3 (42m 37s):
But

4 (42m 38s):
He was just like flying around the world this like medical like master. They were going this Genius the Genius of our time winning like Nobel prizes and stuff and just people were dying left and right. Oh. Because they were just putting a fucking tube into people's throat instead of a trachea. Oh

3 (42m 52s):
My god. Oh my God. How many did he do before they got him?

4 (42m 56s):
It was like a half a dozen or something like that. Yeah. It was really nice.

3 (42m 59s):
So he was just an insane person

4 (43m 1s):
In this weird way. I mean it's kinda what we were talking about earlier. He was a Genius but he was like a mad, he'd become a mad Genius where he was. He just

3 (43m 8s):
Blew a fuse.

4 (43m 8s):
He blew a fuse. Yeah. And he thought, I have an idea. There's no way my idea won't work if I just, oh my gosh. If I just do it enough times. Oh yeah. Oh my gosh. Ma Rainey. And simultaneously he was hustling a woman like he was pretending to be married to, to a journalist in America. And then he was already married in Italy, so he was like kind of had two different madman thing going on at once.

3 (43m 31s):
He's a wild dude. Yeah. Swedish appealed court, convicted Macare on Wednesday and sentenced him to two and a half years in prison. That's it.

4 (43m 40s):
That's pretty crazy. Yeah. Sweden, once there's a wall up where you're a medical professional, I guess there is a little bit of an arm's leg. I mean These people did know they were doing an experimental surgery and that they could die, I guess. But they didn't know that it definitely wouldn't work.

3 (43m 54s):
But they obviously decided that he did something wrong. They put him in jail for two and a half years.

4 (43m 59s):
Yeah. This guy was a wild one.

3 (44m 1s):
Jesus Christ

4 (44m 2s):
Compulsive liar. Spinning wild stories and manipulating a woman who became his fiance.

3 (44m 7s):
The appeal court ruled that two of the three patients who died did not require emergency intervention. Oh my god.

4 (44m 12s):
That was the part I forgot.

3 (44m 14s):
Oh my god.

4 (44m 14s):
It kept fail. This is the most fucked up part, Joe. It kept failing on sick people that needed new tracheas. So he was like, what I need to do is find a relatively healthy person that has a tracheal issue, like a collapsed trachea or something where they're still like walking through the world with relative health like the oyster guy. And I'll put it in them and that will prove that the thing works.

3 (44m 36s):
Oh my god. What a psycho. Is that him? There he is. Yeah. That's looks like a psycho. It looks like, like George Clooney ify got really fat and did a lot of opium. What a psycho. Yeah.

4 (44m 48s):
It's

3 (44m 48s):
Crazy to do it on relatively healthy people just to prove that it works.

4 (44m 52s):
And it completely did not. Oh. So he went, he literally went on a, a worldwide quest to find somebody with like a fucked up trachea but that would didn't, wasn't sick and found someone like that and she, it was like cosmetic for her and she's like, I'm tired of talking like this. and I have to have like a scarf on and okay, I'll do it.

3 (45m 8s):
She didn't like the way her trachea looked?

4 (45m 10s):
No, I think she like talked weird and she had issues for sure. Okay. But she but it was not life or death.

3 (45m 16s):
Oh my God.

4 (45m 17s):
Anyway, there's

3 (45m 18s):
Some psychos out there, man. Some of 'em happen to be doctors. Yeah. Just 'cause someone went to medical school doesn't mean they're not crazy. No,

4 (45m 24s):
I, I, I listened to that Doctor Death podcast. Did you ever hear that? No. It's about a guy who was like, he was a neurosurgeon and he was just like, I, it, it wasn't clear if he was like Dr. Mangola, like wanted to kill people, or if he was just like a stupid person that was just like slashing in people's bodies. Like it wasn't clear what he was doing, but it looked like when he would open someone up, he had no idea what he was doing. I mean, he just was like stapling a artery to a bone. He just like, and I

3 (45m 50s):
Just for fun.

4 (45m 51s):
Nobody really knows. But he

3 (45m 52s):
Was a real surgeon.

4 (45m 53s):
He was a real neurosurgeon. And until I heard that podcast, it would've never occurred to me to go to a surgeon and then look him up. I, I'm sure you were savvy enough to do that. I would've just been like, you're a doctor. Right. You must know things. Okay. Open up my brainstem and get in there.

3 (46m 8s):
Yeah. The first time I got surgery, I, I have, I had no idea anything about the doctor's credentials and I don't know anything about him now. Yeah. I don't even remember his name. He put me under and opened me up and drilled holes in my bones and Yeah.

4 (46m 21s):
Now I, I heard that I would, I would always Google, I would, I would go

3 (46m 25s):
Deeper. Yeah. Man, you, you can't be fucking entirely sure that someone's not out of their mind.

4 (46m 29s):
Well, there's certain, there's certain professions like that where you assume their degree is the thing that makes them competent. But you forget that it's just a person. Here's,

3 (46m 38s):
Here's the guy. It says, of the 37 patients dunked, how do you say it? Dunked.

4 (46m 43s):
Oh, dunked. Yeah. David Dutched

3 (46m 45s):
Dunked operated on Dallas over about about two years. 33 were hurt or harmed in the process. 33.

4 (46m 51s):
33

3 (46m 51s):
Outta 37. That is

4 (46m 52s):
A bad record.

3 (46m 53s):
Four people skated clean. Some people woke up paralyzed. Others emerged from anesthesia to permanent pain and nerve damage from nerve damage. Two patients died, one from significant blood loss after the operation, and the other from a stroke caused by a cut. Verbal arter. A vertebral artery. Wow.

4 (47m 12s):
Yeah. He was just slashing. He was in there just like mashing it up. Kind of like preschool stuff.

3 (47m 16s):
Look at this one, one patient, a childhood friend of Dun went in for a spinal operation with someone he trusted and woke up a quadriplegic after the doctor damaged his ver vertebral art artery.

4 (47m 28s):
That was his like, be childhood best friend.

3 (47m 31s):
Oh my God. Turn him into a quadriplegic. Jesus Christ. Yeah. There's psychos out there, man. Is that him? No, that's,

4 (47m 39s):
That's the guy that plays him in the, in the TV show. Show. That's Josh Jackson from, oh, let's get a real photo of this point here. There's

3 (47m 45s):
Another Dr. Death. There was a guy who created execution machines. There was a documentary about him. It's a crazy documentary because at the end he kind of gets hoodwinked into becoming a Holocaust denni.

4 (47m 59s):
Oh, I know about this guy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I keep tabs on all of them. Yeah.

3 (48m 3s):
He wa I think he's gone now, but I think at the end of his life, like he was somehow or another brought to Auschwitz or

4 (48m 15s):
Yes.

3 (48m 15s):
One of the, one of the other concentration camps.

4 (48m 17s):
I remember this guy. Yes.

3 (48m 18s):
And he said that this could not have been, it's

4 (48m 21s):
Impossible that Zelo B could have. Yeah, I saw this documentary. Yeah. Oh, it was Errol Morris film. Yeah, I remember this guy.

3 (48m 29s):
So what was his assertion? He cl claims he was invited to other American prisons, inspected design modifications to electric chairs, possessed no relevant formal training or education, and claims that he was told that those who did possess such qualifications would not provide advice due to their opinions on death penalty, fear of reprisals, or that they were squeamish about the subject. So, so he was, what was he, what was his background? Just could let hear it. So it's, his career continued with other state prisons seeking his advice on execution facilities other than electrocution, such as gas chambers hanging and lethal injection.

3 (49m 12s):
How do you say his name? Lu Luster. Luster initially professed his ignorance of other methods of executions. The auth authorities seeking his advice reminded him that others with more qualifications refuse to help luster claims to have taught himself on these other methods of execution and provided advice that was used by the authorities to improve safety and efficiency. So his fall claimed when Luster claimed to been sought as a witness for the defense for Earnest Zelle during, so one of the Nazis right in Canada for spreading false news by publishing and sending material denying Holocaust overseas.

3 (49m 52s):
Luster was asked by the defense to travel to Poland to visit out so that, no, maybe that guy wasn't a Nazi. Maybe he was like a Holocaust denni Ernst Del. So what is the trial spreading false news? So he's just been accused of spreading false news by publishing and sending material, denying the Holocaust. So he's being tried for that. And Luster was asked by the defense to travel the Poland division Auschwitz to investigate whether there had been operating gas chambers for executions at the camp. So at first examination, luster felt that using poison gas in a building with the internal and external design of the buildings currently on display at the site would've caused the death of everyone in the area outside the buildings, as well as inside.

3 (50m 36s):
The film shows videotaped footage taken in Poland of luster, taking samples of bricks in the buildings to take back the United States forensic science labs to determine whether there was evidence of poison gas in the material. These samples were not identified as to where they came from. Luer states that the laboratories reported that there was not any Trace of any poison gas at any time.

4 (50m 57s):
Right. I re I remember this.

3 (50m 58s):
Yeah. After his conclusions were disproven and negativity, publicity ensued. Luster lost his work as a consultant to American prisons. So his conclusions were disproven, so they must have found gas. Look, there's a lot of evidence that those were gas chambers. Yeah. That's a, that's a crazy thing.

4 (51m 18s):
I think I remember that this, this documentary, because he starts saying these things. He starts, it's very similar to like social media clout. He starts saying these things and everybody starts to, in the Holocaust denial community starts like bigging him up and going like, this is our guy. And he gets more ideological as a result of it.

3 (51m 34s):
Yeah. And this is the, see, he didn't know what the fuck he was talking about. This is what the, this is one of the answers. It says it's all a question of concentration. Once the gas is, is released into the atmosphere, its concentration decreases and is no longer dangerous. Also, HCN dissipates quickly the execution gas chambers in US prisons were also ventilated directly into the atmosphere. So, so it just dissipates. Furthermore, the argument would hold for the extermination chambers. It would hold for the de laing chambers as well, and one would've to conclude that no de laing chambers existed either. So it's just he doesn't understand how it dissipates.

3 (52m 14s):
So there's probably no Trace because there's no Trace left. You know, it's, we're talking about he's doing this 70 years later. I mean

4 (52m 23s):
That's whatever it was I mean. That's, I think that's what the, I I think that's what the documentary was about, was that this guy got quickly got in over his head the minute he said one thing. They were all like, we love you. And he became this kind of figurehead of He became an expert movement expert. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. People saying that they know stuff, which is sort of the disease of our time.

3 (52m 40s):
So that's the other doctor death. They can have a dual of douche bags. I think the guy with the surgeon's gonna win. He seems more evil. I mean the other guy seems to like ego got ahold of him. Or just stupidity. The

4 (52m 50s):
Errol Morro guy. Yeah. Yeah. I mean there. It is a wild thing out there that to think of going under the, under the knife and then waking up and realizing that the, you hear about this. There was a, a, a, a lab, I believe, I can't remember which hospital, where the women were going in for fertility treatment. Yes. And they were not being given Oxycontin. They were being given saline. And they would be under general, they'd be under general. So they couldn't stop it. So they were doing basically surgery, but you were paralyzed because you're under general anesthetic,

3 (53m 20s):
But you feel the pain.

4 (53m 21s):
So you feel the pain the entire time. And they found out why is because there was a drug addict who was in charge of dispensing the, the Oxycontin, who was just like taking it and being like, that's mine. Oh my God. Or it's fentanyl. It was fentanyl.

3 (53m 34s):
Oh my God.

4 (53m 35s):
And she was just like dripping the fentanyl into her bag and taking it home.

3 (53m 38s):
Oh my God. Yeah. Wow. Oh my God. Geez.

4 (53m 47s):
That's a rough, that's a rough one. And then they would come up and they would say,

3 (53m 50s):
Of fucking evil people in this

4 (53m 51s):
World, they would say, oh, I felt so much pain. And they would go, no, no, you're fine. It's like, no, no. I think I just went under general surgery with absolutely no painkiller at all. But I was paralyzed. Oh

3 (54m 2s):
My God.

4 (54m 3s):
Imagine that.

3 (54m 4s):
Imagine that. Well, imagine when they used to do it when you weren't paralyzed.

4 (54m 8s):
Oh. They put a piece of leather in your mouth and just take your limb off. Just saw your

3 (54m 11s):
Leg off.

4 (54m 11s):
Yeah. Dances with wolves style. They would give you Ethel Ethel alcohol. Right.

3 (54m 18s):
They would give you booze. They'd give you whatever the fuck they could give you. Yeah. It's not gonna help. What do you think the garlic and the vampire connection is?

4 (54m 25s):
Garlic and vampires. Yeah.

3 (54m 27s):
I don't know. Where did that one come from? Yeah.

4 (54m 28s):
I'm, I'm not sure.

3 (54m 29s):
Isn't garlic a very potent antibacterial? Like don't they say to take garlic if you have stomach flus? I think that's one of those homeopathic solutions that people say take garlic if you're sick.

4 (54m 44s):
But why? Vampires,

3 (54m 45s):
Maybe vampires are connected to the, the idea of what a vampire is, is not knowing what happens to people when they get sick. Not knowing what happens to people when they get a plague. Blaming it on someone else. Blaming it on someone evil, blaming it on a curse. You know, blaming it on someone who came back from the dead. And why, why does someone have, you know, anemia, right. Why is someone losing all their blood? You know? You could blame that on a vampire.

4 (55m 11s):
Yeah. I that's, I guess if you were extremely ill, it would seem like, but you're still walking through the world, it would seem like you had been possessed on some level.

3 (55m 19s):
Well, I've said that about people that get addicted to drugs. I've met people. Yeah. And they weren't addicted to drugs, and they got addicted to drugs. It's like, oh my God. It's like that person got bit by a vampire.

4 (55m 28s):
Totally. Yeah. I think about that a lot. Not the vampire thing, but about people who, and I was on that road, by the way. That was going to be my life. But people who decided to get high instead of do anything else, like, it's like, my life will just be getting high and that'll be it.

3 (55m 42s):
Yeah. And well, there's certain ones, the ones that get physically addictive, they're terrifying. Yeah. The, the oxys, the cocaine, like that kind of shit where you're physically drawn to it. You need it to get, to get well. The heroin people that need it, they're sick and they need it to get well. That is wild

4 (55m 59s):
Stuff. Meth does this even scarier thing, which is that it, it lowers the, your brain's ability to create its own, what's the word for serotonin? Serotonin. And so meth becomes this like, sort of cyclical trap where you can't actually, it's not just that you wanna get high, your brain can't make you happy without it. Oh God. and it takes like a long time to rewire your brain in that particular way.

3 (56m 23s):
Wow.

4 (56m 24s):
Heroin's the one that everybody overdoses from. And meth is the one that people kind of go mad from slowly because their brains get weirdly atrophied in that way.

3 (56m 32s):
One of my friends from the pool hall was a crack addict, and he would go get crack and then he would have to come down by drinking 40 ounces. Okay. So he would get so fucked up. I I, I would, he was always trying to, I took him a couple times to like bad neighborhoods so he could cop, but then we'd always have to go to a liquor store and he would get like a 40 ounce of

4 (56m 53s):
What?

3 (56m 55s):
Old English, old English. So like that you

4 (56m 56s):
Were a 40 guy.

3 (56m 57s):
Well, I've drank 'em. I'm, it's, they're fucking crazy strong. Like, if you wanna, that's all. Make sure that people n never have any ambition and don't leave,

4 (57m 6s):
Which is probably what they do

3 (57m 8s):
Is exactly what I would do if I was evil.

4 (57m 11s):
I used to my, the way I would choose what alcohol I would drink is like, if a gangster rapper wrapped about it, I would drink it. So Gin and juice, old English, old English St. Ides. That was my, that was my drink of choice. St. I White Mickey's was for white boys. I didn't mess with that. St. Ides for, for the real brothers in the room. Mm. And Carlos Rossi, because E 40 had a, a, a song called Top of the Line Wine, Carlos Rossi. And then that was, and then Mad Dog 2020 and Cisco. Those were the things that I drank. That

3 (57m 38s):
Dog. 2020 is always a popular one. Sure,

4 (57m 40s):
Yeah. For the youth of tomorrow. Yeah.

3 (57m 42s):
Those, they're fucking strong man. And Johnny used to drink 'em. He used to down 'em when he was, when he was like, his eyes was all wild. He would be sweating, you know. But he was also a Genius. He was a guy that could do complex math in his head. Well there are, you could, you could say to him, you know, like, just throw a bunch of numbers. Four, you could have a calculator there. 400 divided by six minus 10 plus 500, you know, minus you could keep going. Yeah. And he'd go 4, 6, 2.

4 (58m 8s):
It's crazy. It was weird. He play and smoke crack after

3 (58m 10s):
That.

4 (58m 11s):
Yep. That's wild.

3 (58m 11s):
Genius pool player too. Like one of the best pool players I've ever seen in my life. Like professional level pool player.

4 (58m 17s):
I like spent my, I feel like I spent my youth with people like that. Like, I got sober at 15. Wow. Do you know that? I've been sober since I was 15. Wow. I went to rehab for the first time when I was 13. Holy

3 (58m 28s):
Shit.

4 (58m 29s):
And then, and then got, finally got sober. Finally got sober at 15 in a young people's meeting asking for help. And everybody in the room was 10 years, five to 10 years older than me in a young people's meeting. Wow. And that was like the be that was the beginning of my, my kind of life.

3 (58m 47s):
Holy shit. Do Were you a lot latchkey kid?

4 (58m 51s):
Oh yeah, definitely.

3 (58m 52s):
Yeah. So you just got let out and you were just out on the streets listening to rap, drinking forties. I was, I

4 (58m 57s):
Was a Lasky kid. And my mother Oakland Public Schools, my mom was deaf. My parent, my dad was deaf too, and he was like a like sort of born again Hasidic Jew. Like when they, when my parents split, my dad got like super, super religious. We come from, we come from crazy I mean like a hardcore version of, it's not like what you, it's like, do you see Unorthodox?

3 (59m 17s):
No.

4 (59m 18s):
It's a show on Netflix. It, it's about a really hardcore sect. That's the sect that my family

3 (59m 22s):
Is a documentary series.

4 (59m 23s):
It's a No, it's a, it's a show. Oh. It's a show. It's a scripted show about the, the sect of Hasidic Judaism called the Satmars. And that's the world that my, my family was from. My stepmother was Satmar. And my, my family came from a, a town called New Square, New York. Do you know anything about that? No. New Square is really interesting. It's like a village up above Muncie, which is already an unbelievably ultra orthodox place. But Muncie is nothing compared to Vera. Vera is like the hype. Women don't drive in New square, New York. Whoa. This is New York City. I got cousins that have Eastern European accents and they are third generation American. Which borough

3 (59m 57s):
Is this?

4 (59m 58s):
Well, my family lived, Muncie is in upstate New York. And my family lived in Brooklyn, in Seagate. Do you know where Seagate is? Yes. It's like Cascone Island at the, at the tip of Brooklyn. Right. And that was a sophomore neighborhood. And kids in that neighborhood, we used to play dodgeball games where it would be the ultra Orthodox kids versus the actually religious kids. Like that's how intense things were. Like an ultra orthodox person that you looked at and went, wow, that's a real Jew right there. We were basically the Gentiles of the community. Holy

3 (1h 0m 23s):
Shit.

4 (1h 0m 24s):
It was crazy. and I would be nine months a year in Oakland, regular public school listening to too short fly back to my dad's house, get driven to the ul the orthodox barber shop, the put a yama on me, slacks and I would go cosplay as an extra from Fiddler on the roof for six weeks a year.

3 (1h 0m 39s):
Wow.

4 (1h 0m 39s):
So, so that was the pre but before rehab. And that's sort of part, I think that's the reason that I fell into the rehab so heavily into the drug so heavily is because I was, everything about me made me feel like I am, I don don't fit, don don't fit. I'm, I'm a hearing person in a deaf world, I'm a essentially a gentile in a, in a Jewish world, you know,

3 (1h 0m 58s):
That is so crazy that you were considered a gentile

4 (1h 1m 1s):
I mean they didn't really consider me. But effectively, but

3 (1h 1m 3s):
You were not as religious as

4 (1h 1m 4s):
Them, effectively. Might as well have been there. Something wrong with you. Dude. There was a, there was a, wow, there was a local rabbi when I was getting close to my bar mitzvah. And he goes, he noticed, he was very nice and he noticed that I, I didn't know Hebrew, these kids spoke. And I'm not kidding, these kids spoke Yiddish as a first language. That's why they had the Eastern European accent. Right? Wow. So my uncle, he was first generation American. So he sounds like an American because the first generation American say go fit in. Right? But then by the time he had kids, they're like feeling their comfort in, in the United States and they go, don't go fit in. Go to a seminary where we learn Yiddish. So my cousins sound like extras from Dr. Avago and my uncle sounds like a New Yorker. Like it's that weird. So they speak Yiddish as a first language. I would bring an English prayer book to school and kids would, people would be like staring like it was a scarlet letter.

4 (1h 1m 49s):
Like, there's something wrong with me because I had an English book. Because

3 (1h 1m 51s):
You couldn't speak it in Hebrew,

4 (1h 1m 52s):
Because I couldn't know Hebrew couldn't Hebrew. Wow. So it's getting towards my bar mitzvah. Right? It's 12 my 12th year or 11th year. and Don don't know the alphabet. And this rabbi sees that I'm struggling and my dad was deaf. And so he had this kind of like Bazar relationship with the community where he was like one part accepted, one part almost mascot in a way that was a little insulting. But he was loved. Whatever the rabbi said, give him to me and I'll teach him Hebrew. Right? This is like the nineties early or late eighties, early nineties. You could at that time ask for some alone time with a child and they'd be handed over no questions asked. Right. So I go to his house and he starts teaching me the Hebrew, the Hebrew, the alphabet. Basic elemental I mean, like, this is like a Talmudic scholar teaching me the ABCs.

4 (1h 2m 34s):
Right. and I, I'm struggling. I like can't get it. And he goes, don't worry, don't worry. He goes, don't, don't, don't, don't be in embarrassed. Hold on. Come and come. Come. And his son sh comes into the room and he goes, do the English alphabet. This is an American kid. He goes, do the English alphabet. And the kid goes, oh no, A, b, G. And then he slaps me, the rabbi slaps me on the back and he goes, see, he is stupid in English. You are stupid in Hebrew. Everybody's stupid. That's, that was the energy. What a sweetheart. Right?

3 (1h 3m 8s):
That's a good way to approach it. Yeah.

4 (1h 3m 10s):
He was like, he was willing to humiliate his eldest son to teach me the love learning.

3 (1h 3m 13s):
That is funny though. The kid doesn't know the English alphabet.

4 (1h 3m 16s):
It was, I'm sure eventually he got it. But this was like, maybe not, maybe not, maybe

3 (1h 3m 20s):
Not. I mean there's, there's communities in this country that exist generation after generation where they only speak one language.

4 (1h 3m 25s):
No, it's like they made Wakanda in Brooklyn. Mm. That was like the vibe, you know? and I was in multiple Wakanda's too. I was born into like the deaf Wakanda where imagine that you're being born the enemy. But I was a, I'm a member of the deaf community. and I don't, I think every deaf person would say that, that I, I'd like belong, but I also was the enemy. I was the hearing. And, and so you're then

3 (1h 3m 45s):
Why do they think of the hearing as the enemy?

4 (1h 3m 46s):
Well, that is a complicated question. And it's because there has been a lot of enforced oppression on the deaf community from the, from the outside. The story of sign language is really fascinating. 300 years ago, there was no sign language. There was no, there was, there was only the kind of sign if you were born, 90% of deaf people are born into a hearing family. Right. That's just the way genetics works. Like most of the time, You don't have deaf family members. And if you were born 350 years ago into one of those families, you just didn't have language. You weren't given the gift of language, which is the thing I mean. Think about how much language plays into your own life, Joe. Like Yeah. Speaking and think everything, you know, every thought process you have is, is mashed through the filter of language.

4 (1h 4m 32s):
Yeah. And in that situation, you'd be born into a family and you had zero language. You would have like a gesturing system that you'd created with your dad to be able to say, like, pass the potatoes. And that was it.

3 (1h 4m 42s):
You couldn't say how you feel. You couldn't say what you wanted to do. You

4 (1h 4m 45s):
Couldn't even think about how you I mean. You could think, I don't know, I mean I wasn't. Yeah. I've never experienced that. But language is the thing that unlocks reason. It's the thing that unlocks culture. Yeah. And people were stymied from that. But if you were born lucky enough to have genetic deafness in your family so that you and your sibling were both user, both deaf, then the two of you sitting together could create language, a language of two. Right? You would back and forth between two siblings create a, a family sign system that would enable the both of you learning from one another to create a language and enable you to reason and think and talk about how you feel. Couldn't even if it just with one person, you

3 (1h 5m 25s):
Couldn't communicate with the outside world,

4 (1h 5m 26s):
But at least you could communicate with yourself and with one other person. I mean the difference between an isolated deaf person and a pair of siblings is the world. It's, it's, it's freedom. It's everything. Right? So one day a French P priest walks along along and sees two deaf sisters signing back and forth to one another. And he goes, that's language. Prior to that, deaf people weren't even considered to be linguistic. They weren't even considered to be capable of reason. But he goes, no I know what that is. I'm looking at language. So he goes to these sisters, his name is the Ape, and he says, teach me to sign. Somehow he tells 'em, like, you know, teach me these gestures to them. Teach me to sign. They teach him to sign. And he, his thing was he wanted them to take the catechism, right?

4 (1h 6m 9s):
That they, he wanted them to be able to go to heaven. He realized, oh, deaf people have, are linguistically capable, but they can't get into heaven unless they can take the catechism and confess their faith and take communion. Right. Which Right. Makes sense. If there is a God that God wouldn't allow them into heaven based on the fact that they couldn't speak. He's like, what am I, my hands are tied here, bud. I so

3 (1h 6m 28s):
You have to say it. So they

4 (1h 6m 29s):
Teach him. They teach him, and he teaches them back French. And then he starts to gather the deaf people from around the world, I'm sorry, from around France. And he creates the first school for the deaf. Right.

3 (1h 6m 40s):
He teaches them French in sign.

4 (1h 6m 42s):
In sign. That's right. Whoa. 'cause French, 'cause sign, language and spoken language are not the same. A lot of people think that, right? That like I speak American sign language, but people think, oh, it's a translation of English. It's not. It's his complete own language. So,

3 (1h 6m 57s):
Oh, I did not know that

4 (1h 6m 59s):
So much. So that the way that he would fundraise for this school is he would do like a traveling like roadshow where he would take his, his star pupils around France and around Europe, and they would be at like an exhibition hall. And a person in the audience would ask a question. He would say, oh, Joe, do you have a question for the deaf person? And then you'd ask them about some French question, like, you know, what is, what degree of suffering could be born by man? Or how many creams is too many creams for a Bri or whatever. And he would take your question, sign it to his star pupils, and they would take a piece of chalk, walk up to the blackboard and write the answer in perfect French. and it people lost their fucking minds. Like, wow. They couldn't believe it. Like deaf people. Oh my God. It like unlocked this whole conception of the deaf as like, they can think they can reason.

4 (1h 7m 41s):
Oh, they, all they need is language to be free. Right? So all this whole network of deaf schools for the deaf started to spring up. They would, they sprung up in all over Europe and they would copy the, the teaching methods of the, the school for the deaf. And, and, and a guy from America came over, right? And he saw this system and he basically took their star pupil. And one of the things was the deaf would teach each other. So you would teach them sign, and then they would become educated, and then they would become a professor at this school. And he took like the star professor, Lauren Clark was his name, Thomas Gaudette was the name of the American. He came over and he saw Laurent clerk. And he said, move to America with me, and let's go do the, let's go replicate this in America.

4 (1h 8m 24s):
So Thomas Gaudette says, yes, they got on a boat, they sailed to America. By the time they landed, Thomas Galludet knew Rudimentary sign. And Laurent clerk, who was like a fucking Genius knew basically had been taught English. And they set up the first school for the deaf in America. Right? Did you get out English on a boat? He was a Genius, like a real Genius like a, like an actual, like lucky enough to have been, you know, these circumstances in history where like the perfect man at the perfect time. Like yes. They come here, they set up this school here, and they start to create American sign language. And they, they borrowed from these different worlds, right? They took French sign language as the base. Martha's Vineyard back then had this weird genetic anomaly on the island of Martha's Vineyard. This is like, before it was just a place for Kennedys to fuck their mistresses.

4 (1h 9m 6s):
This was like back when it was a, a fishing town, a fishing island. There was some weird genetic thing that had happened where over the course of hundreds of years, one in 25 people on Martha's Vineyard was deaf. Whoa. and it was this very Bazar kind of like, like almost the, the equality that deaf people on Martha's Vineyard felt was almost like the opposite of like what affirmative action is attempting to do. Right? Affirmative action wants to correct a historic harm by, by changing the playing field. This was an equity of everybody was the same because everybody on Martha's Vineyard knew either was deaf, knew a deaf person, or was related to a deaf person. So everybody hearing and non-hearing signed on Martha's Vineyard.

4 (1h 9m 48s):
It was a, a sign system called Martha's Vineyard Sign Language. They took some of that. They took the Plains Indian sign language, PISL, it's called, you know, that like gesture. You, you've seen it in like movies where the, the Native Americans will, will gesture to each other. And you think they present it as if it's like a war language, so they don't have to make noise. But what it actually was, was all the tribes in America spoke different languages. So they created this kind of esperanto of the tribes really, so that they could trade, they could do trade. and it, that was called Plains Indian Sign Language. And they took all that into like kind of Booya bay of French sign language base, Martha's Vineyard chaser and Plains Indians sprinkled on top. And they created American sign language.

4 (1h 10m 28s):
And then a hundred years, 200 years later, my mother was born deaf in, in Oakland, California. And she went to the California School for the deaf. And she absorbed this language. My mother was 13 when she went to the California School for the deaf. She was in other, an oral school system. This is my long-winded way of telling you why deaf people have such a problem with hearing people. That language that she learned, she was, she was in an oral school system. So almost as soon as the sign language system came out, hearing people looked at it and go, we gotta get rid of that. The one thing that unlocked their freedom, the one thing that unlocked their minds, hearing people saw it and said, we have to take that away from them. We have to make them more like us.

4 (1h 11m 10s):
By doing the sign, they're creating more Wakanda, they're creating an insular, sort of closed circuit system of culture. Right. And they're, and weirdly, this was at a time in American history where those closed circuits of culture were really frowned upon this. Oh,

3 (1h 11m 27s):
They were frowning upon deaf people signing to each other. It's

4 (1h 11m 30s):
Deaf people signing to each other. Italians having their own newspapers, Chinese immigrants, like every, at that time in American history, the idea of creating like an immigrant Subculture was, was really frowned upon. Mm. And Alexander Graham Bell, whose parents were deaf like me, had a deaf wife. He became the champion of what was called the oral system. And the oral system was, well, let's not, let's not allow them to sign. Let's teach them to speak. Let's make them like us. Let's make them talk normally and function normally. Let's make them like us. Mm. but it, it was a crazy failure be, and it makes sense why, right? Like, they

3 (1h 12m 7s):
Can't hear the

4 (1h 12m 7s):
Sounds. They can't hear the sounds. Oliver Sack said, teaching a deaf person without sign is like teaching you Japanese from inside of a soundproof booth by holding up flashcards in Japanese and like putting a symbol next to it. Yeah. It was like kind of doomed to failure. And then they went through this, this 200 years reimposed darkness. There was a, there was a trial where all the hearing educators decided that deaf people wouldn't sign anymore. They fired all the deaf educators and they pushed them out and they created this oral system, which really I mean it worked for some people, some people. But what it created was you had to be exceptional in order to be average in the deaf world. You know, you had to be a Genius in order to get that oral system to work for you because your natural mode of communication had been kind of stamped out.

4 (1h 12m 52s):
And then in about the, the seventies deaf people started to like kind of rise up and say, fuck that we're signing. This is who we are. This is our native language. And when I was born in 79, that was the, that was the world I was born into. And, and, and so from that two sisters on a fucking corner in, in a slum in Paris to that school, to galludet, to a boat ride, to the Martha's Vineyard, to the California school to for the deaf, to my mother's hands, to my hands. That was the way that I acquired language. It was through this crazy historical journey. And that to me is, is the reason that, that when I was born into the deaf community, there was, there was so much distrust of the hearing world because they were like, they stole from us the one thing that gave us freedom.

3 (1h 13m 37s):
That makes sense. Wow. I did not know any of that stuff. That's incredible. What, how does someone get to be a fake sign language interpreter and be on stage with Obama?

4 (1h 13m 49s):
Was it Obama?

3 (1h 13m 50s):
Oh, it's been multiple people. But there's one, there was one recently that happened. Yeah. But the Obama one was bananas. This guy was totally insane. And he was standing in front of Obama just making things up. I'll

4 (1h 14m 2s):
Tell you how good he, I wanna see, can I see it?

3 (1h 14m 4s):
The Obama guy, how

4 (1h 14m 5s):
Bad the Obama guy is.

3 (1h 14m 6s):
Well, I think it's just gibberish dude. I think he's just the sign language version of gibberish.

4 (1h 14m 11s):
I, my life was going to appointments with my mother and being tasked with the job of interpreting for my mom's medical appointments for my mom. It was like a, a non-consensual internship program. Right. Like I, I like her medical appointments. And then I started to get in trouble. And then the, the, the subject of the meeting would be me. It would be like a disciplinary meeting about me.

3 (1h 14m 35s):
So you would have to explain what your mom was having a problem with. With you

4 (1h 14m 38s):
Or what? The school system or what the Oakland po Police Department, what their problem with me was, oh my God. And then you have to do this kind of like, this kind of interpretive dance where Right. You, you're, you're not re you can't be like, oh, we think your son is awesome. He's a cool kid. We love him. 'cause then your mom, my mom's not stupid. She'll be like, alright, let's see how bad this guy

3 (1h 14m 55s):
Is. Let's here this guy.

4 (1h 14m 57s):
Okay, well that's not Obama, the memorial.

3 (1h 14m 59s):
No, that's not the one. This is the guy. I

4 (1h 15m 1s):
Remember the there, it's the same guy. It's just same. Oh, this was in, at the Nelson Mandela Memorial.

3 (1h 15m 7s):
Yeah. So check this dude out. This video doesn't have him net with Obama for Okay. Just show him by himself with that other gentleman. So what, what is he doing here? Moshe?

4 (1h 15m 17s):
I, I am at a disadvantage, Joe, because I, this is South Africa and I do not speak South African sign language. Oh. But I remember

3 (1h 15m 25s):
This guy. So there is a south, a South African sign language.

4 (1h 15m 28s):
I would, I would assume every system you wanna hear something crazy. It is so not a translation of English that my mother no. Would have a much harder time understanding a British sign sign signer than a French signer. Whoa. So it has nothing. It's divorced from English. Wow. This, this lady. Okay, so I can tell you that this woman is actually using sign language. This is actual sign language. But she is very bad at sign language. Is that

3 (1h 15m 57s):
What it

4 (1h 15m 57s):
Is? Yes. Those are real letters. and I. This is completely incomprehensible. 55 million is what she just said. I know what that is. Please announcement tonight. Handcuffs. Look,

3 (1h 16m 11s):
She waved her arms around like she was singing jingle bells. But that's not true. Right. If she's doing some sign language, well,

4 (1h 16m 17s):
She's a hustler. What? Whatever this is. But I did, dude, I've been to so many appointments with my mother, with my mother, where I walk in and, and, and it's an emergency room appointment. and I go, you can leave. Just leave because you aren't qualified to do this and this is fucking life or death for my mother. And you're here. You shouldn't have taken this fucking job. You should have known better than to take this job because this is an emergency room situation. So that's when I was an interpreter. The, the responsibility of that was like massive to me. I I I felt that so acutely because I'd lived through it in such a direct way. Right. I've told, I've been an, an interpreter. When people were told they were dying. I've been an interpreter when people were, were graduated from graduate school, from like getting their doctorate.

4 (1h 17m 0s):
Although I've been an interpreter where people were in court and it was literally the, the, the degree to which I could sign accurately and faithfully was a difference between them going to prison and not going to prison. Like I've done all of that. And that that, that weight is like super massive to me and super

3 (1h 17m 15s):
Important. I can't imagine. Yeah.

4 (1h 17m 17s):
And some funny shit has happened along the way too.

3 (1h 17m 20s):
I'm sure.

4 (1h 17m 20s):
Like some very strange situations.

3 (1h 17m 23s):
How does the deaf community feel about people who get like implants and can hear again?

4 (1h 17m 28s):
So that's a another complicated question. I think. Have you ever seen the sound in the fury?

3 (1h 17m 32s):
No.

4 (1h 17m 33s):
It's a fucking beautiful and fantastic documentary about cochlear implants and the deaf community. I mean the thing is deaf. The deaf community had a an and I and don don't speak for the deaf community, obviously, but I can speak from my own experience. My mother has a cochlear implant. She got one. 'cause my mom was like, my mom's like an iconoclast. And she's like, I'm not gonna allow a taboo in deaf society to keep me from experiencing as much of life as I could possibly experience

3 (1h 17m 59s):
Of course.

4 (1h 17m 59s):
But in general, especially at the beginning, deaf people hated the idea of a cochlear implant because they do not feel, and I think to some degree I agree with them that deafness is a disability. They feel that that that what it is, is it's a, it it's a culture. I mean, obviously they can't hear that's a disability. But the true disability comes from the fact that communication barrier. And so to them they see the cochlear implant as just another imperialist, now a robotic mechanism to make them hearing again.

3 (1h 18m 31s):
But wouldn't that be counterbalanced by the ability to absorb art?

4 (1h 18m 35s):
You

3 (1h 18m 36s):
Can hear

4 (1h 18m 36s):
Music.

3 (1h 18m 36s):
Music. Yeah. How do they hear it? Do they hear it the way a normal person hears it? Well,

4 (1h 18m 42s):
I can tell you in section two of the book my RA years. What kind of music? The deaf, like more than any other, in my experience, RAs is definitely slamming techno. Really? 'cause it's a really simple form to be able to experience and feel is is just that boom, boom, boom of techno or house. They love, they love that

3 (1h 19m 2s):
One of the best pool players in the world is deaf. And he shuts his hearing aid off when he plays.

4 (1h 19m 6s):
I can totally see that because you're like hyper-focused. You're like all the way in. Yeah. I can completely

3 (1h 19m 11s):
See it. He shuts it off and he just doesn't miss

4 (1h 19m 13s):
I mean my mother. My mother is still deaf. If you met her, you would be like, there would be no part of you that was like, this person isn't deaf. She sounds deaf. And she she is and she signs. But she wanted Yeah. To experience.

3 (1h 19m 27s):
But she can hear. True.

4 (1h 19m 30s):
So when you're old and your brain has set its neural pathways to such a degree that it does not process sound and never has the cochlear implant. Apparently it's not, there's no way to reignite an atrophied pathway into a normal hearing system. Right. By the way, the cochlear implant, I think it don don't know. I've never had one. Obviously it sounds robotic. It it never sounds like, which

3 (1h 19m 57s):
Is why they like techno.

4 (1h 19m 59s):
That's exactly right.

3 (1h 20m 0s):
I mean it's simple to, you know, it's not like listening to country roads. Oh,

4 (1h 20m 3s):
I thought you meant 'cause it it connects, it's like a, a robot music.

3 (1h 20m 6s):
It's like easy to follow.

4 (1h 20m 7s):
But I don't even mean people with cochlear implants. Deaf people in general, they love raves because Yeah, it's easy to follow. You can dance to it. Right. You don't have to follow some symphonic kind of like path or whatever.

3 (1h 20m 18s):
When they're totally deaf. Do they feel techno?

4 (1h 20m 20s):
Definitely. Yeah.

3 (1h 20m 21s):
So where do they feel it? Their feet.

4 (1h 20m 23s):
I would say probably their genitals mostly. Really? No, don don't know their whole body. I mean you, you've been to a rave, haven't you?

3 (1h 20m 29s):
No. You never have. No. I wonder if your genitals really do feel it. If you couldn't hear

4 (1h 20m 33s):
If base is, I can say if base is deep enough, you can definitely feel it in your genitals. That is true.

3 (1h 20m 37s):
So you'd be just kind of barely moving.

4 (1h 20m 40s):
I, when I was a big rave and I became eventually like a rave promoter and a dj. I was a DJ at raves through the nineties and an Ecstasy dealer. But that's another story. I started when I was about 16. I bought my first set of turntables and a mixer and I was terrible. Obviously like everybody starting out. But you can't play in your headphones DJing. Really. You have to like, have it be amplified. and I had a very lucky break in having deaf parents because I would just set everything all the way to the max and my mom would be like happily studying in the other room and I would just be like train wrecking techno beats.

3 (1h 21m 11s):
Ah, that's hilarious. How'd your neighbors feel about

4 (1h 21m 14s):
That? I didn't have neighbors. I lived next door to a, to a terrible bar so I could have given a fuck. Oh,

3 (1h 21m 19s):
That's lucky.

4 (1h 21m 20s):
I grew up next to like a real white trash kind of like wannabe gangster bar that was, I would say the energy. No. Yeah, really rough. They'd be like showing off their like sound system and their like Cutler Supreme. Oh that was the energy. Oh. Pissing on my front door and shit like that.

3 (1h 21m 34s):
Oh my God. Wow.

4 (1h 21m 36s):
Is this a def aver def brave. I'm telling you, I'm not making this up.

3 (1h 21m 44s):
I don't That's the real music, but yeah. Yeah.

7 (1h 21m 46s):
That's this company, the group called Deaf Rave. They host raves for deaf people.

4 (1h 21m 50s):
Well that's what I'm saying. House music and techno music really is actually music that's made for your body rather than your mind, you know, and it's made to move to, and so I think for the deaf community, this is like, it's, it is the perfect form. Mm. And these guys are all deaf. That's so cool.

7 (1h 22m 6s):
Yeah. You would definitely feel the bass for sure. I mean I don't they? Yeah. There's, there's headphones. You can get that transduce sound through your jaw instead of going through your ear. Whoa. and I. But they have to still be able to understand what that,

4 (1h 22m 20s):
That's really fascinating

7 (1h 22m 21s):
What the frequencies

4 (1h 22m 22s):
Are. Speaking of weird surgeries, when my grandma rather when my mom got the cochlear implant, it decimated her balance. She has not been the same since. Oh no, she's, she's super wobbly. 'cause they, they took out her in her ear and they put it put in a rob robotic cochlea instead. Oh. And her inner ear. And she wanted to get the other one done and we had to do like a, a cochlear implant intervention. We go, mom, no, you're gonna be in a wheelchair if you do that. Like, don't

3 (1h 22m 45s):
Do that. So just wrecks your equilibrium.

4 (1h 22m 47s):
Wrecked hers. A lot of people with cochlear implants are, are doing fine. Oh. But she, for some reason, you know, I wish I mean. I love my mom and I. Who am I to say that? That it wasn't worth it. She says it's worth it to her and it's not my business. She wanted to experience in the, in the last quarter of her life, like the sensation of sound and I think like, I get that when you've never experienced something like why you wouldn't walk through that door to me. I wish she'd never gotten it because now she's like this wobbly older lady and it like scares the shit outta me.

3 (1h 23m 16s):
D is there a way to correct it? The wobbly thing? No,

4 (1h 23m 18s):
No. They take it out. I mean they, they, once

3 (1h 23m 20s):
They do it, that's it. There's not, well they literally

4 (1h 23m 21s):
Remove, they literally remove your cochlea and put, put a robot cochlea in instead. Oh. So there's no, no, it's, it's irreversible. She can't do an MRI either. Oh

3 (1h 23m 30s):
Boy. Yeah. That

4 (1h 23m 31s):
Sucks. She can't like do a lot of things 'cause it like a piece of machinery will clunk out of her brain

3 (1h 23m 36s):
Rip out of her fucking head. Right. But

4 (1h 23m 38s):
Yeah, I think that pe deaf, the deaf community is

3 (1h 23m 41s):
Neur link. Bro. I wonder how

4 (1h 23m 42s):
That would work with deaf people. I'm sure with, oh,

3 (1h 23m 45s):
The new product is called telepathy. Let a person control a phone or computer just by thinking,

4 (1h 23m 52s):
Well, I heard about, sorry.

7 (1h 23m 53s):
What if you think an A SL then you know, you're not thinking in English.

3 (1h 23m 56s):
I thought the first ones were going to be for people that were injured.

4 (1h 24m 1s):
Oh. To get them out of like

3 (1h 24m 3s):
Paralysis or something. I guess that is, that is someone. But if you were injured in like Stephen Hawkings Right. You know, that would've been perfect for him.

4 (1h 24m 10s):
Right. But what would it do?

3 (1h 24m 12s):
You would be able to do everything on a computer by

4 (1h 24m 14s):
Oh, it would no longer be robot voice. Right. You could I

3 (1h 24m 16s):
See. Could type. You could, you could do everything. Right. You could. It says that you could talk faster. He said that you could talk faster than an auctioneer.

4 (1h 24m 25s):
With With Neuralink. Yeah. With Neuralink. That's interesting. Yeah. So how fast can you say, get me to Epstein's Island? How quickly Epstein's I, it

3 (1h 24m 34s):
Took him one minute to write each word.

4 (1h 24m 37s):
Is that true?

3 (1h 24m 38s):
Yeah. And there was allegations towards the end of his life. He married his nurse. His story's crazy. 'cause I have a bid on him and I've been researching him over the last few weeks. His story's nuts. He was, most people that have that disease, Lou Gehrig's disease, they die within two years. He lived like 55 years. Right. And by the end of his life, all he could do was move his cheek muscles. That was all that moved. That's so crazy. So he could move his cheek muscles and he would use the cheek muscle control cursor and he would select letters on a screen.

4 (1h 25m 9s):
Can, is there any reason why he survived? Or is it just full on luck of the draw?

3 (1h 25m 16s):
Probably luck of the draw. I mean access to great medicine. I mean he's

4 (1h 25m 19s):
Right. Well there's that. I kind of feel like sometimes

3 (1h 25m 22s):
Famous scientist,

4 (1h 25m 23s):
There's some part of me that believes, like, until the Epstein story broke that it was like a gift from the universe. Well

3 (1h 25m 30s):
The thing about the Epstein Island thing is there were a lot of scientists that got lured onto that island. And imagine if you're a scientist, let's say you're a physicist and someone contacts you, contacts you and says, Moshe, would you like to go meet this guy? That guy and that guy Right. On a retreat. And you're like, oh, these guys are super legit. This must be legit. Right. You know, you're over there studying the cosmos. How much time are you Googling Jeffrey Epstein?

4 (1h 25m 52s):
That's why I always hate these things.

3 (1h 25m 53s):
And in the beginning, no one really had reason to believe that he was doing anything wrong. Right. With all his fa until he got arrested.

4 (1h 26m 0s):
That's why I always hate these one things where they go, you took a picture with so and so, therefore you're, it's like, what does that have to, I don't you to take a picture with a thousand people a day. Like what does I, I have no, I'm not googling everybody I do a picture with.

3 (1h 26m 10s):
Right. Especially if you just meet someone at a show or something like that. It's insane. But also, you know, with these people, these scientists, like that's a really sneaky trick to get a bunch of prominent people together and then invite you to be with those prominent people. Right. Right. And it's a good intelligence operation. Move I mean, if I was an, an intelligence operative, that's how I would compromise people.

4 (1h 26m 34s):
Oh, you think there's a part of you that thinks maybe they were lured there not just 100, but in order to take them down

3 (1h 26m 41s):
100%. Oh, that's interesting. Not to take them down to have their influence.

4 (1h 26m 44s):
I see. To triangulate them into Yes. Into I You can, you'll do what I want you to do kind of a thing. Yes.

3 (1h 26m 49s):
Yes. Right. You'll, you'll support Israel no matter what. You'll do this, you'll do that. You will, you know, the ci I will tell you to do something. You do it. You know, if you are a person that has an enormous amount of influence in a field of science, that's a very valuable person to have on your hand. If you ever have something where someone has to speak to the general public, right. You get this expert and this expert has a, an opinion that's very different than some other people's opinions. And they say, well then they promote that opinion. Right. This is the person. Well, you could, you could do a lot of things, especially if you have a lot of them. Right,

4 (1h 27m 23s):
Right. You know, an islands. An island's worth.

3 (1h 27m 25s):
Yeah. And then you also keep them from criticizing you. You keep them from talking about it. You, you know, you essentially muzzle them to this very complex sort of scheme that was running where they were compromising all

4 (1h 27m 39s):
These people. That's what you think Epstein's Islands was about? 100%. It wasn't like a play hedonistic playground. It was actually like a pun.

3 (1h 27m 45s):
He's an intelligence agency agent most likely. Ah, that's most likely interesting. Well, Ghislaine Maxwell, her father was an intelligence operative, you know, and he was the one who apparently had trained Epstein supposedly. You know, the whole thing is very convoluted because it's very difficult. The stories filled with very wealthy, powerful people who have done a fantastic job of keeping themselves from getting arrested. It's pretty wild. Like how this has been out in the open, just the murder of Epstein, which seems to be a murder, doesn't seem to be a hanging.

4 (1h 28m 15s):
You ever get upset you weren't invited?

3 (1h 28m 17s):
No. Pretty

4 (1h 28m 18s):
Happy because hey, you

3 (1h 28m 19s):
Might've gone. I would've gone if I didn't know.

4 (1h 28m 21s):
Especially Yeah, if you got an email. Dude. Dude, we got an island. It's really fun. Especially

3 (1h 28m 24s):
Prego. Oh yeah. Prego. You're like, Hey, do you want to go out with, hang out with Steven Hawkins on an island? You're like, holy shit. But I

4 (1h 28m 31s):
Did used to think, yeah, back to the Hawking thing that I don't know, like the universe gave him to us in this weird way. Like, here's this mega brilliant Genius. I'm not like a big deist in that way, but I think what are the odds that the smartest man ever to get Lou Gehrig's got to live long enough to give over the full bulk of his Genius. Mm. There's something very beautiful and interesting about that to me.

3 (1h 28m 52s):
Well, yeah, that, that's a good point. That that guy who had so much to give lived so long with the disease that killed so quickly.

4 (1h 28m 59s):
Yeah, yeah.

3 (1h 28m 60s):
Yeah. I mean he was, apparently he was paralyzed. He couldn't move, but he could feel so that's why he liked girls. Yeah. And you know, there's a crazy article and I forget what Mag Variety, maybe they were No, I forget the, I forget the magazine. But they were talking about, he was like a frequent visitor to strip clubs. Right. He would go to like swingers places.

4 (1h 29m 22s):
Imagine being the, the stripper. Yeah. When Hawking comes in,

3 (1h 29m 26s):
She probably didn't know who he is, you know? Yeah.

4 (1h 29m 29s):
Probably that's not, that's possibly not true. Fucked

3 (1h 29m 31s):
Up old guy. If you're 22 years old and your stage name is Lexus, what are the odds that you know who Stephen Hawking is? You know, I

4 (1h 29m 40s):
Mean he's pretty famous, pretty famous guy. Could be

3 (1h 29m 42s):
Famous for people that care about those things.

4 (1h 29m 44s):
Yeah. I think Lexus cared. Maybe. I think you're, you're, you perhaps cut l cut Lexus, some slack

3 (1h 29m 50s):
Maybe. Maybe Lexus is just, you knows way through school

4 (1h 29m 53s):
Thinker. That's right.

3 (1h 29m 54s):
There's those. That's real. I think the, the, the Hawkings thing is a strange story, but it's the whole island thing is a strange story. It's a strange story. It's a story that is one of those things where you're going like, this sounds like the plot of a movie. Right. How could this really be how they did it? You know?

4 (1h 30m 13s):
Yeah. I yeah. That movie will come out. Yeah. Who plays Epstein? Oh

3 (1h 30m 17s):
Yeah. That's a good question.

4 (1h 30m 20s):
I got a pitch. Alec Baldwin. Yeah, Baldwin would be good. Be

3 (1h 30m 23s):
Good if a little too big. It's a little stink on him right now.

4 (1h 30m 27s):
Well, there's a little stink on Epstein too. Yeah. But

3 (1h 30m 30s):
I mean maybe too much for him to get the part.

4 (1h 30m 33s):
Sure.

3 (1h 30m 33s):
You would want someone to, who would do it? Oh, Bradley Cooper. He could do it.

4 (1h 30m 38s):
Oh, BC

3 (1h 30m 39s):
He's a, he's a good guy at assuming

4 (1h 30m 41s):
New characters. Yeah, great. Two great Jewish heroes. Yeah. He goes from Maestro to Epstein's Island.

3 (1h 30m 49s):
Well he played, he's played a lot of people. Who else would be good at it? Christian Bale. He could do anything.

4 (1h 30m 56s):
Christian Bale is the best of us. Have you seen poor things?

3 (1h 30m 59s):
No, I

4 (1h 30m 59s):
Haven't. Emma Stone is the best actor in the world. Really? I'm on, I'm on record now. Wow. Poor things was great. I loved,

3 (1h 31m 6s):
Other than Daniel de Lewis.

4 (1h 31m 7s):
Well DDL is, he is retired.

3 (1h 31m 11s):
Is he? He's still retired. He,

4 (1h 31m 12s):
I think so.

3 (1h 31m 13s):
I feel like he's about to come out.

4 (1h 31m 14s):
You think he's about to drop a new mix tape Mayweather. He's ready

3 (1h 31m 16s):
To get back in there.

4 (1h 31m 18s):
Now. That is a pay-per-view that I would pay for Daniel Dayle versus Floyd Mayweather. I

3 (1h 31m 23s):
Bet if you gave Daniel Day Lewis long enough, he'd learn how to b He was really good in the, a movie called The Boxer. It was about an IRA guy who got outta jail and he looked like a real, real legitimate boxer. He trained for an entire year in a boxing gym. That's all he did before he, you know, before they filmed. So he went to a boxing gym and he essentially was there every day.

4 (1h 31m 44s):
You know, he had to be called Mr. President on set of Lincoln. Yeah. Including to like a, the security guard. There was like some older security guard that like just had got hired that day.

3 (1h 31m 52s):
Yeah. He was all in.

4 (1h 31m 53s):
He was all, but that's it. Those kind of people are so insufferable and then you look at their performance, you go, don don't know. I guess it's worth it. Like

3 (1h 31m 59s):
It's, I think it's gotta be worth it. I would not wanna be around him during the, there will be Blood movie.

4 (1h 32m 5s):
No, definitely not. Fuck that. I just saw in the name of the Father again. Have you seen that? It's one of his earlier movies. It's like an IRA story about

3 (1h 32m 13s):
Yes I did. Yes. I did such a good

4 (1h 32m 15s):
Fucking

3 (1h 32m 15s):
Movie. Oh, he's guy. He's so good. He's got no duds.

4 (1h 32m 18s):
N is that true?

3 (1h 32m 19s):
Don don't know of any duds.

4 (1h 32m 20s):
Yeah, I guess you're right.

3 (1h 32m 22s):
Don don't think he's got any duds. Oh,

4 (1h 32m 23s):
That's such a good movie. I love this movie.

3 (1h 32m 25s):
Last of the Mohicans is great too. No, he was great. He's great in everything. So I mean he decided to start making shoes.

4 (1h 32m 32s):
Is that true? Yeah,

3 (1h 32m 33s):
He became a cobbler.

4 (1h 32m 33s):
He went too deep into the phantom thread.

3 (1h 32m 35s):
He just decided that's what he feels like doing right now.

4 (1h 32m 38s):
Well, I think it's time for me to reveal something to you, Joe.

3 (1h 32m 40s):
Official statement. Daniel. Daniel Day Lewis will no longer be working as an actor. He's immensely grateful to all his collaborators and audiences over the many years. This is a private decision, and neither he nor his representatives will make any further comment on the subject. Why be

4 (1h 32m 54s):
So mysterious? And also, what is this office building? I don't know exactly. Is that Photoshopped?

7 (1h 32m 58s):
I think someone made this account on Instagram and just put this up.

4 (1h 33m 2s):
DDLI

7 (1h 33m 3s):
Don't imagine that's by him.

3 (1h 33m 5s):
Mm. Yeah. I would not imagine that. He has an Instagram,

4 (1h 33m 9s):
So yeah. Those boots you liked so much, Joe. Those are DBLs made. Nice.

3 (1h 33m 13s):
That's

4 (1h 33m 13s):
Right. DDLs. I was gonna get us to this conversational point at some point today. That

3 (1h 33m 17s):
Would be a, you know, a dope brand. Like if Daniel Day Lewis started like actually selling things,

4 (1h 33m 23s):
I would buy Daniel Day Lewis'

3 (1h 33m 24s):
Shoes. Oh, I know percent. You'd be the coolest guy in the fucking room.

4 (1h 33m 27s):
Absolutely. But yeah, Emma Stone and import things. I'm, I, she's the new one. Is

3 (1h 33m 30s):
He still a cobbler? Does he sell shoes or does he just make 'em, he might be one of those dudes that just makes shoes.

4 (1h 33m 36s):
You wanna hear a crazy cobbler port to the conversation we were talking about earlier,

3 (1h 33m 42s):
20 years ago? Yeah.

7 (1h 33m 43s):
After the boxer. He's secretly made off,

4 (1h 33m 46s):
Secretly made shoes. 96 to 97. Okay. My mother, my, my mother learned sign language because of a cobbler. Oh, wow. So my, my grandma had her in an oral school and she was failing and she was isolated and had no friends. And my mother, my grandma went to get her shoes fixed at this cobbler. And he happened to be deaf randomly. And my grandma was like, you know, talking to passing notes back and forth with him. And he said that he'd never learned sign language and, and that he didn't have any friends and that he didn't, he didn't have any access to the world. and it was just this like, lonely cobbler. And that was the day that my mom, my, my grandma pulled her out of an oral school and sent her to the school for the deaf to learn sign language was Wow.

4 (1h 34m 30s):
All because of a cobbler.

3 (1h 34m 31s):
That's awesome.

4 (1h 34m 32s):
Yeah. It's a wild one.

3 (1h 34m 34s):
Do you believe in synchronicities like that these things happen on purpose? That there's something, some sort of a destiny to life?

4 (1h 34m 42s):
I can tell you that I've been thinking about Destiny a lot. She was the other stripper at the strip club looking at Stephen Hawking. No, I've been thinking about Destiny a lot because of this book. Because, you know, these are worlds, all of these worlds that I write about in this book, like Deafness and Hasidic Judaism and AA and raves and Burning Man and, and stand up there, they don't go together except through like my body, like through me, I'm, I'm the connective tissue. And having written this book, like now I'm, I guess I'm, am I middle in middle age or something like that? You're lucky if I'm lucky. Yes. Amen. May I, may I be so lucky. I'm looking back and going like, this whole thing was a path. And there is no way to see Destiny. I don't believe in Destiny looking forward.

4 (1h 35m 23s):
I believe in Destiny, looking back, like everywhere you land is destiny in this weird way because it never could have been anything else. I have all these, and I'm sure you do too, these portals in my life, you could have been a pool hustler. Only you, you could have been a and you could have gone to the pool hustler thing and then gotten shot and been died at 25. Or like, there's all these multiverse possibilities of the Moshe that wasn't Mm. And the Moshe that was, was always headed in this direction. Like, I, I like think about standup. The only reason I started standup is because I was in Israel doing a semester abroad, and it was in the, the second ada and it got shut down. and I got, I just decided randomly to go to New York.

4 (1h 36m 3s):
And, and I happened to have a friend who I'd kept in touch with who was doing standup. And she brought me to a show that night. and I, I saw Patrice and Sarah Silverman and I. I had never even thought standup in my life. I like never. It I mean I'd seen like Delirious or it's like I watched Janine's special and it, but I didn't care. Standup wasn't part of my thing, but I saw them doing their thing and I was like, I couldn't believe it. Like I, I'd been writing like long form monologues and like wanting to be an actor. I didn't know what I wanted to do. I wanted to write plays. Maybe I wanted to be a historian. I just didn't know. And then I saw them. How old were you? I was 21 and I Go First of all Patrice was making fun of Michael J. Fox.

4 (1h 36m 45s):
and it was like the week that his Parkinson's had been. And I was like, I like couldn't believe it felt illegal. You know what I mean? Like, I was just like this, how can this be? You know? And, and then Sarah went on and she was transgressive in this way. That was like, anyway, I go, wow, that's crazy. And then the next night my friend was doing a set and I went and saw her and she was funny. and I go, what the hell? She's a human being like, these are gods that I just saw last night. Right. You know, but this is a person. She's like me. So I said to her, when you come to the Bay, I'll write five minutes of material, take me to an open mic. I go to the open mic, I do the open mic. It goes pretty well. And then I just, like, my destiny was like set. I like, now here I am. It's 20 years later, I just wrote my second book.

4 (1h 37m 26s):
I'm talking to you. I got a wife at home who's a comic who I met in comedy clubs. I have a child at home. That's a result of the, the connection that the two of us have. I can't even look back and think about the other lives. It could have been. 'cause it's like that to me is Destiny is looking back and going, I was like, don don't know how I know how raves to burning Man to deafness, to Hasidic Judaism to aa to stand up lead here. but it was always leading here. This is where I was going.

3 (1h 37m 52s):
Do you believe in the multiverse? Do you believe that there's infinite numbers of you living in different directions and infinite possibilities that have, because that's what if the people that believe that we live in one channel of essentially what's an infinite radio dial? Yeah. That, that, that's why you can only exist in the moment really.

4 (1h 38m 16s):
Because it's only one thing going.

3 (1h 38m 18s):
Yeah. It's only one thing going. and it can go anyway. And if there's an infinite number of you out there, which it likely the way the universe is, if you, if you talk to people that actually understand the scope of infinity, they will tell you that not only do humans exist, but you exist. And not only do you exist, but you exist in the form where you have done everything that you have done on this earth. You Moshe the guy I'm talking to right now. Yeah. There's an infinite number of

4 (1h 38m 53s):
You doing the same thing

3 (1h 38m 54s):
That have done that. Exactly. Every pause that you've made. And then there's an infinite number of ones who made different choices. and it iss an infinite number of different choices that they have made at every single moment of every single step of their life. That's how Big Infinity is. What

4 (1h 39m 11s):
Is the, I guess there is no purpose in that there. It's like, it's

3 (1h 39m 15s):
Like, I don't know. There still might be a purpose, right? There's still, there's definitely a purpose to the people that exist in the moment that exist in this time that we're, we're sharing. So if that is real and it is felt by all of us, life is amazing. And when it is and it's terrible when it's not, you know, there's, there's definitely, it's, there's a meaning to it. It's what does that do? And what, what are these moments and what is, what is the, the powerful emotion of love and the way people feel when they hear great music and all the good things that human beings are capable of and all the things that human beings do. What, what is that doing? Like what it's, it's expressing energy.

3 (1h 39m 58s):
It's expressing the universe in some weird way has taken this multi-celled being and allowed it to change the surface of the planet. Right. And experiment with video where it flies through space and hits another person's device on the other side of the planet. Instantaneously. What we've done is fucking Bazar and I can't think that there's not a meaning to it. 'cause there's a meaning to us while it's happening. Well,

4 (1h 40m 28s):
If you believe that story that I, not that I'm saying that story was the most magical story. It's my magical story. And everybody has their own little version of magical story.

3 (1h 40m 35s):
If you're lucky, it's magical. Right?

4 (1h 40m 37s):
Right. And that's not to discount people's tragedy. That Right. That they go through too. And some of my, by the way, some of my path was, was paved with tragedy. And, and, and that's, to me the history of the, of the Jews is like this sort of triumphant story that's like pockmarked with insane tragedy all the time. And then you just keep going and keep surviving. Like if you believe in destiny, like, I was headed here because a force brought me here. That's magical. And if you believe in randomness, like there was no meaning. There was no, this was truly a pinball ping from wall to wall. That's as just as magical to me. That's just mind blowing. It's

3 (1h 41m 11s):
All pretty magical. Existence is magical. I've always said that if, if life itself as you live it right now was a psychedelic drug, you would take it and be like, what the fuck is this?

4 (1h 41m 21s):
Well, even to exist at all scientifically is so infinitesimally like, unlikely, unlikely. Were the perfect amount of distance from the sun to have an ozone layer and an atmosphere. And then you are a human that you got to incarnate in, in the human version where you're not just like a sustenance, like, you know, the pig that you shot, you could have been the pig that you shot. Yep. The the te the the, the, the funky pig. Like that is such a rare, it feels so common. If You don't pay attention to the beauty in your life, it can feel so common and banal. And life is boring and meaningless. And if you turn around, if I turn around and like look at the kind of magic of this existence and this incarnation, like I, and that's why I love life so much.

4 (1h 42m 6s):
Like that's to, to me, like the, the, the, the book is about my, my desire to like, I want, when I die, I wanna squeeze the last drop of the towel. That was life. I want the last little drip of water that was in there. I wanna drink it all. I wanna live like my religion is fun. It's not Judaism. It's fun, it's experiences. It's like love and the comm connection. Talking to you, going on stage, writing a book, having a family. Like I feel super overpaid and lucky and 'cause a lot of my friends that I grew up with are dead. And like I just, and I could have been me too. Sure.

3 (1h 42m 41s):
Could have been all of us. There's a lot of decisions you could have made that have not gotten you to this point right now.

4 (1h 42m 47s):
Yeah. Me and Pete Holmes call, we were talking about it. He was calling it spiritual plinko. Like it just could have plinked in a different direction and you'd be a different guy. You go on a car ride one day you're in an accident, you go on a car ride the other day you, you win the Nobel Prize. Yeah.

3 (1h 43m 1s):
You, you tie your shoes before you leave the house and you avoid an accident

4 (1h 43m 5s):
Or you tie your shoes and you get into an accident. Yeah. Yeah. So I think, yeah, that is what you're talking about living in the moment. Because there's so many possibilities that if you believe it one way are happening or could happen to you, then fear is I mean. I live in fear sometimes. and it's like, this is so pointless. 'cause the thing you're it's the thing with my daughter, the thing you're protecting her against, you're not protecting her against the actual thing that will harm her and vice versa.

3 (1h 43m 26s):
Well that's the thing about anxiety, right? It's preparing for something that hasn't happened. Right. That's the what, what freaks people out. I think a lot of time it affects very smart people too. 'cause they take into account all the possible scenarios that could take place. Right. All the variables. I always would tell people when I was teaching, when I was teaching martial arts, when I'd have people compete and I'd take 'em to tournaments, I'd be like, the reason why you are so nervous is because you're smart. The last thing you want to be is not nervous right now because nerves are gonna save you. Yeah. It's a terrible feeling, but you're gonna get over it. But that those nerves exist 'cause you're aware of the ver the variables you're aware of the possibilities you're aware of the danger of it all. A delusional stupid person who's just confident they can win.

3 (1h 44m 9s):
Right. They, it's possible they can still win and they can have no nerves at all. And they can go in there and they can kick everybody's ass. But you're better, better off being aware of what this is. You're better, you, your, your senses will be heightened as long as you're not overwhelmed by fear.

4 (1h 44m 23s):
You're saying fear is beneficial in that way. A

3 (1h 44m 26s):
Hundred percent. Yeah. Cama who trained Mike Tyson used to say fear is like a fire. You can cook with it or you could burn your house down. Oh, that's great. You have to be able to control it.

4 (1h 44m 34s):
Yeah. Yeah. Totally. I mean the, the, the thing that happens is when people become worshipful of their fear and it takes away their ability to go out and experience life, they're so afraid of the disastrous possibilities of life that they forget to live a life. Yes. and I, I will say I'm not free of fear at all. I feel it all the time.

3 (1h 44m 52s):
You're a human being. It's impossible to not be. Also you live in LA

4 (1h 44m 56s):
Well

3 (1h 44m 56s):
I you and you gotta bitch for a dog.

4 (1h 44m 59s):
It's not, it's possible to bitch. It's also possible to betray me 'cause it's a German shepherd and it's like I wasn't trained to protect Jews.

3 (1h 45m 6s):
Oh. Ooh. Good point.

4 (1h 45m 7s):
Okay, I got you. Yes. Good point. Good point. It's like, no, he's a sweetheart. You

3 (1h 45m 11s):
Know, George Foreman had a German shepherd and when he, he had a German shepherd and he brought it to Africa. When he is fighting Muhammad Ali, they were very distrustful of him because

4 (1h 45m 21s):
Of the

3 (1h 45m 21s):
Dog. Because he had a dog that would, they used a sick on black people. Wow. So when he was bringing this dog, this guy was bringing a dog that they recognized as the enemy. There's a lot of people that were very distrustful of him.

4 (1h 45m 33s):
Oh, that's really interesting. Yeah. I should have, he should have brought my dog.

3 (1h 45m 36s):
So that helped Ali.

4 (1h 45m 37s):
If he brought my dog, it would've created unity in South Africa. He, he,

3 (1h 45m 41s):
They still wouldn't have trusted it. It's this breed.

4 (1h 45m 44s):
Yeah. Yeah. That thing's sweet. I love them.

3 (1h 45m 46s):
They didn't have those breeds back then though. They only had one kind of German shepherd. You ever see what Oh, they were gnarly German shepherds look like over the years. Yeah. Because they're trying to make them for show dogs. Their hips have dropped. Right. And they look different. If you go to like a German shepherd from like 1930 and then look at a German shepherd from 2023, it, it's a different animal. Have you, there's

4 (1h 46m 4s):
Sloping, you know that bulldogs can't True bulldogs like MCA or whatever.

3 (1h 46m 9s):
Jamie's dog can't Fuck

4 (1h 46m 10s):
They, they can't. And they can, they only give birth. They only give cesarean birth.

3 (1h 46m 14s):
Yeah. I think Jamie's dog can't breed. Normally you gotta use the Turkey baster.

4 (1h 46m 18s):
But neither can Marshall. I haven't

3 (1h 46m 20s):
Tried Marshall can if I let him.

4 (1h 46m 21s):
Yeah. The problem is you won't let him. Well, he'll

3 (1h 46m 23s):
Always gonna want,

4 (1h 46m 24s):
He texted me on the way here. He said to talk to Joe, see if I can get some

3 (1h 46m 27s):
Ass. I'm definitely, I find a good lady that, and I would have to have homes for all the puppies. But you know, it's the thing about dogs, like you're, you're not saying I want my dog to have sex. You're saying I want my dog to procreate. Right,

4 (1h 46m 40s):
Right, right.

3 (1h 46m 41s):
That's a different thing.

4 (1h 46m 43s):
Yeah. Yeah. That they can't. Right. They don't do it for I think about that a lot too. That human beings, by the way, I think human, this is a great and lucky incarnation to be a human. Yeah. Really good. But it's also humans are, we have warped evolution to such a degree. Like, we shouldn't be hung up about stuff. We can't have se sex is so simple for every other animal. Right. It's just like I get in there, boom, I got a baby. Whoa. We're also, and we're over here going like, I'm ashamed covered

3 (1h 47m 9s):
In clothes, which is just a Bazar invention. Right. What a Bazar thing we've done to our bodies where we can no longer exist in the atmosphere. Even if it's warm. People wear clothes. Like it's become a, a thing where you're shielding your genitals from the other people because they represent your sex

4 (1h 47m 28s):
Well also though, I have heard that when people, when when uncontacted tribes really like old school, you know, sustenance, living sort of iron, age level tribes come out of isolation and decide to join the world. A big part what they want is clothes. Mm. I think it might be really cold out there just in life. Oh yeah. With no

3 (1h 47m 51s):
Clothes. Well, it definitely is sometimes. Yeah. It's not perfect all the time. But I think that's why we used to be hairy. Right.

4 (1h 47m 58s):
I still have some of that. It doesn't seem to help I mean. There's

3 (1h 48m 0s):
Some fucking dudes in Russia. There's some Russian wrestlers that look like, they look like a human lived 200,000 years ago.

4 (1h 48m 9s):
Looked like

3 (1h 48m 10s):
They're fucking covered in hair. Like everything all the way their neck, all the way through their back, their chest, their arms, full thick hair. Yeah. It's like, that's probably what we were like, you ever seen a real heavy hairy Russian wrestler?

4 (1h 48m 23s):
Sure. I

3 (1h 48m 23s):
Mean, look at this dude.

4 (1h 48m 25s):
Oh yeah. That's my guy right

3 (1h 48m 26s):
There. I mean this is a man that exists right now. But

4 (1h 48m 28s):
He doesn't look like he would stay warm in the winter. No,

3 (1h 48m 31s):
No, no. Because it used to be a lot thicker. Yeah. But I think that was slowly over time when we chose to wear clothes. We invented clothes and chose to wear clothes. I think slowly over time people lost all their body hair. But I think at one point in time, when you see these really fu go, that other picture of him where you see his back and everything. That one, that one. Perfect. Perfect. That one. That's a fucking different kind of hair than the average person has. That dude has long hair on his shoulders.

4 (1h 48m 57s):
Do you think you, you, you think that like if you have more hair, your, your older school probably like your genetics or older

3 (1h 49m 5s):
School. Yeah, probably. Probably. Why they're so good at wrestling too. They're probably, well there's that whole thing strongest as shit.

4 (1h 49m 9s):
There's that whole thing that we have all, we all have some, a little bit of Neanderthal DNA. Yeah. I have a

3 (1h 49m 13s):
Shit ton. Do you? Yeah. Yeah. Look at how fucking hairy these dudes are. I think this is just the 2023 version. I bet if you could go back 200,000 years ago, people were just covered in hair. Right. I I mean then that's what they think about like ancient hominids. It's not like one day they weren't hairy.

4 (1h 49m 31s):
So you think I might be like quite a man.

3 (1h 49m 34s):
A little manly there.

4 (1h 49m 34s):
Thank you. How's

3 (1h 49m 36s):
The

4 (1h 49m 36s):
Back? Back is clean Dude, don don't know how. I don't know why. It's a blessing. Yeah. I'm telling you this. Life is magical. I got a hair your back. Do you really? Yeah. You don't. Are you a shaver?

3 (1h 49m 46s):
I have my, I get my wife to shave my back. Really?

4 (1h 49m 48s):
Yeah. Can you imagine what would happen if I asked Natasha to shave my back?

3 (1h 49m 51s):
It would be a problem.

4 (1h 49m 52s):
It would be a no. I could tell you that

3 (1h 49m 56s):
She would do with those gloves. The ones that go all the way up to the elbow and she'd be complaining the entire time. but it Yeah. Darling I don. but it would be hilarious. It would be hilarious. She'd probably film that.

4 (1h 50m 6s):
She would never, I cannot even, I love this image though. Elbow length gloves. She's got a custom made razor with golden pearls on it. Fucking face shield shaking the covid shield.

3 (1h 50m 21s):
Yeah. I get hairy.

4 (1h 50m 24s):
As do I. Yeah.

3 (1h 50m 25s):
I get itchy though too. When I get too much hair. It pulls up in between my tits and I get itchy. Do

4 (1h 50m 31s):
You shave your arms?

3 (1h 50m 32s):
No. Not mo most of the time not. but it, I have, I have a few times. It makes my tattoos look better.

4 (1h 50m 37s):
I mean you don't look very hairy from here.

3 (1h 50m 39s):
Yeah. They hair you can see it. You get close. Just 'cause it's all tattoos.

4 (1h 50m 43s):
My hair stop. I swear to God my hair stops here. Mm. Interesting. It's like I have a reverse farmer's tan.

3 (1h 50m 48s):
Interesting. Yeah. Well maybe your people for the longest time wore short sleeves.

4 (1h 50m 52s):
That could be true. That's probably what it was. You really think that? Yeah.

3 (1h 50m 55s):
Yeah. I think that's why people have hairy forearms for the most part. But they don't usually have Harry's shoulders. I think that's where it comes from.

4 (1h 51m 3s):
Evolutionarily.

3 (1h 51m 4s):
I think the whole thing comes from close. I think our, our whole adaptation to I mean, if you look at it like I would imagine urban people, like if collectively people who've lived in urban environments for longer periods of time probably have less body hair than, you know, if you follow their genetics than people who live in like very cold rural climates. Like fucking Canadian men that live in like Alberta. Right. They're probably hairier dudes.

4 (1h 51m 31s):
It's weird that with what you're talking about, you're kind of talking in a, in a strange way it reminds me of like original sin too. It's like straight up biblical. Right?

3 (1h 51m 40s):
Right. We've lost our abilities.

4 (1h 51m 42s):
The pri the first big event that occurs is something goes wrong and people and the human becomes aware of its nakedness. It's not what it it it's what you're talking about. Not what I'm, it's not about cold. It's about like shame. Yeah. Like what I do believe in answer to a question you asked me two hours ago, like, are all of these rules somehow connected to a functional, nearly scientific corollary? Right. Like trinos or whatever. Yeah. I do believe that in on some level, every bit of biblical information, every bit of religious information, it has some sort of allegorical and metaphorical connection to our past. Like what does it mean that Adam and Eve saw their nakedness and realized they were naked and decided to cover up?

4 (1h 52m 26s):
It speaks to like a historical truth. Definitely. I don't think Adam and Eve saw their nakedness and we're ashamed, but something occurred where we realized we are naked in the world and we must cover, we must cover because people can't look at what we're doing.

3 (1h 52m 38s):
Which just makes sense that once they started wearing clothes, seeing people without clothes would be just this shocking thing.

4 (1h 52m 44s):
I can tell you an exact corollary for that in my personal life. Mm. When I go to Burning Man, this last year was my 24th time at Burning Man. Oh my Jesus. I've going since 96

3 (1h 52m 53s):
And you're stone cold sober. How dare you

4 (1h 52m 54s):
Stone sober the whole time. How

3 (1h 52m 56s):
Dare you?

4 (1h 52m 57s):
I'm the guy, I'm the designated driver. When I get there. I a lot of nudity. Less so every year as things get a little bit more sanitary there. But over the years, lots of nudity. It was one of the primary characteristics, women running around naked. Everybody naked. I will be like zero Titillation. Like nothing about it is like Haina. Ooh, mama, look at that hot naked lady. Zero.

3 (1h 53m 20s):
Because it becomes normal.

4 (1h 53m 21s):
Then I get back to the states a low cut dress. I'm like, whoa, look at that over there. Oh, a little cleavage. Interesting. Like my, your mind can adjust based on your circumstances. Like it's erotic. It's like there's zero erotic charge after a week at Burning Man to see a naked woman running by fully naked.

3 (1h 53m 37s):
Well, isn't that why lingerie exists? 'cause the whole thrill is like taking it off.

4 (1h 53m 42s):
I

3 (1h 53m 42s):
Don't, the thrill is that it's very sheer and there's very little of it. Like, Ooh, look at that.

4 (1h 53m 47s):
I feel that lingerie is a con and that I've never met a man that likes it.

3 (1h 53m 51s):
Interesting. Do you love it? We'll get to that in a moment. Okay.

4 (1h 53m 53s):
We'll

3 (1h 53m 54s):
Be right back. Humans appear relatively hairless compared to our other APE relatives, but the density of the hair follicles in our skin is actually the same as would be expected. An eight hour size. Whoa. The follicle, the fine hairs that cover our bodies, which have replaced the thicker ones seen in our close relatives are thought to be an evolutionary leftover from our hair ancestors. Yeah, there it is. Makes sense. This, this is what I, oh, news s Oh wow. Now scientists find these fine hairs are useful after all with people with, more of them are better at detecting bedbugs.

4 (1h 54m 26s):
More fine hairs means you're better at detecting bedbugs. You

3 (1h 54m 29s):
Probably feel them more female ancestors preferred a bug free mate. And so opted for hairier guys. Whoa.

4 (1h 54m 38s):
Oh, that's really interesting. How

3 (1h 54m 39s):
Weird.

4 (1h 54m 40s):
I've had crabs. You ever have that?

3 (1h 54m 41s):
No, I have not. I've dodged that bullet. The research has found that body hair significantly enhanced how well people detected the bedbugs. Which participants noticing the bugs on the hairy arm quicker than they did when tested on the hairless arm. Interesting. The hair serving its motion detectors. Whoa. The hair also prolonged how long it took the parasites to find places to feed, presumably because they hindered movement. Interesting.

4 (1h 55m 8s):
So wait, it's better to have hair or

3 (1h 55m 10s):
Worse. Yeah. Follicles. Better to have follicles to better have some hairs.

4 (1h 55m 14s):
When I got crabs Mm. I was living with my mother.

3 (1h 55m 17s):
Oh shit.

4 (1h 55m 18s):
And how old were you? I was probably 18, 17, something like that. And they tell you at the clinic, they say anybody that lives with you, you gotta give them this insecticide too.

3 (1h 55m 28s):
Oh no. So I had to go. So you had a sign to your mom, but you got crabs. Holy shit.

4 (1h 55m 34s):
And she had to slather herself in insecticide and sleep overnight with

3 (1h 55m 38s):
It. How mad, how mad was she at you?

4 (1h 55m 40s):
I'm lucky in that my mom is probably the most sexually open-minded woman in the universe. And she was not mad at all. She was, she thought, I think she thought it was funny. Oh,

3 (1h 55m 50s):
That's

4 (1h 55m 50s):
Cool. Yeah. My mom was what a great

3 (1h 55m 52s):
Mom.

4 (1h 55m 52s):
Very chill about things like that. There was a time once

3 (1h 55m 55s):
Probably happy you were getting some that

4 (1h 55m 56s):
No, really? She used to sit my brother and I down on Tuesday nights and read to us from a book called Boys and Sex. Whoa. And she was just like O open when she found porn, when I hit puberty and she found porn. She took the porn and rather than yell at me, she brought me to like a, a lesbian, like a, a vibrator, a feminist vibrator shop. And she said, you can pick any of the lesbian text based erotica that you want. She wanted to make sure if I was looking at porn, it would have like 90 pages of prose poetry before we got to the good stuff. That's the kind of woman my mother was. She didn't Interesting is she didn't care at all. Very open-minded. Well,

3 (1h 56m 30s):
That's lucky. Especially in the crab situation.

4 (1h 56m 33s):
Well definitely in that situation,

3 (1h 56m 35s):
The whole idea of vd killing people is so strange. But like that's a lot of the ways people died. Back in the day it was syphilis,

4 (1h 56m 43s):
Right? Syphilis untreated. Well, you couldn't treat it right. It was this was pre

3 (1h 56m 46s):
Nothing they can do before. Right. Antibiotics and penicillin and all that shit. Yeah. Of course. What the fuck did they do I mean? That's literally your, your skin rotted out.

4 (1h 56m 56s):
I've never had any of those. of course I've only had the Of course. I've only had the bugs.

3 (1h 56m 59s):
Don don't think people get it anymore. If they do get it, they can cure it now. Is that

4 (1h 57m 2s):
True? No. People must phi still

3 (1h 57m 3s):
Phis. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You can get it. But I think they can cure it now.

4 (1h 57m 7s):
It won't kill

3 (1h 57m 7s):
You. No. I think they just give you penicillin, I believe.

4 (1h 57m 10s):
Do you know that rabies not to change the subject off Kill

3 (1h 57m 12s):
Everybody. It

4 (1h 57m 13s):
Will kill 100% of people that display symptoms. Kill, kill, kill everybody. It's crazy.

3 (1h 57m 17s):
Yeah. If you get bit by something with rabies, you have to take painful shots. I think they go into your stomach. I think it's a large needle that goes into your stomach and I think you have to do it multiple times. and I think if you don't do it within a certain period of time, you're done. There

4 (1h 57m 30s):
Was a crazy story about the, the first woman person who ever survived symptomatic rabies that I heard on, I think Radiolab, that basically she started displaying all these symptoms and like fear of water rage, all that kind of stuff. And that's fatal 100% of the time. Yeah. But this, anyway, they, her parents took her to the doctor and they go, this really made me laugh. It's tragic, but it made me laugh. The doctor's like, has anything unusual happened? Anything that you think could have maybe brought this about? And they're like, no, nothing We can think of nothing. Not bitten by a dog or a bat. They go, oh no. Yeah, she was bit by a bat. Is that what you're talking about? Yeah. She was bit by a bat, she was at church and a bat flew under her nose and bit her I was like, yeah, I think that that might have been the in Jesus point.

4 (1h 58m 13s):
Jesus. But anyway, they put her into a coma, into, 'cause something weird about rabies apparently, like your body, it's kind of what we're talking about with human evolution. Your body can beat it, but it, it, I I'm not gonna articulate this well. Your body can moves to beat it, but it moves at just below the speed of the virus. Ooh. The virus moves faster than your body's ability to beat it. If you weren't, if the virus was slower, then your body would cure it. but it it like it, it goes faster. Mm. And so they put this girl into an imposed coma and slowed down somehow in ways I don't understand. Slowed down her, her system in such a way that the, that the, the rabies went a little bit more dormant and then her body was able to supersede the speed of the virus.

4 (1h 58m 60s):
And do

3 (1h 59m 0s):
They still do that? Do they Well now they do, they

4 (1h 59m 2s):
Do it regularly now, but it doesn't work. It's not like a universal cure. I

3 (1h 59m 7s):
Guess the Milwaukee protocol recommends inducing therapeutic coma by ketamine. And back to the rave scene mid there it is midazolam during rabies participants the first week of ICU admittance.

4 (1h 59m 18s):
So yeah, it's s like, it's a system now and it doesn't work like well, but it works a lot better than the,

3 (1h 59m 22s):
It's the ability of the natural host immune response to clear the rabies virus that the patient's purpo supported through the intense oxic ExoToxic phase is the basic premise of the strategy. So that makes sense too, because you'd be able to hydrate them. Because one of the things that happens to people, they, they no longer can drink any water.

4 (1h 59m 40s):
Fear of water isn't that

3 (1h 59m 41s):
They, they just start throwing it up as soon as it gets in their mouth.

4 (1h 59m 44s):
They said in that, in that that podcast that, that rabies presents this in the way that a an ancient an by ancient like million year old disease present. It doesn't feel similar to the more modern diseases and pathologies, pathogens that we have in our systems now. That the way it presents is like, it's like an ancient killer. Ooh. It's like a ghost of our past.

3 (2h 0m 7s):
It's crazy how common it is in the animal kingdom too. Right. And it's really wild that it gets animals to bite you, to give it to you too. That's why,

4 (2h 0m 15s):
That's how it spreads. It feels evil. Right. It doesn't feel like very evil. Feel like a sickness, like

3 (2h 0m 19s):
A vampire.

4 (2h 0m 20s):
Yeah. Oh,

3 (2h 0m 20s):
Right. That's Minnesota man. Yeah. First reported fatality due to rabies in the United States, despite receiving appropriate post-exposure prophylaxis according to recent article published in clinical infectious, he 84, 80 4-year-old man had died in 2021, about six months after waking up in the morning while a rabid bat was biting on his right hand.

4 (2h 0m 40s):
Now this is what we should be afraid of. Bats. This is the scary thing.

3 (2h 0m 43s):
Think about it. but it is rabies, right? Because it is vampires 'cause vampire bat bats. I think

4 (2h 0m 47s):
You're right. And they're scared of water. It all seems like animals. People

7 (2h 0m 49s):
Used to use garlic to keep bats away. Is that true? I mean it's not a hundred percent effective, but that's medieval times. That's

3 (2h 0m 56s):
Really interesting how the vampire thing probably

4 (2h 0m 58s):
Rabies. How do we solve this? Bam.

3 (2h 0m 59s):
We did it. We did it, dude. But dude,

4 (2h 1m 1s):
Rabies by the way, is like the fact that it kill that article said what? It it killed the guy who took the appropriate

3 (2h 1m 9s):
Yeah. But he was old if that

4 (2h 1m 11s):
Happened. Yeah. We're fucked. You ever, you know what the Tasmanian devil

3 (2h 1m 15s):
Yeah.

4 (2h 1m 15s):
The, it's, they're all dying of a contagious face cancer.

3 (2h 1m 18s):
Yeah. It's like, it's like a vd, right? Isn't

4 (2h 1m 21s):
It? Is that what it is? It's a cancer though, right? It's cancer. Imagine cancer goes contagious. Right? That's the scariest thing I've ever heard in my life. The fact that it can exist in one animal means it could exist in all of them. Very, very scary.

3 (2h 1m 33s):
What is it from? Okay. Tasmanian devils are affected by two independent transmissible cancers known as the devil facial tumor and the devil Facial tumor. Facial tumor too. Both cancers are spread by biting and cause the appearance of tumors in the face or inside the mouth of affected Tasmanian devils. So that's not this sexually transmitted

4 (2h 1m 51s):
Disease. No. Speaking of a disease feeling mean like what you're saying with rabies, the reason that they Oh, why That's crazy. The reason that they transmitted it so much. They have the cancer in their, in their thing and they've got a behavioral tick where the way that they, I think fight is to like mash their faces together so they, they have the confluence of the disease that, that can spread that way and the behavioral tick that allows it to spread. These viruses are just like us. They want out. They want to live, they wanna survive, you know? And they will somehow, weirdly find a way to, to spread themselves. So

3 (2h 2m 23s):
That's why variants are so strange. Like the, the virus will find out that you have some immunity to some certain aspect of it. And so they just slightly change. So it sneaks past your immune system.

4 (2h 2m 34s):
I had a weird, very cosmic theory about the, the pandemic and covid. I I know that you don't cotton with conspiracy theories about covid, but I do. No, I'm joking. The, that I, this is more sort of metaphysical though. When we were raised our fam, like I remember being told to wash my hands like all the time. Right. But I don't really feel like, I told my kids that like, it wasn't like, it used to be like almost religious, like wash, wash, wash, wash. And then by the time I had my kid, I told her to wash your hands. but it wasn't like you must, right. And then all of a sudden a new pathogen came into the human genome and it was like, I mean, obviously I don't think that washing hands is that big of a deal with covid.

4 (2h 3m 19s):
But I had this thought, what if viruses go like dormant until we kind of, for, because the reason, this is my big weird theory. The reason that we were told wash, wash, wash is residual trauma from Spanish flu. This is my theory here. Mm. Right. It's like, it's like your grandparents lived through that and then they embedded it in your parents, like, wash your hands. It's super important. And then it got to you. Yeah. And then it started to fade away a little bit. And then all of a sudden you have a new pathogen. I was like, what if these viruses have a little like a weird sort of animal consciousness of like, okay, they've forgotten about the washing hands thing. Let's, let's pop up into the human population anyway. I know It's a little kooky. Yeah.

3 (2h 3m 57s):
That virus that, I don't think that's it. The, the Spanish flu one's weird. 'cause you know, the people didn't really die from the Spanish flu. They, that died of other diseases that they got while they had the Spanish flu. Like what did they die of? They died of Oh, meningitis. Ence. There was a bunch of different things that people died from. All of which would be cured by antibiotics today.

4 (2h 4m 22s):
Do you know how it got the name of Spanish flu? This is an interesting story.

3 (2h 4m 25s):
I do, but I forgot

4 (2h 4m 26s):
Basically that it wasn't Spanish. It

3 (2h 4m 28s):
Came in, it was in America.

4 (2h 4m 29s):
It started in America. Yeah. But we were in the midst of World War I and so every country was in this like medium embargo to not say, oh God, there's a new disease in America. 'cause it would've made our army look weak. And, and Right. And every other country didn't wanna admit it either. But Spain was either not involved in the war or didn't have that embargo. Somehow they reported the disease. And so they, so for the rest of time, the Spanish Spanish Flu. Flu, wow. Another weird thing I found out, the flu that you get today is, is the Spanish flu. It's the variant that that sprung off from the Spanish flu. Mm. Like weakened and weakened and weakened an infinite amount of times. But the thing that we get that we call flu is just the, the cousin of the Spanish flu. Wow.

3 (2h 5m 9s):
And the reason why it's weak is 'cause it serves the virus better to not kill you. Exactly. 'cause it could spread to more people. What a weird fucking thing.

4 (2h 5m 18s):
It's wild. It's almost like they i a life, I don't mean literally with my cockamamie theory that it was consciousness. Let's go back. I mean more like that. Like, like that it'll weaken in order to be effective. And which is the

3 (2h 5m 29s):
Fact that it can do that, that it adjusts and changes. That's what's really scary. Like a lot of people are scared of this disease called CWD right now. CWD is called chronic wasting disease and it's affected a lot of deer. And there's deer all over the country that have this chronic wasting disease. and it hasn't jumped to humans. I think it has jumped to some mice. I think there's, in some parts of the country, they've tested mice and they tested positive for this stuff, but it hasn't jumped. It's a PreOn disease. So it's like mad cow.

4 (2h 5m 58s):
Oh,

3 (2h 5m 59s):
Like, you know, tz felds disease. And then if you get it, you are fucked. You're fucked. And the the end is horrific. You know, the, these deer wandering around just drooling, emaciated, they look like skeletons and they're just like, like zombies.

4 (2h 6m 16s):
I don't like this chronic wasting disease one

3 (2h 6m 17s):
Bit. Well it's very scary. It's all these things are scary because occasionally they jump right. Because these things, they can figure out a way to change. They, they morph over time.

4 (2h 6m 28s):
It's not, if it is when with pathogens jumping into Yeah, it will 100 it will happen.

3 (2h 6m 35s):
Especially with large scale agriculture. Right. Right. And the thing about large scale, especially industrial agriculture, is it's very unsanitary. It's fucking disgusting. Yeah. And just like how the plague was started in all these different parts of the world because people were shitting in the streets and living in filth and no sanitation. And that's probably exactly how it starts with them as well. The virus is particularly deadly because it triggered a cytokine storm. Ra ravaging the strong You're talking about the Spanish flu? Yeah, Spanish flu. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, about that. That's

4 (2h 7m 5s):
One of the weirdest facet ts of Spanish flu. Although viral, it killed young healthy people more than it killed old and infirm.

3 (2h 7m 11s):
Yeah. It killed young soldiers. Apparently they was no more aggressive than previous influenza. Strains. Malnourishment, overcrowded medical camps and hospitals. Poor hygiene exacerbated by the war, promoted bacterial, super infection, killing most of the victims after a typically prolonged deathbed.

4 (2h 7m 30s):
That is crazy.

3 (2h 7m 30s):
Yeah. Super infection is a scary word, man.

4 (2h 7m 33s):
Promoted. It was the

3 (2h 7m 34s):
War. Yep. So it's

4 (2h 7m 35s):
Like, it's like we became a part of the pathogen. Human society became a part of the pathogen that allowed it to kill. Gnarly.

3 (2h 7m 43s):
Apparently the 2009 swine flu was really bad too. Burke got that. He says the closest he ever felt to dying

4 (2h 7m 50s):
Scary.

3 (2h 7m 50s):
He said it was horrible. He said the worst flu he's ever got in his life, he was wrecked forever. What about a new non-flu influenza virus? Like the one called

7 (2h 7m 59s):
There. It was,

3 (2h 8m 0s):
What was this, say this part, however, as historical records dating back to the 1700 show, every 10 to 40 years the world suffers a global flu. Flu pandemic. The result of a major antigenic drift. The virus mutates so much that the human body no longer recognizes it and it is left defenseless. Woo. The resulting epidemic spreads faster than scientists can isolate producing and distribute a vaccine. This is what happened in 1918.

4 (2h 8m 29s):
Dude, this is sort of my, this is kind of my cockamamie theory, kind

3 (2h 8m 32s):
Of, sort of Well I mean, if you think about all the different diseases that kill people, they are coexisting life forms. You know that they Right. Viruses and bacteria. They're a type of life. Some sort of, we I don don don't know if they know, if they really call viruses life forms, they don't, they they, they categorize 'em in a different way. But it's essentially, it is like a life form.

4 (2h 8m 53s):
It's the same thing. It just wants to fuck. It's just like

3 (2h 8m 56s):
Marshall. Yeah. It just wants to live in your body. Yeah. Yeah. And, and, and reproduce in there and get to other people. But the the wildest one is rabies. 'cause it makes the animals bite so that they get it too. So that other people get it, other animals get it. It makes them more aggressive.

4 (2h 9m 9s):
It's really a, like I said that it's like a prehistoric a a megalodon. It's coming from our, our past

3 (2h 9m 17s):
Dinosaur

4 (2h 9m 17s):
Disease. Yeah.

3 (2h 9m 19s):
Well that was the, the premise of 28 days later. Right. Remember that movie, right? Yeah. They created one and gave it to chimps and the chimps just biting people and people are biting. I showed you this before that movie Fucking Rules man.

4 (2h 9m 30s):
I do love that movie.

7 (2h 9m 31s):
The great manure crisis of 1894. This also caused a lot of disease problems.

3 (2h 9m 35s):
Yeah. The the streets because everywhere had a horse were filled with shit. That's all hu That's all horse shit that click on that one up there that has a text below it. 99%. Yeah, that one. Look at that. That's manure. That's shit all throughout the street. So you're smelling shit. Everyone's getting shit in their nostrils. You're getting, if you're smelling it, that means that some of that is getting in your body. You're inhaling shit. They were vacant.

7 (2h 9m 59s):
Lobster was piled over 60 feet high. Oh.

4 (2h 10m 2s):
But on a positive note that pranks are on TikTok. This was a glory year for him. He was able to find buckets of shit right at his very feet.

3 (2h 10m 9s):
They didn't have YouTube back then. He really couldn't make a living. I mean don don't think he's making a living. I think he's he's arrested. Yeah.

4 (2h 10m 17s):
I think that's good. Look

3 (2h 10m 18s):
At that. 1894,

4 (2h 10m 20s):
A great horse manure crisis in 1890

3 (2h 10m 22s):
Until they figured out cars. That's how people got around. You had to ride a fucking animal. Well, shit. Which is pretty wild. That's pretty recent.

4 (2h 10m 28s):
What's what's

3 (2h 10m 29s):
That? That until like 200 years ago you had to ride a fucking animal.

4 (2h 10m 32s):
Oh, it's wild there. And in that poor things, there was a, I think it was historical sword of semi historical. There was a, a combustion engine cab, but it was, it was a stage coach with a fake horse head on it at the very beginning of stage coaches, people were so used to having a horse in front. It would just be like a little head. That

3 (2h 10m 47s):
Makes sense.

4 (2h 10m 48s):
Godfather style. Yeah.

3 (2h 10m 50s):
It's it's crazy how much the world has changed in 200 years and

4 (2h 10m 56s):
It feels unsustainable. Oh. Have you heard this? You know, you know about the ESE paradox, right? This comes brings it Fermi.

3 (2h 11m 3s):
Yeah. Yeah. The, the space paradox. Yeah.

4 (2h 11m 6s):
Okay. So you know that, do you hear the, I'm sure you did the latest like theory on why they, because that's the question that it raises. If there's infinite amount of planets, where are the people? Where are the aliens? Right. And the new theory, this really sent a chill down my spine, is that every planet goes through the same basic process, which is that they become in 200 years, they go from pre industrial revolution to industrial revolution to strip mining their themselves for, for resources. And then their population explodes because they can sustain more population and they need to extract more resources. And then they go to get to their like space age. And by the time human, any planet gets to like space exploration, it has exploded in population and resource stripping to such a degree that they reach a decision that they have to make.

4 (2h 11m 55s):
Every society is either we continue to strip mine and populate and go extinct because we're gonna run out of room and resources or we shut down and do an imposed like dark ages

3 (2h 12m 9s):
Population

4 (2h 12m 9s):
Control. Just like shut everything down. Stop the, so we'll, we will never evolve to the point where we can get to an earth because we all go through the same historical arc.

3 (2h 12m 19s):
Or maybe it's a longer arc than we think. That could be true. of course. And maybe Of course we're in the middle of it. And maybe that's what asteroids are for. Maybe asteroids come along when we get a little cocky and they slam into the earth and we start from scratch again. Right. And then we have the same genetics as the intelligent people that figured out how to build the pyramids. But we are this new confused, barbaric version of it that's been fucking eating rats for a thousand years. Oh,

4 (2h 12m 42s):
I like that. So it's, there's not just an infinite amount of Joes and Moshes. There's an infinite amount of human populations. Yeah. Like just re regenerating and regenerating for an infinite amount of time till we get to the good one. Well

3 (2h 12m 52s):
I'm a big fan of what they call the younger Dries impact theory. And the younger Dries impact theory is based on a bunch of things. But one of the things that's based on is core samples. When they've done these core samples, they show that around 11,800 years ago, without a doubt, the earth was hit by comets. And they think this is what happened that stopped the ice age. This is why the polar ice caps that they used to be ice covering North America, half of North America be a mile plus sheet of ice. Yeah. That was, and then it all stopped very quickly. and it also caused the death, the extinction of 65% of the mammals that lived.

4 (2h 13m 32s):
Right. I've heard about that.

3 (2h 13m 33s):
Yeah. Yeah. And they think the people that are proponents of this theory, like Graham Hancock and Renold Carlson, they think that human beings had achieved a very high level of sophistication and probably a different direction that we have now. Yeah. And that's the pyramids. That's go Beckley, tepi. That's all these ancient structures that they, they don't understand how people could have explained or built, you know, a long, long, long fucking time ago that we can't do now. Right. And that, that's what happened. The impacts happen and then society rebuilds thousands of years later. Right. So thousands of years of barbarism and then 6,000 years ago in Mesopotamia, language written language emerges agriculture, they start, they start figuring things out again.

4 (2h 14m 11s):
It's like Atlantis. Yeah. Yes. Natasha was into this documentary. Yes. That was, yeah, I remember

3 (2h 14m 16s):
This now. Ancient apocalypse That's right on Netflix's. It's amazing. And it's very likely that that's, there's physical evidence now. It used to be this wacky theory and people would say, well, there's no evidence of that theory. And then they started discovering things that they like go Beckley, TE's the best example that are absolutely, absolutely over 11,000 years old. And so they go, okay, 11,000 years ago people were building these complex stone structures. Like how the fuck did they do that when we thought people were hunter gatherers back then? Right, right. And then when they find these core samples, there's a high level of iridium in that time period. And that's very common in space and very rare on earth. And it's like a sheet of it. As long as also with a sheet in a lot of these areas, it's just pure carbon where it seems like everything burned.

3 (2h 14m 60s):
And so it's very likely that we were pelted and it's very likely it's gonna happen again. Every June and every November we pass through this comet

4 (2h 15m 8s):
Storm. You always do this to me. You're the one that told me about the Supervolcano. Yes. and I have, you know, I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since you

3 (2h 15m 14s):
Should think

4 (2h 15m 14s):
About it. Why, what good does it do me? It

3 (2h 15m 16s):
Doesn't do you any good, but it's good to know that every six to 800,000 years

4 (2h 15m 19s):
Don't read.

3 (2h 15m 20s):
Yellowstone goes,

4 (2h 15m 21s):
Don't re

3 (2h 15m 22s):
When Yellowstone this

4 (2h 15m 22s):
Information, we go it's,

3 (2h 15m 24s):
It's a wrap.

4 (2h 15m 24s):
Oh man, it's

3 (2h 15m 25s):
A continent killer.

4 (2h 15m 26s):
Oh, I don't want that. I don't want wasting disease. don don't want continent killer. And yeah, You don't want those other things I don't want.

3 (2h 15m 33s):
But maybe those are the things that keep us from getting to the place where we nuke each other into oblivion. Maybe those are the reset buttons of the universe where if we go down the bad path and maybe there's this race to try to be, to have good morals and ethics and have society evolve at the same level that the human mind and technology evolves and to overcome this constant need for war and controlling resources which have dominated human culture from the beginning of time. And that maybe it's this battle, right. And maybe this culture war that we're all fighting, that people are complaining about now. Maybe part of that is this sort of struggle to achieve a higher level of existence.

3 (2h 16m 14s):
And maybe it's done in the wrong way on both sides to a certain extent. But ultimately what it is is trying to sort out what's right and what's wrong and what's good and what's bad and why certain things take place. And if we don't, if we don't get to that and we keep, keep engaging in wars, then we never reach a technological level of sophistication that allows us to stop natural disasters. Right.

4 (2h 16m 38s):
Right.

3 (2h 16m 38s):
So if we can get to a point where we can knock asteroids out of the sky and do something to release the pressure of the super volcano and figure out a way to not have people starve and fig and all those things could be accomplished. If we get to a certain point and I think we're in a race and I think AI plays a gigantic part of that race and I think the race just got really fucking weird. That's what I think. Yeah.

4 (2h 17m 2s):
That, well Neuralink I mean, you know, the the, the doomsday scenario of ai. And by the way, you're an optimist. That's interesting. I didn't know that. It seems like you're kind of an optimist. I'm

3 (2h 17m 13s):
Optimistic, I think, I think human beings generally society, if it exists long enough, there's always going to be terrible moments. But ultimately people want the same thing. They want their community to be good. They want their friends to live, they want their families to live. You're terrified of other people that might want to take from you the thing that gives you joy and happiness and community and love. But ultimately I think we're gonna figure out a way if human beings can exist long enough where we can work things out much better than we're doing right now. and I think one of the things that hinders our ability to work things out is just like you were talking about sign language like that your sign from America is different than the sign from the United Kingdom.

3 (2h 17m 56s):
I think if we develop a universal language through translation, through technology, we will eliminate a lot of miscommunication and a lot of this failure to understand each other. Because we look at each other as the other. We look at each other as something that's very different than us. Right. And they're already doing that on Samsung phones. Samsung phones, the new Galaxy S 24 Ultra comes out with ai and one of the features of AI is a translate. So we can sit apart from each other. And in real time, this thing could take your, if you're speaking French in my

4 (2h 18m 29s):
Headphones,

3 (2h 18m 30s):
You could do it in your ears, in your headphones, or you could do it on the phone in written language. Yeah, it does both. And if it's in headphones, we both have it. and I could talk to you in English and you could understand it if you speak French. 'cause it'll translate into perfect French and then, or close enough as it is. Right. It'll get better. And then you can speak French and I will hear it in English.

4 (2h 18m 48s):
We need that for like a liberal and conservative. Yeah. You just put headphones in and it's like, oh, that's what you meant. Yes. Okay. You're okay.

3 (2h 18m 53s):
It's not even that I mean that's the tribal part. Right. The right. Completely. The tribal part is that people just adopt ideologies wholeheartedly. And if you don't, you're not on the team. Just like the people that were in your neighborhood looked at you weird like you were a goem. Because you're right. Not it's all the way in. Right.

4 (2h 19m 9s):
It's tri tribalism is, tribalism is the downfall of society and, and it, but I also, I love tribes. I do love if

3 (2h 19m 17s):
They're cool tribes. Yeah. It's, we just need charitable conscientious tribes that are kind to other people. Right. And just enjoy the differences instead of thinking the differences as being like some sort of a negative.

4 (2h 19m 29s):
And that's what you're saying is that we're hopefully we're evolving towards a situation. Yeah. Where with a universal language or at least a universal understanding, you can see someone that's different and think that they're not, what do they, the difference between Isn't that awful to, isn't that interesting? Yes,

3 (2h 19m 43s):
It's and, and then because we're in a growth phase, you're gonna go through overcorrections. I think a lot of the cultural war that we're involved in right now, all the craziness that's happening in society, it's an overcorrection. And then people are gonna get fed up with it and they're gonna move into a more conservative direction and then they'll get fed up with that and then they'll move to a more liberal direction. And it's like, it goes back and forth because we're trying to figure out what's the right way to do it. And we're basing life on what we were taught by people who didn't know what the fuck they were doing right. Which is most of our parents. And most of their parents, like, they didn't know what the fuck they were doing. They that my grandparents didn't know what the fuck was going on in the world. They raised kids. They didn't know what, what the fuck was happening. They raised me, I know, I barely know what the fuck is going on.

3 (2h 20m 25s):
My kids know more than me that their generation will figure it out a little bit better. And if we can stay alive, right, we can eventually get to some commonality. And we can realize that a lot of this stupidity is based on our, our human system of these tribal interactions. It's kind of ingrained in our genetics. Or

4 (2h 20m 43s):
We need to mega a enemy. Maybe that's ai. We all come together as a tribe. Or UFOs. Or

3 (2h 20m 47s):
UFOs. That's our mega enemy.

4 (2h 20m 48s):
Will you please get here guys? 'cause we need to solve some of these problems here. I think they're here

3 (2h 20m 52s):
Already.

4 (2h 20m 52s):
Oh yeah.

3 (2h 20m 53s):
I think they've always been

4 (2h 20m 54s):
Here. Why don't they just be like, Hey, what's, I think

3 (2h 20m 56s):
They're interdimensional and I. Think I, I've been reading this. I've been reading Diane Paco's new book, the other book. The first one. Yeah. Yeah. That's

4 (2h 21m 3s):
The one I

3 (2h 21m 3s):
Got through. Yeah. So I, this lady who's a religious scholar, I'm reading American Cosmic. Now we gotta get you outta

4 (2h 21m 9s):
Here. Oh, sorry. Yeah. I, I have a book event tonight. It's I know tonight's the Night and

3 (2h 21m 13s):
With Duncan

4 (2h 21m 14s):
With Dunking Tonight. Yeah. I'm, I'm super excited, but I could fucking talk to you all, all night. This is, yeah.

3 (2h 21m 19s):
We'll, we'll wrap this up, but I'll recommend this book to people. It's called American Cosmic, and it's essentially about this whole flying saucer UI just did a whole podcast with the woman, but now, now this is a previous book that I'm reading and it connects it to religion and it connects it to the stories in the Bible of Ezekiel. The Ezekiel is essentially seeing a UFO and that these things are not just a physical thing, that they're, there's some sort of a psychological aspect to them. There's some sort of a frequency that we connect to occasionally as human beings as thinking creatures.

4 (2h 21m 53s):
You're saying we get to a state of kind of enlightenment where the a dimensional portal opens up for a split second. And that's what we see.

3 (2h 22m 1s):
I don't know if you would call it enlightenment, a a

4 (2h 22m 4s):
Or frenzy spiritual frenzy

3 (2h 22m 6s):
State. A state of, of able being able to receive whatever the frequency these things operate on. and it's, I I think it's based on the of, I think there's a lot of stories from ancient religion that's probably based on this. and I think as, as we get more and more of an understanding of quantum physics and this concept of dimensions and this concept of the ability of something that's far more advanced than us to manipulate dimensions and to visit back and forth. And that the potential is that maybe that is where all intelligent life forms eventually evolve too. If given enough time and they do it correctly, they become interdimensional travelers.

3 (2h 22m 47s):
And that what we're looking at good. When we're looking at these grays, these weird looking things. Yeah. That's us in the future

4 (2h 22m 53s):
Coming back to visit

3 (2h 22m 55s):
Yeah. Interdimensionally. That this is, this is our path that we would become these genderless things, the giant heads that use telepathy. Well, just like this Elon Musk invention, this Neuralink that's gonna allow you to scroll and so paralyzed people can use the internet, right. And it's going to be able to operate machinery. The one of the things that Bob Lazar said about that craft right there, the sport model that he allegedly worked on in area 51, site four, was that they didn't have controls in them. They, they operated in with their minds.

4 (2h 23m 26s):
And it's so funny because when he first said that, it probably sounded I mean. It still sounds a little bit like bullshit, but it probably sounds a little crazy, but it sounds great. But when then you look at Neuralink, you go, wait a minute. Yeah. I guess I could see operating a craft with my mind in a thousand years from now. There's that idea that ai, you know, when it, when robotics catches up to AI and, and AI can implant itself in a, in a robot warrior, then they, then they are like an entity. Yeah. And then they look and they go, what is the only threat to us? Oh, it's humans. Let us Terminator. Let us get rid of the terminator. Yeah. So that makes it so that our only hope is Neuralink. Yeah. Is hopefully we can emerge and go and, and the and the AI will not say, what's our threat?

4 (2h 24m 7s):
They go, oh no, that's us. Yeah.

3 (2h 24m 8s):
We

4 (2h 24m 9s):
Will emerge. That's our meet us.

3 (2h 24m 10s):
I think that's what's gonna happen no matter what. Because I think once it happens, the people that have it will have such a massive advantage over everyone else that has to use a device.

4 (2h 24m 20s):
It's like steroids. Yeah.

3 (2h 24m 21s):
Well it's not just like that. It's like having a car, living in a house. Right. Having a television, having the internet. If you, if you live in the woods by yourself with no language, you're fucked.

4 (2h 24m 29s):
Right, right. It's like the tribe coming out of the jungle and saying, I want some clothes. Exactly. On a mega mega level. On

3 (2h 24m 34s):
A mega mega level. I think that's where we're going. I think that's what the UFOs are.

4 (2h 24m 39s):
Well, hope I mean. Do you think that in this universe my book is a bestseller. I

3 (2h 24m 43s):
Think it's gonna be fucking

4 (2h 24m 44s):
Huge. Oh, thank goodness that now this is what's important.

3 (2h 24m 47s):
There it is right there. Subcultural Vulture A Memoir in Six Scenes by Moshe Kasher available. Now did you do the audiobook?

4 (2h 24m 55s):
I did do the audiobook, yeah. Yes. Yeah,

3 (2h 24m 56s):
I did. Thank God you didn't let an actor do it. That's

4 (2h 24m 58s):
No, never. Although what's really funny is there's a part Did

3 (2h 25m 0s):
They try to pressure you to do an

4 (2h 25m 1s):
An actor? No, no, no. They wanted me to do it. I think they like when comics do it, God. But there's a funny part in there where my, my friend Larry, early in my life, throws me up against a wall at an AA meeting and tells me to stop saying the N word. And he's black hit a black friend of mine. and it was like when I was like, thought that I had a pass or whatever. Right. And, and it's a, it's a moment about like, you know, popping your head outta your ass, basically. Like, he basically threw me up against the wall and like shifted my perspective into like Of course that's not what I'm supposed to be doing. But I had this passage in the book where I was like, I mean, it's very short passage. But I'm like, I'm not reading that shit. And so I cont I went forensically into my past and contacted Larry and said, Larry, it would be awesome if you would read the part of Larry.

4 (2h 25m 45s):
and I found him and he did

3 (2h 25m 46s):
It. That's amazing.

4 (2h 25m 47s):
So it's me and Larry.

3 (2h 25m 48s):
That's great. That's awesome. It's out now. I'm gonna see you tonight, so. Oh, awesome. I'll

4 (2h 25m 53s):
See you at the club. See you at the club. Good luck

3 (2h 25m 54s):
At your book event. Say hi to Dunking for me. Thank

4 (2h 25m 56s):
You very much. Thank having me

3 (2h 25m 57s):
Back. My pleasure brother. It was awesome. It was really fun. I really enjoyed it. We gotta do more often.

4 (2h 26m 0s):
I would love

3 (2h 26m 0s):
To. Alright, let's do it.

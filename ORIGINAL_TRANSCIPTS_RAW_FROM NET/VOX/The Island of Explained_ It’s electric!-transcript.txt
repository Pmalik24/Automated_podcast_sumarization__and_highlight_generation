2 (47s):
Let's try something different.

3 (1m 11s):
Welcome to the final episode of this summer's today. Explain to kids series where we last left off our favorite pie. Izzy had another successful case closed time to kick back with a glass of ice cold soda and the video game, knowing the job was done well, but there can be no rest for a pie on today. Explain to kids.

4 (1m 38s):
Aren't you going to answer that

5 (1m 39s):
Kiarra I'm on vacation.

4 (1m 43s):
You have like 500 voicemails. What if these kids really need you?

5 (1m 48s):
You know what else needs me? My video games,

4 (1m 52s):
But don't you miss the thrill of a new case? The rush of a good question. Chasing down answers.

5 (1m 58s):
Okay. Okay, fine. I guess I can take a break from my break. Play the voicemails.

2 (2m 8s):
How do you get energy from fossil fuels? How does solar power work? How do you convert like the energy from the sun that comes on a solar panel into the electricity we use to like plug in things. There are a bunch of different energies that I just need to know about.

5 (2m 28s):
Hmm. Interesting. Very interesting.

4 (2m 33s):
I think these kids are onto something. I've heard that fossil fuels are bad, but why and what even are fossil fuels. Anyhow,

5 (2m 43s):
Sounds like we've got a solid mystery on our hands and you know what that means

4 (2m 48s):
You bet. I do. Wait, what does that mean?

5 (2m 52s):
It means it's time for a visit to our favorite island. The island of explained, come on. Just step into my portal here.

4 (3m 10s):
Whoa, I didn't know. There was an amusement park on the island of explained,

5 (3m 15s):
Well, I'm supposed to be on vacation. So if I'm gonna work, I'm also gonna have some fun.

7 (3m 21s):
Welcome to amusement, spark the best place to have fun and learn

5 (3m 26s):
The amusement. Sparks, sparks your interest in things by making them exciting. And I bet they have a ride that can answer our questions,

4 (3m 34s):
But what kind of ride will be able to teach us about fossil fuels and why they're bad.

7 (3m 39s):
Have you ever asked yourself what are fossil fuels and why are they bad? Well, Ben step right up to our newest ride. It's an old world. Fossil fuels, AKA coal oil and natural gas are actually some of the oldest things on earth. So it's an old world. We'll take you back in time to tell you everything you need to know.

5 (4m 0s):
That sounds perfect. And look, there are two seats left.

4 (4m 6s):
I hope this isn't a scary ride. Ah, we're moving.

7 (4m 12s):
Welcome to it's an old world. I'm duck your brave and wise time guide. Sit back and relax as we journey back to a time before humans, before Neanderthals. And even before dinosaurs, behold, our first stop.

4 (4m 33s):
What exactly are we looking at here? All I see is a swampy looking for us,

5 (4m 39s):
But wait, this looks different from a regular forest. I've never seen so many giant ferns in my life.

4 (4m 46s):
Oh yeah. And look at those super tall trees. Their bark looks all scaly like snakeskin.

5 (4m 53s):
And is that a millipede as long as this cart?

7 (4m 58s):
Oh yeah. That's Millie. Hi Millie soft doc.

4 (5m 2s):
Where are

7 (5m 2s):
We? I think you mean, when are we welcome to the Carboniferous period? We've journeyed to a time before humans, approximately 300 million years ago. You might not believe it, but all of these giant trees and ferns and plants, they're the earliest forms of fossil fuels. Now, as we move forward in time,

4 (5m 28s):
We're going fast now.

5 (5m 31s):
Ooh, the plants are wilting and look, all that sand and dirt is blowing over them, covering them up.

7 (5m 38s):
Yep. We're moving through millions of years. Now. Think of how many storms and floods and earthquakes happen over the course of millions of years.

4 (5m 47s):
My guess is a lot, a

7 (5m 49s):
Lot, a lot. And all of that changes the surface of the earth. Rocks break down places, floods and a dirt close in. And each new layer settles on top of the buried plants and animals. Through those millions of years, one layer forms then another and another and another.

5 (6m 8s):
It looks like dirt, lasagna

4 (6m 10s):
Gross.

7 (6m 11s):
Those layers, add a ton of pressure, squishing and crushing what's left of those plants. And this process is happening in swamps and forests. All across the planet, the plants die. Then get buried as the surface of the earth changes. And the same thing is happening to plankton in the ocean to new layers of sand and water and dirt. Keep forming and pressing down on these plants and animals for a million years, then another million. Then hundreds of millions of years,

4 (6m 41s):
We're going even faster. Now Izzy pull my hand

5 (6m 45s):
Buck dinosaurs. Oh, and now everything's freezing over, Hey, this must be the ice age.

4 (6m 53s):
Oh. And now look humans

7 (6m 56s):
Over these millions of years. The pressure from those layers plus heat from the Earth's core transforms our plants and animals. Some of the material becomes shiny black rocks. We call that call. Other times there's so much heat and pressure that it transforms into a liquid that we call crude oil. Or if there's a ton of heat and pressure, we get a gas, natural gas.

4 (7m 19s):
Wow, love a good transformation story.

7 (7m 23s):
These three things are all versions of what we call fossil fuels. The fossil part is just because they're made from really, really old stuff. And the fuel part is because we use them to make power. In fact, it turns out that burning fossil fuels is a really powerful source of energy, which brings us to our next stop on this ride. The late 17 hundreds,

5 (7m 49s):
Wow, look, trains, steamboats,

4 (7m 53s):
And factories to build more trains and more steamboats,

7 (7m 57s):
Right? This is what we call the industrial revolution. Humans started to build factories and invent machines that depended on burning fossil fuels in another hundred years or so. Cars powered by fossil fuels came on the scene and around the same time, people start burning coal to make electricity.

4 (8m 22s):
So you're telling me that the giant ferns and plants and plankton, we saw hundreds of millions of years ago. Those power stuff like our air conditioning and phones

5 (8m 33s):
And video games.

7 (8m 35s):
You bet. In fact, more than half of all the electricity used in the United States today comes from burning fossil fuels. Not just cool, but natural gas too.

5 (8m 46s):
Okay. This is fascinating and all, but my pie senses are tingling. Something's not adding up here.

4 (8m 53s):
What do you mean?

5 (8m 54s):
Well, the time guide said this ride would show us why fossil fuels are bad, but so far we've only seen what makes them good. So why are they bad?

7 (9m 4s):
Ah, that is an excellent question. If you all reach under your seats, you'll find a special pair of goggles. Please put this on.

4 (9m 12s):
Ooh, mad scientist vibes. I like it.

5 (9m 16s):
Whoa, what's all this stuff in the air.

7 (9m 19s):
So these goggles, let you see something. That's usually invisible, a gas called carbon dioxide. Remember how fossil fuels included the remains of a bunch of plants and animals pressed together over a really long time? Well, those plants and animals contained a lot of different chemicals, including carbon. That means when humans burn fossil fuels, it creates carbon dioxide. Sometimes we call that CO2. That's what you're seeing in the air now

4 (9m 47s):
Is that what's bad.

7 (9m 49s):
Well, it's not good. See how the carbon dioxide is floating up and forming a layer in the sky that wraps all around the planet, like a blanket and just like a real blanket. It traps in heat, making the surface of the earth hotter as more carbon dioxide is released. That blanket keeps getting heavier and heavier, which makes the earth even warmer.

4 (10m 11s):
So the more fossil fuels we burn, the more of this carbon dioxide we have

5 (10m 17s):
And the more carbon dioxide we have, the hotter our planet gets

7 (10m 21s):
Exactly. This is part of what scientists call climate change, burning fossil fuels. Isn't the only contributor to climate change, but it's a pretty big one today. The earth is around two degrees, Fahrenheit warmer than it was in the 18 hundreds.

4 (10m 36s):
Okay. But why is it bad if the planet gets a little bit hotter?

7 (10m 41s):
Well, two degrees might not sound like much, but even a small rise in temperature. It comes with a big effects like rising sea levels or serious heat waves or more wildfires and more storms.

4 (10m 54s):
But doc, it seems like we still use a ton of fossil fuels. You said it yourself more than half of the electricity we use at home comes from burning fossil fuels. So what happens if we keep using them so much? Ah, why do we stop?

5 (11m 14s):
Huh? I think we've reached our time. As in present day 2022,

7 (11m 20s):
My dear riders, we are now at a crossroads and you get to choose where we go next to the right a future without fossil fuels to the left fossil fuels future. So basically what the future will look like if we keep using fossil fuels at our current rate, which will you choose?

5 (11m 39s):
I do not have a good feeling about fossil fuels future,

4 (11m 43s):
But what else do we have besides fossil fuels? I'm not ready to give up everything that uses electricity.

5 (11m 49s):
I'm not sure, but I don't like the idea of all those chemicals in the sky.

7 (11m 55s):
You waited too long. Here we go.

4 (11m 58s):
We're moving towards fossil fuels. Future

7 (12m 1s):
Climate change is affecting snow and rain patterns. More places are having droughts. The ocean's getting warmer, which is causing more powerful hurricanes and dangerous storms. Different plants and animals are losing their habitats. And if average global temperatures rise by more than 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit compared to pre-industrial times, then things could get bad, like really bad.

4 (12m 27s):
I'm too scared to look anymore. Can we go back?

5 (12m 30s):
Well, there's a button here. Magical emergency rewind for emergencies only. I wonder what it does.

4 (12m 37s):
Press it. Press the button.

5 (12m 40s):
I don't know

4 (12m 40s):
Is he please press it now. <inaudible>

3 (12m 50s):
Well, Izzy and Kiarra be saved by the magical rewind button or is it too late? Find out after this short break

3 (14m 16s):
We're back on the island of explained with Kiarra and Izzy. They just press the magical emergency rewind button. And now they're having a spot of deja.

4 (14m 32s):
Am I losing my mind? Or were we just here?

5 (14m 35s):
You're not losing your mind. I think that magical rewind button really worked. Look, there's the same fork in the road with the same sign pointing to fossil fuels future. And if I remember correctly, doc is about to tell us that we're at a crossroads,

7 (14m 52s):
My dear riders, we are now at a crossroads and you get to choose where we go next to the right a future without fossil fuels to the left fossil fuels future. So basically what the future will look like if we keep using fossil fuels at our current rate, which will you choose,

4 (15m 10s):
Right? Let's go right to the future without fossil fuels.

7 (15m 16s):
I love your enthusiasm. I was going to suggest going left, but okay. Right. It is. We're leaving amusement sparked and heading to the most amazing city on the island of explained Electra city.

5 (15m 30s):
Ooh, the track is so high up. We can see the whole city under us. Look at all the trees and the parks and the bike lanes.

4 (15m 40s):
Okay. I'm liking this a lot more.

5 (15m 43s):
Huh? I'm curious though. I wonder if there's also bad stuff in the air here that we just can't see. Let me put on those special CO2 goggles again.

4 (15m 53s):
Oh, me too.

5 (15m 55s):
Hmm. I barely see any carbon dioxide in there. Do you?

4 (15m 59s):
Nope. But the city still seems to be running on electricity. Look, I see air conditioners, refrigerators, TVs.

5 (16m 9s):
How is that possible?

7 (16m 11s):
Ah, here comes the mayor of electricity on her hoverboard.

11 (16m 16s):
Hi. Or should I say hydro water is one of our main power sources here.

7 (16m 22s):
Electricity actually doesn't use any fossil fuels at all.

5 (16m 26s):
Not any

11 (16m 27s):
None. Let me point out the energy sources we do use like, oh see those shiny blue panels on the roofs of the buildings. Those are solar panels. They're made up of a special type of solar cell that turns sunlight into electricity. We also have a wind farm over on your left.

4 (16m 45s):
Those are some big windmills.

11 (16m 47s):
The wind spins the blades, which spin in generator and that creates electricity. Let's see what else? Oh, we also have a nuclear power plant, which you'll see over on your right. Look for the big curvy towers with steam coming out of the tops.

4 (17m 2s):
Ooh, I see them.

11 (17m 4s):
Our city also uses a bunch of sources that you can't see like geothermal energy, which uses the heat from the Earth's core or different types of biomass, which come from plants and animals. Our scientists are even experimenting with making power from allergy photosynthesis,

5 (17m 21s):
Algae that's slimy green stuff and deep dive lake. Good to know it's useful for something.

11 (17m 27s):
All of our energy sources produce way less carbon dioxide than fossil fuels, but that's not all, most of them are also renewable, which means we can easily replace what we use. There will always be more wind or sun and we can grow more trees. Fossil fuels on the other hand are nonrenewable. Since those take hundreds of millions of years to form, we can't exactly make more.

4 (17m 51s):
But wait, if these sources of energy are so much better than fossil fuels, why isn't every city like your city? Why does most of our energy at home still come from fossil fuels? Great

11 (18m 5s):
Question.

7 (18m 6s):
Fabulous question. Listen, the world is a big place. Unlike our island. So cities or towns that use the most energy, aren't always the sunniest or windiest places. That means that you need a way to get energy from the places, with the most, to the places that need it. The most.

11 (18m 23s):
We also have it a bit easier here because it's almost always sunny and almost always breezy. So we don't have to worry about making batteries to store energy for cloudy days or days without wind.

7 (18m 36s):
There's also the matter of money

11 (18m 38s):
And politics,

7 (18m 39s):
Definitely politics.

4 (18m 41s):
This all sounds impossible.

7 (18m 44s):
Not the I word

4 (18m 46s):
What what's so bad about the word impossible,

7 (18m 49s):
Please. No more

11 (18m 51s):
Of all the things you need to make big changes. One of the most important is belief.

7 (18m 58s):
If you don't believe that change is possible, you'll never try. And if you never try, then things will never change,

11 (19m 4s):
Right? Because let me tell you a secret. My city electricity, we used to use fossil fuels to

4 (19m 12s):
Really you use fossil fuels to

11 (19m 16s):
Yup. And switching to clean energy was really, really hard. It almost felt well impossible. A lot of people here were used to doing things a certain way and some residents owned or worked in fossil fuel factories and they didn't want those factories to close.

5 (19m 36s):
So what changed?

11 (19m 38s):
Well, we started to understand just how bad those fossil fuels were for the environment. And we all realized that we had to change if we wanted to avoid fossil fuels future. So it took some time, a

7 (19m 52s):
Lot of time

11 (19m 53s):
And some effort, a

7 (19m 54s):
Lot of effort.

11 (19m 56s):
But once we started making small switches, like adding just a few solar panels at a time, we realized it wasn't so scary and that's not all this could just be the beginning.

7 (20m 8s):
What an excellent segue to the very last part of our ride. Thanks mayor. Back. We go into amusement spark

4 (20m 16s):
By mayor.

11 (20m 17s):
Bye. Or should I say biomass?

7 (20m 22s):
We're almost at the end of our ride, but before we close our loop, I want to take you all even further forward into the future. This is a brand new part of the ride that I'm still kind of working on.

11 (20m 35s):
Whoa,

7 (20m 41s):
Welcome to the year 30, 22 in the great city of Greenville.

5 (20m 46s):
Wow. That the rocket ship,

4 (20m 49s):
It's a whole bunch of them.

7 (20m 51s):
Oh, that's the local rocket port. Not only did the citizens of Greenville, figure out how to use algae photosynthesis for electricity. They figured out how to channel all photosynthesis into electricity. Now every park and garden generates enough electricity to power rockets to the moon up there goes one now.

5 (21m 12s):
And what are those over there? The pretty bird looking things,

7 (21m 16s):
Oh, those are wind energy kites instead of huge wind turbines that take a long time to build. You can fly those kites whenever and wherever there's wind. Oh. And see those people dancing over there. They're having a PAs electric thought. The special street material absorbs the pressure from their dancing and turns it into electricity.

5 (21m 36s):
That's my kind of party.

4 (21m 38s):
What about those rollercoasters over there? What do those do?

7 (21m 42s):
Oh, those are just regular rollercoasters. For some reason, the people here are really into roller coasters.

4 (21m 48s):
This is pretty awesome, but it all looks so different from back home. How will we ever get here?

7 (21m 55s):
Well, like the mayor of electricity said change is hard, but if you believe that it's possible, then imagination and invention can take you a long way after all. You need to imagine a new world before you can make it. In fact, there's a whole section of Greenville devoted to imagining new inventions. Let's listen in.

2 (22m 15s):
I wonder if they could make like a lighter when mail that cause like that you could like put on like your roof. Cause it'd be like lighter. Wouldn't be that heavy.

5 (22m 23s):
Ooh, that would make a great addition to my office.

4 (22m 26s):
I thought you were on vacation.

5 (22m 28s):
Consider my vacation officially over. There's too much to do.

7 (22m 35s):
Here. We are back at the start of the ride. But before you go, would you mind if I record a review from you? I like to see if our little ride here changed people's minds here. Let me play you some reviews. I've gotten from other writers in the past. I asked them if they want to work toward a future free of fossil fuels in order to take better care of the planet. And they said stuff like

13 (22m 58s):
We live on and what our kids will live on. If you have kids

2 (23m 4s):
Beautiful stuff,

14 (23m 5s):
We have to make sure we have this planet because it's the only one we've got. We don't have a plan B.

4 (23m 14s):
Well I'm with those people. I can't wait to get home and start researching solar panels. I feel like I could probably talk my parents into getting so,

5 (23m 22s):
And I want to start the first grand private I practice in my city.

4 (23m 27s):
I guess we better get back to the office. Izzy. We have a lot of clients to call.

5 (23m 31s):
We

4 (23m 32s):
Come on. Every successful private eye needs a partner.

5 (23m 37s):
How about we start with sidekick and go from there

4 (23m 41s):
Done.

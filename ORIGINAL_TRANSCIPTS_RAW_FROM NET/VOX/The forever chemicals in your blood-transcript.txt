0 (1s):
Forever. Chemicals are everywhere.

1 (5s):
Okay. So the big one is drinking water. You go into the bathroom, it can be in soap, shampoo, conditioner, hand lotion, dental floss, which I hate. Cause then it's in your teeth, right?

0 (18s):
Oh, they're in my teeth.

1 (23s):
Cosmetics are really bad. A lot of waterproof cosmetics, which is actually a deal breaker for a lot of women I talk to. Hmm. The other big place is the kitchen. Okay. Nonstick cookware. Takeout containers. Your food really high in a lot of fish. And then in the living room, there might be like stain proofing on the carpet. Stain proofing on the upholstery in the dust bunnies.

0 (46s):
There's forever chemicals in the dust bunnies.

1 (49s):
Yeah. And it's also in breast milk.

0 (54s):
Coming up on today, explained the Biden administration wants to do something about it.

RuPaul's Drag Race champion Sasha Valor, says some of the weirdest drags she's ever done was influenced by the Lord of the rinks.

2 (1m 7s):
They did a transformation from like a glamorous 1950s ingenu to Gollum and did the lip sync with both Gollum and Sneel fighting. And then I performed Kate Bush Weathering Heights,

3 (1m 23s):
Sasha Valor on her new book and the history of drag. This week on Intuit Vultures pop culture podcast

0 (1m 35s):
Today explained Sean Ramos here with Barbara Moran. She's an environmental and climate correspondent at Public Radio Station W B U R in Boston, which means she's been covering forever Chemicals forever. I asked her why we should cover them right now.

1 (1m 52s):
So the E P A, the Environmental Protection Agency finally came out with draft drinking water regulations last month. And that is a huge deal because drinking water is one of the main ways that people ingest PFAS chemicals. And the EPA is finally gonna regulate it.

5 (2m 9s):
The EPA a's proposal applies to six of those chemicals known as PFAS compounds and would require water utilities to clean any detectable level out of their systems.

1 (2m 19s):
So this is a huge announcement that came out in March

0 (2m 22s):
For people who don't know anything about forever Chemicals or pfas, what are they?

1 (2m 26s):
Okay. PFAS chemicals are these class of about a thousands of chemicals that were invented in the 1930s.

6 (2m 36s):
PFAS is an acronym for a family of manmade compounds called Per and Poly Floral Alkaline Substances.

1 (2m 42s):
And they turn out to have all these amazing properties like they are heat resistant and water resistant and oil resistant. So they're using thousands of products like stain resistant carpeting.

7 (2m 56s):
Even DuPont says it cannot rule out the Teflon connected products such as its Stainmaster carpet treatment, give off the

1 (3m 5s):
Chemical and water resistant clothing and cosmetics. Researchers at the University of Notre Dame found more than three quarters of waterproof mascara. Nearly two thirds of foundations and liquid lipsticks they tested have high levels of pfas chemicals and teon pans.

8 (3m 25s):
If Teflon gets hot enough, depends on what you're cooking or how long you leave the pot on the stove. It gives off fumes that can kill

1 (3m 33s):
Birds and microwave popcorn bags.

9 (3m 37s):
Microwaveable popcorn is a classic for movie nights at home, but that greaseproof paper it comes in may actually have chemicals that are toxic to people and the environment. And that's according to the Food and Drug Administration

1 (3m 49s):
And all of these things that people use every day.

6 (3m 53s):
Things like pizza boxes, paper plates, rain jackets, ski wax, even guitar

1 (3m 58s):
Streams. So because they're so widely used and they've been used for so long, they're now everywhere. They're in water and air and soil. Mm. Yes.

0 (4m 15s):
And are blood, I'm told

1 (4m 17s):
Yes. Of 98. It's either 98 or 99% of Americans have some pfas in their blood. Okay. So here's the thing that's interesting. When I hear that, I'm like, well, how bad can it be cuz I'm not dying. I don't think so.

0 (4m 35s):
Same. I don't think.

1 (4m 36s):
I don't think so. Why? Why is it so bad? So here's why. It turns out pfas chemicals are so bad. One, they stick around forever.

11 (4m 43s):
They are nearly indestructible. You just can't get rid of 'em. You can't get rid of

1 (4m 47s):
'em. Like most toxins you get in your body, they eventually go out. Pfas will stay in your body for years. And they have a structure that makes them affect almost every organ system in your body. So they've been connected with all kinds of diseases like liver disease and kidney cancer and testicular cancer and immune problems and digestive problems and high cholesterol,

12 (5m 15s):
Obesity, risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, a whole suite of health outcomes that we're quite concerned about are associated with exposures to these compounds.

0 (5m 25s):
Ugh, why are they so bad? Why are they causing so many terrible things?

1 (5m 30s):
Scientists are not a hundred percent sure of the mechanism of how they do these things in the body. They kind of mimic certain other things that are good. So your body kind of lets them in and they just disrupt all kinds of different functions in your body. But there's a ton of research going on with that. They just know which organs and systems that they are hurting, but they're not exactly sure how.

0 (5m 54s):
What the heck are these things doing in the tap water?

13 (5m 57s):
Scientists with the environmental working group in Washington have detected some amount of pfas in groundwater or drinking water. In nearly 2,800 American communities across 49 states. The contamination often linked to nearby industrial sites, landfills, airports, and military bases where the chemicals may have seeped into the ground.

1 (6m 18s):
You have say waterproof clothing, you put 'em in your wash. Eventually this stuff washes off or flakes off. It gets into the wastewater that goes out into the wastewater treatment planet. Then it goes out into the world. You know, it washes off of things into storm water if you have it in your food that can go into the drain. It's in sort of landfill leachate. It's in firefighting foam. So anywhere there's a fire, it leaks outta the firefighting foam and gets into the groundwater.

14 (6m 47s):
A Triple F aqueous film forming foam is an unsurpassed way to stop a raging petroleum fire for about 20 years. Firefighters used it in training exercises. The foam is water and oil repellent thanks to perfluorinated chemicals, more commonly known as pfas.

1 (7m 7s):
So all of this stuff, eventually it all sort of leaks down and gets into the groundwater, which ends up in the drinking water. And so this is how people first discovered it in drinking water. This remains one of the main ways that people get exposed, especially if you live near somewhere like a firefighting academy where there's been a ton of this foam used. Right. It's in your drinking water. That's why it's EPA announcement is such a big deal that they're finally gonna deal with it in drinking water. Cuz that's the first big enchilada that they have to deal with. Here I am drinking water wondering, no, my drinking water is safe because I check it because I'm obsessed.

0 (7m 47s):
Oh yeah. How do you check it?

1 (7m 50s):
Well, Massachusetts, cuz we're ahead of the game here. We've regulated pfas and drinking water for a few years now. And so you can go online if you live here in Massachusetts and look up your drinking water system to see if it's okay.

0 (8m 4s):
That sounds great. I, I'm guessing not everyone has that opportunity.

1 (8m 8s):
No, there's like a handful of states, maybe 10 or 12 that already regulate it. Those states are kind of ahead of the game and the federal government is finally catching up. So now all of the states are gonna have to figure out how to measure it in their drinking water and, and regulate it.

0 (8m 24s):
Tell me more about that. How did the federal government just decide, hey, maybe we should pay attention to these forever chemicals, right. That are in breast milk and the blood of our nation and small children. Yeah. And causing this raft of horrible calamities you talked about.

1 (8m 43s):
Yeah, this is the big question is what took the e P A so long to finally regulate these things in drinking water? And there had been calls to do it for years and years and nothing happened under Trump. And then Biden came into office and said, yep, we're moving ahead on pfas. Everybody's sort of waiting, waiting, waiting. And then finally the regulations came out in March. I mean, people knew years ago that these chemicals in drinking water were a problem, right? And all the states were kind of waiting around for the EPA to do something. And then some of the states were like, the hell with this, we're not waiting for the epa, we're just gonna do our own thing.

0 (9m 23s):
What exactly did the EPA say in March?

1 (9m 27s):
So the EPA said in March that they are going to regulate six PFAS chemicals in drinking water when

15 (9m 34s):
Finalized. This proposed regulation will require public water systems to monitor these chemicals. It will also require systems to notify the public and reduce the levels of these pfas as prescribed.

1 (9m 46s):
So that means that if this regulation goes through as they're proposing, then every municipal water system in the country will have to measure these six pfas chemicals and filter the water to get them out if they're in there. So this is good, they're doing something, but it's only six of these chemicals and there's like thousands of them.

0 (10m 7s):
Thousands. Why just six?

1 (10m 9s):
The six of the EPA is regulating are the ones that we know the most about. So there's enough evidence to know that these six should be regulated. Although a lot of scientists say, how about we regulate all of them and not just these six? So there's a lot of controversy over, you know, how to regulate these things. Whether you should just look at a few that we know are bad or look at all of them, assuming that they're all bad,

0 (10m 36s):
Well be it six or you know, a hundred or a thousand of them. How would the government then go about getting these forever chemicals out of the water? If they're forever chemicals,

1 (10m 49s):
You can filter them out. Water. You know, you can use like a NDA filter.

16 (10m 53s):
This brand new water treatment facility in Mansfield filters pfas, known as forever Chemicals out of the drinking water by sending it through a massive carbon filtration system.

11 (11m 5s):
40,000 pounds of carbon in each one of these vessels. The pfas adheres to the carbon. So that's what removes the pfas.

1 (11m 14s):
They're really expensive of course,

0 (11m 16s):
But maybe worth

1 (11m 17s):
It. Oh, it's totally worth it. You have got to get it out of the drinking water. Okay, everybody get it outta your drinking water no matter what it

0 (11m 24s):
Costs. This has been a public service announcement.

1 (11m 26s):
Yes. Yes.

0 (11m 30s):
Get the chemicals out of the drinking water. Absolutely. From from Barbara Moran. W B U R.

1 (11m 35s):
You heard it here? Yes. The problem is then all the pfas is stuck in the filter.

0 (11m 41s):
Then what?

1 (11m 41s):
Then you either

0 (11m 43s):
Launch it into space.

1 (11m 44s):
This is what everybody says to me about every single toxin de like, can we just shoot it in the sun? And I'm like, what? No, you can't shoot it in the sun. Okay,

0 (11m 53s):
It's our problem. We should keep the problems that we've created here on our polluted planet.

1 (11m 58s):
Exactly. And then you have to, you put it in a landfill, but that doesn't get rid of the pfas, really. You select the pfas. The pfas just keeps piling up and piling up and piling up. Also, another PSA from Barb is that these, all this regulation does not help people with private wells, which are actually a lot, a huge percentage of people, especially in rural areas. You get your water from private well, you have to go out and test your well by yourself. So go do it even though it costs you money. Because you wanna know,

4 (12m 33s):
Oh,

0 (12m 40s):
What have we done to ourselves? Barbara, what is this all for? Just so we can go out for a run and not get wet. Just get wet.

1 (12m 46s):
You know what? I'm glad that I'm bringing you into this level of despair that I have now felt for months.

0 (12m 52s):
I've been here for a long time.

1 (12m 54s):
I've been saying those exact words to myself. Like what have we done? You know, I love Teflon,

0 (12m 59s):
I guess,

1 (12m 60s):
And I like waterproof cosmetics and I love waterproof hiking gear. But yeah, we don't need to have toxic chemicals and everything.

0 (13m 9s):
Back with Barb in a minute on today. Explain Lane.

17 (13m 25s):
Hey, this is Noam. I'm the host of Vox s Science podcast, unexplainable for a show all about scientific questions that are still unanswered and everything we can learn by diving into the unknown. One of my favorite things about my job is hearing directly from our audience about why they listen. Here's one email I really love this listener said, I find myself inspired to go study science, learn work hard, and conduct my own research one day. This instills in me dreams from my future of being one of the scientists podcasts like yours call or being someone to discover a long-held mystery. I can't explain how much this means to me honestly, reading an email like that, I just feel so lucky to be part of a show that makes this kind of impact and has these kind of wonderful listeners that take their time to tell us what this show means to them.

17 (14m 15s):
And I'm really glad Vox makes unexplainable free and accessible to everyone. Part of what makes this possible is the Vox contributions program. In April, we're aiming to add 1500 contributors to celebrate Vox X's ninth anniversary. You can go to vox.com/give today to help us reach our goal. There's also a link to give in the show notes. Thanks so much for all your support Over the last few years. A big idea has taken root trees might be talking to each other,

18 (14m 54s):
Some call it the wood wide web, the

19 (14m 56s):
Wood wide web, the wood wide

17 (14m 58s):
Web. And it's all happening underground.

20 (15m 2s):
Underground. There is this other world, a world of infinite biological pathways that connect trees and allow them to communicate and allow the forest to behave as though it's a single organism.

17 (15m 16s):
It's a beautiful image, but is it real?

2 (15m 19s):
Lots of people potentially are sort of getting this somewhat of a fantasy about how forests work rather than the true picture.

21 (15m 26s):
It's a welcome debate. We need to lean in and figure out what is actually happening

17 (15m 31s):
This week on unexplainable. The story of the talking trees and the pushback. Follow unexplainable wherever you listen for new episodes every Wednesday,

22 (15m 45s):
Everything's prepared. Chemistry that's

0 (15m 52s):
Today explained is back with Barbara Moran from W B U R and I asked her an obvious question, why not just replace these dang forever chemicals with something less toxic?

1 (16m 2s):
Okay, so well this is part of the problem, right? Is the companies that make it, they're like, okay, we'll take out this bad stuff, but then they put in some other stuff. It's not really regulated. We are worried. Are they just putting in another bad thing? The ultimate solution for all this is better regulating chemicals before we put them out in the world. A b, finding a way to actually destroy this stuff when we're done with it, you know? And in the meantime, helping people limit their exposure to it. Getting outta people's drinking water, helping people have safer products so that we're not exposed so much to these things.

0 (16m 41s):
Do you know the history of how these things came to be?

1 (16m 43s):
You know, they, they were invented in the 1930s

23 (16m 48s):
And now I want to tell you a chemical story. I'm Larry Livingston of the DuPont Company. This story is about a new plastic material trademark, Teflon.

1 (16m 60s):
So they invented these chemicals and they're amazing. They have these amazing qualities.

0 (17m 6s):
This is very like the graduate, the future is plastics, plastics,

1 (17m 10s):
Plastics. It is totally,

0 (17m 12s):
It's these people. It's

23 (17m 13s):
A great future in plastics.

1 (17m 15s):
Absolutely. And they're like, woo, this is amazing. We could use it in this and we could use it in this and this and this and this. And it became most famous used by DuPont in products like Teflon. I think that was the one that most people were familiar with.

24 (17m 28s):
Cookware never needs scouring if it has DuPont Teflon.

1 (17m 33s):
And that's how it also came to light. That they were toxic because of the factory where they were making Teflon when they had workers exposed to it. And also it got into the water there. Hmm.

25 (17m 45s):
Everybody knows it's there. They know it's in the water, but nobody

26 (17m 49s):
Seems to know what to

1 (17m 50s):
Do about it. And now it's everywhere.

0 (17m 52s):
When did companies really start to understand how bad these things were?

1 (17m 57s):
So the companies knew that they were bad long, long before they told anybody about it. They knew it because some of the female workers had children with birth defects.

7 (18m 7s):
These internal DuPont documents only now made public showed the company knew that of eight women working on the Teflon line in 1981. Two had children with birth defects

1 (18m 19s):
And they knew in like animal tests that these chemicals had problems. And they kept this information quiet for a long time. And it eventually came out in lawsuits.

26 (18m 29s):
When we got into the litigation with DuPont, we got access to a lot of the internal documents and we found out that DuPont and another company called 3M had been studying this chemical dating back to the 1950s and 1960s.

0 (18m 45s):
So how do, how do companies respond to the information that by the way, these forever chemicals that you're putting into every last product you make are really bad for people and cause a, you know, host of diseases and conditions that people are doing the darnest to avoid in regular life?

1 (19m 2s):
Well, I think it goes the usual way. They first they say, no, they're not, they're fine. What are you talking about? And then they say, okay, well they're not as bad as you think. And then they're like, Ooh, okay, maybe some of them are bad, but not all of them, you know? And what they did was they phased out the first two best known ones. So they phased those out, but then they just replaced them with other ones that they said were better but weren't really, and 3M has said they're gonna phase them out completely by 2025. Oh

0 (19m 31s):
Yeah.

1 (19m 31s):
Yeah. So that's big. And you're like, Woohoo, 3m. But like scientists I talk to, they're like, Woohoo. But are they actually just replacing them with some other thing

0 (19m 41s):
That could have some other unknown consequences?

1 (19m 44s):
Exactly.

0 (19m 46s):
When do people learn about the negative effects of pfas, if not right now on this show?

1 (19m 53s):
Oh God, they have to know by now. This is all I talk about. So I feel,

0 (19m 59s):
I would hope so. I would not be surprised if people hearing about this for the first

1 (20m 2s):
Time. I mean, let's see. So I think it sort of first came to light in around the late nineties, early two thousands, I would say a lot of people probably heard about it because there was a movie with Mark Ruffalo in it called Dark Waters.

27 (20m 17s):
How many did you lose?

28 (20m 20s):
190.

27 (20m 24s):
190 calves.

28 (20m 26s):
You tell me nothing's wrong here.

0 (20m 28s):
Not a lot of people saw that movie despite the Hulk being in it.

1 (20m 32s):
That's not my fault.

0 (20m 34s):
The movie was made for you and me.

1 (20m 36s):
I know there's this one scene in the movie where the guy played by Mark Ralo basically has a total freak out and starts getting rid of all the stuff in his, his house that has pfas in it. And I'm like, yeah,

29 (20m 54s):
Holy crap Rob. What? I thought someone was breaking in for god's sakes. No, it's just me, Rob, you need to tell me when the hell's going on. We're being poisoned.

1 (21m 9s):
I'm that guy. I went around and threw away all our dental floss.

0 (21m 13s):
But if you ripped up your house to take everything out of your house that had pfas and it sounds like you'd have to kick yourself outta your house.

1 (21m 20s):
I know.

0 (21m 20s):
And your wife with the breast milk.

1 (21m 23s):
I

0 (21m 23s):
Know. And your child who ate a dust bunny and now has them in their system, it's not practical.

1 (21m 30s):
I know. So then I have to say, okay Barb, just sit down, take some deep breaths. Here's how I think about it. To keep myself from freaking out. It's kind of like air pollution, right? If you live in the world, you're probably gonna encounter air pollution, right? Yeah. Right. Okay. Yeah. So but you wanna do is you wanna limit it. You don't wanna go stand behind an exhaust pipe and suck in exhaust. Okay? Okay. Especially if you have asthma. So go for the big ticket items, make sure your drinking water is cleaned up. Make sure you do not microwave stuff in your takeout containers.

0 (22m 4s):
That is scientifically proven to be bad.

1 (22m 7s):
Yeah, there's often pfas in takeout containers.

0 (22m 11s):
So we got the water, we got the microwave. What else?

1 (22m 14s):
Another big thing, you're not gonna like this one either, but if you do like recreational fishing or hunting, you should check the place where you're fishing to make sure it's okay.

0 (22m 22s):
Like check the water streams, the water quality. Yeah.

1 (22m 25s):
And you can usually do that online. You should do this anyway. Because some places, a lot of places now are saying you should not fish or take fish from certain places because of the pfas. Fish is one of the highest pfas laden foods. So be careful with your fish.

0 (22m 41s):
So like you're trying to eat less red meat cuz cows are so bad for the environment. So you start doing a fish heavy diet and then you find out that by the way, you're doomed there too.

1 (22m 50s):
You're not doomed. Let's not go there. See, everybody's always telling me I'm the doom and gloom reporter because I'm the climate environment reporter. So let's not just do doom and gloom, let's like empower ourselves.

0 (23m 3s):
But how worried are you right now about Dwayne the Rock Johnson who eats something like 821 pounds of cod every year?

30 (23m 12s):
I can confirm it to a certain degree that I, I was eating many pounds of food per day, including a lot of cod.

0 (23m 23s):
He might be doomed.

1 (23m 25s):
I don't wanna doom the rock. I love the rock. Let's not doom him.

30 (23m 29s):
I'm a good guy, but sometimes I do bad

0 (23m 32s):
Things. This conversation with you, Barb, has been a wake up call for me personally, maybe for some of our audience, is it realistic to try and live a PFAS free life? Is it realistic to avoid these forever chemicals? And if we can't, is there a reason to despair?

1 (23m 50s):
You cannot avoid them. You can't avoid them in the world we live in altogether. Okay, but don't despair because you can cut your exposure way, way, way down by just going for the big ticket items. And the biggest ticket item is drinking water and the federal government is finally doing something about it. So that is a huge amount of hope right there.

0 (24m 21s):
But there have been previous administrations who have like been all about like disbanding the epa. Is the federal government doing something right now, necessarily an indication that the federal government will be doing something in 10 years?

1 (24m 33s):
It's really hard to roll back regulations.

0 (24m 36s):
Is

1 (24m 37s):
It once you get him in place, didn't

0 (24m 38s):
Like Obama do a bunch of regulations and then his successor on did 'em all and now his successor trying to put him back in place, isn't it kind of how it goes. Cyclical

1 (24m 46s):
Almost, but not quite. Trump made a really strong effort to roll back a lot of regulations and had a little bit of success, not a ton of success. Americans want safe drinking water. And so I, I think this one is gonna stick.

0 (25m 5s):
You know what that is, Barb?

1 (25m 7s):
No,

0 (25m 8s):
That's a glimmer of hope.

4 (25m 10s):
Aw,

1 (25m 11s):
Thank you. I do like to give those glimmers.

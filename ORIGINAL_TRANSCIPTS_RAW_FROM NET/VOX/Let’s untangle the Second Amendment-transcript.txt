Noel. You got a second. Yeah. Great. Cause I want to read you. What I think is the most confusing sentence in the history of this country hit me a well-regulated militia comma being necessary to the security of a free state comma, the right of the people to keep and bear arms comma shall not be infringed. Period. It's a lot of commas. So many commas, a few subjects. Finally, a period, this second amendment of ours, the root of this entire gun rights versus gun control debate.

0 (40s):
It's it's a doozy Noel. And, and you specifically asked if we could untangle it as, as it pertains to the big Supreme court case on the second amendment district of Columbia V Heller. I wanted to know who Heller is. That's what we're going to do on today. Explained nice. All right. Today. I explained I'm Sean Rama's from. And before I worked here at Vox, I worked at w NYC in New York where I worked on a show called more perfect in collaboration with the good people at radio lab. If you haven't heard of the show, you're missing out and there's strong signs, you should subscribe now and keep an eye on that feed.

0 (1m 25s):
Anyway, one of the stories I did for more perfect was about the second amendment. It was titled the gun show and we're going to play you a chunk of it on today. Explained right now, this is the chapter about district of Columbia V Heller, the case in 2008, where the Supreme court tried to explain to the country what the heck, the second amendment meant for individuals for everyday gun ownership to report the story. Back in 2017, I met up with the cases namesake Dick. I am that's me.

2 (1m 60s):
Great to meet you and you

0 (2m 2s):
To Keller. What does your hat say,

2 (2m 4s):
Sean? This is my favorite hat. Make America free again with a big Western handgun in the center.

0 (2m 12s):
And it looks like you drew a trigger out there. Is that what you did?

2 (2m 15s):
Well, it was missing a trigger, so we had to update it.

0 (2m 19s):
Who's we? Okay. Where'd you met Dick right outside the Supreme court, the building where he became famous. He's a slim 75 year old white guy sports classes that look straight out of the seventies.

2 (2m 33s):
Got a situation here. You want to cross?

0 (2m 35s):
Sure. What's the situation.

2 (2m 37s):
Oh, the anti-Trump protestors are here.

0 (2m 40s):
I actually happened to meet him in DC. The day after Trump won the election,

2 (2m 44s):
The hate freedom. Apparently

0 (2m 48s):
The president elect was visiting the white house. There were protestors

2 (2m 52s):
At your knife, not my president. They're anti-Trump protesters. Don't you like freedom. What about freedom? What about freedom?

0 (3m 8s):
Most of the protesters that were passing us were white, but just as a few young black men pass us by, he says,

2 (3m 16s):
See you on the plantation. Freedom, freedom.

0 (3m 25s):
See you on the plantation.

2 (3m 27s):
Yeah.

0 (3m 28s):
I just say that

2 (3m 30s):
We in Washington, we call it the government plantation.

0 (3m 33s):
You didn't mean your kids are about to be slaves or something. Cause that's how I interpreted it.

2 (3m 38s):
Well, yeah, the more power government has the less freedom you have, the closer you get to ball and chain of a plantation. There's pretty good place to eat right there. If you're here for a couple of days, have you been in there?

0 (3m 52s):
I have not.

2 (3m 53s):
Yeah. Pretty good.

0 (3m 54s):
Okay. High Regency. This is good for you. We can do

2 (3m 56s):
This. Sure. Yeah. Great.

0 (3m 59s):
We ended up talking to the Hyatt, which is just down the street from the Supreme court. And, and Dick explained to me that his journey with guns began pretty casually, like 1976. He's living in DC. And one day he's sitting at home.

2 (4m 13s):
I was watching my hero, Matt, Dillon guns,

0 (4m 20s):
Different Matt Dillon.

2 (4m 23s):
And he had this long barreled hand gun. I was about 30 years old and I figured, golly, I should own my first gun. So we went and bought my, what I call my Matt Dillon special high standard, 22 revolver, Matt Dillon bunt line. And it was just, I live in America. We're a cowboy society. I should have a cowboy gun. And it was just nothing, no really deep thought to it.

0 (4m 51s):
But then just a few months after he got that gun

2 (4m 54s):
In October of 1976, DC gun control regulations, outlawed firearms ownership

0 (5m 2s):
At that gun law, which outlawed all handguns.

2 (5m 5s):
I had some choices. I could turn it into the government. Not going to happen. I can throw it in the Dipsy dumpster not going to happen. Or there was another option. I could go to jail, not going to happen.

0 (5m 18s):
Eventually he decides on option D give the gun to his brother.

2 (5m 23s):
My brother lived in Maryland. So that made it very convenient.

0 (5m 26s):
Did you just go visit your gun in Maryland? What did you

2 (5m 28s):
Do? Yes. I would go visit and caress and use my gun.

0 (5m 33s):
What did you use it for

2 (5m 34s):
Target practice? Of course,

0 (5m 37s):
Dick made his gun visitation situation sound functional, but I think like any long distance relationship, it mostly sucked because more and more, he didn't feel safe where he lived.

2 (5m 47s):
I lived about 10 blocks from the Capitol building right across the street from the number one most infamous drug dealer den in the city called Kentucky courts every night at 2:00 AM. The chief drug dealer would fire a nine millimeter into the air, empty the clip. And that was the signal every night at two o'clock that drug dealing was over for the day.

0 (6m 15s):
It's clear that living through the crack epidemic in DC really shaped a lot of Dick's views on guns. So in the years after the handgun ban, Dick starts the very long process of finding a way to get his gun back to DC. And he eventually even quit his desk job to pursue getting his gun back full time.

2 (6m 36s):
I'm all over Capitol hill and I see security guards have guns. Well, golly, why can't I be a security guard? Golly, maybe that would help me have a gun that I can't have on my own. Golly, let's see how easy or not easy. This is golly. One step leads to another. Golly,

0 (7m 2s):
Just like that. Dick was able to have a gun in DC, but only during the day and only while he was working

2 (7m 8s):
Barney Fife. At the end of my shift, I have to turn in my gun and my bullets

0 (7m 13s):
And they kept it there

2 (7m 14s):
And they kept it onsite in the safe. Yes. He

0 (7m 17s):
Finally starts looking for some help, some legal help,

2 (7m 20s):
But I knew Washington cause I lived here and I'd gone to some think tanks, Cato, and heritage, and some others. I knew they existed

0 (7m 26s):
And right around the time Dick's out there looking for some help. It turns out these lawyers are out there looking for some Dick.

5 (7m 33s):
No, no

0 (7m 35s):
He wasn't their ideal sympathetic guy.

2 (7m 38s):
I was told repeatedly. And it was in print that I was the worst choice

5 (7m 42s):
Was less than,

0 (7m 44s):
You know, because of that plantation thing he said, or he would always talk smack about the federal government interviews

2 (7m 50s):
One day Clark Neily, put a note in my hand and said, Dick Heller, this is what you say. I just wanted a gun to protect my house. Shut up.

0 (8m 2s):
So he wasn't their favorite plaintiff, but did

5 (8m 5s):
I did one thing that no one else had done, which is besides just wanting an illegal handgun in DC, he actually filled out an application to register a gun that he already possessed again in Virginia and had that application denied

0 (8m 18s):
And he had this denial slip or whatever it's called. He like literally had this physical proof of his grievance and it's simple technical arbitrary, little stupid piece of paper gave him what's known as standing to bring the case. Yeah.

5 (8m 33s):
Keller ended up being kind of the last man standing. That was nothing to do. That was not our choice. Right?

0 (8m 37s):
Regardless he became their guy and these three lawyers, they take the case of the DC court

2 (8m 42s):
And the judge after inspecting, it said the case can go forward. Magic moment.

3 (9m 6s):
The Supreme court is entering the debate over the second amendment, right? To bear arms today's cases, aroused huge interest among citizens and politicians alike. And it is divided even the president and vice-president

6 (9m 17s):
And

0 (9m 21s):
March 18th, 2008, the day the Heller case was argued at the Supreme court. Everyone understood how high the stakes were outside in front of the Supreme court. Protesters by the hundreds were marching and chanting in favor of gun rights. And in favor of gun control journalists from all over the world descended upon the Supreme court that day and inside the Supreme court house,

9 (9m 53s):
We will hear argument today in case 0 7, 2 90 district of Columbia versus Heller.

0 (9m 58s):
This was the first time in our history. The Supreme court would directly try to figure out what the second amendment means.

9 (10m 4s):
Mr. Dellinger,

0 (10m 5s):
And immediately

9 (10m 6s):
Good morning, Mr. Chief justice may please. The court

0 (10m 9s):
DC's lawyer, Walter Dellinger gets up and jumps right into a

9 (10m 13s):
Second amendment was a direct response.

0 (10m 15s):
And he sort of begins with the central question. Like what was James Madison thinking when he wrote this super confusing sentence like 200 years ago, was he thinking about the individual people and the right to own a gun? Or was he thinking about the collective right of the militia to own a gun?

9 (10m 30s):
And the first text to consider is the phrase protecting a right to keep and bear

0 (10m 36s):
Arms. And he says, if you look at the phrase, the

9 (10m 38s):
Phrase, keeping, bear, arms,

0 (10m 40s):
How it was used at the time,

9 (10m 41s):
Every person who used the phrase, bear arms, use it to refer to the use of arms in connection with malicious surface.

0 (10m 49s):
Dylan just says that if you look at someone Madison's rough drafts of the second amendment, it's pretty clear that when he says people have a right to bear arms, all he really means is like report for duty.

9 (10m 60s):
Even if the language of caving and bearing arms were ambiguous, the amendments first clause confirms that the right is militia related. It's a sin. If you're, if you're right, Mr. Dellinger,

0 (11m 12s):
Chief justice Roberts, Thompson's like, whoa,

9 (11m 14s):
Why would they say the right of the people to keep arms?

0 (11m 18s):
Just the people in the state militias. Why

9 (11m 20s):
Wouldn't they say state militias have the right to keep arms? I missed the chief justice. I believe that the phrase, the people and the phrase, the militia were really in sync with each other. The Federalist farmer uses the phrase. The people are the militia, the militia that's right. Doesn't that cut against you? If the militia included all the people, it includes all the people. Yes, I do believe it includes all

0 (11m 44s):
At this point, everyone sort of jumps in a bunch of justices, start interrupting each other. It's kind of like a scrum and they're all trying to figure out. Okay. So when Madison wrote the phrase,

9 (11m 55s):
Why did the people to keep it bear arms shall not be infringed. Like

0 (11m 57s):
Who were the people he was talking about it,

10 (11m 59s):
Thinking of the people, what those words meant.

0 (12m 3s):
It was the people, just the militia or everyone, all the people. What is the relationship between the second part of the sentence? The people part and the first part of the sentence, the militia part,

9 (12m 13s):
Verdugo, Ricky,

0 (12m 14s):
They

9 (12m 14s):
Go into like life Sonia common law, right? He speaks

0 (12m 16s):
A little common laws,

9 (12m 17s):
Scottish Highlanders,

0 (12m 19s):
Scottish Highlanders, for some reason, at one point

9 (12m 23s):
Farms in both clauses,

0 (12m 25s):
Even sort of start to diagram Madison sentence

9 (12m 28s):
As this court

0 (12m 31s):
And the net result. According to Adam Winkler was the four liberals, Stevens, Souter Brier Ginsburg seem to want to emphasize the militia part of the sentence. And then you had the four conservative justices Scalia, Thomas Alito, Roberts who seem to want to emphasize the people part of the sentence. The second part is

9 (12m 49s):
I don't see how there's any, any, any contradiction. Okay.

0 (12m 54s):
Tim peoples team, captain the quarterback, the first chair that day was without a doubt, justice Antonin Scalia.

9 (13m 2s):
Why isn't it perfectly plausible? Indeed. Reasonable to assume that since the framers knew that the way militias were destroyed by tyrants in the past was not by passing a law against militias, but by taking away the people's weapons

0 (13m 16s):
Well year throughout the arguments is that Scalia is very, very forwardly pressing this sort of individual rights

9 (13m 23s):
Argument speaks of the right of

0 (13m 24s):
The people and justice as like David Souter,

9 (13m 26s):
The kind of the military

0 (13m 27s):
Are arguing back saying, what about the collective, the militia, this goes on for well over an hour, the justice is sort of grilling the lawyers arguing amongst themselves. Everybody trying to figure out what was in James Madison's head until finally just as Briar. One of the liberal justices is like

9 (13m 45s):
Saying that this is unreal. Hold

0 (13m 47s):
The phone.

9 (13m 48s):
That really is my quest.

0 (13m 49s):
Forget what Madison intended. There is no way for us to know. Let's talk about now, let's talk about gun violence. This sentence was most definitely written about muskets. What about handguns and assault rifles? What is reasonable now?

9 (14m 5s):
80 to a hundred thousand people every year in the United States are either killed or wounded in gun-related homicides or crimes or accidents or suicides and suicides, more questionable. That's why I say 80 to a hundred thousand. Now in light of that, why isn't a ban on handguns, a reasonable or a proportionate response on behalf of the district of Columbia,

11 (14m 38s):
Because your honor, for the same reason, it was offered by numerous military officers at the highest levels of the U S military at all branches of service writing in two briefs, they, they agree with us. The handgun ban serves to weaken America's military preparedness.

0 (14m 55s):
Alan Gura basically argues when you take away people's guns, they're going to be less prepared if, and when they enlist in the army to which justice briars, like they can still practice shooting

9 (15m 6s):
With their rifles,

0 (15m 7s):
Which weren't banned in DC.

9 (15m 9s):
They can go to gun ranges, I guess, in neighboring states. But does that make it unreasonable for a city with a very high crime rate? Assuming that the objective is what the military people say to keep us ready for the draft, if necessary, is it unreasonable for a city with that high crime rate? Just say, no handguns here. I want to say that's that's you're right. Well, you want to say yes, that's correct. But I want to hear what the reasoning is because there's a big crime problem. I'm simply getting you to focus on that.

0 (15m 45s):
That by the way, it was justice Scalia telling Alan Gura how to answer justice briars.

11 (15m 52s):
The answer is yes, is justice Scalia noted and it's unreasonable. And it actually fails any standard of review that might be offered under such a construction of the individual, right? Because proficiency with handgun.

0 (16m 3s):
Anyway, the oral arguments last 97 minutes, far longer than most other cases. And going into the arguments, many Supreme court Watchers figured the case would be a close five, four decision. And it could go either way. And as with all of these close cases, the question was what would Anthony Kennedy, the swing justice do as in so many issues in America, it comes down to what does Anthony Kennedy belief. So at the oral argument, and I had the good fortune to be at the oral argument in the Heller case, everyone was looking to hear, what would he say about the second amendment? His was really the vote that counted and the very first comment he made

12 (16m 46s):
And has nothing to do with the concern of this remote settler to defend himself and his family against hostile Indian tribes, Outlaws, wolves, and bears and Grizzlies and things like that.

0 (16m 59s):
One of the first things he said was about bears. Like not bear arms, but grizzly bears. And the point Kennedy was trying to make was clear. Don't you think the framers had other reasons that they wanted people to have guns other than just being in a militia? Like what about people being in their homes and just needing to defend themselves?

2 (17m 21s):
And that's when I silently screamed at the top of my lungs so nobody could hear me. Yes, we win dot, dot, dot something,

0 (17m 32s):

We're back today explained featuring more perfect. When we left off, we were about to get a decision in the big second amendment case at the Supreme court district of Columbia V Heller.

21 (19m 58s):
Will you return now to the historic Supreme court decision handed down this morning?

9 (20m 2s):
Leo has our opinion this morning in case 0 7, 2 90 district of Columbia versus Heller. We hold that the second amendment guarantees an individual right to have and use arms for self-defense in the home and that the district's handgun ban as well as its requirement that firearms in the home be rendered, inoperative, fire lights, that bright.

22 (20m 23s):
It was a groundbreaking reading of the second amendment Scalia minimized that clause, referring to a well-regulated militia and put the stress on the second clause that referred to the right of the people.

9 (20m 39s):
The people will not be deprived of the right to keep and bear arms.

13 (20m 42s):
This

0 (20m 43s):
Was as good as it got for him on the bench.

22 (20m 45s):
I think so.

0 (20m 47s):
Rip the militia clause, December 15th, 1791 to June 26th, 2008, a pretty good run. If I'm being honest for the first time in the history of these United States, the courts definitively declared that the second amendment gives every American the right to a gun for self-defense.

2 (21m 7s):
It was a, it was a great day for freedom in America. It was a great day for the constitution. A great day for citizens. It's a great day for gun owners. It was great day for fearful people.

0 (21m 19s):
Of course not everyone

23 (21m 20s):
Agreed. I mean, to me, that's a travesty.

0 (21m 24s):
This is Jack Reiko,

23 (21m 26s):
Professor of history and political science at Stanford university.

0 (21m 29s):
He filed a brief for the court and he says, Scalia's reading of the history is just wrong.

23 (21m 34s):
The second amendment is not about individual, right? You could argue

0 (21m 37s):
That we shouldn't even be talking about history

23 (21m 40s):
Because the nature of firearms has changed so radically from the 18th century to our own time.

0 (21m 44s):
And that ultimately

23 (21m 46s):
I think it's all politics, to be honest. I mean, I, I, I didn't really believe in constitutional validity more. I think constitutional laws, a fiction, you know, it's become so highly politicized in so many areas I think has Susan laws is bunk. Wow. I just did. You know, I'm just starting. I'm not a lawyer, so I don't have any professional stake in defending the judiciary,

0 (22m 11s):
But there's a very big, but

22 (22m 14s):
He did have a major caveat.

9 (22m 15s):
The next section of our opinion points out that like most rights, the second amendment, right, is not unlimited.

22 (22m 20s):
He said like all rights, it's not absolute.

9 (22m 23s):
It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever. And for whatever purpose,

22 (22m 30s):
Which is very important to keep in mind

9 (22m 31s):
Or opinions should not be taken to cast doubt on long-standing prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places, such as schools and government buildings.

0 (22m 44s):
And this is another thing that we tend to forget. The decision says every individual has a right to bear arms, but most interestingly, like the decision also says, of course we need gun control. The word Heller has come to represent like second amendment rights. Like, are you for hell? Are you against Heller? Even though being for Heller is being for gun control. That's confusing. Yeah, it is. I mean, after all this time, it's still just totally confusing. You have a right to a gun, but the government has a right to regulate it to Keller gets his gun back in DC. But DC still, also has all sorts of gun regulations.

0 (23m 27s):
And you see the same pattern all over the country. Some states are lenient, some are super strict and both approaches seem to comply with Heller in a way the Heller decision is just like all those commas and clauses that we started with in James Madison's sentence. It's this confusing declaration that leaves the door wide open for interpretation, which obviously sucks. We could have used a little more clarity on how to live with this second amendment, right.

0 (24m 12s):
To bear arms. But that door being open. It gives us an opportunity. I think, An opportunity to get it right to fix it. It seems like now it'd be a pretty good time.

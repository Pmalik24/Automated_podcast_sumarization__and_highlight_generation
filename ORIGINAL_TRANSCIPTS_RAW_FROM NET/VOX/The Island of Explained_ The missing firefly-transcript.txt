Let's try something different. <inaudible>

0 (2m 20s):
It's a cold dark night in a city wrapped in secrets, but one small apartment on the 13th floor of a dark gray building is still lit by a single dim bulb. A sign on the door reads today, explained to kids a smaller sign under that reads Izzy podcast, producer and private eye. And under that and even smaller signs. This is an episode for kids. Parents listen at your own risk inside the apartment Izzy podcast, producer and private eye sits in the swivel chair. Thinking there are footsteps on the stairs and then a knock at the door.

3 (3m 11s):
Hello?

4 (3m 12s):
Hey there

3 (3m 14s):
I needed detective.

4 (3m 16s):
Well, you've come to the right place. Pull up a chair. I didn't catch her name.

3 (3m 21s):
Sarah. I'm Sarah.

4 (3m 23s):
Nice to meet you, Sarah. I'm Izzy. And how can I help you today?

3 (3m 27s):
My friend Luce is missing.

4 (3m 30s):
Okay. Can you describe this loose?

3 (3m 32s):
Sure. Of course. She's about one inch tall. She has six legs and sometimes her butt will light up bright green.

4 (3m 41s):
Got it. And I'm not sure why I think this, but my detective instincts are telling me that loose might not be a human.

3 (3m 50s):
Wow. You're good. Nope. Loose is a Firefly.

4 (3m 54s):
I knew it. All right. So tell me more about what Luce is like.

3 (3m 59s):
Well, Luce is, well, she's kind of a flashy personality. She's an artist actually. She'll flash her lights in special patterns and codes. This one time. I remember she and all her Firefly friends put on a light show in this forest in Tennessee, they lit up all together. So the whole forest looked like it was one big Firefly flashing in the night. It was so beautiful.

4 (4m 23s):
One big Firefly in the night. Got it. So when did you first notice your friend Louis was missing?

3 (4m 33s):
Well, it's been a gradual thing. She doesn't have a phone or anything, so it's not like I can just text her and meet up, but I've been seeing less and less of her and less and less of her friends too. And I suddenly realized the other day that it's been forever since I've seen Luce. And that really worried me

4 (4m 51s):
Very, very mysterious.

3 (4m 54s):
Do you think you can help?

4 (4m 56s):
Well, this is a really unusual case. Most of the people I tracked down are people not fireflies, but we do have one option. If you're willing to go on a bit of an adventure,

3 (5m 8s):
I'm up for anything. I just want to find my friend.

4 (5m 11s):
All right then, because I don't know much about bugs. Let's go to the one place. I can always find answers the place I go for my weirdest, most wonderful cases. Island of explaining

3 (5m 31s):
Well an island. Okay. Should I book plane tickets or boat tickets?

4 (5m 36s):
No. The island have explained as a special kind of island and there's actually a portal right here in my closet.

3 (5m 59s):
Wow. It's gorgeous here. Look at that lake instead of boat,

4 (6m 3s):
It is a boat hop in.

3 (6m 9s):
I've never seen loose on a lake before.

4 (6m 12s):
Oh, that's not why we're here. All right. Put this on

3 (6m 19s):
Diving suit.

4 (6m 21s):
Yep. This is deep dive link. It lets you dive deep on any subject. I figured the best way to start looking for loose is to learn more about fireflies in general. So we know where to look.

3 (6m 32s):
Sounds good to me. Let's come in.

4 (6m 35s):
Wait. One thing you need to know about deep dive lake. If you go too deep, you risk drowning in information.

3 (6m 45s):
Okay. That's a little scary.

4 (6m 48s):
We'll be fine. Probably now think long and hard about what you're trying to learn more about. And then on the count of three, we'll jump three

3 (6m 58s):
Fireflies

4 (6m 59s):
To

3 (6m 60s):
Higher flies

4 (7m 1s):
Jump.

3 (7m 9s):
Wow. It's all blue. Green down here.

4 (7m 13s):
Here comes a fact to posts.

8 (7m 16s):
So fireflies are beetles

4 (7m 18s):
Down here. All the animals tell you information about whatever subject you're looking into

8 (7m 23s):
And as beetles, that means that they have a kind of a neat lifecycle where they have a juvenile state just kind of looks like a caterpillar, but it's not a caterpillar. It's the larva. And then it goes into a pupil stage, kind of a Chrysalis. What you might imagine for a butterfly, but it looks a little bit different.

3 (7m 40s):
Okay. So Firefly babies have a learnable stage. That's cool, but I don't need to know about Firefly babies. I need to know where looses.

4 (7m 48s):
Well, all information is useful, but we can go a little deeper. Let's go see what that true lobby over there has to say.

7 (7m 57s):
Firefly babies, eat slugs and caterpillars, but adult fireflies usually eat nectar pollen or other fireflies.

3 (8m 7s):
Oh, okay. Still not that useful. I'll go further. Is that true? Labia following us,

7 (8m 14s):
Fireflies tend to live in forest or human places with lots of plants and streams. But right now some Firefly homes, their habitats they're being destroyed.

3 (8m 27s):
Wait, Firefly habitats are being destroyed. Does that mean we're destroying looses home. Hey, come back here. True labia,

4 (8m 38s):
Careful, Sarah, we're getting pretty deep. Now.

3 (8m 40s):
There's been a fact opposing in fact, to put what's going on with a Firefly habitats.

8 (8m 45s):
Well, unfortunately for a lot of fireflies, they're losing their habitat. They like to be out at night and they do a lot of flashes using their body to make light. And they flashed to communicate and send signals to each other. But we make the dark kind of disappear when we put lights on in our backyards and have a lot of light pollution. So they're facing a lot of threats just from being able to communicate with each other. And then also we use a lot of chemicals that make it hard for them to survive

3 (9m 14s):
Chemicals.

4 (9m 16s):
Sarah, you're really deep right now.

7 (9m 19s):
Chemicals like pesticides. For example, those are really bad for fireflies and it's not just fireflies,

3 (9m 27s):
Not just fireflies wait up

8 (9m 31s):
Each of the species that might be in a community. They're all interacting with each other.

3 (9m 35s):
So if it's bad for the fireflies, it's bad for everyone. Or if the fireflies are gone, everyone else suffers to,

7 (9m 43s):
Like I said, it's not just fireflies. Lots of bugs are struggling to cope with these things. And as they disappear, their communities are in danger of falling out of balance.

4 (9m 58s):
Sarah you're in too deep. I'm pulling the plug, come on, let's get to the surface. Are you okay?

3 (10m 12s):
I don't know. That was a lot to take in. Why is it so dark out

4 (10m 17s):
The sun must've set while we were down there. One let's get to shore. Okay. All good.

3 (10m 35s):
No, I am not all good. I am all wet. It's getting dark and a little cold and I thought we were just looking for my one missing friend or maybe just looking for a few missing fireflies, but it sounds like if there's a much bigger problem here, maybe with all bugs disappearing, and we're no closer to finding loose anyway.

4 (10m 55s):
Well that's not totally true. Sometimes deep dives can be really overwhelming. There's a lot of information and it can be pretty sad, but let's take a second to go over what we learned.

3 (11m 8s):
Okay. Well we heard a bunch of random facts about fireflies and then some sad news about destroying your homes and then some bad news about bugs in general.

4 (11m 19s):
All right, hold up. Think carefully about those random facts. Do you remember what the true lobbyists said about where fireflies live?

3 (11m 28s):
Humid widths. Wait, are there any humid woods near here?

4 (11m 32s):
There sure are. They're called the knock-on woods and they're actually really close by.

3 (11m 37s):
Do you think if we go to the woods, maybe we might find some fireflies who had nowhere looses.

4 (11m 43s):
That's exactly what I think.

3 (11m 45s):
Okay. Where are these woods?

4 (11m 47s):
Well, if we just walk over here and then around this wrong, see those trees.

3 (11m 54s):
Wait, look at that. That green light blinking.

4 (11m 59s):
Huh? That's funny.

3 (12m 1s):
That's loose. I know it is. That's exactly the pattern of lights she would blink when she came to see me loose, loose,

10 (12m 11s):
Sarah, what are you doing here?

0 (12m 17s):
And so as often happens in this line of work solving one mystery leads to the discovery of a new one, possibly an even darker one and even grittier one than the one where we began. How deep does it all go? We'll find out in a minute,

0 (13m 57s):
We're back with today, explain to kids. Let's continue with the case of the missing bugs

3 (14m 4s):
Lose. I can't believe I found you. I've been looking for you with my friend Izzy here.

4 (14m 9s):
Actually I'm a private, I'm not just a friend

3 (14m 12s):
Loose. Where have you been?

10 (14m 14s):
I've been here with most of my Firefly friends and a lot of other bugs to things at home are pretty bad. Our homes are disappearing. So we're trying to figure out how to save ourselves.

3 (14m 26s):
Yeah. I heard that fireflies and all bugs are in trouble, but how can you figure out how to save yourself here?

10 (14m 33s):
Well, the island of explained is where you go to find answers and we pick the knock on wood specifically because it's not just a great place for us to live. It's also a great place to run experiments.

3 (14m 45s):
How do you run experiments in the woods?

10 (14m 47s):
Well, the knock-on woods are special woods. Do you know what cause effect means?

3 (14m 53s):
Hmm. I'm not sure I do.

10 (14m 55s):
Let's say you do something like you're not going to treat. That's a cause and it has an effect. It makes a sound. But in the knock on woods, the effects of your actions are made way bigger and they happen immediately. So people use the woods to experiment. They say, if I do this, what would happen? Like watch what happens when I turn on these floodlights?

3 (15m 23s):
Whoa, whoa. It's bright in here.

10 (15m 25s):
Yeah. And what else do you notice?

3 (15m 27s):
Hmm,

4 (15m 28s):
I can't see your light anymore.

10 (15m 30s):
Exactly. When there's lots of light around Firefly lights get drowned out.

3 (15m 35s):
Ooh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

4 (15m 37s):
What is it?

3 (15m 40s):
A slug. I think it fell on me.

4 (15m 43s):
Slug fell on you. Does that happen?

3 (15m 47s):
It's not normal.

10 (15m 49s):
Take a look at the woods.

3 (15m 50s):
You,

4 (15m 52s):
Those are all slugs.

3 (15m 54s):
The whole woods is covered in them. What's going on

10 (15m 58s):
Too much light makes it hard for fireflies to communicate, right? So we might be seeing what happens if they all leave an area that has too much light.

3 (16m 7s):
Oh, because baby fireflies eat slugs. So if you have no baby fireflies, you'll end up with more slugs.

10 (16m 14s):
Exactly.

4 (16m 15s):
But what if slugs just love light? And that's why they're here. And it's not related to fireflies at all

10 (16m 22s):
The question. There's always some uncertainty when you're experimenting on something as complicated as an ecosystem, we'd have to do some more experiments to confirm. There are more slugs because fireflies are going away, but they definitely seem related. Want to see something else?

3 (16m 39s):
Yeah. Okay.

10 (16m 41s):
Watch what happens when I get rid of all the other bucks here, turn off that floodlight. I'm going to fly up and flash the signal. So they all leave the woods.

4 (16m 56s):
Oh, what is that? Horrible, horrible smell.

3 (17m 1s):
I'm kind of afraid to even shine my light, but here goes, oh no, I think it might be.

10 (17m 10s):
Yep. That's a huge pile of poop without bugs to break it down. You'd have a lot of poop and rotting stuff lying around. We've also run this experiment in the daytime. And we noticed that if all the bugs disappear, the birds and the woods disappeared too, because they don't have any bugs to eat and all the fruit on the trees and in the bushes, strawberries and the blueberries battle disappears too because bugs pollinate all those plants. Even chocolate might disappear.

3 (17m 43s):
No bugs. That means no chocolate. This is unacceptable.

10 (17m 47s):
I mean, no bugs also means no MI.

3 (17m 50s):
Yeah. Yeah. But also chocolate. This is terrible. I was just worried you were missing. And I was missing you as a friend, but now I'm realizing this is a much bigger problem.

10 (18m 1s):
Again, it feels like a pretty big problem regardless.

3 (18m 4s):
What do we do to save the chocolate?

10 (18m 8s):
Well, not all our experiments in the woods are scary. Like come over to the stream here. One of the reasons bugs like me have been leaving the real world is because the waterways where we raise our young have been getting polluted with harsh chemicals.

3 (18m 25s):
Oh look, the true labia said

10 (18m 27s):
True labia.

4 (18m 29s):
You were saying

10 (18m 30s):
Right. Well, so we wanted to see what would happen if we filtered out those chemicals, would that help bugs return? We've been filling the stream with all sorts of pollutants, but now let's see the effects of taking them away. This is an Aqua clean 3000. It's an island invention that filters. Colleen's that a freshwater.

3 (18m 56s):
Oh, look at all those lights. The fireflies are coming back

4 (18m 60s):
And it looks like the slugs are thinning out a bit too.

10 (19m 3s):
Interesting. So fireflies have come right back. And that does seem to have an impact on the slug population.

3 (19m 10s):
But the poop is still around.

10 (19m 13s):
Yeah. We'd send to leave that to the flies. Hang on. I'll call everyone back.

3 (19m 31s):
Oh, that's better. Okay. So now we know all this stuff. Are you going to come back?

10 (19m 39s):
I don't know. The more time I spend on the island of explained the more I wonder why I would want to go back. People don't seem to want us around very much,

3 (19m 48s):
But I'll miss your Firefly shows in the forest.

10 (19m 52s):
That was, were pretty great. Huh?

4 (19m 53s):
And Sarah did have a point there about the chocolate

10 (19m 56s):
Note to self lead with the chocolates.

3 (19m 60s):
I know what if we took the lessons you've learned and fixed the world, would you come back then

10 (20m 6s):
You would do that.

3 (20m 8s):
I mean, of course where your friends, right? Is he,

4 (20m 10s):
Well, technically I'm just closing a case.

3 (20m 13s):
We'd love to

4 (20m 13s):
Help. I guess we'd love to help.

10 (20m 17s):
That's so sweet of you. I didn't realize there were any humans left who cared about us bugs. I left to come home. Thank you so much. You guys are the best friends ever.

3 (20m 31s):
Well, I love you too loose.

4 (20m 33s):
Hang on there. Love bugs. It's one thing to fix the knock on woods, but there's a whole world out there. We can't just flip a switch and expect everything to get better. Just like that.

3 (20m 43s):
I mean, it does seem like a big task for just one or two people. I

8 (20m 47s):
Think one person can make a difference when it comes to insect of client. In

3 (20m 51s):
Fact, the puss

4 (20m 52s):
Suite, you can walk

10 (20m 54s):
Who's

4 (20m 54s):
This. We met her in the deep dive lake,

3 (20m 56s):
Hush. She's still

8 (20m 57s):
Talking. We can choose to turn off our light. Then our backyards. We can choose not to put as many chemicals as we normally might put on our backyard or our garden. And we can talk to our parents. We can talk to the principals of our schools. We can talk to the mayors in our towns to make decisions, to kind of preserve that habitat for lots of insects can thrive.

3 (21m 18s):
What do you think loose?

10 (21m 20s):
Those are all great ideas. You could start small with the lights and then work up to something big, like talking to the mayor. But the fact that pluses, right, even 1% can make a big difference.

3 (21m 32s):
Great. Let's get out of here. Izzy. We've got a world effects.

4 (21m 36s):
Sure. The exits right over here and would now be a good time to discuss my rate for

3 (21m 41s):
The Firefly.

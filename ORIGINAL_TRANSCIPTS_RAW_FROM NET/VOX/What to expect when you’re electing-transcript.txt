Hi, I'm nilay Patel co-founder and editor and chief of The Verge and host of decoder a new podcast from The Verge in the VOX media podcast network of a big ideas and other problems for over a decade. I've been interviewing leaders from the worlds of Technology business and policy about how they run their organizations make decisions and consider policy changes that could fundamentally alter entire Industries with decoder. I'll be expanding these conversations with a diverse cast of CEOs. Policymakers and innovators some you know, and some you wouldn't expect so look for decoder with nilay Patel in apple podcast or your favorite podcast app.

1 (46s):
Until 2010 exciting when you explain its they explained I'm Sean Rama sperm tomorrow is election day. This is election week and let's really hope it doesn't turn into election month, but it's 2020. So don't be surprised. If it does we figured it's high time. We talk about the path to victory for Joe Biden or President Trump Andrew broke up Vox. You've been writing about the paths. What can you tell

3 (1m 12s):
us? So to understand how the presidential election is going to play out. You have to understand the magic of the Electoral

1 (1m 21s):
College.

3 (1m 40s):
So Biden has led pretty significantly in polls of

4 (1m 44s):
the national popular vote all year, but

3 (1m 49s):
that doesn't matter.

4 (1m 50s):
What matters is whether

3 (1m 53s):
Biden or

4 (1m 53s):
Trump can win enough of the key swing states to put

3 (1m 58s):
together a coalition of

4 (2m 0s):
270

3 (2m 1s):
electoral votes. That's enough for a majority

1 (2m 4s):
270. That's the number everyone's got to be looking out for tomorrow to 72 win

3 (2m 9s):
as the saying goes.

1 (2m 10s):
So you need 270 to become the president of the United States 270 is the magic number again, they need 270 to win. It's a magic now. So as usual the contest has really zeroed

3 (2m 26s):
down on a few key States depending on how you define them. There could be maybe as many

1 (2m 33s):
as 14 swing States but election analysts think that this is really going to come down

3 (2m 38s):
to how six key States go. If most of these Six States and the electoral votes they have go toward either Biden or Trump that person will

1 (2m 50s):
win. Okay, beautiful. Let's start with the Six States. Can I guess them I'm gonna guess

3 (2m 56s):
Florida. Yes, Wisconsin,

1 (2m 59s):
Pennsylvania, Michigan,

3 (3m 2s):
Arizona. Hmm. How am I doing? You got one more?

1 (3m 7s):
I cheated. I looked at the notes, North Carolina, but I got the first five from memory,

3 (3m 12s):
but that's that's pretty good. That's a passing grade. Okay, great. Great.

1 (3m 15s):
So those are the big six. Those are the big six, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, Michigan. Wisconsin

3 (3m 23s):
Pennsylvania are the famous Upper Midwest or nearby Upper Midwest Trio that flipped from voting for democrats for many

4 (3m 33s):
years to voting

3 (3m 35s):
for Donald Trump in

1 (3m 36s):
2016. And the Wall comes tumbling down. This is the blue wall that Hillary Clinton talked about this is and then

3 (3m 43s):
you have Florida, Arizona and North Carolina. They also

1 (3m 49s):
voted for Trump in 2016,

3 (3m 50s):
but they were less. Close then

1 (3m 52s):
as you can imagine the crowd here, very loud. Very happy very boisterous. Okay, and what do we know about these Six States going into the election?

3 (4m 0s):
So you can really think of them as split up into those two groups the Florida Arizona and North Carolina group. It's not a regional group. But you know, when you look at the polls, they're all pretty similar with the polls. Show is Biden up by a Little bit on average

4 (4m 23s):
but not a ton.

3 (4m 25s):
So they appear to be if the polls are accurate and you know, they could of course be wrong, but they appear

4 (4m 32s):
to be true toss-up States maybe with a

3 (4m 35s):
slight Biden Advantage then you have the other three, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania,

1 (4m 43s):
Wisconsin, Michigan and

3 (4m 46s):
Pennsylvania. And Biden has had a larger lead in those.

4 (4m 52s):
It's according to polls and Trump won them. Very narrowly in 2016. Trump won all

3 (4m 58s):
three of those states by less than one percentage point over Hillary Clinton. So in a national race trending toward by then we're Biden is

4 (5m 7s):
polling

3 (5m 8s):
generally better than Hillary Clinton. It would make sense. If these crucial three states are also trending in Biden's Direction and that is what the state polls show but the state polls in these states were Off by several points in 2016 now pollsters have tried to fix this problem since then,

4 (5m 29s):
they need one important change which is

3 (5m 31s):
polarization based on

4 (5m 33s):
levels of education is now really

3 (5m 35s):
important

4 (5m 36s):
predictor of voting behavior

3 (5m 38s):
with non-college educated voters more likely to support Donald Trump

4 (5m 43s):
many pollsters did not

3 (5m 44s):
wait for that in their samples. So they ended up missing a lot of those non-college educated voters who prefer Trump. So a lot of pollsters have adjusted their practices to account for that. Will it be enough to fix the

4 (5m 58s):
problem? We won't know until the votes are

3 (6m 1s):
counted Donald Trump won. All of these Six States last time

1 (6m 5s):
Biden is currently ahead in state polls in all six of these states this time how many of them does he need to lock down the 270 electoral

3 (6m 14s):
votes? Well, the math is a little complicated because they all have different numbers of electoral votes. But basically so long as Biden holds

1 (6m 25s):
onto Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. He doesn't even

3 (6m 30s):
need necessarily, Florida or North Carolina or Arizona, huh? And if Biden manages to win, especially Florida, he has almost certainly won the presidential election. Florida is a big state 29 electoral votes and It's a must-win state for Trump based on his electoral math. If Trump loses Florida, he is almost surely losing the election and Biden picking off Arizona and North Carolina would obviously helped him get closer to that magic number of 270 also, but Biden can survive the loss of North Carolina, Florida and Arizona so long as he holds onto that tree.

3 (7m 16s):
Rio of Wisconsin Michigan and Pennsylvania,

1 (7m 19s):
Wisconsin, Michigan and

3 (7m 21s):
Pennsylvania, but if Trump flips for instance, Pennsylvania as well as those other three, Florida, North Carolina and Arizona, then Trump would be the winner. Okay, so there are various combinations

1 (7m 36s):
if Biden holds onto Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, you know, he's sitting pretty Photo will be decisive if Biden wins it Trump kind of needs it to survive. What about these 14 States? What are we looking for once use for the zoom out? Well, so once you get past

3 (7m 58s):
the core battleground of the six most crucial states, there are a few states that would be more of reach targets for Biden and there are a few that would be more of a reach targets for Trump. So Biden is currently looking looking at Georgia and Iowa and Texas and Ohio.

1 (8m 24s):
He is currently leading

3 (8m 25s):
polls by a little bit and Georgia and trailing very narrowly in Texas and Ohio, but all of these are definitely polling in the realm of competitive states that could go either way. Is there some sort of situation in

1 (8m 43s):
which Biden flips Texas where Just a done

3 (8m 47s):
deal. So this is a bite in Landslide scenario where in addition to winning the six core Battleground States Biden reaches further into Trump territory and flips other states that are also essentially must wins for Trump building out a very big Electoral College win. And of course Democrats have long dreamed of flipping, Texas, which is a massive prize 38 electoral votes has Voted consistently

4 (9m 17s):
Republican for a very

3 (9m 19s):
long time in presidential elections and the polls really do show a close this year. Democrats have had their hearts broken before in Texas races that look competitive. But you know if Biden went to Texas then the Trump is toast there's no way he can win. What about Trump? What's he trying to

1 (9m 38s):
achieve once you zoom out into these 14

3 (9m 40s):
States? So Trump's more optimistic targets, which are currently sort of less justified by what the polls show but you know, he'd like to flip them is a Nevada, Minnesota New Hampshire and Maine now some of these seem to have slipped a bit away from contention lately, even though Trump did pretty well. He didn't win any of these states last time but he was three points or Less behind Hillary Clinton in all of them. So, you know, you can see why he may have thought that he had a chance to flipping them this time around they clearly trended toward him to an extent.

3 (10m 26s):
He didn't miss winning them by much. But again, the current polls show them a bit Out Of Reach for him and they would probably only flip if if there is some serious pulling error and the poles are really missing some um support out there.

1 (10m 44s):
Is there any chance that they tie that they each get the same number of electoral votes.

4 (10m 50s):
They're very much isn't a chance. It's not likely it's never happened in modern American history, but there is an even number of votes electoral votes in the Electoral College. There's five thirty eight of them. So it is possible that they could split in a 269 versus 269 tie and

1 (11m 12s):
For that

4 (11m 12s):
happens then well, first of all, it would be crazy. Secondly

1 (11m 19s):
what happens is that

4 (11m 21s):
the election would be decided by the House of Representatives, but not ordinarily in a vote by the House of Representatives where each House member would vote. This would be a vote of House of Representatives State delegations, and it would be a vote in the next Congress. So basically in January Free after the house elections are all settled then

1 (11m 46s):
each

4 (11m 46s):
state in the house would have to determine who they would want to support for president. And basically whichever party has the majority of majority of States would end up determining the winner. So it's totally unclear how that would take out. It depends on how the house races pan out in 2020, but you know just because the Democrats are

3 (12m 12s):
Are

4 (12m 13s):
widely expected to hold their majority doesn't necessarily mean that they'll have the majority in enough States

1 (12m 21s):
why Andrew that sounds like a nightmare scenario

4 (12m 24s):
indeed, but we're just getting started with the nightmare scenarios.

1 (12m 54s):
It's more for the show today comes from all birds and all birds is thinking about the environmental impact of your clothing. So you don't have to just in case you're like not or whatever. They got a new apparel line and all of their tops and outerwear are made from the same premium natural materials that made their shoes. So great. We're talking. Yes Merino wool.

That is faragonda Cam explained that are gone.com / explained. 20 20 2012 20 broke up before the break you were talking about a nightmare scenario where these two septuagenarians tie and the House of Representatives decides sometime in January making an already Eternal election even longer but there are other potential unpredictable nightmares in this unpredictable year and they fought this of course

4 (15m 48s):
is an unusual year the Year of the covid-19 pandemic a year of unprecedented levels of male vote. And it's also a year in which there is a new phenomenon when it comes to who is choosing to vote by mail versus who is choosing to vote in person.

3 (16m 11s):
It's overwhelmingly Democrats who are

4 (16m 15s):
more likely to vote by mail and

3 (16m 18s):
Republicans and supporters of Trump have been telling pollsters all year and we're starting to see this in the data as well that they are. Or likely to show up

4 (16m 29s):
in person to vote and this is

3 (16m 32s):
probably because Donald Trump has spent months

4 (16m 37s):
disparaging the idea of male voting

1 (16m 40s):
thousands and thousands of people sitting in somebody's living room signing ballots all over the place. No, I think that mail-in voting is a terrible thing

4 (16m 49s):
accusing it of being unreliable saying there is fraud with male voting's and

3 (16m 54s):
there's no evidence of widespread. All voting fraud obviously weird things could happen with a

4 (17m 0s):
couple of ballots here and there but the bigger picture is that male voting is a time-tested and reliable system of voting that's been used by several States and happens to be the

3 (17m 13s):
president's method of voting of

1 (17m 15s):
choice because I'm allowed to

4 (17m 17s):
yes Trump himself seems to think that his own mail vote submitted in

3 (17m 23s):
Florida will be

1 (17m 25s):
safe. So something smells.

4 (17m 27s):
Elle's rotten about all this basically Trump has been sowing the seeds of doubt and there are some theories about what he might be up

1 (17m 36s):
to which is that on Election

4 (17m 41s):
night. It's going to take in certain States a long time to count these mail ballots. They just take longer to count than in-person votes because you have to look at the envelope. You have to check the voters signature to make sure that they're registered to vote. In the district, you need to sort it. You need to open the envelope you need to then put the ballot

1 (18m 5s):
in the ballot machine. And and this is when you're talking about millions and millions

4 (18m 10s):
of mail

1 (18m 11s):
ballots that takes time and the upshot is that certain states have really dropped the

4 (18m 19s):
ball on preparing for this most notably,

1 (18m 23s):
Wisconsin, Pennsylvania. You remember those three very

4 (18m 27s):
Social part of the core swing state Battleground and all three states have Republican

1 (18m 33s):
legislators and all three states have

4 (18m 37s):
refused to allow a significant window of time before the election where that difficult paperwork of mail ballots can be done. So that ballots can be approved or rejected and gotten ready for the count

1 (18m 52s):
before election day itself or right beforehand. So, Pennsylvania, mr. Get in Wisconsin Michigan Wisconsin are basically near-certain to be counting their mail ballots very slowly. And if those mail ballots are overwhelmingly Democratic, then the in-person

4 (19m 16s):
ballots are going to be counted

1 (19m 17s):
first and it's going to look like Trump is winning in those States. If you just

4 (19m 24s):
look at the boats

3 (19m 26s):
that come in as they are.

1 (19m 27s):
Counted and President Trump appears to be well aware of this he sent a tweet last week that said big problems discrepancies with mail-in ballots all over the USA must have final total on November

4 (19m 44s):
3rd and Twitter

1 (19m 46s):
flagged tweet for disinformation

4 (19m 48s):
because they said male voting is safe and secure,

1 (19m 52s):
but you see what he's trying to do there. He says

4 (19m 54s):
must have final total on November.

1 (19m 57s):
Bird because he expects in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Those very important States the count will show him

4 (20m 8s):
ahead on November 3rd because they're going to be so slow at counting the mail ballots that will favor

1 (20m 15s):
Democrats. So to be clear here, the very specific nightmare were talking

3 (20m 21s):
about is

1 (20m 23s):
a ton of votes are cast by mail in these big three states. We've been talking about, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and a lot of those mail-in

3 (20m 36s):
ballots are for Joe Biden, but a lot of the in-person voting on November 3rd tomorrow is

1 (20m 43s):
for Donald Trump and Donald Trump refuses to wait. Hear about the results from the mail-in ballots which take longer to count and declares Victory tomorrow before knowing the full

3 (20m 56s):
picture. Yes, what happens then? Technically,

4 (21m 0s):
it's up to state election officials to count these votes in the count is not going to

3 (21m 6s):
necessarily stop just because Donald Trump wants it to stop but here we have to

4 (21m 12s):
go back again to the Electoral

3 (21m 13s):
College and

1 (21m 16s):
the Electoral College is made

4 (21m 17s):
up of actual people. They are 538 people technically chosen by state legislatures now the state Slater's they just choose the people

3 (21m 30s):
that are nominated by the party who wins in

4 (21m 33s):
their state generally like if Biden wins in Pennsylvania than the 20 Democratic electors that the Biden campaign wants will be named the electors from Pennsylvania.

3 (21m 46s):
Got it. But what happens if there's a

4 (21m 48s):
dispute then again, it seems that the dispute might be able to be settled by state legislatures and in Michigan, Wisconsin. And

1 (21m 57s):
Pennsylvania, Michigan

4 (22m 0s):
Pennsylvania, those state legislatures are controlled by Republicans. Then this sort of thing might go to the courts and there was an interesting decision last week where two supreme court justices appointed by Trump Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh made clear that they believe State legislatures

3 (22m 22s):
have preeminent power over how elections in their state work. We don't know how The Fuller Supreme Court thinks about this but you know,

4 (22m 30s):
it's a little ominous potentially that that if there are certain antigens pulled off by these state legislators controlled by Republicans in states where Biden has legitimately one, but Trump is disputing that Victory do the mail ballots.

1 (22m 47s):
What if the state legislatures

4 (22m 49s):
go on with Trump and what if the courts agree to stand back and let it happen because you know, it's really up to the state legislatures and and it's not up to the people in the end.

1 (23m 1s):
Right? We covered this on the show last week with our colleague Ian milhiser. It seemed like at least a few of the conservative justices were saying that elections need a clear ending and that ending should be

4 (23m 13s):
tomorrow November 3rd, and we should point out that this is

1 (23m 17s):
completely

4 (23m 19s):
a historical and frankly

3 (23m 21s):
bizarre.

4 (23m 23s):
It regularly takes States weeks

3 (23m 26s):
to actually

4 (23m 27s):
Their election totals, there's no reason

3 (23m 30s):
by law that the election has to be decided by election night. It's it's simply not the case. In fact,

4 (23m 38s):
if it takes longer to actually count votes, then you have to count every vote that's legitimately cast

3 (23m 46s):
according to the rules is generally how things are supposed to work.

1 (23m 49s):
And this is all just one more

4 (23m 51s):
nightmare we'd have to deal with

3 (23m 52s):
and there are potentially more.

1 (23m 55s):
Well, let me

4 (23m 56s):
maybe alleviate a bit of this

3 (23m 59s):
nightmare scenario first. So basically the gist for this total nightmare scenario is that

1 (24m 6s):
it can only really

3 (24m 8s):
work for Trump. If the election comes down to

4 (24m 11s):
fight in can prevent that from happening by winning in the states where we are going to get a pretty good idea

3 (24m 22s):
what the result will be on Election night or soon afterward it Totally possible polls show Biden currently ahead

4 (24m 31s):
in Florida, North Carolina,

3 (24m 34s):
Arizona, Georgia, Iowa. And so if

4 (24m 38s):
Biden wins a few of those States, then he's going to be pretty clearly the presumptive winner of the election whether he actually gets over the magic number of 270

3 (24m 50s):
or whether he has to wait a bit for you

1 (24m 53s):
know, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and

4 (24m 55s):
Michigan he finished. Count will depend exactly on

3 (24m 60s):
which states flip into his column but if Trump does have a plan to contest the results

1 (25m 7s):
in Pennsylvania, that would only

4 (25m 12s):
fly if Biden hasn't won States like

3 (25m 15s):
Florida or North Carolina, which would pretty clearly position him as the winner.

1 (25m 20s):
What about the nightmare? We presently live in on the 2nd of November 2020. The one where Donald Trump hasn't even lost. This election yet, and he's already a sore loser where he might declare Victory prematurely and you know doesn't concede where he doesn't commit to the peaceful transfer of power, you know, all these things. He's been saying for the past few months. What if he loses and just doesn't go if Trump just says

4 (25m 47s):
I won't accept the election. I don't see how he could pull that off.

1 (25m 54s):
He needs a story to sell.

4 (25m 56s):
He needs a narrative. He needs an excuse and so he's been trying to float, you know problems with

3 (26m 2s):
mail ballots as that excuse.

1 (26m 4s):
But

4 (26m 7s):
but I don't know. There are a lot of republican-controlled states that use mail ballots and and they know that they are basically safe and fine. And so so that's kind of a tough sell, you know, usually when Trump does get to the brink with this stuff. He is often convinced to Get down we saw that for instance with Trump. Wanted to fire Robert Mueller. And for some reason he didn't he let Mueller finish his investigation because he basically got word from the Republican party that they wouldn't support that that was too far.

4 (26m 48s):
He should just let the investigation Play app

3 (26m 51s):
and there are various other things that that Trump has

4 (26m 54s):
tried to do that. The party has signaled they won't go along with now. There are other things that they have got along with and

1 (27m 3s):
so the question is which

4 (27m 4s):
category this hypothetical disputed election would fall

2 (27m 9s):
into

1 (27m 13s):
okay. So the elections tomorrow and there are three states that are going to be closely watched and those are Michigan, Wisconsin. Pennsylvania there are six states that will be

3 (27m 32s):
essential and

1 (27m 33s):
those are those three plus Florida North Carolina and Arizona. Then there are 14 states that could play sort of this critical role, but most of all it sounds like we should just all be prepared for election day to maybe be election week and hopefully not election month, but this is a pandemic. And it's going to take time

4 (27m 58s):
or it may not the result could be pretty clear on Election night. We just don't know it depends how close it is. When those votes start actually being counted. It could take weeks. It could take a few days or we could learn the results on Election night that is still a possibility.

1 (28m 18s):
So anything can happen. Exactly. Well Andrew will see you on the other side. Thank you. All right. Andrew Prokop will be covering and explaining the election results along with the rest of the Vox Newsroom this week at vox.com.

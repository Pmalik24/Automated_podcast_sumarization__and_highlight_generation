It's this American life from IRA glass today's show is a rerun from a few years back. So when we get to the musical that is written for today's episode by wind Manuel Miranda, and I say that he is best known for his Broadway show in the Heights. Please know that was actually true at the time. This is the greatest and definitely the most ambitious live show we've ever done. And it's a true variety show. Hope you like it. Hi for everybody. I'm speaking to you today from the stage of an opera house at the Brooklyn academy of music in New York city, According to listeners that there is mild cursing throughout this hour and on the podcast, we're not gonna beep that. And I'm here on an opera house stage with a story that is so small.

1 (1m 14s):
It almost feels wrong to tell it in a room. This grand it's actually about a real opera singer, not a super famous upper singer or anything like that. Parn Guri makes about half of her living singing the other half. She makes recording audio books. And about a year ago, she was staying at a hotel and she had a deadline on this children's book that she was supposed to be recording. And the hotel room was kind of noisy. She was singing a lot of noise from the street. And so she looked around for a quiet place and she went into the closet, put pillows all around to deaden the sound, sat on the floor with microphone. And then the cord of the microphone went under the door of the closet, out to her laptop, cuz her laptop had a fan that made noise.

1 (1m 56s):
And so she closes the door. So it's pitch dark except for the light from her iPad, which had the text of the book that she was supposed to read. And she began

3 (2m 6s):
The exciting exploits of an effervescent elf written by Trisha sugar, EC and narrated by Karin Gil free chapter one. Where is Emma? The enchanted forest was deep and green and splashed

1 (2m 24s):
With I just say, wouldn't it be incredible if I just now played you the entire audio book, you paid like 85 bucks for those seats, right? Actually I can't play you the whole audio book because Karin gets exactly like two and a half sentences into this book and she stumbles in word and she's says, oh wait, I'll just, I'll just start again. I'll just start from the beginning. So she gets up to go to the closet and start the tape again, start the recording again. And she tries to get outta the closet.

2 (2m 57s):
Oh shit.

1 (2m 58s):
And she discovers that she's locked in.

2 (3m 7s):
Oh my God, seriously.

1 (3m 11s):
The car told me at first she thought like this isn't gonna be that hard right after all, she has the iPad there's wifi. She could call the front desk on Skype. Right. But it was a problem.

3 (3m 21s):
This wifi was like half of one bar and it kept just cutting out. But I found the hotel number.

1 (3m 30s):
This of course is on the recording.

3 (3m 32s):
2 1 2 6 6 1 9 6 0. I dialed it.

4 (3m 43s):
Thank you for calling the Roosevelt hotel. Please listen carefully to the following options for additional information about the hotel, please visit our website.

3 (3m 52s):
And then of course it's like the longest hotel phone menu ever

4 (3m 57s):
For sales and catering services, press three for accounting, press four for the human resources office, press five.

3 (4m 7s):
And I'm like trying to press zero to get to the operator. And I'm thinking the WiFi's gonna cut out at any moment. So I'm listening to like this giant long menu. And finally I hear is

4 (4m 18s):
That any time you wish to speak to an operator, press eight.

3 (4m 22s):
So I press eight

4 (4m 27s):
Reservations. May speaking may assist

2 (4m 29s):
You. Hi, I'm actually in room 1136. Can you hear me? Can you hear me fuck

1 (4m 43s):
After that? There's seven minutes of silence on the recording. Just like total silence. Nothing happens except every now and then Karen just laughs to herself that happens one minute and 48 seconds after the phone call, then it's quiet. There's no other sound for 44 seconds. And then on the recording, you're hear now. And then she tries the door handle again, thinking she told me later, you know, this can't really be true. Like this can't this gotta be a way. This is gonna work. One wall of the closet has the hallway on the other side and 18 minutes after Karen locks herself in, she hears people.

1 (5m 23s):
She hears some German tourists walking towards her, down the hall. And fortunately she actually has the skills for this very situation.

2 (5m 35s):
Hello? Can someone help me?

1 (5m 54s):
Germans come to the door of the room. They whisper to each other for a little bit. And then they do nothing.

2 (6m 2s):
Hello?

1 (6m 15s):
Her. Husband's out on an audition. He's also a singer and his phone was turned off. She texts her mom. Here's nothing back. She phones her mom and right then somebody taps on the door of the hotel room and calls through it. Are you okay?

3 (6m 28s):
Yes, please. Come in.

1 (6m 30s):
Can you come to the door? The person asks

3 (6m 33s):
I can I'm I'm stuck in the closet. Hello in the closet right here. Oh, thank you. I'm an audio book narrator and I was trying to

2 (6m 49s):
Marry,

3 (6m 52s):
Oh my gosh.

1 (6m 53s):
Carrin knows. It's a really weird thing to say to somebody as you're getting rescued, but she just couldn't help herself. Nobody wants to look like a nut. You know, apparently the Germans went and they found this very sweet Jamaican housekeeper and 22 minutes after Karen was locked in to a housekeeper set her free

3 (7m 10s):
God, I was so happy to see her. And she was so nice. Oh my gosh. She was so nice.

1 (7m 18s):
I know this is a weird question, but like, is it appropriate to tip in a situation like that?

3 (7m 24s):
I, I don't know. I didn't think of it then

1 (7m 27s):
Now Karen, remember she's just an opera singer, right? And operas are all about spectacle. You know, it's 80 peoples on the stage and horses and love and vengeance and big grand feelings. It was really, it would really be hard to get further from that, to what happened to her in that closet, right? Where all the action takes place in a space, not much bigger than your body. It is the simplest plot imaginable. There's literally no movement in this plot. If someone were to stage this as an opera, how would that go?

3 (8m 1s):
It might be minimalist music actually.

1 (8m 4s):
Oh, right.

3 (8m 5s):
Like just a repeating theme over and over and over again with me yelling help.

1 (8m 16s):
And you know, people say those kinds of things in interviews. And then I'll put that quote at the end of the story and make sure nice ending, put a little Planky music under it. And maybe you've heard our show. But when we did this interview, like three or four weeks ago, I realized, oh wait a second. For once in my life, I don't have to let this story stop here. I am actually gonna be in an opera house very soon. I can reach retire with this. I can take this to the next logical step. The step. It never gets you the step you need an opera house for. And it turns out I actually have a hookup for the kind of music that Karin is talking about. Some of you know this, I have a cousin, his name is Philip Glass.

1 (8m 56s):
He is written a number of minimalist operas. They've been performed here on this very stage since the 1980s. And so I called Phillip and he sat down to write. And so today, right now I am pleased to present here on the Brooklyn academy of music, opera house stage the world, premier of his latest opera. I am not joking. This opera is called help Commission for our program today on the bam opera house stage, his work is played by orchestras all over the world. Please welcome Philip Glass and the performance with him.

1 (9m 58s):
Jonathan Dingley on violin, Emily brow and cello. And of course the woman, this is all about Karen Gil free Metso soprano, Karen bra and Welcome WB Z Chicago.

1 (11m 33s):
It's this American life. I'm our glass ladies, gentlemen for decades. The Brooklyn academy of music has been a home for all sorts of new kinds of theater and dance and music and opera. And when they invited our program to perform here today, we wanted to live up to that tradition by trying to invent something new. And so what you're in for today is true stories. It's journalism like we always do for presented as radio drama. And we think these are radio dramas. Like you have never heard before we have journalism turned into opera into a full on Broadway musical. We have journalism turned into a play that is structured like a radio documentary. In fact, is there are so many ways you can tell a true story. There are so, so many ways. And today, instead of just applying the tools of journalism to everyday stories like we usually do, we try to harness the full power of music and theater, like Karin's story.

1 (12m 23s):
We are not done with Karin's story. Sure. You could do it as a minimalist opera, but what if you wanted to stage it as like kind of an old school opera opera, the kind that they take you on field trips to when you're a kid, like what would that be? I asked Karin in our interview and she was game to speculate.

3 (12m 44s):
Oh, I don't know. I mean, I, as a whole opera, I mean, opera is long. Maybe, maybe the elves from the book would come and PR around and sing about the enchanted forest. That was the book I was narrating.

5 (13m 43s):
Guys,

1 (13m 44s):
You would need more than elves in this story. Like Austin, you would want

3 (13m 47s):
The people, the people walking around the closet, the German people there could be, you know, I just got to New York sung in German.

1 (14m 6s):
Actually what they're singing is we have just arrived. The air is dirty and smoggy.

5 (14m 35s):
I have lost.

1 (14m 48s):
I don't know if you got the German there. One of the tourists says, I think someone called for help in German. And the other one says impossible. Everyone in this country is obliterate. Then there's the front desk lady. You know the one that Karen calls from her iPad. Right?

3 (15m 7s):
It could be funny if she was like, oh, my life is so boring. You know, I just answer this phone all day. And people ask for room service, you know, you do a cutaway, I'm stuck in the closet. And finally, this is her big moment and she doesn't even know it.

5 (15m 24s):
Oh, it's so it's it's

2 (16m 12s):
Then

1 (16m 13s):
There's the husband in this version of story, we could actually see him out on his audition, belting his heart out oblivious to the pain that his wife is going through.

3 (16m 23s):
So maybe we could incorporate some kind of famous baritone aria.

1 (16m 27s):
I wonder like what would be the most appropriate and ironic aria for him to be singing?

5 (16m 33s):
Oh,

3 (16m 33s):
I don't know something about love. I'm sure. Or something about being a rescuer.

1 (16m 39s):
We actually talked about what would be best. And we finally settled on a scene from TTO where the title character who loves his daughter more than anything in the world, rages against courtiers who have locked her up in a tiny room, open up that door. He sings open up

5 (17m 33s):
God. That was great. Carrin will be so proud of me.

1 (17m 41s):
Of course, the climax of her opera arrives with the entrance of the housekeeper. What should she be like in the opera version of this story?

3 (17m 50s):
Gosh, I mean, maybe she just rescues people all day. Maybe somebody's having a baby and she delivers a baby and then she cleans up after it. And like

1 (18m 1s):
She saves a guy who's out on a wedge. She gets to

5 (19m 36s):
The

3 (20m 10s):
Seriously true story.

1 (20m 34s):
Our opera in shrank or trapped in the closet was posed by Matt coin, music direction and keyboards by William Hobbs. It featured Rachel Stein, Candace hoes and Sarah Craft bezels Marni Breckenridge is the front desk. Adrian Rosa says the husband, Shane Debe as the housekeeper rod Gil. Who's actually Karen's dad as the German tourist with Heather Buck and met soprano Karen as herself,

2 (21m 6s):
Which

1 (21m 7s):
Means to F1 F1 21 Trump street, the musical I've always, I've always wondered what it would mean to try one, one of our radio stories as a musical, you know, I was taken to so many musicals as a kid. And I think because of that, my basic sense of what makes a satisfying story actually comes from musical. It's much more than from, from TV or movies. If you think about like the classic old musicals were on the roof or even cosine, it's like, they're funny at the beginning. And then there's something really emotional and they're about some bigger idea. They take you into this world. I just, I just love that. And so what you're about to hear is our first attempt at a musical based on journalism, probably 70 to 80% of what you're about to hear is verbatim quotes from interviews.

1 (21m 54s):
The rest is artistic invention. I'll say that upfront. It's based on a true story. You may remember from our radio program, back in May, 2011 at a bunch of high schools in Palm beach county, Florida, a group of young police officers were sent undercover to pose as students. They went to classes, they ate in the cafeteria. They had fake Facebook accounts. Of course there have been complaints about drugs being sold at these schools. That's what they were there to deal with. And what happened next in this one, school was transformed into a musical by a team of people who usually do this on Broadway. Pretty much everybody involved in this, the cast, the chorus, the musicians, the director, Michael mayor, all from Broadway words and music are by Lynn Manuel Miranda probably best known, probably best known for writing and starring in, in the Heights.

1 (22m 43s):
He will be your narrator.

8 (22m 49s):
The plan was called operation D and one of the schools included in the plan was park Vista, community high school where a kid named Justin Laboy.

9 (22m 58s):
That's me

8 (22m 59s):
An 18 year old honor roll team. I guess,

9 (23m 2s):
Straight as man

8 (23m 3s):
Was in the last semester of his senior year. Justin could hardly believe his luck when a very pretty girl showed up and not one, but two of his classes,

5 (23m 15s):
Nile.

8 (23m 17s):
She sat in front of him.

5 (23m 19s):
He switched seats. Nile.

8 (23m 23s):
The last name she used was Justin. What drew you to Naomi? Initially,

9 (23m 33s):
Man, she used to fall asleep in class. She was a light-skinned Puerto Rican, Dominican long hair, mature in the body life.

5 (23m 42s):
Whoa, whoa. That's

9 (23m 44s):
Not the only reason I like to though. She said she moved with a mother to fly from New York where dreams are made. Well, so did I. So I said, hi, she seemed and what the heck I gotta do to be with you? What the heck I gotta do? What the heck I gotta do to be with you? What the heck I gotta do. Tell me who I gotta be for you to be with me. You told her all this in class. Well, yeah, I texted her, you know, I was like, what the heck I gotta do to be with you?

9 (24m 30s):
What the heck? I gotta do what I be with you? Tell me who I gotta be for you to be with me.

10 (24m 42s):
Smiley face.

9 (24m 43s):
Yes. Next thing you know it texting day and night, I trust her right away. Like whoa. And yo, I never met anyone like her bro. Yo, she listens to all my problems. I let her copy all my homework and then I lay it all on the line and she was like, no, no, no. She didn't say no. Exactly. I don't. No, no, no, no. Yeah. Was surprised. I'm a pretty great guy. So, so, so I decided I needed to step my game up. Oh, oh, oh it's too late to be shy.

9 (25m 26s):
So I got in front of the whole class one day and I ed her. I was like, what the heck I gotta do? What the heck I gotta, what the heck I gotta do to be with what the heck? I tell me who I be for you to go to prom with mayor? You asked her to the prom. Yeah. I danced everything. You know me?

9 (26m 7s):
Will you go with me?

10 (26m 10s):
I'll think about it.

11 (26m 12s):
She'll think about it. It'll she said to think it'll it'll it'll it?

10 (26m 33s):
I didn't say yes. I didn't say I'll think about it. I can't tell you my real name, but yes, I can confirm that. I did get asked to the prom.

9 (26m 42s):
You have to cover officer

8 (26m 43s):
Who poses. Naomi is 25 years old, a new recruit with the Palm beach police force

10 (26m 50s):
My assignment to pose as a senior and find out who's buying. Who's selling mostly pills and weed. You would not believe how easy it is to get pills. And we

8 (27m 4s):
What's the hardest part.

10 (27m 6s):
The cafeteria imagine hundreds of teenagers yelling and running full speed and the lack of deodorant. Let's just say, I would drink at the end of the day. Seriously, these kids need to learn. There are consequences in life. If I'm doing my job and I'm doing it right, I am making life safer. One school at a time.

8 (27m 34s):
So we asked you to prom,

10 (27m 35s):
Right? I gave every excuse. I said, it's too expensive. Which is totally true. By the way I told him, look, I'm just a transfer. I wouldn't feel comfortable with all your friends. And it's true. You make friends on the job. Then it ends. You meet kids who are sensitive, smart, and defenseless. Those are the ones you remember. The ones that you think about after you are seriously. These kids need to learn. There are consequences in life. If I'm doing my job and I'm doing it right life a

8 (28m 21s):
Meanwhile,

9 (28m 22s):
What the heck I gotta do to be with you? What the heck I gotta do? Tell me who I gotta be for you to be with me.

10 (28m 37s):
Do you smoke?

9 (28m 38s):
What

10 (28m 39s):
You smoke weed?

9 (28m 41s):
No I don't. But if that's what you need, I can find some for you. I can be your,

10 (28m 47s):
You would do that

9 (28m 49s):
For me. I can be your guy.

10 (28m 52s):
Seriously. These kids need to learn. There are consequences life. I'm my, and I'm I life a time.

9 (29m 7s):
Listen, I'm not a drug dealer. So it's not like she asked me this day and I got it for her the very next day. It took me a while. You know? So I mean, I'm trying to get it and I can't get

8 (29m 18s):
It. What are you thinking? As you're trying to get this pot to sell her,

9 (29m 21s):
I'm thinking, what the heck am I doing? I never done this before. So I'm, you know, I'm really scared and skeptical at the same point.

8 (29m 28s):
What did you end up doing?

9 (29m 36s):
I called a cousin who called the cousin who called his friend who called a couple dozen cousins. Cuz it doesn't end my cousin. Justin's looking for a little something, something for a certain someone, some girl he wants to be touching every,

13 (29m 48s):
Everybody's got a cousin who can hook them up with something. Everybody's got a, who can hook them up with.

9 (29m 54s):
So we were just discussing our cousin, Justin wasn't Justin, the cousin who just made the honor roll. Got the colleges buzzing. Are we close to our cousin? Justin? Are we supposed to trust it? Are we thug to our cousin? Justin? We don't sell drugs.

13 (30m 7s):
Everybody's got a cousin. You can hook them up with something. And everybody got a cousin who can hook them up with something.

10 (30m 13s):
Did you get it yet?

9 (30m 15s):
No. I'm about to get it.

10 (30m 16s):
Is your dealer, a student? I

9 (30m 18s):
Got you girl. Don't sweat it.

10 (30m 20s):
Let me know when you got it.

9 (30m 21s):
As soon as I can,

10 (30m 23s):
I'll find a way to repay you Justin.

9 (30m 25s):
Oh man. Yo, what is up with this? Fussing. This isn't up for discussion. This is our cousin coming to us. He's our blood and we love him. Ah, look at Justin. He flushed it. Our little Justin is crushing are for rushing the judgment. Why should we get you? He drugs? What? Only if you believe in

5 (30m 45s):
Love, love,

9 (31m 2s):
Get him the stuff. I hear my cousin, 25 ducks, some sweat and buckets. He hears me a sandwich bag with some little green nuggets. I got it for you.

10 (31m 11s):
Exo. Cool.

9 (31m 12s):
You want it now?

10 (31m 14s):
See you at school.

13 (31m 15s):
Everybody's got, you can hook them up with something everybody's got, you can hook them up with, everybody's got a,

8 (31m 51s):
Now, according to the police, Justin is a drug dealer. Maybe Justin didn't know where to get drugs. Maybe he did what we know is this, the next day Justin brought a rolled up baggy of marijuana to school for Naomi.

9 (32m 4s):
And I was like, oh my God, I'm actually about to do this. So we was in class and I sat down right next to her and she was like, Justin,

10 (32m 13s):
Do you have it?

9 (32m 14s):
Yeah I do. And I was like, you know what? We're gonna wait for a few cuz I didn't want to be like, oh Hey and just slot it in her hand or whatever. So we waited

5 (32m 29s):
And

9 (32m 29s):
She was like,

10 (32m 30s):
Okay, put it in my purse.

9 (32m 33s):
So I slid it right in there. And then she was like,

10 (32m 37s):
Okay here, take the money, Justin here, take the money.

9 (32m 46s):
I don't want your money. I got this just for you. Keep your money. It's nothing. I do feel I come through feel every time. Just time

10 (33m 4s):
Justin, listen, please just

9 (33m 6s):
Take the there's a reason you were. You're making me

10 (33m 10s):
Take the

9 (33m 12s):
There's a reason. This is you. Only one. Every time

8 (33m 53s):
Justin would later find out it's a felony in Florida to sell marijuana. And the penalty is even harsher for selling it on school property. By taking the money, Justin had made an irreversibly bad decision. And since he was over 18, he was legally an adult. When he made it

10 (34m 9s):
Seriously, these kids need to learn. There are consequences in life. I am doing my job. I am doing it right. I am making life safer. One school had a time

8 (34m 23s):
In may. The police arrested 31 students at several schools. Justin was one of them.

9 (34m 29s):
Freeze. You have the right to remain silent. Everybody who so trust undercover cops is busted everybody. So trust undercover. Cops is busted. Everybody who sold drugs to undercover. Cops is busted. Everybody who sold drugs to undercover. Cops is bust in.

8 (34m 47s):
He spends a week in jail. Wondering what would happen next?

9 (34m 51s):
It's a word of confers. The cops of every text, the cops of every text, the cops of every text. Don't worry. God, I got that stuff. I got you.

8 (34m 60s):
He knew he'd lose in court. He had to take a plea.

9 (35m 3s):
Three years probation. I plea guilty to the felony. What? A felony, a nickel pass a felony. What? Justin say goodbye to college. They got you.

10 (35m 12s):
These kids need to wake up. I don't wanna go too much into it, but drugs hit really close to home. For me saw the effects growing up of cocaine, marijuana ecstasy

8 (35m 23s):
With family members.

10 (35m 25s):
Yes. I've seen what it can do to a family. That's all I wanna say about it.

8 (35m 30s):
Do you wish someone like you had done this type of work?

10 (35m 33s):
Yes. And I hope someone like me keeps doing it still. There are kids. You remember the ones that you think about after you are gone

8 (35m 47s):
During the week he spent in jail, Justin couldn't help. But think about Naomi.

9 (35m 52s):
She was a life skinned, Puerto Rican, Dominican long hair, mature in the body life. Whoa. That's not the only reason I liked her though. Yo, if it had been a guy that came up to me asking me for drugs, I would've said no, I would've said get outta my face. I don't hang out with people like that. It's cuz it was her.

1 (36m 16s):
Have

8 (36m 17s):
You talked to her since all of this happened?

9 (36m 19s):
No, I would love to. I would love to have that conversation.

8 (36m 24s):
What do you think you would say?

9 (36m 27s):
I would say what the heck did you do?

5 (36m 34s):
What

9 (36m 35s):
The heck did you do

2 (37m 9s):
Our,

1 (37m 11s):
We Mendez Naomi Anthony Ramas is Justin the chorus. Alex bun, Gerard Cano and Antoine. Holly are narrator wind manual Miranda who also wrote the words and composed the music, the musicians, music director, Ben Cohen, Sean McDaniel, mark van DPO, David chin GRA Jonathan DWI, Emily Browza with Scott Wasserman to everybody who was actually listening to this right now on the radio or podcast. I should say the staging of this story was like a 14 minute nonstop dance number from start to finish choreographed by Lauren gutta, costume sets, lots of laugh.

Hey, this American life listeners, I'm Anna Martin, the host of the modern love podcast. In every episode, we peek into an intimate corner of someone's life and learn about what love means to them. You know, I can tell you 35 years with another person, I've never spent that much time with anyone else either. So we both kind of said, I love you pretty fast. My advice is that it's okay. If it's hard, you can listen to modern love wherever you get. Your podcasts

1 (40m 8s):
Today's program is first broadcast in 2014, this American live from IRA glass each week on our program, we choose a theme, bring you different kinds of stories on that theme today from the stage of the Brooklyn academy of music in Brooklyn, New York city, the radio

2 (40m 21s):
Drama episode,

1 (40m 26s):
We have journalism memoir, true stories, staged as radio drama. We have arrived at act two of our show act two of my son, men. So this next bit of radio drama is not an experiment for us like a musical or at opera. We thought it would be smart to have one story in today's show where we know what we're doing, a type of radio drama. We actually bring you now. And then on the program, a true story told on stage by the person that it actually happened to please welcome comedian Mike Burbiglia,

16 (41m 13s):
It's pretty easy following a musical. I, I think that my favorite thing about being married is actually that you can share jokes with your wife or husband that are funny to you and that person and no one else other than maybe your cat, cuz when you have a cat, your barometer for humor out the window last summer, my wife and I went on a trip to Massachusetts and, and I called it Chu, which is not funny.

16 (42m 1s):
But in our house was the joke of the year. I was like, we're going to cats, Massachusetts. My wife is like, I was like, our cat was like a, everyone loves a good pun when you have a cat. And so, so we drive a cat to choose. And when we arrive, my wife has a headache and she asked me if I will acclimate Ivan, that's our cat to the bedroom cuz you can't just put an indoor cat into a house cuz he'll explode. And so I bring him in the bedroom, but I'm so tired from the drive that I fall asleep, which is the only thing you cannot do when acclimating an indoor cat to a house.

16 (42m 45s):
And so I wake up an hour later, Ivan is gone, he got out. And so now I'm running around the house. I'm like, I'm, you know, I'm like, cat's gonna explode. I wake up my wife. I say CLO her name's Jen. I say, Mr fantastic is gone. His name's Ivan and CLO gave me a look that I can only describe as divorce eyes. Because before that point I was convinced that we would be married forever. And then once I saw the divorce size, I was like, oh, I guess this could end.

16 (43m 26s):
And, and if it ended, it would look a lot like that. And so now, now two of us are running around the house. I'm like, my marriage is falling apart. Like cat's gonna explode and we find Ivan, but we had another major problem in the house, which is that there were mice in the house. It was actually worse than that because they were, they were parasitic mice. They have what's called toxoplasmosis, which means they have a, yeah, you might know what this is. They have a parasite in them. And as a result, they're unafraid of cats and they're unafraid of people.

16 (44m 6s):
And the way we discovered this was that my wife was watching TV and she looked next to her and there was a mouse and he was watching TV also. And she screamed and he just looked up at her like Stuart little like, Hey, what's going on? I don't like, like this show either. I don't know why all those women would wanna marry that one guy. And then she pushed him off the couch and he didn't even run away.

16 (44m 46s):
He didn't even scurry, which is a Feb invented for mice. He just walked into the kitchen like a roommate, like fine, I'll go in the other room. I just think you're overreacting. And then he did a confessional into the mouse cam in the kitchen. He was like, I'm not here to make friends. I'm here to win. I was here before they came. I'll be here when they're gone. I'm a mouse.

16 (45m 28s):
That's some real mouse lives of cats that night I'm I'm sound asleep. And my wife wakes me up by grabbing my face. She says Mo my name's Mike, Mr. Fantastic found the mouse. You need to get the mouse. And I sit up and I say, CLO, we have a cat. We do everything for the cat. We give him food. We give him an apartment that he thinks is the world.

16 (46m 12s):
We set aside an area in the apartment for him to poop in that we clean more often than the area where we poop. We have a gentleman's agreement that in the unlikely event that a mouse should walk in that door. He will kill that mouse. We'll never split that mouse again. He will be protected. That's from cat father.

16 (47m 1s):
My wife says Mo get the mouse. And I sit up and I see what may be the strangest Tableau I will ever witness in my entire life. I've been smacking. The mouse, the mouse flies in the air lands gets up, walks back towards Ivan. Ivan smacks. The mouse flies in the air lands gets up, walks back towards Ivan. Ivan is thrilled. His toy is alive.

16 (47m 41s):
I have a serious sleepwalking disorder. So as I am watching this, I'm not even really sure it's happening. I'm thinking I've had this dream before my wife says Mo get the mouse and she hands me a cup. I sit up, I walk towards the mouse and the mouse walks towards me. I put the cup over the mouse. I put a magazine under the cup. I take the cup into the backyard and I put the mouse into the forest where I can only assume that he walked into the mouth of a Wolf.

16 (48m 38s):
And from that day forward, we have called it Massachusetts. I want to point out something really special that happened there at the end a few minutes ago, I prefaced the story with a Massachusetts based pun cats, which we all agreed as a group is not funny. Just moments ago.

16 (49m 27s):
I concluded the story with another Massachusetts based fund that was nearly identical and that was Massachusetts. And we applaud it,

2 (49m 47s):
Which

16 (49m 48s):
Means in a way it's like we're married

1 (50m 2s):
Mike Bigley to everybody hearing us on the radio. There was a person in a mouse costume at roller skates. And that story doing some funny stuff to see the video of this entire show. So you understand where people are laughing at. You will not be sorry, this American life.org,

16 (50m 26s):
We have

1 (50m 27s):
Arrived at act three of our show. Act three. How do you slow this thing down? So this story is a follow up to a story that we ran a couple years ago, which was a full episode of our show about one of our contributors, Josh Bearman and his family. The set up is that Josh's parents got divorced when he was very young and he and his brother, Ethan grew up with their dad. Who's a physicist out in suburban Los Angeles, Josh's mom and his half brother, David lived very differently. They drifted around, they ended up in Florida. They were barely keeping it together. Josh's mom was an alcoholic. David was an aspiring rapper getting acquainted with the court system together.

1 (51m 7s):
They lived in this tiny condo, in a retirement community in west Palm beach called century village, where they did not belong. They were not retirees. And they would get into various kinds of jams and crises. And Josh would have to fly to Florida to try to help. He ended up spending a lot of time there where you're about to hear is an experiment at creating a radio drama, which has exactly the same structure as one of the documentary stories on our show. And so what's gonna happen is the real Josh Bearman is gonna narrate. And then instead of going to, you know, like quotes on tape or things like that, we have actors performing scenes that really happened. All of this really happened in those scenes. Josh has played by Josh Hamilton. His brother David is played by James Ranson.

1 (51m 49s):
The story begins last year when real life Josh found himself back in Florida with his two brothers.

17 (51m 58s):
My mother's been in the hospital so much by now. She's figured out how to direct the paramedics, like emergency show firsts or something to all the best facilities. Her room at Wellington regional is big and bright. It's a corner room with big windows and a nice view, although she can't see it because right now she's connected to state of the art equipment behind a curtain. When I walk in my brother, David, is there already,

18 (52m 23s):
Hey man. Oh, this whole thing. It was like a fucked up remix of the night before Christmas because it was the night before Christmas.

19 (52m 31s):
Is this story gonna be in rhyme? Not

18 (52m 32s):
Shut up,

19 (52m 34s):
David, what happens?

18 (52m 35s):
You know how she gets around the holidays? I, I thought that you and Ethan were gonna bring her out to California.

19 (52m 40s):
Oh man. I don't know why we didn't. I think it was Ethan's schedule or we probably just didn't try hard

18 (52m 46s):
Enough. Nah, nah. I mean, you never know when she's gonna get all twisted like that. And I wasn't even really around anyway,

19 (52m 53s):
Where were you?

18 (52m 54s):
I was with this girl from school and this girl Tasha, I went over to her house early on Christmas Eve. Cuz they were having Turkey dinner and everything. You know like a normal family. I mean I had to get outta century village. I was cooped up in there with mom and she was driving me crazy. So anyway, I'm at Tasha's and mom calls and she sounds all drunk. Right? And she's like, something happened to the car.

19 (53m 14s):
Something what kind of something?

18 (53m 16s):
I don't know. That's what I said.

19 (53m 18s):
That's like something you would tell me.

18 (53m 20s):
I know. And now I know how you feel. Well, whatever happened, the car got stuck. Right. I, and I didn't have any way to get to her.

19 (53m 29s):
So how did she get home?

18 (53m 31s):
I think Peggy picked her up. By the time I got back to the condo the next day she was, she's pretty deep in it, but I, it didn't seem like that big of a deal really. And then, and then she woke up and she was short of breath. So I was like, wait, wait

19 (53m 46s):
For how long

18 (53m 47s):
Tuesday. So for like a day

19 (53m 50s):
And you didn't call me sooner,

18 (53m 52s):
Dude, she's done this shit like a million times. She wasn't even that worried about it. And she didn't want me to ride an ambulance with her. She was like, I'll see you later tonight, Dave.

20 (54m 0s):
Hi. I'm Dr. Schneider. I are you, are you the older brother? Yes. You have a medical power of attorney? Yes. Good. And who's Ethan,

19 (54m 13s):
Our other brother. He's also coming

20 (54m 14s):
From California. He's a medical power of attorney. Yes. Not him.

19 (54m 20s):
No.

20 (54m 21s):
Okay. Oh. Did your mother go to Cornell? Yes. Why? She told us

19 (54m 30s):
What else did she say

20 (54m 31s):
That she does not consume alcohol?

17 (54m 36s):
Those were her last words before going under soon enough withdrawal told a very different story. The first time this happened was five years ago when David called and told me he had to remit himself to the local Sheriff's office for quote, just a quick jail sentence. Oh. And mom's in the hospital. So I flew to Florida that next day and went straight to the ICU. And here's what happened that time?

21 (55m 3s):
Well, it looks like she'll never be the same again.

19 (55m 7s):
What are, are you the neurologist?

21 (55m 9s):
Oh, I see. We have a savvy medical consumer here. No, it's 2:00 AM. I'm just a guy on rotation. So she scored low on the goat test. Which measures brain function. She got a 62 probably permanently impaired

19 (55m 24s):
62 out of what?

21 (55m 28s):
Out of a hundred.

22 (55m 29s):
Although no one ever really scores a hundred. Oh, that's true.

23 (55m 32s):
I took it myself for practice in nursing school.

21 (55m 34s):
I got like an 80.

22 (55m 35s):
Yeah. For perfect score. You'd have to be like Superman or something.

21 (55m 38s):
No, no, no. You know who could get a hundred? What's that guy? You know that guy who can do anything including karate,

22 (55m 47s):
Leonardo DaVinci.

21 (55m 50s):
No, no, no. He's dead. He would score poorly. He's just no, the, the speaker guy who can do anything. Jesus Christ. If I was him and never forget anyone's name, he helps you realize your full potential. He's six and a half feet tall. Come on ladies. He's

19 (56m 12s):
Tony Robbins.

21 (56m 13s):
Yes, exactly. That guy, that guy, he could score a hundred.

17 (56m 24s):
So as the medical professionals discussed how awakening the giant within can totally boost her neurological scores. One of the other nurses came and told me that earlier they'd had to restrain my mom because even though she was unconscious, she'd somehow managed to get a hold of cigarettes. They caught her trying to light one in bed. We're not even sure where she got it. The nurse said, and that's when I knew my mother would be fine. Within days she was sitting up completely lucid chatting up strangers. Everyone's favorite. This time things were bad enough that I called my brother, Ethan.

17 (57m 4s):
He can only come in a true emergency because he plays for the LA Phil harmonic. And he has a couple kids and his schedule's planned out months in advance. He took the red eye straight from playing at Disney hall.

24 (57m 17s):
Well, here we are again, you doing man,

19 (57m 20s):
So glad you're here. Thanks for coming. Hey

24 (57m 22s):
Buddy. Good to see you holding up. Yeah. I'm

19 (57m 25s):
Nice tucks.

24 (57m 26s):
Yeah, but my stage attire might help me look a little more official. She in there. Yeah.

17 (57m 32s):
Right now Ethan is working on a giant Moler retrospective. They're gonna play all nine symphonies. It's something that's never been done before.

19 (57m 41s):
Oh Ethan. This is Dr. Snyder.

20 (57m 44s):
Hi. Nice to meet you. Your mother had a heart attack. She has severe respiratory distress, nearly septic infection. If we can get her breathing on her own again, recovery's possible, but would take a long time.

24 (57m 59s):
And then what?

20 (58m 2s):
That's a good question.

19 (58m 7s):
No, that is a good question. If she needs in-home care. I don't think David can do it. They can't keep the cable on. And if she doesn't make it, what then

24 (58m 17s):
Where's he gonna live? Right?

19 (58m 19s):
He can't stay at century village. I mean, it's a retirement community with the perimeter. It's like, it's like a geriatric army base.

2 (58m 29s):
You

19 (58m 29s):
Know? I don't know how he hasn't gotten kicked out already. They're definitely onto him. And if they realize mom isn't coming back,

24 (58m 35s):
I'm sure we're gonna get calls any day now.

19 (58m 41s):
Which one are you working on?

24 (58m 43s):
Oh, the eighth.

19 (58m 45s):
Well, that's a, that's a, a big one,

24 (58m 47s):
Right? It's a big one. Has some really nice passages though.

18 (58m 51s):
Mom, I know you can hear me.

2 (58m 56s):
We,

18 (58m 57s):
We love you and we need you.

19 (59m 1s):
What's it about

24 (59m 4s):
Eternal life.

17 (59m 16s):
It's David who says that mom would be happy that all three of her boys were together and that's true. One of the few real senses of family, I can recall the summers in the Midwest with her when we were all children years ago and we made ice cream and caught fireflies and roller skated, normal things like that. That's why David doesn't like being in the room much now because he doesn't wanna remember mom like this trapped in so many tubes. It's like some jacked up Darth Vader shit. He says. And yet he's the one who's been in her bedside the most. I can't bring myself to kiss her the way David does. I dunno why.

17 (59m 59s):
After Ethan goes back to California, I stay with David and mom. Time is merciless in Florida and especially merciless in the ICU days, turn into weeks. And every afternoon I pick up David, we go to the hospital, talk to some doctors, wait, talk to some more doctors and then maybe get dinner. Very little changes.

18 (1h 0m 23s):
Yo, y'all still wanna show you that video that I was telling you about. Oh yeah. Right. Okay. Okay. Hold up, hold up

17 (1h 0m 29s):
In this very strange video. David's friend, Sebastian, a completely grown man is standing on some Florida crabgrass break, dancing robot style. And the music is a tinny Cassio sounding version of fur lease.

19 (1h 0m 51s):
You. He's pretty good.

18 (1h 0m 52s):
I know,

19 (1h 0m 54s):
But why is this happening?

18 (1h 0m 57s):
I don't even really know. I mean, we're all just hanging out there in a driveway. Like a bunch of us dude just starts doing a robot. He does that sometimes. Right. And it one time he was doing it my face for a really long time for like a half hour. No, no, I couldn't even believe it, man.

19 (1h 1m 15s):
That he could keep it up that long.

18 (1h 1m 16s):
No, I'm more that I had to watch it for so long. Cause I was like, I was like kind of trapped there. Right. And at first I was trying not to look and then I couldn't look away.

19 (1h 1m 27s):
Let me see

18 (1h 1m 28s):
That again. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. It was like, I was in denial at first and then I accepted it

19 (1h 1m 35s):
Like the stages of grief.

18 (1h 1m 36s):
Exactly. Exactly. And then I reached some kind of state of bliss where it was so awesome. That was almost in tears.

19 (1h 1m 45s):
Yeah. I'm not sure it's exactly the Kula Ross model,

18 (1h 1m 48s):
But well, they should add that one. The awesome state.

17 (1h 1m 53s):
It's nice spending time with David, but I'm also really worried about him. He's had a history with pills on and off over the years and I suspect it's on again one night while we're driving to dinner, David says, oh, Hey Josh, can we stop over at the victory? That's a gas station down on Okeechobee Boulevard. And victory's a total misnomer for the kind of place where you pull in and just see a bunch of weird dudes crouching around the entrance. Like it's a totally normal social spot. And David knows everyone here, which is weird. And I'm pretty sure something Elit is happening, but I don't want to ask cuz I don't wanna be the man with David. And he probably wouldn't tell me anyhow, it's nothing David says, sure, just your regular nighttime.

17 (1h 2m 36s):
Renez in the parking lot of an off brand gas station. David gets back in the car and he says, all right, I'm good, but I'm not so sure it's weird. But mom and David are team. They've been like a fucked up crazy team for a long time, but a team nonetheless, and they've taken care of each other. And the question on my mind is if mom doesn't make it, whether David will,

20 (1h 2m 59s):
All right guys, she might destabilize immediately. But if she makes it, we'll load her up, get over to the hospice facility right away.

18 (1h 3m 5s):
Yeah. I I'm just, I'm a little concerned that, that she understands you. I mean, I think that she can hear you.

20 (1h 3m 10s):
Oh I, I know this can be hard for you and adjustment to end of life care.

18 (1h 3m 14s):
I mean she's right there.

20 (1h 3m 17s):
Right. Do you have any other questions?

18 (1h 3m 19s):
Well, yeah, I was wondering. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I was wondering about Xanax.

20 (1h 3m 28s):
She's everybody getting out of Ann, which is also for anxiety. It's part of the hospice program. I,

18 (1h 3m 33s):
For me, look, I'm not talking like a whole prescription or anything. I'm just asking if you can hook me up with like a couple, you know, for right now,

20 (1h 3m 43s):
I'm sorry. I can't accommodate that request.

18 (1h 3m 51s):
I'm gonna go outside and smoke. This shit is getting a little too real for me right now.

17 (1h 3m 58s):
The hospice is nice institutional, but warm. Like people are allowed to bring pets and stuff. One lady even brought her horse. The intake guy was very excited to tell us. I spent some time going through mom's things. I find her address book, which is a mess stuffed with post-its and scraps. Bearing faded numbers in mom's perfect cursive.

19 (1h 4m 19s):
Okay. How I, how can we call her friends? I don't know. Who's who, I mean, no one visited her in the hospital. We should have called people sooner.

18 (1h 4m 29s):
She didn't really have that many friends around anymore. And I'm telling you she didn't want visitors at the hospital.

19 (1h 4m 34s):
Well, yes, but they might wanna see her.

18 (1h 4m 36s):
Well, I don't have her friends' numbers, David,

19 (1h 4m 39s):
Cuz I need you to help me figure this out.

18 (1h 4m 42s):
I gotta take care of some shit right now. Where

19 (1h 4m 44s):
Are, where are you going, dude? You've been wandering in and outta here for weeks. Is it pills

18 (1h 4m 50s):
Or what? Nah, nah. It's it's Sebastian. Right? He's got this other friend who called him so

19 (1h 4m 55s):
That can wait. What is with all the weird petty dramas half the time you're pacing around on your phone, dealing with some crisis like Jimmy Carter at camp David.

18 (1h 5m 8s):
Well, I got Peggy's number.

19 (1h 5m 10s):
Why don't you tell me that

18 (1h 5m 11s):
Before you didn't ask

19 (1h 5m 12s):
Dude, this is when you call people. When your mother, mother is dying, you call her fucking friends. Yo,

18 (1h 5m 20s):
She can hear you. And I know that you wouldn't be all mad at me right now because you're mad at yourself or something. But this whole situation is fucked up. I accepted it a long time ago. I

19 (1h 5m 31s):
Accepted it's fucked up. I've been here

18 (1h 5m 33s):
For six weeks and I appreciate everything that you have done. But I've been here the whole time when mom fell and knocked herself out or when I found her in the backyard or when I took her to get the lasts of her teeth removed, I wish it was different, but this is what it is. Mom is my best friend and you you're gonna get to go home and I'm gonna be the one who stranded here. Now I have to go. Sebastian locked himself in his garage somehow and you should call Peggy, but do that shit outside.

17 (1h 6m 20s):
I finally bring myself to start holding mom's hand and she rubs my Palm. I think David's right. She knows each time her grip gets a little stronger. I look in her terrified eyes and see my own one night just before I leave for the day, she takes my hand with both of hers. It's the biggest show of purpose in weeks. And for a second, I don't see the tubes, the room, the cracked lips or her papery fingers. No one else is here. It's just us. The next morning, there was a message on my phone from the hospice before I got up, I know they always say it was peaceful and they'd made arrangements with the king David cemetery for the next day.

18 (1h 7m 10s):
Yeah, my stomach hurts. I can't tell if it's his funeral stuff or from that bacon, egg and cheese biscuit I this morning.

2 (1h 7m 20s):
Hmm. I mean, I'm gonna guess it's the former.

18 (1h 7m 24s):
I don't know that shit was pretty gross. You wanna hear something funny? So I was at home earlier today, right? Watching TV, just, just trying to take my mind off of things, you know? And then all of a sudden TV goes black and I'm like, oh shit, this is all I need right now. So I find this cable bill from before mom went in the hospital. It was like 15 bucks, but she forgot to pay it as usual. And the whole thing was like such a mom type scenario. You know? I mean, it's just exactly the type of thing that she would've done. So when the TV went black, I, I kind of thought it was like mom saying a little, hello.

18 (1h 8m 12s):
I'll be okay.

2 (1h 8m 14s):
I hope so.

25 (1h 8m 16s):
All right, let's get rolling.

17 (1h 8m 20s):
The sun is low on the horizon beneath the clouds, bring up steam from the grass. If you include the funeral director and the two Haitian dudes lounging on tombstones, waiting to fill in the grave. There are only nine people listening. The scene feels like a frontier funeral, a clutch of poor soul standing around a pine box. Like we should leave here in a covered wagon and keep heading west and just be glad the devil's drink. Didn't bury us too.

1 (1h 9m 1s):
Joshua Beman in the scenes. Josh Hamilton played him. James Ranon played his brother. David Matt marks was Ethan played the French horn. Our doctors were Bish Patel and Seth Barish who also played the rabbi. Nurses were Carolyn be Warren and Kia young Terry Kenny directed the story on stage. I'm really sorry. I'd have to tell you this. But in the years, since we first broadcast this story in 2014, Josh's brother, David died of an overdose. And then incredibly Matt marks who played him in our story also has died since we first broadcast this show. Okay. Back to our original broadcast. So we'd been planning for months that Steven Merritt was gonna sing a song at this point in the show.

1 (1h 9m 42s):
And we told Josh Beman a couple weeks ago. And he was like, oh my God, that's crazy. My mom, his mom in the story used to babysit for Steven Merrit. When, when Steven it's true. When Steven was a kid growing up outside Boston, Josh Berman's mom, Susan babysat for her. So please welcome Steven Merrit.

25 (1h 10m 28s):
Oh, do you slow this thing? How do you make this thing? Slow down. We try to break by saying with missed mistake, problem, unsolved. We said don't make me get involved.

25 (1h 11m 14s):
Do you slow this down? Oh, do you make this slow? We tried to slow air down by no, no Barbara's fault things.

25 (1h 12m 13s):
Slow tried. It's oh, do you make this

1 (1h 13m 18s):
Merritt with pinky Whitesman of violin and Sam Deval and Chao act four bus stop. This next story is something the comedians Sahi made has been telling on stage in her standup act. And we asked her to adapt it into a full on radio drama with actors and a sound man, like a classic radio drama. In fact, we have two sound men doing sound effects with a table full of props. Please welcome SA

26 (1h 14m 7s):
A few years ago, I got into an accident on a shuttle bus, my friend, Nicole and I rented a car and we were dropping it off at LaGuardia airport. We got onto the rental car company, shuttle bus to get taken to the cab, stand to get a cab to go home. And we were the only two passengers on the bus.

16 (1h 14m 24s):
Hey you too sure. You wanna sit back there because I drive pretty crazy.

26 (1h 14m 33s):
Okay. We heard him say this, but we didn't believe him. We should have believed him cuz that's exactly what he did. He sped outta the parking lot and towards the airport and Nicole and I were in the back, humoring him and playing up the wild ride. Woo. This is crazy. And then he hits the brakes really hard. Whoa, too crazy. And then we hit another car in the intersection.

2 (1h 15m 13s):
Wait you crazy. There's

26 (1h 15m 16s):
No seat belts on the bus. When Nicole goes falling into the luggage, carry in front of her, I'd go flying into the air and headed towards the driver's seat. Now, if I was walking this distance, it would probably take me like 10 seconds. But because I'm flying through the air, it takes me like two. And I think now I understand why flying is the fastest way to travel.

2 (1h 15m 39s):
Ow.

26 (1h 15m 42s):
I'm lying on the floor and my head is pounding and I just think, wow, that was the most realistic example of foreshadowing I've ever seen. Two seconds ago. This guy says I drive crazy and then he did. And then we got into an accident. I don't know why I thought anything different would happen.

2 (1h 16m 16s):
Hey you

26 (1h 16m 16s):
Okay? No. Everything sucks. I wanna go home. No, you can't go home. You hit your head. I know, but it's fine. No, it's not fine. We have to go to the hospital. Your face is like twice the size. It should be. We get off the bus and the cops are already there. I see the car that we hit and it's a tiny red car and we T-boned it. Except the T is very disproportionate where the top part of it's very tiny and the bottom. Part's a huge bus.

16 (1h 16m 44s):
Did you ladies see what happened?

26 (1h 16m 45s):
No. We were sitting at the back of the bus and we couldn't actually see the traffic.

16 (1h 16m 50s):
Okay.

26 (1h 16m 52s):
But the bus driver did it,

16 (1h 16m 55s):
But you just said you didn't see anything.

26 (1h 16m 56s):
Yeah, but he said,

2 (1h 16m 57s):
I drive crazy

26 (1h 17m 1s):
Before the accident. And then he did drive crazy a concept that was still blowing our minds.

16 (1h 17m 8s):
But you didn't see

26 (1h 17m 9s):
The accident? No we didn't. But how could have been the other guy's fault? We were on the bus that hit him. Also. Can someone take my friend to the hospital? She hit her head real hard. Nicole was amazing in high stress situations. Like the time when I told her I was pregnant. Yeah. So we didn't use a condom and I haven't had my period in a while. It's okay. This is fine. Okay. I support whatever you want. I don't know what I'm supposed to tell my family. Oh, listen. I will go with you to the clinic or if you don't want me to whatever you want it

2 (1h 17m 43s):
Just,

26 (1h 17m 44s):
I can't have a kid right now. I don't. I know. Come here. It's gonna be okay. I love you. Okay. Okay. I love you all. Okay. Okay. I, I really appreciate this and April fool, what the fuck? What the fuck is wrong with you? See she's a great friend and the perfect person to have for the stupid bus accident. We get onto an ambulance and head towards the hospital and the driver of the other car is already there.

26 (1h 18m 29s):
And he's much chatter than most would be after getting into a serious accident like this.

27 (1h 18m 37s):
So you guys were on that bus?

26 (1h 18m 40s):
Oh yes we were.

27 (1h 18m 43s):
It was, it was a rental company bus. Did you rent a car?

26 (1h 18m 47s):
Yeah, we rented a car to go to Boston.

27 (1h 18m 49s):
Oh cool. What was going on in Boston?

26 (1h 18m 55s):
We were there for a festival.

27 (1h 18m 59s):
What kind? A festival?

26 (1h 19m 1s):
A comedy festival.

27 (1h 19m 3s):
Wow. So you're a comedian.

26 (1h 19m 7s):
Yes.

27 (1h 19m 8s):
Does that mean you're a comedian too?

26 (1h 19m 10s):
Don't talk to me. I don't know why. I just didn't do that. Telling a person who's not a comedian that your comedian is never good. Cuz the conversation that follows is always terrible.

27 (1h 19m 26s):
So you were up in Boston. Did you make any jokes about baked beans? They love those up there?

26 (1h 19m 32s):
No, I didn't make any jokes about baked beans.

27 (1h 19m 35s):
Listen, next time you're in Boston. You Saypac the car it'll kill. It will kill. You can have that one that one's yours. You can have that for free.

26 (1h 19m 43s):
Okay. Thank you. Thank you so much. I'm gonna stop talking now cuz my head really hurts.

27 (1h 19m 49s):
I get it.

26 (1h 19m 50s):
It's not a joke.

27 (1h 19m 51s):
I get it.

26 (1h 19m 54s):
I don't wanna say the name of the hospital that we went to because someone here in the audience may actually work there, but we went to Elmhurst hospital and it was the dirtiest hospital I've ever been to in my life. There were Toblerone wrappers on stretcher beds and loose muffins on the floor. Just like unwrapped, unexplained, whole muffins.

26 (1h 20m 35s):
I'm left with Nicole in the waiting room and we're waiting and waiting. Nicole's actually really scared of what would happen to me if I fell asleep. So she makes it her job to make sure I stay awake. Hmm. So she, yeah. So she, so yeah, you see that doctor over there. Would you fuck him? You said he is a doctor, right? Yeah. So probably. Yeah. So she, yeah. So, so she, yeah, so she, so, so, so, so, so are you hungry? Always. You want a muffin? Always go get that muffin. Muffin.

26 (1h 21m 15s):
Get that muffin. That muffin muffin, muffin. Muffin's that's a dirty muffin. What's I must do. Oh no, maybe eat that candy off the chair. Okay. There's nothing in here. Oh no. The hot doctor must have eaten at all. He loves chocolate. Oh, does that mean he'll love me. You're a big old chocolate woman. So yes, But you gotta stay awake. Doctors hate sleepy bitches. Yeah.

26 (1h 22m 1s):
I don't wanna be a sleepy bitch because you know what they say about sleepy bitches? What? They too tired. Five hours pass and I still haven't gotten seen, excuse me. Do you know how much longer before I get seen? What

22 (1h 22m 21s):
Do you need to be seen for?

26 (1h 22m 23s):
I was just in a car accident. I need someone to check my head. Oh,

22 (1h 22m 28s):
I didn't know you were in a car accident. We thought you were waiting on somebody. You look fine,

26 (1h 22m 33s):
But I hurt. Eventually. I get moved to the cat scan area and the guy running the scan looks like he's 12 years old and he's like not putting me at ease. Okay. So what happened to you? I was just in a car accident. Oh, I couldn't tell you look fine. It's what I hear.

28 (1h 23m 1s):
Whoa, cool. Gold shoes did just spray paint

26 (1h 23m 5s):
Those yourself. I did. That's so cool. I get this one pair of sneakers with this design. Can you just, me please. He finally scans me and then I wait a while for the results.

2 (1h 23m 26s):
You're fine.

26 (1h 23m 30s):
Every person involved with this accident was awful except for Nicole. She was the best part of this whole thing. So lane is, and gentlemen, I'd like to present to you the last best person in New York state, Nicole Byer,

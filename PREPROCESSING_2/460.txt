welcome to the you were men nation science science pace toe i man your supermen and om a professor of neurobiology and theology at stamford school of medicine to day we are talking all about food and the brain we are going to talk about foods that are good for your brain in terms of focus in terms of brain health generally end the longevity of your brain your ability to maintain cognition and clear thinking over time we are also going to talk about why and how you prefer certain foods to others and ism going to talk about the three major signals that combine to drive your food choices i give you a little hint of what those are one of those signals comes from your gut and is completely subconscious this is not the gut microfilm person these are nursed in your gut that are sending signals to your brain that you are unaware of about the nutrient contents of the foods that you are eating the second signal is how metabolically accessible a given food is meaning how readily that food can be converted into energy that your brain not your body but that your brain can use and the third signal is perhaps the most interesting one it is the signal of belief it is the signal of what you perceive and believe the food that your eating to contain and what you think it can do for you healthwise and energy wise and that might sound a little wish wash your vague but we are going to provide mechanistic data to support the fact that you can change what you eat much that you can drive your brain and your body to crave foods that are good for you er at least better for you than the foods you might currently be eating this is an incredibly powerful mechanism that we all have it is one that i think is very underappreciated and to day ism going to review the data from both animal models and fortunately more recently human studies that really do underscore the fact that you can control your desire for particular foods before we dive into to day's topic and just want briefly touch on some key take always from a previous episode which is the episode on time restricted feeding also called intermittent fasting the key elements of time restricted feeding that will benefit your health the most in terms of wait loss or maintenance fat loss organ health quality sleep and cognition are that the feeding window begin at least one hour after waking you could push that feeding window out to begin later but at least one hour after waking and that it end at least too an ideally three hours before going to sleep some people can end that feeding window much further away from the beginning of sleep meaning their finishing their last bite a food for instance at six p m and they are not going to sleep until midnight but many people struggle to get quality sleep if that feeding window is set two early relative to when they go to sleep begin the feeding window at least one hour after waking and the feeding window at least two hours before going to sleep and a we feature based on the scientific research is that the feeding window itself fall more or less at the same period of each twenty four hour day from day to day meaning if you are going to eat over an eight hour period that is your feeding window you would not want to start that feeding window at ten a m one day and ended at six p m and then the next day start at noon and ended at eight p m an the next day started at two p m and ended at ten p m and forth as much as is reasonably possible if you want to extract the maximum benefit from time restricted feeding the idea is to keep that feeding window at more or less the same phase as it is called of each twenty four hour day if it slides around a little bit for social reasons or whatever reasons does not seem to be a big deal but you do not want it sliding around by many hours from day to day because of the way that that feeding window impacts other genes called clock genes that regulate a bunch of other processes in the body before we begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero nostoc consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens athletic greens is an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens on the reason i still take athletigreens once or twice a day is that it helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which are vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called up microfilm and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens i get the vitamins i need the minerals i need and the phobics to support my microfilm if you to truth lentic greens you can go to athletic greenstone come slash supermen and claim a special offer they will gie you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitemend three k too there are ton of date and ow showing that vitamin three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if wore getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient in vitamin d three and k two is also important because it regulates things cardiovascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic green stucco slash supermen to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs and the year supply of vitamin three k to today's episode is also brought to us by element elements s an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar talk many times before on this podcast about the key roll of hydration and electrolytes for nerve sell function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues an organ systems of the body if we have soda magnesium in potassium present in the preparations all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and dehydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise your mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the preparations of electrolytes if you to try element you can go to drink element that is elements dock cold slash supermen and you'll get a free element sample pack with your purchase there all delicious again if you want to try element you can go to element elements dot calm slash auberge some of the most frequent questions i get are about food and the brain everybody seems to want to know what they should eat and what they should not eat in order to have pig brain function to be able to focus and memorized things and forth and in order to maintain brain health over time because nobody wants to lose their memory or have troubles with cognition fortunately there are a lot of data now from really good quality pure reviewed studies that indicate certain things that we can do including certain foods that we should eat and perhaps even some foods that we should avoid in order to enhance a brain function and of course when i say brain what i really mean is nervous system function because how we are able to move and remember things et camera does not just depend on the neurons the nerve cells that are in our head it also depends on are spinal chord and the neurons that connects all the organs of our body in general there are two categories of things that are going to improve brain health from the perspective of nutrition the first category is the general category of things that we eat and avoid and things that we do and avoid doing that will modulate brain health and function what do i mean by modulate well getting quality sleep on a regular basis making sure that your socially connected making sure that you are not depressed all these things are vitally important to our overall health and of course they will impact brain function but they do it more o less indirectly there are few things that happen in sleep which directly benefit brain function and repair et camera but to day i really want to concentrate not on the things that modulate are over all health but rather the things that mediate brain health directly and in particular how certain foods enhance brayed function and we are going to talk about how we can change our relationship to food literally how we can start to per fir certain foods that are better for us than others just briefly i want a touch on the modulatory components because they are vital first of all getting quality sleep on a regular basis and ample sleep on a regular basis is the foundation of all mental health and physical health there is no question about that we have done several episodes including the mastery your sleep episode which is episode two of the hubrmon labpodcast and we have done a lot of other episodes that are all about sleep and how to get better at sleeping i just want it make crystal clear that unless your sleeping well on a regular basis your brain will suffer you will not be able to focus very well learn very well and indeed there are data linking poor quality sleep to dementia or at least exacerbating preexisting dimension and things of that sort get your sleep in order the other of course is cardiovascular health and exercise the general prescription that out there in the literature and i think it is well supported is to get somewhere between a hundred and fifty and a hundred eighty minutes of cartyovasclar exercise per week if you choose to also use resistance exercise that is crate but the hundred and fifty to a under ad eighty minute minimum per week of cardiovascular exercise is crucial for heart health and heart health directly relates to brain health because the brain consumes a lot of oxygen glucose and other factors that are delivered via the blood if your arteries are dragged up and you have got poor vascular supply to the brain in any region of the brain your brain will suffer get party vascular health in order now with those two modulatory elements set forth that we are all aware that there there and they are vitally important now i to turn to the elements that have been shown to be vitally important for directly controlling for mediating neuron function neurons of course are nerve cells in the brain and there are other retypes to of course that will impact brain function the most prominent of which are the called glad plea means glue but even though for a long time people thought that these cells were just kind of holding things together passively the glue up play a very active roll in the metabolism neurons in brain function and probably also recognition in thinking and forth what are the things that directly impact brain health and what are the foods that we can eat that will support brain health generally when we think about neuron function and brain function we default to a discussion about fuel the fact that neurons use glucose which is blood sugar in or and that they require a lot of it in some cases they will use ketones which we will talk about a limit later specializing people that are following a low carbohydrate or quitogenic diet but before we can even consider the fuels that neurons use in order to function we have to talk about the elements that actually allow those neurons to be there and to stay healthy what actually makes up those irons and that brings us to what i would a argue is the most important food element for brain function and that is fat and that may come as a surprise but unless one considers the water content of the brain which is very high a lot of our brain and a lot of the integrity of the nerve cells the called neurons in our brain and the other types of cells comes from fat and that is because nerve cells and other cells in the brain have a external layer its what sometimes called a double layered membrane it the sentiarly two thin layers that serve as a boundary between them cells and that boundary is very important because how things pass across that boundary actually regulates the electrical activity of neurons which is the way that neurons fire and communicate and keep you thinking and acting and doing all the good things to those neurons allow us to do and those membranes are made up of fats but they are not made up of the fats that are around our belly round the other organs of our body they are not made up of storage fat they are made up of structural fat and maintaining the called integrity of that structural fat meaning the health of those neurons is going to come in large part from the foods that we eat now this needs to be under scored what i am saying is that the foods that we eat actually provide the structural basis the building blocks of the very neurons that allow us to think over time and as i mentioned earlier the fat that makes up those neurons and other nerve cells is different than the other types of fat in the body what type of fat is it and what shall we eat in order to support that fat and those neurons and the answer is the called essential fatiacids and fossil limits now those are more or less the same thing but i just want to make a very large literature very crystal clear essential fatiacids can include the called e p a variety or d a oh variety you hereabout megatheres and omegasixes most people are getting enough omegasixes from their diet not everybody but most people are getting enough o megapixel however most people are not getting enough omgathrees in their diet to support healthy brain function in the short and long term have talked before about the benefits of elevating the levels of megatheres in one stint for sake of offsetting depression and for enhancing mood and indeed there's a wealth of literature now pointing to the fact that ingesting at least one or two or even three grams per day of e p a form of essential fatiacid can have effects plosive effects on mood and well being that are at least on par with some of the major antidepressant treatments out there but without similar side effects to those antidepressant treatments and that for people that are already taking into depresses that supplementing with one to two to three grams of e p a essential fatiacids can actually allow a lower dose of antidepressant treatment to be used and still be effective that depression but just in terms of maintaining normal connive function in people that a aren't depressed the e p s and megatheres seem to play a very important roll of course you can supplement e p s through various fish oils and a cab liquid fish oil or causal fish oil some people if there a not interested in eating fish for whatever reason their allergic or for ethical reasons they can take chill oil if they do not want to use chill oil they can use ally in other forms of e p however i think it is clear that one can get a lot of e p from the proper foods and it turns out that those foods not surprisingly do not just contain high levels of e p but they also contain other things that are beneficial for brain health what are foods that are high in megatheres that we should all probably be consuming at least on a daily basis the number one is fish things mackerel and salmon and harming in oysters and sardines and anchovies and perhaps the heavyweight champion of e p s per unit volume is caviar now i soft know about you but ism not eating a lot of fish ism not eating a lot of caviar i do not think i can remember the last time i had a caviar unless it was sprinkled on a obit of such ism not a big a fish eater personally i will from time to time but that is one reason why one might want to supplement with e p s from another source but also e p s are found in chiaseeds in walnuts in soy beings and other plant base foods you can look these up on line and you will immediately see that therefore lot of sources of e p s and many of the foods that i listed off might be appetizing to you some of them might be unappetizing to you or some of them you might be sort of neutral about but it is very clear that eating foods that are rich in megatheres and or supplementing with megatheres to get above that one point five grams and ideally up to two or even three grams per day of e p can be very beneficial for connive function in the short and long term later in the episode ism going to talk about how to actually change your relationship to particular food that foods that you do not particularly you can actually start to more and that might be important for those of you that are thinking material sardines in thisabat i making the space cause frankly those are not foods that i naturally but again i want to emphasize that you do not have to consume fish and animal products in order to get sufficient e p es you can get them from plants but i do believe based on the quality pe reviewed research that everybody should be striving to get a minimum threshold of at least a gram and a half of e p s per day one way or the other the great thing about megatheres is that they are also thought to be beneficial for things party of vascular health and although there some controversy there as to weather or not two grams are three grams or six grams as ideal for party vascular health i think the bulk of evidence points to the fact the getting sufficient megatheres in the diet is going to support party of vascular health certainly not the only thing people should be doing to support their party of vascular health a robin exercise and forth being important also but it does seem to support cover vascular health and in doing supporting brainhealth however what ism emphasizing is ingestion of omagathrees to support the very cells within the brain that make up our cognition that allow for cognition and for movement and memory and all the other marvelous things that the brain does the other compound that has been shown to be directly supportive of neuronal function is phosphotital shrine which is abundant in meats and in fish here we are again back to fish being an important source of brains supporting food phosphotital spring is something that nowadays people are supplementing it is a lipid compound that at least in three studies have been shown to improve cognition these were not huge effects but they worstatistically significant effects and as well in more than three at least at least five studies to reduce connive decline d this is interesting in every case it was three hundred milligrams supplemented phosphotital serin but one again does not need to supplement phosphotital serin phosphotital spring can be derived as i mention from meets in fish and to some extent from cabbage of all things i do not know how much cabbage people are ingesting but later when we talk about got health and the relationship between got health and brainhealth it'll mention fermented foods and of course one of the most a readily available fermented foods out there that at least many people find appetizing is sober trout which is of course made from cabbages for rented cabbage for those of you that do consume meat and fish provided your getting enough fish your probably getting enough phosphotital serin for those of you that are interesting supplementing phosphotital urine to get these effects that were reported in these various manuscripts which by the way have read and look solid i been i do not think we have seen the landmark studies showing that supplementing with phosphotital urine at three hundred milligrams pray is going to create a a huge offsetting of a massive connive decline or a massive increase in brain function these seem to be modest facts but the effects do appear to be real and i for those ofyouther are interesting supplementing phosphotital spring it is a relatively inexpensive supplement that again is lipid it is mimicking some of the same things that you would get from food but in higher concentration now after e pe fatiasids and phosphotital sari i would say third on the list of things that come from food that can readily support brain function would be coaling and that is because of the relationship to coalmine in the biosynthesis pathway for a sendal coaling a seal coaling is a neuromodulator not narrow transmitter but a neuromodulator in the brain a neuromodulator is a chemical that modulates the function of many brain circuits and also circuits within the body i mention what those are in a moment but a septal coaling as a neuromodulator tends to enhance the activity the electrical activity in chemical activity of certain sets of neurons and down play the activity of other neurons it sort of a conducted of sorts leading to enhanced function an activity in certain brain areas an circus and not in others for instance the brain areas that are involved in focus and alertness we have multiple clusters of neurons in our brain that make a redo coming two of the most prominent and well known of call nucleus basalts which is a cluster of neurons deep in the bazalfor brain that highlight particular areas of our brain highlight meaning a when used coming is released from those neurons at their nerve endings in particular areas the brain those particular arms of the brain can undergo enhanced levels of activity relative to surrounding area its can of a electrical highlight or pen if you will by analogy that is the basis of much of what we call focus are or our ability to concentrate on a particular batch of information that is coming in through our eyes our ears our nose or even things that were just thinking in our head having ample coaling for production of a seal coaling allows for focus through of course many intervening steps there are also regions of the brain in the called back of the brain the hind brain that release a sedocoaling that are involved in general states of alertness and not surprisingly then many of the treatments for claimers disease which is in a bi inability or challenges with remembering things and focusing or drugs that impact the used coaling pathway and are aimed at enhancing the amount of a sedocoling that is available to neurons and it can do that through number of different mechanisms you can do that by enhancing the amount of a sedocoaling that is created or you can do that by of taking a drug that can reduce the amount of enzyme that gobbles up the acetal coming and in doing leading to more net used coming but outside of the scenario where somebody has connive decline due to claimers all of us are able to focus to some degree or not or are able to be alert to some degree or not based on the amount of a redo coaling that we have now other processes of course are involved but what this means is that making sure that we have enough of the substrates to create a seal coaling is vital if we want to be able to focus and that is why dietary coaling is vital and the primary source for dietary coaling would be eggs and in particular egg yokes and this again has a very interesting relationship to our evolution as well we are always referred to hits hunter gathers om but when one hears hunters we often think about meat and animal sources and indeed as a species we hunted a many many a other species of animals to consume them and still do but we also fish we take about that earlier and consumed a lot of fish and we consumed a lot of eggs eggs are an incredibly rich source of neutreants for the brain and that is because the egg actually if you think about it contains all the nutrients that are required in order for an organism to grow it a bird that is in it in a eggshell it is got the yoke there an its using that oak yoke for reason its using that yoke as a source of fuel it is using that yoke as a source of literally building blocks in order to create its nervous system many years ago i worked on chick embryos and as these amazing experiments you could actually taken an egg and you could create a little window in the top and these were fertilized eggs and you would see over time you could peer in there literally look in with a microscope or even with the naked eye and you would see this little chick embryo sitting on top of that yoke growing and growing and growing and growing in the the yoke getting smaller and smaller s really a incredible they are using that is a source for all the building blocks of the body but in particular the nervous system eggs are a rich source of coaling some people will supplement with coaling however food sources seem to be the best source of coaling and as with the e pes and the megatheres there are plenty of foods that are non animal based that contain coaling if your somebody who does not eat eggs or does not want to et eggs things potatoes not and seeds and grains and fruit they do not have as much coaling as eggs but they do contain coaling you can look up the values of coaling that are o present in those various foods an make sure that you are reaching the threshold amount of coalmine for you in general most people should probably strive to get somewhere between five hundred milligrams and a gram of coalmine per days or thousand milligrams and some people rely on supplementation in order to hit those levels because they are not eating a lot of beg yokes are there not eating a lot of other foods on certain fish contain o coaling for instance and the other foods i listed off a few minutes ago from plantable sources some people of supplement with fifty to a hundred milligrams or whatever amount is necessary to get them up to that one grader even a two gram dose per day we have three things that we know can support nerve cells e pe in particular megathere fatiacids phosphothidal seeing and coaling those three things i would list off as the top three things for enhancing neuron function and the integrity of neurons in the short and long term and this is again is setting aside the vitally important factors of hydration and electrolytes have set it before another podcast but if you are not investing enough water and you are not getting enough sodium and magnesium and potassium than obviously your neurons cannot run because a lot of the brain is is water you need to maintain proper hydration and sodium potassium an magnesium are important in order for nervecells to function they are actually the a components the ions that pass across those lipid membranes those those little fatty membranes that were talk about earlier that allow the neurons to generate electrical activity in communicate with one another defiantly you want to hydrate enough will we will do an entire other episode all about hydration and electrolytes but megatheres the e p s phosphotital seeing and coaling it is obvious are g in to improve brain function how much they will prove bring function probably depends on how well your brain was working previously in fact many of the studies that have looked at the effectiveness of these compounds have looked in people that are suffering from mild or even severe cognac of decline and while the outcomes of those studies very give the interest in maintaining brain function given the fact that we do not make new anurans throughout are entire life and given that everybody has to eat these are quality healthy foods that we should all be investing any ways and it is clear that they can support brain function to some degree or another many people ask what i do in light of this information and while i can only talk about what works for me i choose to invest fish oil in mainly in liquid form because that turns out to be a the easiest way in the most a economically a affordable way to do it for most people a there are various forms have liquid fish oil out there some of them include some lemon flavoring it does not taste fish oil because frankly fish oil to me i sort of noxious dating and it'll take the table spoon of that or two per day a if ism traveling it'll use the capsid form in order to hit that threshold of for me about two sometimes even three grams per day of e p a not just two or three grams per day of fish oil but two or three grams per day of e p now if ism eating fish a which as i mention earlier is not often then i might reduce the amount of fish oil that i take but that is my major source of fish oil currently i do not supplement with phosphotital seeing a number of people that i know in trust and indeed several colleagues of mine a do take phoshotital spring i do not have any good explanation for what i do not take it yet a but i have not tried supplementing with it yet may be of some of you have you can a place your experience a in the comment section ut would be of interest and then in terms of coaling i in order to get coaling in my diet i do pay attention to the various foods that contain coming and i try and get those food on a semi regular basis i do supplement with something called alpha p c which is essentially in the see e coming pathway or by synthesis pathway i do not take it very often but i will take three hundred milligrams of alpha p c from time to time from time to time i mean anywhere from a two to three times per week it'll generally do it early in the day cause it for me can have a low bit of a stimulant effect although it is not nearly a stimulating say is a doubles resort triples press but that is one way in which i enhance my coming function and some people choose to get it from supplementation because it straightforward there are lot o supplements out there that contain alpha p c some people are taking dosages as high as nine hundred milligrams per day that sounds very high to me that the studies of offsetting cognac decline using alpha p c did use quite high a dosages of six hundred to nine hundred or even twelve hundred milligrams per day it has been used that those much higher concentrations but a because fortunately at least not yet or not to my awareness ism not suffering from any connive decline i will supplement with three hundred telegrams every now and again next me my list of compounds that have been shown in pure reviewed research to improve coronal an brain function is creatine creatine can be derived from meat sources it can also be supplemented some of you are probably familiar with cretin or heard about creatine from the context of the health and fitness world where eating is used to bring more water in to muscles which can enhance the strength of those muscles as well as bring water into other tissues ho don't just draw more water into muscle i can a more water into the body generally creatine has also ben shown to have an important role in brain function and once again this is something that came up during the discussion about depression a few episodes back creatine can action be used as a fuel source in the brain and it there is some evidence that it can enhance the function of certain a frontal cortical circuits that feed down on to or rather connect to carries o the brain that involved in mood regulation and motivation and that is where creatine place a roll in depression or rather where creating supplementation seems to be able to assist in some forms of mild depression that is an emerging literature still not well established however there is now ample evidence that creating supplementation can enhancsprain function in certain contacts and if you're interested in learning more about what those contacts are there is an excellent review that just came out the first author is a run hell are o s c h all we will provide a link to the study a rather this review scums me in a the caption a this was publish just very recently in a twenty twenty one and one thing to make clear is that creatine supplementation has been shown to be especially useful for people that are not consuming any meat or other sources of foods that are rich in creatine what is the threshold level of creatine to supplement in order to get the connive benefit pears to be at least five grahams per day not the most typical form of cretin as local creatine monohydrate there are other forms of creatine as well some of which are thought to not draw as much water into non muscle tissues and for some people that the attractive to them they do not want water sitting below their skin et camera i should emphasize that the responses to creatine in that sense can differ some people get a little bit of what water attention some people experience more i there some evidence that creatine can impact some of the hormonal pathways that it might enhance levels called dihydrotestostrone d h t and therefore because t h t is involved in hair lost there are these theories that creatine can cause hair loss and indeed for people that are very deed sensitive it might a there is going to be a lot of variation person to person terms of how much creatine impacts d h t and how many d h t receptors they have on their scalp and therefore whether not they experience hair lost ism just giving you all this information that your aware of the various things that creating can do but none the less i think it is interesting that creating supplementation of five grams per day that is creating monohydrate has been shown to improve cognition on people that are not getting cretin from animal sources and there some evidence detailed within the review that i just described that creatine supplementation can also enhance cognition in people that are also eating animal products i personally take creatine five grams per day and have for a very long time i cannot say that have a noticed a tremendous benefit because have actually never really come off it ah and have never done the control experiment i take it more as kind of a base line insurance policy for me a ism probably losing ism certainly losing some of my hair whether not that is due to creating or not a have never done a the analysis but a what i can say is that i generally consume these things e pes creatine alpha p c to set a general context of support for my neurons a for my brain and of course i also pa attention on the foods that contain these various compounds i do not actively eat additional meat just to obtain creatine a i eat a fairly limited amount of meat i do not restrict it but i and i do eat meat but a i do not actively seek out creating in my diet rather i use supplementation in in order to hit that fivegrams pray threshold next on the list of foods that are beneficial for brainhealth is one that you probalycine pictures of on line because there seems to be a practice of putting pictures of blueberries and other dark berries next to any title that says foods that benefit your brain there are a lot of foods out there that have been purported to improve brain function the interesting thing about blueberries and other berries blackberries dark currents any of these thin skin berries that are purplish in color is that they contain what are called anthosionins and the signals actually have some really nice data to support the fact that they improve brain function now whether or not it is direct effects on anurans or whether not is by lowering inflammation a we some other modulatory a fact is not quite clear but by now there's enough data to support the fact that eating a cup or two of blueberries pretty often every day or maybe you a blackberries or maybe its black currents that these anthosionyns are are good for us that they are enhancing our over all well being at a number of different levels and just to give you a couple examples of wear the are actually pure reviewed studies to support those statements the anthosionns of which blueberries and other dark berries are rich in a have been shown to reduce the amount of data damage has been shown to reduce significantly although a be it slightly souse me connive the cline a and that particular study was supplementation of a blue berry extract it'll talk about the difference butene extract an actual blueberries in moment but supplement to station of blueberry extract in offsetting cognitive decline in elderly people a what constitutes elderly is always a little bit of a of a debate in a discussion but in this case what they what they did is they supplemented with somewhere between four hundred and twenty eight i of know why they selected for hundred twenty eight and five hundred ninety eight milligrams of anthosionans daily for twelve weeks was associate with improvements on verbal learning a memory a and they had some other beneficial changes that were within the bodily organs a in blood blue coast a regulation forth positive changes but that is one study in this case a elderly meant sixty five or older a that study and a number of studies it looking at things mildly enhanced memory a reduced insolent levels a reduced oxidation of elder these sorts of things have basically create a situation where any time you huge or look up a food set in handbrake function you are going to see a picture of a blueberry er some other berry because of these anthosionans i personally do not supplement anthosionons a i do blueberries i eat blueberries when there in season a i love them am what you d call a drive by blueberry eater their blueberries in a in a bowl on a table and ism walking by i just have to scoop them up some sort of bear or other animal in pop hen my mouth blueberries do not last long around me one of the issues with berries blueberries and blackberries and forth is that quality sources of them can be pretty expensive and then of course when they are not in season they are hard to get and that is why some people will supplement with them that range of about four hundred to about six hundred milligrams pray seems to be on the minimum threshold ford getting a connive effect in these elderly a a patient i in that case they were patient a good review about the anthozoans potentially contributing to offsetting cognate decline in alceimers and also enhancing brain function in people that do not have alceimers is a review by official a far a l that was published in twenty nineteen we also provide a a link to that study in the caption when one looks across the total batch of studies that are out there on this it appears that if one is going to supplement with blueberry extract to get the anthelion an effect on cognition dosages of somewhere between five and a half for about eleven grams seem optimal with the her end closer to ten or eleven grams a being more beneficial the blueberry eaters out there me who prefer to get there anthosionans from the actualberries it appears that somewhere between sixty to hundred and twenty grams of fresh blueberries each day is the way that you can get a sufficient anthosionins to least shift your system or bias your brain towards these enhance connive effects we have got epic fadiacids we have got phosphodital serine we have got cosine we have got creatine and we have the anthosionyns and the last item that it'd to place in this list of food derived things that can enhance brain function is glutamine glutamine is a very interesting monoacid have talked about glutamine on here before there is some evidence although somewhat scant there is some evidence that glutamine can unhandsome munesystem function people will supplement with glutamine or people can get glutamine from foods foods that contain a lot of glutamine are things cottage cheese there are also other sources of glutamine glutamine is rich in proving rich foods things beef chicken fish dairy products eggs but also for you non o animal food o consuming people out there om vegetables including beings cabbage once again speech easily things of that sort those foods contain glutamine for people that supplement with glutamine generally they will take anywhere from a gram as much as ten grams per day why would they want to do that well there is also some evidence starting to emerge that glutamine can help offset sugar cravings and have talked about this on the podcast before were going to talk more about the basis for this a little but later but in brief we all have neurons in our got that sense the monoacid content the fat content and the sugar content of the foods that we and signal in a subconscious way to our brain whether not the foods that were we are eating contain certain levels of certainominoacids and we actually have glutamine sensing groans in a got that actually have their little processes their little on excellent and dendrites we call them in the mucosa lining of the got they are not just sense in glutamine but when they do sense glutamine they respond and they send signals to the brain that are signals of satiation of satisfaction and in doing can offset some of the sugar cravings that many people suffer from now here were talking about goldmine for sake of enhancing connive function and this is interesting because it is been shown that glutamine supplementation can offset some of the negative effects on cognition caused by altitude and oxygen deprivation of other sorts now can i that is kind of a strange such and unique situation of your in o going up to altitude should you supplement with glutamine in order to be able to think more clearly well it peers that there is good rational for doing that but the reason i bring this up assuming that most people in gludomie are not going up o to high altitudes very often is that it is been well established that apnea failure to breathe properly during sleep can contribute to age related and even nonage related connive decline there are lot of reasons for genius on ranging from ability to a obstruction of of the airways for other reasons a there tremendous number of underlying causes of ani an its something to be taken seriously a mi hard attacks all sorts of metabolic issues are caused by apnea apneas a serious issue that disrupts the depth of sleep and its a serious health issue in general in any event apnea is associated with connive decline and connive dysfunction even in young people and it does appear that glutamine supplementation can offset some of the connive deposits that are associate with reduced oxygenation of the brain if you would to learn more about how apnea can negatively impact cognition there is an excellent paper that was published on this in twenty eighteen the first author dharma s ah a r m a it should be easy to fine the title of the paper is obstructive sleep apnea severity effects meloid burden incognively normal elderly this was a longitudinal study meloid burden is a corselet of alshimers and other forms of of nourdegeneration and connive decline associate with memory deposits obstructive sleep at apnea excuse me as a very serious issue for which glutamine appears to be able to offset some of the negative symptemology how is it that glutamine either from food or or through supplementation can offset some of these called hypoxia effects caused by sleep apnea hypoxia being a lack of oxygen for the brain that relate to connive decline it appears to have this plosive impact by way of reducing inflammation an if you want a look more deeply into the various biological pathways and the supplementation regimes for this a the paper that i think is really spectacular is a paper last author a is quaresma u u a r e s m a that q u a r e s m a it is a review the possible importance of glutamine supplementation to loud and cognition in hypoxia from high altitude and even though papers about high altitude induced hypoxia it does seem to have direct relevant to the sorts of apnea that are related to alshimers and other forms of connive decline now have been taking glutamine as a supplement coach since i was in college mostly because i felt either by superstition or by reality that it protected me from a various a losing colds and things of that sort because of the reported a immuneinhancing effects again those immuninhancing effects have some data to support them natation however i got into the habit of taking glutamine and but now that have learned that glutamine seems to also have some connive enhancing effects possibly it is a supplement that i continue to take i take very small amounts of it but o my do i take on a regular basis that more or less completes the list of things that at least by my read of the literature or things hat are supported by at least three and in some cases as many as hundreds of studies in various populations that have bee explored in mouse studies often but also in a number of human studies i want to emphasize again that all of the things i listed out whether or not its peas whether or not its phoshithidal seeing whether r not its coaling whether or not a it is the various compounds that are in berries et camera all of those can be extracted from food there is not any law that says that you have to get them from supplementation supplementation can help you get to the very high levels of those things if you want a work on the higher end if that is right for you obviously check with your doctor before taking anything or removing anything from your diet or supplement regime but in general you can get these things from foods is just happens that for some of these a compounds the foods that their contained in fish are not foods that i particularly enjoy and i rely on excuse me i rely on supplements in order to get sufficient levels for me but again you can get these levels from food and the reason i made this list the reason that i emphasize these things in this particular order is that they support the structure of anurans they support the structure of the other cells of the brain that make up our cognition and that are important for our focus and are ability to remember things in forth and they are less in the category of called modulatory effects they will also have modulatory effects on sleep on inflammation or reducing inflammation throughout the body on party vascular function all of which i believe our positive effects at least what the literature tells us is that none of these compounds are harming other systems of the body provided they are takin at a reasonable levels but everything in this list is directed towards answering the question what can i eat what can i invest by way of food and or food supplement that can support brain function in the short term and in the long term i hope you find that list beneficial for you eve not for use at least for consideration now having talked about some of the foods and micreneutriants that are beneficial to our immediate and long term brain health i to shift gears somewhat and talk about why it is that we the foods that we we have all heard before that we are hard wired to pursue sugar and to fatty foods and that carry rich foods are attractive to us for all sorts of reasons yo as surviving famines and things of that sort and while that is true the actual mechanisms that underlie food seeking and food preference are far more interesting than that they re basically three channels in our body and nervous system by which we decide what foods to pursue how much to eat and whether or not we will find a particular food attractive whether not we will want to consume more of it whether or not we want to avoid it or whether r not it is just sort of what i refer to as the yum much or me analysis and indeed that is what our nervous system is doing with respect to food it is trying to figure out whether not yum i want more of this much i want to avoid this or me it is now while that may seem a overly simplified version of food seeking and food preference it is actually not that far from the truth it actually correctly captures much of the biology of food preference let us talk about what these three channels for food preference are the first one is an obvious one it is taste on the mouth it is the sensation that we have of the foods that we eat while we are chewing them and those sensations which are literally just somaticensory touch sensations the the a palatability of food as it relates to the consistency of food that is important and as you have all heard before we have censors on our tongue and elsewhere in our mouth that detect the various chemicals contained within food and lead to the senses of taste which we call bitter sweet mama salty inpour now most of us are familiar with the sense of bitterness that comes from something a raw radish sweet which comes obviously from sugars of different kinds for tosglucos et camera salty salty and sour think lemon or lemon juice for instance and then i mention mama the mama receptor is a receptor that responds to the savory taste of things that is ah what you might find in a really wonderfully rich tomato sauce for those of you that eat meat and meat a a really well cooked not sold well done but properly cooked i should say stake ah if that is your thing and mama is present in both plant and animal foods and gives us that sensation of savoriness it almost has a kind of little bit of briny taste to it or brazed taste to it and indeed brazing of meats and brazing of vegetables is done specifically to activate that mama receptor we have those five basic tastes those are chemical sensors on the tongue that what we call transducer those chemicals those chemicals literally infold bind to those receptors and it is transducer meaning the binding of those chemicals to the receptors is converted into an electrical signal that travels in from the tongue along what is called the gustatory nerve the gustatory nerve then synapses mean meaning it makes connections in our brainstorm in the call nucleus of the solitary tract their other nuclide back their nuclargus aggregates of anurans and then it sends information up to the called insular quarters to the insula i want a highline the insula this episode because we are going to return to the insula again and again in this episode and later the insular quarter is a incredible structure that we all have that mainly is concerned with called interception or our perception of what is going on inside our body to be the amount of pressure in our got because of how much food we have eaten it could be a the acidity of our got if we are having a obit of indigestion for instance it can also be the case that neurons within the insula ore paying attention to how street you are or how alert you are or how tired you are it is really an inward focusing structure it focuses on how we feel internally and not surprisingly the taste system sens information up to the insular quarter to give us a sense literally of what we have ingested whether or not what were tasting tastes good or not we were turned to insular quarters in a few moments a very important thing to understand is that the neurons in the areas of the quarter your quarters in mind that respond to particular tastes or providing an internal representation of an external sense what do i mean by that i do not want to be at all abstract we take these foods we break them down in our mouth by chewing them or sucking on them whatever it is the food happens to be those chemicals bind to those receptors and electrical signals are sent into the brain but they are just electrical signals just notes being played on the keys of a piano there is no unique signature for salty or sweet it is the relative activation of one set of anurans that was activated by sweet or another set of anurans that was activated by mama it is that relative activation traveling into the brain in essentially the same form the same electrical signals this is really incredible right electrical signals are sent in the brain and you say aha that sweet and i want more of it or that is bitter i want less of it or that is mamma flavored and i really really that really savory foods as i happen to that should immediately strike you as incredible because it means that your representation of what you want more of or less of is electrical in nature and to really tamp this issue down studies that were done by charges sucker u k e are is a absolutely phenomenal nor scientist at colombia university in new york studies done by the sucker lab have shown that first of all they could identify the anurans in the quarter deep in the brain that respond to a sweet taste or to a bitter taste it turns out they are non overlapping populations of anurans and then using some molecular tricks they were able to either silence or activate the anurans that for instance respond to sweet when they do this they see incredible consequences on perception that indeed occur in your brain and my brain as well all the time without these kind of manipulations here is the experiment they have a subject drink water that contain sugar or drink water that contains a salty substance or drink water that contains a bitter substance for instance him sort of paraphrasing a large amount of work they identify the neurons that respond to sweet tastes they see as many researches have seen that subjects prefer sweet taste to other tastes and certainly sweet taste to bitter or sweet taste to nothing to plain water and then they go in and they are able to selectively silence the neurons that represent sweet and when they do that they eliminate the preference for that sweet taste now that might seem obvious the anurans respond to sweet you silences neurons they no longer seek out sweet but that should strike you also as incredible because they're not actually changing what is happening on the tongue or in the deeper layers of the brain conversely they can have subjects drink bitter water or plain water while activating selectively activating the neurons that respond to sweet and what they find is that than subjects will actively prefer bitter or plain water to actual preference is such as sweet what this means is that your perception of what you is a central meaning with it deep within the brain phenomenon it is not about how things taste on your mouth now of course under normal conditions where there are not these experimental manipulations being done those things are positively correlated sweet tastes trigger the activation of sweet anurans for instance anurans in the mouth that respond to mama trigger the activation of irons in the brain that respond to mamma and forth there correlated in a way that makes you seek out the things that you and avoid the things that you do not but as will see in a few minutes turns out that that is not a direct relationship that is hard wired you can actually uncouple the preference for particular taste with the reward systems in the brain in a way that for instance would allow you to eat ah or i should use myself as enxamlics the don't particularly fish have had a few meals that include a fish that were pretty good but none of them were memorable in the con of positive way some other events in my life memorable but by way of these circuitry's and the way they link up with one another it is actually possible to rewire one sense of taste and preference for particular foods if this is seeming at all vague to you just hanging with me a little bit longer because i will provide you with the information tools and resources with which to navigate this process but the most it important thing to understand is that with our hearing with vision with smell taste is in internal representation that has particular goals for you your sense of what taste good is related to particular things that are occurring in your brain an body and that are likely to give your brain an body the things that it needs it is not simply a matter of what you quote in duo or what taste good or what does not taste good let me give you a relatively simple example of how your body and your brain are acting in a coordinated way to make you prefer certain foods and indeed to pursue certain foods more si just mention you have neurons on your tongue that respond to different taste but of course your digestive track is it just your tongue its also your throat got s all the way down to your stomach and of course your intestines it is along tube of digestion all along that tube there are neurons some of the neurons are responding to the mechanical size of whatever portion the digestive tractor happens to be for instance how distended or empty or full rather does not have to be descended how o opens how much you ate but how full or empty your gut happens to be whether not something you just ate is temperature hot is hot in the sense of hot to the touch or whether not its spicy hot whether not its soothing whether not its and of hard to swallow this kind of thing we of neurons all long your gut that are responding to the mechanics related to food in digestion and that are related to the chemistry of food an digestion there is a population of neurons nerve cells in your gut that are exquisitely tuned to the chemistry of whatever it is in your gut and these are neurons called uropod cells they were discovered many many years ago but really defined with and classified with modern tools by diegobores hope ism pronouncing your name correctly dingo we have spoken many times but i cannot ever seem to quite capture the proper pronunciation just right but diegobores at duke university who discovered that these cells reside within the gut and place little processes their little axons and dendrites within the mucosa lining of the gut and there they are paying attention to meaning they respond to a monoacid sugars and fatiacids as your food is digested as food lands within your gut neurons they are are sensing what types of foods are available and what types of things are making their way through the gut environment now those neurons are not actually taking those foods in doing much with them what there doing is the there essentially a surveying what qualities of food are there and these particular neurons that ego and his group discovered send electrical signals up into the brain through a little passage that we call the roofs ganglion that nodes angle is a a cluster of neurons that then gofer send a their own process into the brain and trigger the release of dopamine which is a molecule that inspires motivation reward and more seeking for whatever it is led to their activation these are superinteresting neurons because what they are essentially doing is they are providing a subconscious signal about the quality of the food that your eating what it contains and then triggering the release of a molecule within your brain dopamine that leads you to go seek more of those foods now this has profound impact on a number of things first of all there is the consideration of called hidden sugars doctor robot lusting who a pediatric under chronologists tat university californium san francisco has been among the most prominent researches to talk about the fact that there are these called hidden sugars in foods now these are not yous sugars that they sneak in just to be sneaky these are sugars that are literally snuckyin in a way that you cannot taste them that is why they are called hidden sugars not that they just put them in there for fun these are sugars that are placed into process foods that are designed to trigger activation of these mechanisms to leads you to want to eat more of these foods but not because they necessarily taste sweet or delicious but because they are activating the subconscious mechanisms that are driving you to pursue more of these foods something a very diabolical strategy and indeed it is somewhat of a diabolical strategy however these neurons are also involved signalling to your brain when for instance you are eating of food that is rich in a megathere fatiacids the padiasis that we are talking about earlier why is it that you do not crave salmon wise at that i do not sit around day dreaming about marcel well because there's also the influence of the actual taste on the mouth under normal conditions it's a commination of the taste of the thing on the mouth plus this subconscious signaling from the gut and while this is into discussion about got microbial i should just mention that it is very clear that having a healthy got microbial allows these neurons to function in a way that serves our seeking of healthy foods in positive ways and without getting into a lot of detail about this the best way to insure a healthy got microbus that i am aware of is not necessarily to take supplemental prebiotics are robotics they are actually some reasons why you might not want to do that but rather to invest two four servings of fermented foods that are low in sugar each day there is a recent study publishing cells showing hat the ingestion of fermented foods two to four servings each day can enhance the quality of the mucosa lining of the got that allow certain got microbioda to flourish and the got microbiota that are not good for just to not flourish cause that is the environment that they settle down into this is work that was carried out by my colleagues a just in sonimberg is in the laboratory upstairs for me as well as cries gardener and others at stamford they are certainly not the only researchers exploring this but it does appear that two to four servings of fermented foods each days of these would be things not sour trout a low sugar fermented foods is great for the got microfilm and separate studies not there study but separate studies have shown that that correct gmicrobium conditions allow these neurons that signal to the brain to signal the right at the right times and in the right ways to promote healthy food seeking many people opt to supplement with capsule form robotics there are some data that suggest that may be those do not contain the correct robotics and robotics for setting the correct got microbiota conditions it's i low bit of a controversial issue none the less getting robotics from fermented foods is probably the simplest and most straightforward way it is also the way and that we evolved to do that over many at least hundreds and probably thousands or even tends tour hundreds of thousands of years people have been investing tormented foods not just for their taste but for their health benefits as well now have mention two of the three mechanisms by which we prefer certain foods one is from the actual taste that were familiar with the taste on her tongue and in her mouth and the sensations that make us go man or e or e the young young me responses as i referred to them earlier and then there is this subconscious signalling coming from the it that is really based on the nutrient content to the foods there is a third pathway which is the learned association of a particular taste with the particular quality or value that a food has and this is where things get really interesting and where there is actually a leverage point for you to rewire what it is that you find tasty and that you want to seek more of the work it'd to talk about next has been carried out in malsemodels and has been carried out in parallel experiments in humans this is largely not exclusively but largely the work of van de auto and can a small van erugo is at mountain school of medicine and data small is at male and they and others in their field have done incredible experiments exploring how taste and food value the nutritional value of food and the impact of that food on metabolism in the brain drives our food choices and allows us to change our food choices for the better their groups have done some really amazing studies involving ingestion of a particular substance that either contains sugar and thereby can elevate glucose blood sugar or not and varying meaning changing the taste associated with that ingestion of sugar lemme just give you a simple example where they have subjects these con be mice or these to be humans case they have done both sets of studies drink sweet water as an alternative or choice to non sweeten water or bitter water or some other flavor what they find is that mice in humans will prefer to consume the sweet beverage now it is not always sweet water mice sweet water but humans will let will prefer for instance a milk shake a fatty sweet come drink tho consume more of that and not surprisingly dopamine levels in the brain increase in response to that the taste and the neutrino content of what it is that their ingesting are alined they are matched they have also done experiments where they have no taste but subjects are being infused with sugar directly into the gut and not surprisingly based on everything have told you up until now subjects will pursue more of that thing relative to some other taste either neutral or negative taste because that sugar in the gut is triggering the activation of the anurans i mentioned earlier which is signalling to the brain to pursue more of that thing this tells us something important it tells us that we are driven meaning we have mechanisms in our brain that make us motivated to pursue more of what brings both a taste of sweetness but also that brings actual changes in blood luck levels up orcas we are motivated to eat sweet things not just because they taste good but because they change our blood sugar level they increase our blood sugar level this is important because it mean be the case it could have been that we were just wired to pursue things that taste good but what this tells us is that we are actually wired to pursue things that increase our blood glucose much that when the small lab its not a small assets a big lab but when damn a small slab and or van dearucofs lab have done experiments where they use a compound called to doxy glucose this is a compound that can prevent glucose from being metabolized by neuron blood glucose is going up but anurans cannot use it what they find is that the reenforcing or the rewarding properties of of food or taste are eliminated p ut simply it is not sufficient for a food to taste good consciously it is not sufficient for a food to increase blood sugar you need blood sugar to go up and that blood sugar glucose has to be utilized by the neurons even if it is not associated with a good taste and to make it even simpler if this is not sinking in this should make it very clear what your brain meaning what you are seeking when you eat is not taste is not dopamine is not even arise in blood glucose what your seeking even though you do not realize it because its subconscious is you are seeking things that allow your neurons to be metabolically active and this is fundamentally important for understanding why you eat why you eat particular foods and how you can change your relationship to those foods now earlier i referred to circuits that are wired for a particular outcome and in biology and in particular neuroscience we refer to things that are either hard wired meaning immutable and unchangeable or soft wired a good example of soft wiring would be the areas of your brain that are responsible for speech and language a always more or less in the same place in your brain and every one else is brain however they are not hard wired to speak french or to speak english or to speak chines or to speak german because depending on where you are born in the parents that you are born to you need to be able to speak water may be even more languages the taste system and this general system of seeking particular foods similarly is hard wired to obtain certain types of neutriance it tends to sweet things most children naturally sweet things some more than others but naturally most people from childhood onward do not particularly crate very bitter substances may be mildly bitter but not very bitter there is some hard wiring of preference but there is also some soft wiring in the system that allows it to change the groups i mention earlier have done some really beautiful experiments looking at how artificial sweeteners interact with the actual sweet sensing system and this gets right down to a number of issues first of all it gets to the issue of how we can rewire our taste system in ways that serve us for better or for worse second of all it gets right down to the issue of whether not artificial sweetness are good for us a bad for us and indeed as of just this last year we now answer to that question and turns out it depends and i will tell you in a few minutes when it is oke to invest artificial sweetness and when it is very detrimental to ingest artificial sweetness of any kind regardless ism not ta name off brannames but there different forms of these artificial sweeteners nowadays and there a various forms of non colonic plantable sweeteners for which the same information than am about to tell you applies et the experiments that were done beautifully illustrate that you ill seek out particular foods because of the way they taste because of their impact on blood glucose levels but also on their impact on the dopamine system even if your blood locos levels do not change here is the experiment one group of subjects is given a sweet taste of a substance that also raises blood glucose levels blood sugar and dopamine goes up not surprisingly second condition separate subjects consume an artificial sweetener or a non cleric sweetener it is not preferred much over other substances but it is sweet its preferred somewhat and it does not cause in increase in blood locos levels and not surprisingly dopamine levels do not go up initially we do not tend to artificial sweeteners that much that is the simple way of putting it however if subjects continue to invest artificial sweeteners even though the is no increase in blood locos level and therefore no increase in brain metabolism dopamine levels eventually start to rise and when those dooming levels eventually start to rise you have essentially conditioned or reenforced that artificial or noncaloric sweetener and then subjects start to consume more of it and the actually get dopamine increase from it that is interesting it says that consuming more of these artificial sweetness or consuming them for a longer period of time can starts a tapping the dopamine system and lead us to seek out or consume more of these artificial sweeteners many people are probably familiar with this because we tend to a or i should say people report that when they invest these artificial sweetness at first they do not taste very good but then over time they seem kind of tolerable and then may be even pleasurefore and than some people feel quotuncuo addicted to various diet sodas and thinks of that sort now the is another condition that been explored and that is the really interesting condition and it is the condition where an artificial sweetener is pared with a substance that can increase blood sugar but not because it taste sugary a normal sweet substance now there's an artificial sweetener that is coupled with an actual increase in blood glucose then natural world scenario where this would happen would be drinking a diet soda which contains no calories and therefore would not increase blood glucose but is sweet with a food that increases blood glucose and when that happens what your essentially doing is tapping into the dopamine system this non cleric sweeten sweet taste is pared with it and there is an increase in in neon metabolism you have all of the components for reinforcement and as a consequence you get in a sort of pavlova condition sing way a situation where later when you invest that artificial sweeter you actually get not only the increase in dopamine but you get alterations in blood sugar management now blood sugar cannot go up if you do not invest something that makes blood sugar go up it is not as if you invest artificial sweeter with some food that contains calories are sugar and then later you remove the food and you just drink the soda and your blood glucose goes up rather it is a much worse situation if you it'll make this in the natural world contact if you invest an artificial sweeter say drink dietsota while consuming foods that increase blood glucose then later even if you just drink the diet soda it is been shown that you secret much more insolent the hormone that regulates blood glucose in response to that diet soda studies have been done in both adult humans and in human children general when we say children we mean human children but just to be very clear will ere talking about exploring consuming diet soda with or without food than later consuming just the diet soda and what they found was having previously consumed dietsota with food and then later only consuming the diet soda of course there is not an increase in blood glucose because tear not bringing in any calories when they just drink the diet soda but there is a significant increase in insolent release and that is serious in a terrible way because increased release of insolent and called insolent sensitivity is the basis for type to diabetes much that in the study with the children consuming non colonic beverages in this way first with food and then on their own let to increases in insolent that made them prediabetic and that she had to holt the study one is fume out from this and just really illustrate the major findings and then talk about how this can be applied in the positive sense i also want a mention what this means in terms of your consumption of artificial sweeteners of any kind first of all the direct take away about artificial sweetness artificial sweetness are not bad for you ism not going to say that what i am going to say is that whether not you invest them alone or you invest them in culmination with foods or is part of foods that raise blood glucose is vitally important for your insolent management and the simple extract or tool from this is if you are going to consume artificial sweetness it is very likely best to consume those away from any food that raises blood glucose levels if you're going to enjoy diet soda be my guest but do it while not while consuming food in particular foods that raise blood glucose because what these studied show and i will provide references for these is that they can vastly disrupt blood sugar management by way of the insolent luck system ski and awhile just give you the reference now this is a paper a from data small slab the first author is dalinburg d a l e n b e re and the title of the paper is short term consumption of sucres with but not without carbohydrate impairs curl and metabolic sensitivity to sugar inhuman this is a paper publish in sellmetabolism in march of twenty twenty i think it is a very important paper and similar findings have been addressed in mice and another studies and now because of this paper there is now a bunch of other groups working on this o this issue there is some evidence previously published in nature excellent copter journal among the superable of topthree journals being nature science and sell paper publish in nature a few years back showing that particular artificial sweeteners can destroy the up microfilm and have dilitarious health effects that result i think stands although there some results that a may not agree with that depending on whether or not the artificial sweeteners sacring or scrolls or aspartame or stein that is the up microfilm but what we are talking about here is independent of the form of artificial or non cleric sweetener because it has everything to do with whether or not there is a match or a mismatch between the perceived taste and the effect of the thing that you are consuming on blood sugar and metabolism the first take away from this is if you are going to consume artificial sweetness it is really important that you do that not conjunction with foods that increased blood locos second of all it points to the fact that the foods that we prefer and the activation of the dopamine system both through the gut and at the level of conscious taste what in other words what we is very plastic it is mutable and we can change it how can we change it well earlier i mentioned a structure in the brain called the insula this incredible structure that is involved in interception and in terraception of all kinds in fact a just as an aside assuror go my lab published a paper showing that activity within certain compartments of the insula of humans is responding to a heightened state of anxiety in the body it can respond to changes in our respiration changes in our heart rate this is again it is a redoubt of our internal state not just of taste but of many many different aspects of the mechanics and chemistry of our internal mil we within our body all of the work that i was describing previously has also been addressed at the neural level and using a broad brush to explain these results what we can say is when there is dopamine increase one sees activation of the called nucleus accumbent which is part of them called musolymbic reward pathway if you would to learn more about the musolymic reward pathway and dopamine in general and humans and in animal studies and all the various incredible am and challenging things that dopamine can do for us a there is a episode all about dopamine that you can look up it is easy to find at supermen lapdocom the increases in dopamine associate with sweet taste and or bloodglucos elevating foods and drinks cause activation of the uncles accumbent that is not surprising also in the circuit is activation of the called arcuate neuclyie within the hypothalamus the are areas of the hypothalamus that respond to hormones from the body and respond to hormones in neuropeptites in the brain as well as neural signals in the brain to drive us to eat more or to stop eating it is hypothalamus nucleus accumbent the i a sort of the a hypothalamus and the argue being the motivating to eat or motivating to stop eating both set of barons are to contain there their other airs the lateral hypothalamus as well but hypothalamus a sort of the accelerator in the break on eating and then the nucleus accumbent and dooming release can be thought of as kind of a am a nitroboost if you will l the cuddly to the cuddly that anymore anyway a nitroboose to increase what we call the gain or the volume of how much you want more of something ki wen dopamine is present it is this kind of generic signal to go seek out more of whatever caused that release and then there is the insula this very thoughtful rational not really it is not thinking it is a brainarea your thinking but it is part of the areas of your brain that are interpreting what is going on in your body whether not you feel good or not good whether it you feel anxious excited or fearful it is integrating all that information and fed in to this entire circuit as well are the inputs from your prefrontal quarters which is your thinking rational neuronal structure if you will informing you for instance ah eh i do not really salmon very much am not crazy about can but it has omagathrees or it is rich in these polyphinales that are good for me and if one decides that they are going to eat these things not just because they are good for them but believe it are not if one takes the perception or adopts the perception that they are both good for you and that in being good for you they are good for your brain metabolism and that you desire to be healthy as crazy as it sounds those subjective signals of what you tell yourself about the foods that you are eating can actually impact how those to gods will taste may be not immediately but eventually and can impact the way in which your body utilizes those foods now that might seem a absolute pipe dream if i just imagine that i mackerel mackerel will start to taste good ism not saying that i did not say that you could override yum signals with this mechanism i did not say that you could take a food that would be absolutely noxious to you or make you want a vamp and override that however foods that are somewhat neutral to you can take on a different value based on the activation of the dopamine system and now knowing what there are coupleways that you could imagine doing that first of all you could in this all gadoncan or thought experiment you could for instance swap out sucres because sucres is just a taste rite is an artificial sweet taste you could swap that out and insert can but eat the can with something that raises blood glucose to some degree or another now ism not encouraging any one to run out there in spite their blood glucose crazy and in fact blood glucose is in really the goal if you recall the goal is to get neurons to be metabolically active with that blood glucose and that is what is actual rewarded at a subsubconscious level men at a deep subconscious level but consuming these foods with other foods that increase blood locos and thereby a brain metabolism or i suppose if you ere quitogenic here a in the mitosis a i do not know what the range of foods that are allowed on mitosis are i soft want a misspeak here and u say cracker if which would probably be a sin in the context of mitosis and no nock against mitosis ism offering this in in part because i think that there are a number of people that have and can positively benefit from aquitogenic diet but for instance if there's a food that you want to consume more of but that you find somewhat me or mildly ye much even parring it with queitones if indeed you are using queitones for your brain metabolism cause that is what happens on the quitogenic diet overtime that food will be reenforced by the dopamine pathway we know this from these studies where sucres was the substance paired with the glucose elevating in other words metabolically elevating food substance or liquid substance how does one go about doing this well first of all i want t emphasize that this experiment actually has been done in a slightly different context studies by my collogue a decorum in the psychology department at stamford have explored the bodily response in terms of insolent release and the release of other food and eating related hormones as well as over all feelings of satisfaction et camera in groups of people that drink a milk shake and are either told that it is a low carry shake that contains a various neutrinos that are good for them or a higher carry shake that has a lot of nutrients et camera and what they found was that the different groups and here again on being very general with my description of these studies but what they found is that the physiological response the insolent response the blood locos response and the subjective measures of whether not people enjoyed something or not were heavily influence by what they were told for in these milk shakes blood glucose would go up insolent would go up when people were told it was a high carry shake with lots of nutrients less when people invested a shake that was that they were told had less nutrients and forth when in reality it was the identical shake this is incredible this is a belief effect this is not placebo right a placebo effect is different placebo effect is in comparison it is where the control condition actually influence is outcomes to a same or to some degree just the experimental condition this is not a placebo effect this is a belief effect where the belief and the subjective thoughts about what a given food will do has a direct impact on a physiological measure blood sugar and blood locos let dugout from this for a second and think about how we can incorporate this in to adopting consumption of healthy foods that serve are brain health and the immediate and long term and if you are wondering what those are e listed them out at the beginning of the episode and their justification for being on that list what this means is obviously you want to consume foods that you but because brain health is very important and many of the foods that promote brain health perhaps are not the most palatable to you or desirable to you the key would be to invest the foods that you want to invest more of simply because their good for you and not because they taste good to you a alongside foods that increase whatever fuel system you happen to be relying on i think that is the most a nutritionally politically correct way to say it if your quite that would mean quinone a if you are not quitogenic and i think most people probably are not in mitosis are try to maintain mitosis but for instance people that are on a purely plant basket that would be one set of foods for people that are omnivore a different set of foods and for people that are corners yet another set of foods if you want to eat more of our particular food because it is good for you part with something in the same meal you do not have to hide it physically or in the flavor sense you don't have to hide it within that other food but parrot with that other food that provides you a shift in brain metabolism because that really what your brain and you are seeking even though you do not realize how long will this take well according to the data and humans on sucres and the conditioning for sucres to have these effects which in many cases were detrimental right because they were increasing insolent but in this case you are trying to hijack this conditioning of food preference for healthy purposes not with sucres but by investing things that are good for you then the data really point to the fact that even within a short period of time of about seven days but certainly within fourteen days that food will take on a subjective experience of tasting at least better to you if not good to you now i believe this has important implications for much of the controversy and food wars that we see out there food wars being of course the groups that ardently subscribe to the idea that there diet and the things that they are eating are the foods that are good for us and that are the most pleasureful and the things that everyone should be eating we see this with every community within the nutrition realm now of course there are studies that point to the fact that certain foods and food components are healthier probably for us and fer the planet but you really see on both ends of the spectrum you have got people who are on a pure carnivore diet who are arguing with a lot of biomedical evidence that that is what is best for us and beneficial and then you got people that are arguing the same general sets of arguments but for a purely plantable diet and then i think most people fallen the omnivore category what is very clear however is that what we consume on a regular basis and what leads to increases in brain metabolism leads to increases in dopamine and thereby a motivation to eat them what this really says is that what we tend to do regularly becomes reenforcing in and of itself and i think enlarge part can explain the fact that yes indeed for certain people a given diet not only feels good but they heavily subscribe to the nutrient and kind of health beneficial effects of that diet and they often will provide evidence for that whether not you ask them for it or not but that is true of every subcategory within the nutrition realm again this is not to take away from some of the beautiful data emphasizing that certain foods and micronutrient et camera are better for us or worse for us and fer the planet it is not a debate i want to get into right now what it but this emphasizes is that foods impact our brain and its health but that they also impact how our brain functions and response to food and that is largely a learned response we cannot completely over ride for instance that certain foods evoke a strong the much component certain foods are truly putrid to us i should just say certain things are future to us and we should not cons n them right and not a at the far end of the spectrum's hard wired for us to avoid those because they can be dangerous for us that can me us very very sick but it is also true that if we continue to eat foods that are progressively sweeter and sweeter and highly palatable it shifts our opening system because it activates our dopamine system to make us believe that those foods are the only foods that can trigger this reward system and make us feel good and taste and that they taste good but after consuming foods that perhaps are less sweet or even less savory that are not what we call highly or i would say nowadays at superpalatable foods we can adjust our sense literally of what we perceive as an attractive and rewarding food and indeed the dopamine system will reward those foods accordingly i cannot emphasize enough how much this learning of associated food reward is important for not just understanding why we the foods that we eat and how to eat more of foods that are healthy for us and enjoy them but it also speaks to the fact that our brain as a whole is a perceptible device trying to make guesses or estimations about what certain foods are going to do for us put simply we do not just sweet foods because they taste good we them because they predict a certain kind of metabolic response this is important also because damn a small and van erugo and others have been exploring whether or not people for instance that have type to diabetes or that suffer from any number of different metabolic disorders whether not somehow these food reward systems are permanently disrupted and through a beautiful set of experiments that have been done by mainly by damn a small croup at male but also by the erugo group and others exploring how the reward pathways or altered in various metabolic disorders et camera people suffering from tits diabetes we do not have time to go into all those data now but the take away is that food preference and the ability to reshape these circuits is not disrupted in these people to the point where it cannot be rewired and that is very encouraging because what it means is that for people that are suffering from these syndrome through some simple alterations in dietary choice provided those are carried out over time and in the correct way by paring with the foods that will appropriately shift metabolism of the brain one can actually rewire what they consider not just palatable but attractive as foods if you want to learn more about food reward and food reinforcement because it turns out those are slightly different things there is a wonderful review written by van erugo they have a middle author mar actor and damn a small it called rethinking food reward and it was published in the annual reviews of psychology he can find it very easily on line was published in two thousand nineteen and it is a beautiful deep dive although quite accessible to most people about how different foods in the way that we perceive them impacts our brain and body and why we the things we and how to reshape what we once again we've done a fairly extensive deep dive in to food and your brain focusing first on how particular foods and compounds within foods that are available also through supplementation can impact immediate and long term brain health came up with a relatively short list of what i would call super foods only because a there are ample data to support their roll in enhancing short and long term cognition and neuronal health and on and we also talked about food preference and why particular tastes and particular events within the gut and particular events within the brain combine to lead us to pursue particular foods and to avoid other foods and how you can leverage those pathways in order to pursue more of the foods that are going to be good for you and good not just for your brain but for your overall body health and to enjoy them

one of the great qualities of dictatorship is that dictators can hold the line even as democracies start to fay that of course is the theory a pay much every dictator across history when faced with a democratic rival that is certainly the theory of vladmerpouten to day whether it is in e crane or weather it is with regard to him just killing yow the people who oppose him people elegy naval and is becoming very clear this week that vladmerpoutent is now settling all family business this is the week where he feels he has the ability to do exactly what it is that he wants and the reason he feels that way is because a combination of splits on the right in the united states in accommodation of splits on h left in the united states as well as splits in the european coalition with regard to russia when vladmerpouten invaded crane there were pretty much unanimity that this was not something that the west could allow to stand the you could not have ladmrpoutent simply waiting into knives takin over the country killing vladmir's lens and essentially setting up a puppet did tutorship in turning new crane into a second sellers you could not have that because it would put russia directly on the borders of e did city of dato countries including hungary and pole yet you could not have it because it would certainly threaten former soviet satellite states estonia mafia lithuania all of which are deeply fearful of a gotten led incursion into their territory finland as well you could not have it because crane actually is relatively major producer of products wheat and oil and mostly could not have because ladinerpouten has interest the are antithetical to those of the west and for all of the talk about over the last twenty five years how ladder potent was just on the cusp of moderating how it there can be a moment when vladmerpooten was welcomed into the family of nations and then he would just be nice to everybody that never happen every single president of my lifetime has tried a rest with ladmerpouten gorge doll be bush famously looked into pouter's eyes and thought he had a sense of his soul and the you had borakobama who literally sent killer client in his secretary of states to mascot to give them a button that did not actual say reset but was supposed to be a reset button and then you had ladder potent being offered flexibility biborokabama into thousand twelve in the lead up to the twenty twelve lection when then dona tramcar into the office in the basic assumption was the dona trump was going to lead to a warm relationship with pouted and i have golden who came into office t was immediately pretty soft on russia in terms a sort of get political stritetery as gorge by bush once put it that that take has been proved false time and time again vladmerpouten is a highly intelligent highly skilled adversary of the united states his interest do not a line with the interest of the west the chief russia motivation in this has been true for a literally centuries is territorial ambition there is been true since the time of peter the great and father in the great man if you an't go back even further this been terucentime i the terrible in that the fact is that you look at russia histories have any sense of russia history cassia's great leaders are always measure by the amount of land they control which makes a certain amount of go political sens if you are russia because again russia is a giants step meaning it is open to invasion from all sides and if your russia one of the things that historically you have attempted to do is expand your borders as to prevent invasion from all sides out a certain point that defensive justification becomes at all fence strategy in which are invading sovereign nations that exist all around run attempting to control top down a russia has always been in empire since the time of musky and now you are watching as ladmerpouten tries to expand the boundaries of what he sees as his new empire can he himself compared himself to outer o the great just a couple of years ago after the invasion of you crane and when you watch the interview that he did tucker raisin where the first thirty five minutes is dedicated two his idea of russia claims to u crane in which he actually sort makes the claim that russia has claims to plan and hungary is well when when he says that sort of stuff we ought to take that seriously he is actually spelling out what he actively thinks now their bunch people on the left who think the ladimerpootenis doing this because he is offended by the muscularity of the west that if only the west had been more conciliatory toward flamer gotten than russia would not in fact being adversarial force that everything of ladmerpootn does his blow back to the west that is the theory of of people on the left who are very much vacillating with regard to what lamerpouten is thing to do and then there are a couple of theories on the right and those theories range from the blow back theory people ripping that off from john me shiver the form policy scholar who think is wrong about a great anything john marshier has sort of frize that it it is ado's expansion that drove gotten to invade south o seeshufor example an georgia or drove gotten to invade crime and tat on baseretion originally in twenty forte an the invade the rest of you can in twenty twenty two read that there is that theory which again is coincident with the left wing blow back theory of america form policy that day someway back to people hoarsen and omchomsky we get a more on this in just one second

very an ti mush of the left wing ideology with regard to say gender and sax an sexuality that the west has fallen for and they have built up in their minds lot of people the idea that because ruffians are socially conservative as a general matter which they are that this is somehow what claimer patent represents as opposed to he has a population that is socially conservative and also that is not his actual ambition his actual ambition is not in defense of a social conservatism his ambition is in defend a russia territorial ambition it is a category error in other words for many people on the right hayfield on the right have made that same category error for example with cereal law countries in the atomic world that suggested tat because those countries are gone quote socially conservative that somehow those countries have a commonality with we america conservatism america christian conservatism and the answer there is no they really don't their ambitions are not the same as your ambitions and what this really reveals is a schism in the united states broadly rid then in the less broadly written rope as well a schism about whether the west has any sense of internal solidity what are the values of the west because if pouted is able to split the west on the basis of perceived values or perceived anti westernism as has their lot f people in lest really do not west very much on the one hand and lot people the west who believe that the greater threat to the united states might be their neighbors who dis agree with them about social politics as opposed to people claimer patent not the vladimputents a direct threat to people in the united states right this instant but he is a very large indirect threat to people in the united states because geopolitics actually matters when you cut off shipping roots when you destroy the sources of international trade when you threaten america lies these are things that actually will matter to america citizens it large ay laterputeness figuring that the history of the united states since world war too is if you can split the america public you can win and does it matter how weak you are all yes to do is outlast outlasting is the strategy is been true since poachy men in vietnam it was true of the talesman an of gangsta it was true of cereal law protean forces in arch if you can out last the united states you will win and the time for out lasting is shrinking an shrinking and shrinking used to be that order to outlast the america public you would have to way to decade and now because of the velocity of social media and because of the ability of people to see these arguments in real time an split from each other and polarize very quickly what your seeing is that the west is sapped of its will incredibly quickly on nearly every conflict when there is a conflict with true evil you see western powers immediately leap to fight the evil and then pretty quickly start to doubt themselves and figuroca i think were done here we n to move on with our lots now this would be a timeworn political leadership actually matter be there is a complete dearth of political leadership on b t sides of the political isle on these matters jobidon is utterly incapable of articulating the ration ow why america should carry if russia invade you grant he does not he does not even attempt articulated he is just spouts words democracy without taking full stock of the actual situation four america cause american's look at jobidon state things democracy and the a weight hold up a second you crane first of all is an extrordent in extraordinarily imperfect democracy and the freedom house score for you races thirty nine russia seven but you cranes thirty nine does not amazing well spring of democracy it is a burgeoning democracy at best and when you say democracy over and over america what is that really what you crane is about and then america say what if if that is what you cranes really about then where we allies with says out arabia to shut arabia obviously is not a democracy by the way a lot of our allies for not democracies are to get very nervous when they her democracy talk coming from jobidon because i locate chatting an arab spring us over here the real reason why the united states is pursuing a defense of you crane he's because we have geostratigic interest in degrading the russia military capacity to expand beyond its own borers threaten shipping lanes threatening supply resources increasing the power of enemies of america and america allies russia has formed antofacto collision with china and iron at this point and that a fact coalition threatens america allies all around the world and threatens freedom of the sees for example everywhere from the titan strait to the straits of polka to the red sea to the traits of harmony and that that coalition it is extremely dangerous and the united states does have a get political interest in down grating that but that is not something that jobidin can explain because he cannot we words any more and probably does not understand the words that he is saying right now and on the right there is a split about whether these things even matter there is this bazar idea that is arisen on large parts of the right that america can become autarkic that suddenly global economics do not matter at all that if he that if things go to hell in a hand basket with regard to the freedom of the seas in these particular areas at will not effect america citizens in any way mum's explain if shipping starts to be truly endangered the way that it is in the red sea in any of the other areas that i just mention the amount of money that america are going to pay is going o be much larger than whatever checks we are signing to crane it will make our head spin if you love to the inflation of the first couple of years of the biding hero wait until freedom of the sees goes ways something the you are going to enjoy o case it in any case vlamerpootent knows all this because all he has to do is just keep pressing all yes to does keep pressing and he is taking full manage he sees the splits and is exploiting those splitter he is a smart player lederhoot is a smart political player who sees form policy is a zero some game and no attempt to a peas ladmerputent through happy talk is going to work again i wen through the serious administrations in the united states since ladmerpuon took office into thousand everything one those administrations has tried a the want policy with lanmerpooten and all of them fail its guess what every one of those administrations ends every one of them has a shifting congress and lady tan still there ruling in unitary fashion the downside of dictatorship is i generally means a poorly run country that has no feed back loops for improvement of the country y can list certain countries by the way that have had queasy dictatorships that have actually run fatally well that was true for example of a sing aport for several decades but it is very rare more likely it turns in to a corrupt oligarch in which the leader use is his position in order to enrich himself and his friends in order to insure his own power and destroys his adversaries and one of the best ways to maintain your own power is to destroy things internal property rights in political freedoms because if you give property writes that may lead to the creation of a monetary was for which a threat can can mount against you laderpouten has been very very bad for the russia people if you do not believe me all you have to do is is look at the various g t ps per capita in the former soviet satellite states it peeper capita right now in states poland it poland is a former ya satellite state go peeper capita there is about eighteen thousand dollars it peeper capita in a estonia a former ya satellite state is twenty eight thousand dollars it peeper capita in coffin a former you satellites at twenty one thousand dollars g peeper capita in russia right now is twelve thousand dollars someone in that neighborhood lanrpouten has not in a boon to russhok putting all that aside again lanerpouten is winning right now because all he feels he has to do is out last not only that the weaponry that we are shipping to you crane in defense is much more expensive than the weapon my the vlanerpouten is using in offense in u crane get's more on this in just one moment first are you struggling with back taxes or unfold returns at this year l have got some bad news the is is escalating collections by adding twenty thousand new agents in these challenging times your best offense use tax network you say along with hiring thousands of new agents in field officers the tires has kicked off two thousand twenty four by sending over five million pay up letters to those who have unfired tax returns or balance is owe is gas a not your friends do not wave your rights and speak with those agents on your own without back up tax network you say is a trusted tax relief firm and they have saved over a million dollars in back taxes for their coins they can help you secure the best deal possible the the o ten gran or ten million bucks they can help whether its business for personal taxes whether have the means to pay or whether you are on a fixed income tax network can help finally resolved your taxburdens once in for all cede control of your financial future right now do not let tax issues over power you contact tax network you a save for immediate relief and expert guidance call one eight hundred two four five six thousand or this it t n u a dot come slash o per turn to tax network yous find your path to financial piece of mind that c and us do come slash o per the reason that vladnerpootent is able to ramp up his production which can last probably effectively another two to three years at the levels that he is currently producing the spend six per cents of their go pe on defend by which mean offers in places u crane that is unsustainable for an economy that is truly on workable in russia they do not have a workable economy it is fifty per cent probably based on oil profits they they do have trading partners of course outside the west but have they been economically damaged by the warning print absolutely is damaged everybody but it has certainly hit russia in sweeten terms of the inflation a but the reality is that russia can produce an crappy old machinery an am and it costs a lot less money then defensive machinery they you bythelyes use all over the globe a cost compass fifty bucks to to cratichat she rocket that they can shoot in to in his daily city and accost israelect fifty thousand dollars every time they fire an irondome that sort of stuff happens all the time across theglobe sone of the reasons why the soothes are being effective in the red sea right now all offensive measures that are basic and dumb cost almost nothing defensive measures which have to be sophisticated to stop the offense of measures are very very expensive which is why from a financial point view abut offense is better than defense from a financial point of very during war in the moment right now destroying the enemy's capacity to make wars actually easier than defending against the war that they are attempting to fight against you again all of this is just predicates the fact that vladnerpooten really is feeling his hates right now not only did he almost certainly kill election of alone i see almost certainly because you try to be a little careful about these things but h he killed plush electing valley did not die of natural causes in a prison at the age of forty seven after being poison by v ladinerpooten just about for years ago and then immediately arrested upon his return to russia a sentence to a geology for thirty plus years and then he randomly dies that is not the way that works especially not for ladinerpooten who makes a habit of killing his political opponents and in fact unsurprisingly the drumlin has now rejected international calls according to axis for an independent investigation in to russia opposition leader electing ofvalney's death in prison if lanes allies and family of course say that they suspect high level russia authorities were involved in his death which of course is absolutely true ism sure the european council said mister volley's unexpected and shocking death is yet another sign of the accelerating and systematic repression in russia drumlin has they have refused to release his body because they are afraid that if the releases body than there can discover the poison on him or the bruises on him or the broken bones or never it is the country's prison service is said he died suddenly after a walk they claims he fell in conscious after feeling sick and could not be resuscitated of course all of this has sort of outsized to impact in the lest because there is very famous h be documentary made about electing valley that one best picture for in best best documentary at the stars just a couple of years ago it is a very very compelling documentary all about his poisoning and is attempt to track down the people who poison him which he actually does heesshe calls one of his poisoners on the phone and gets them to admit the whole thing on the phone the very tale end of that documentary election valley actually is asked what is your message to the russia people in case o murdered and here is what he had to say i this tmnipro the robe nevis the it san go nothing very obvious to telling o t what is the slow not allowed and e she try you they decide to kill me it means that we are incredibly strong yon teeth you soul b is pus yes tho owe needs to utilize this power tan i give up y s remember were a huge power thoria turn you ttisthat is being impressed by these bad news thesttwe do not realize how strongly actually aching ssmosnti the the only thing necessary for the trying of evil the bus it is for good people to do nothing do not be inactive and then he was murdered either his murder is a reflection of paten feeling threaten or his murder is a reflection the fact that putting things he get away with nearly anything at this point and it seems more the latter especially because they are not being shy about anything they are doing right now ladies pouted according to the russia news agency the resign government has now file charges against olid and valley who is the who is the brother of elect navalney they said wanted under an article of the criminal code they did not specify what article nacelle's brother was even want under there just arresting flexing of all these relatives who are in russia right now and attempt to presumably quash any blowback from their decision to kill sexy navalney not just that on tuesday cassia's main security agent agency said that they ad arrested another america citizen this person's a duel citizen of russia and he united states on accusations of committing state treason by raising fun for u crane the affect identify the detain as a thirty three year old woman who lives in losangelis apparently she had raised fifty one dollars for you cranial organization that bought weapons and other equipment for you crane's military that is because she had sent fifty bucks to sum for you crane no york based non profit organization that sends assistants to the country and a the fess released of the russia state media avidin that showed the woman wearing a white hat that cover her as being hand cuff in escorted by massed security service officers if convicted she faces twenty years in prison and of course this makes perfect sense considering that russia is making just a balance off of america citizens the kidnap if they arrestpbritn grinder for being foolish enough to fly to russia with pot in her bag another they throwing prison they can get an actual hi level russia armstealer released in return for that they are still holding the palestra journal reporter even gershklich ifthy've they have no compunction about just rannimally kidnapping america citizens that this is no problem for them why because they are not afraid of the blowback at all that's more on this in just one second first in a world filled with uncertainties you should be prepared for any possibility you need my patriot supply my patriot supplies your trusted partner for emergency preparedness the the country's largest prepared is company they are more than equipped to stock your shelves whether its a natural disaster sudden emergency or unforeseen circumstances my

who defected she crane has now been apparently murdered according to the nearer times macsimen kuzmanofv pulled off a daring escape last summer when he defected she crane and handed his military helicopter over two craning commandos in exchange for half million bucks you crane trumpeted the defection as major coo in ladder cousin's russia he was guilty of treason you craning intelligence officials warrant outman of his life and danger they urshhim not to leave the country instead he moved with his money to small resort town on pains mediterranean coast and now he is been found murdered he is twenty eight or was twenty eight two punish police officials with knowledge of the case said the body of a man found riddled with bullets last week in the costal town of village yoga belonged to mister kuzmanoff antre turn representing of you crane's military and tell said he could confirm the fact of his death there is no in formation abut the possible assailants or motive very difficult to imagine that this person was not in riddled with bullets in a random town in spain sounds pretty potence to tome an again considering that this is a thing that vlanrapouten does send hi his s fence to do and again it is protein's exploiting the visions in the west at what america enemies would do right's what is what any country would do every country who seems itself as a get political opponents m another country hopes to exploit internal divisions the difference is that america the democracy and internal divisions are pretty obvious and clear wive a free press same thing is true in rope for all the problems we have in america or rope they are not remotely the same kind of promthery different in category problem what happening over in russia president bison had promised that there would be significant repercussions against russia if nvalneat was killed unclear exactly what those repercussions are going to beat pounds figuring he can with stand anything at this point he is got his money inside the countries got as dash s he does not care according too yah who knew the bi dadministrational impose major sanctions on russia in response to the death of navalney john hurry what has nationals secured communications adviser said the new sanctions are designed to hold rush accountable for what happened to navalney as well as all its actions over the course of this vicious and brutal war that is raged in new crane for two years in clear what that son toy apparently viganoinvail the sanctions package on fridge the question of course is how is that work far because of course the economic sanctions have not done tremendous damage to gotten or his inner circle the the realistic a anger cure is that there are actually things that that bison could do is one of the things that truly amazing about bison he will use executive power to try to cram down i acting mandate on eighty million america using the occupational safety in health administration he will attempt he legally to alleviate student lone at by simply deciding that you no longer have to pay it using his executive power but the one area of america wallet the president does have tremendous outsize power is inform policy and bindberrely uses it he will not do it to shut down the border he will not do it to actually take measures he could take to punish for example the ruffians instead he is weak need and he is weak need because again virtually ever one on all sides in the united states is incredibly divided but the situation lilies is the really not the evil lad repoutents the weakness of the west according to bet seven's writing over than your times he says their four broad approaches that could the critically be used by bison with regard to mouton according to bill broader whose an invested an political actives who has a really shocking book that he wrote about his experiences facing down futon he was a a financier who worked in russia for years and years and years anna and then was targeted because one of his business partner was surgayment risky who is killed in prison by the by the mouton regime it he has a suggestion his suggestion is that you could enact legislation to confiscate frozen russia bank reserves for the defense and reconstruction of you crane theoretically now everybody's been very in willing to do that because they are afraid that there would be a flight from dollar assets if that sort of thing happen with you understand great if you are a foreign actor in your afraid that the united states can a confiscate your money if itself in america dollars this could harm the america dollar that that is a risky move wit that sad you may have to take those sorts of risks if you hope actually punish a dictator theoretically you could back residence in more significant ways and stop stop with these hostage trades viol continue at these hostage trades putting my is just going to take more hostages and finally you could actually do the thing the bison really will not do and that is jack up america production in the oil and natural assentor really each stet up in this is it is an opportunity frankly on for america economy the fact that the fact that rope is now cut off for russia oil supplies would be an opportunity for the united states to jack up into even g production and start shipping all of that stuff over to rope instead jobidon is in thrall to his radical left on the environment that he refuses to do any of that sort of stuff that is more on this in just one moment first grand canyon universities to private

given that he means is to criticize them that he seems to be a fan of on them i are you worry in o on doing the dollar got tigon to to first of all first of all we must be sure that he does not step one foot into the white house not as president or not as anything now we have some one new ad the honor of setting in the white house did not consider it in honor did not consider his oath of office to protect and fend the constitution and on this week speaking out the way he did about nnevony shows you that he is person without dales he looks his going be a person without dollars either but the values of what concern us yes that the dollars a o whet he has going o but i think it is probably financial and this probably financial either something financially as om or something on the come o is announced o speculation about trump and pouted as supposed to actually not slow walking the aid to you crane as gabion has done for literal years taking the middle position on everything and this is the nature of jobidons om hoiden is the president which means this happening on his watch all of the talk about republicans in congress ye republicans and congress amass there is no question about that they cannot tell their as from their elbow i mean that just is that is why they've now rotated through two speakers and a bunch of speaker candidates the course of a year their mass with that is that hoiden is the corn presidents of the united states i notice and it is under join the ucranean invasion took place and is under jobidon that the america will to to baccy crane has fated the power the bully pupil would be a thing but goblin has failed to use it and he is not capable of using it and he has no moral clarity anyway and it turns out that for police issues affect each other when you bands in afghanistan that has impact on what russia does in you crane and by the way when russia sees these sorts of half measures that you are taking wit grad to israel and commons they fell the same way cassia's an open ally of commons a this point the have invited commons to mascot to talk about situation over there and meanwhile the democrats are fully divided on israel and whether to support america democratic ally in the middle east that provides a america with intelligence resources and acts a essentially a land based aerie car air crafts carrier for united states interest in there police and and we are telling them you cannot defend yourselves against come off to the exstenthat you take out compass next in incapacity is it t a that is what t gobidmnistrations completely split on this sort of stuff according to politico the israel commons conflict is opening new rifts in the house democratic caucus with a second congressional progressive packs quitting the group over the war and represented of sheeted to leave ut backing an activist campaign to undermine presidential bide in the michigan democratic primary the new developments underscore that more than four months in israel military operations an goa are still causing a painful rift within the democratic party out hell i mean why what m is is not israel military operations this thing was not initiated by israel is initiated by commas committing the greatest atrocity against news since world war too and yet this is somehow shattering the democratic coalition harshly because of gun the the democratic party is split between their crazy wing and their actual sort of traditional bates which tends to be more proisrael the younger insane generation that has been trained on nonsense by the garbage reporters that the washington post into times they continue to push the bide administration is simply conceive two comas and s what you have is a split inside the administration you will have members of the bye administration out their talking about how the new oppressor on israel and ten you will simultaneously have john carryout their talking about how israel is doing its best to avoid civilian casualties the that their speaking two languages to two different groups of people it is wild and you see these two things comeinto conflict for the democratic party and rush a looks at this an the say look you that can get your act together out the most morally obvious conflict in modern world right now the conflict between again a democratic ally of the united states that was attacked in a fashion that four it sized dwarf's nine eleven and you can you get on board with de extirpating a terrorist group you cannot why would rush oud think that they cannot outlast and and you can see the split and tenancy policy was ripping on benjamininton yah because this is the way the democrats have tried to square the circle they try to suggest that they support israeligius nolignito who the problem is none that ma any sense because the reality is israel has a war cabinet right now they have a unity government right now all the talk about ho being intend yahoo is standing in the way of a palistinian state no the policinuencs have stood thewy of a palistinian state since literally the inception of the peace process the called peace process was which was a joke again diplomacy cannot incept things into reality you cannot just wander your way into piece that not the way any of that works and as i say again the policy of the take of israel with re cards the passion insight not is a unity policy in fact to day israel cannas it voted on a on a proposition that proposition was with regard to the possibility of a palistinian state and what the proposition actually steal as resolution quote israel outright reacts international dictates about a permanent arrangement wit the palistinians such an arrangement will be reached only through direct negotiations between the sides without preconditions israel continue to oppose you in lateral recognition of palistinian state such recognition following the october seven master will be an enormous surprize for terror a prize e lights of which have never been seen and will prevent any future piece agreement that was a resolution a prove by it is now and benny goes is chief rival also worth noting that thing passed in the confessed with ninety nine out of a hundred and twenty boats ninety nine get to that is at that is a universal proposition israel but polls and the left they are trying to appears they are left wing bays by blaming the tonyaho but then that asking obvious question then were you supporting these daily government and they cannot answer that question because again they are constantly splitting the baby is not the into to the you that if you do not what s where's the the pesetas mad her some of what is er i to don't and and you go on supplying them with hod where to do this things you own this operation

absurdity that is not the policy nest who it is the policy of the entire war cabinet and israel has currently lost out two hundred and forty soldiers in gaze when they have complete air superiority the do not you do any of that they are doing that to avoid collateral damage again medic's enemies including iron russia iron china they see america weakness they see western divisions and they are exploiting that weakness and o vision right now which is why who the attacks for example in the red sea are working according to the paltry journal a cargoship is at risk of sinking in the gulf fade and after being hit by yet an base toothy missile the most significant strike since the iron back group started launching attacks last fall the in creasing the audacious attacks come to by weeks of yours air strikes and highlight the challenges of deterring the group you centaur the you have to destroy them ours obviously they are not to turd they are terrorists persistent wo these strikes are raising new questions for the bide administration about how to bring the attacks to halt and prevent the continuing wore in the gotestrip from fueling and worry stabilizing regional conflict the answer there is you let israel destroy its enemies and you destroy your own enemies and that is how you actually win wars but if the lest refuses town wars when its enemies will in just one second we will get to how all this is impacting joint's realize efforts the answer things are not great first president's day is a time to honor the great leaders of the nation who shaped our history and our

inability to make a decision affecting joins poll chances we are not good a new sienna college poll actually has jordan under fifty per cent in new york in new york and by the way this poll is insane it shows that news in new york according this poll i in israel outwit poles will we if it is real or not fifty three per cent of news in new york say they would vote for trump which is an astonishing number that is an astonishing number because remember the vastmajory the jewfish community by jewfish community i mean people who are born into a jewfish family for example are not observant do not care about perish precepts do not care about israel there is a in increasing per senator news wo are realizing that the left really really jurel lot but with that said that is an amazing number usually in everyelection seventy seventy five eighty per cent of news not for the democrats because the vast majority of news are secular left us wo have no relationship wit their religion at all at but according to this polling data gan the suburbs are split thirty nine thirty nine men are are forty seven forty in new york for donate trump according to this senile and to whether that is true or not the bottom line is that jobidon is is in a seriously weakened position in his reelect effort again the the latest had to hell had to head polls between trump and bison continue to show trump with a durable need araskmeson report poll that came out just last week shows trump up six forty seven forty one emersion has him up forty five forty four morning consult has him up forty five forty one in other words hoiden seems to be stuck in the low forties and it there is no body can do to change that especially because again the thing that is reinforcing weakness on the world stages the fact that the present is physically weak it is he is the physical manifestation of his own policies yesterday jobidon was was facing down the stairs of air force one again and at went real poorly is the short stairs stand they start that try to have load on the short stairs that ye has tour stairs to trip on whom et boom twice twice almost trips on the stairs again e keeps falling up the stairs things are going really really well men are a porter ask jobidon if gavenuwsumis gun are place on h ticket and jobidon started speaking safely or something are you ready a look o a worker to you we lower to you e cool i can o to you a i told you i in out on fact on rush give a major practice o on rid fear roll rough a gave he is at aback having new seine's roooooo squirrel things are going amazingly wall for him again the reality is that his vacillation is uncertainty is mouthiness on policy in the foreign realm is hurting the country his wild leftism on policy in the domestic realm is hurting the country and all that comes together in the figure head of an e one year old man who is no longer gentian and trips up the stairs all this is really bat what exactly is bin strategy his strategy's highly trump which means once again folks if you wish dona trump to win on ism somebody who in a trump torso bide race which is dona trump to win if you are trump to win then he needs to ratchet down the crazy the entire campaign for jobidon is going to be donate trump is crazy yes ism old yes ism senile gust my policy sucks but he is totally crazy that is going to be bi in's argument ism not saying that bison is saying that here i we an an reporting that yesterday president biding is ordering his campaign to get far more aggressive when it comes to his likely point this brand new reporting true in ans m jail is that bison personally instructed his top campaignates recently to spent even more time maintain trump as on a hinge and calling out his inflammatory rhetoric to horses tell am a that the thrust than bid's instruction was to significantly ramp up the campaigns efforts to highline the crazy as at that trump says in public an ans m jay is at the wit say asked ford but an't be to early on the west cost that lis m jet you at i i think this reporting gives us some interesting insight in to how the president himself a personally uses his campaign trinity what i was told by strays is are said a president biotin in stropping personally some of his top campaign ate to is mentally even more a massive in high living o some of trompsomast in lavatory and wild moment again that is brain's only strategies the only thing that he can amply at this point which means that is incumbent on trump to say if you were things just let bid just let him wither on the mine out there that is all that is all dona trump has to do don trumpeting interview with lord engram last night on fox news and he said him good things as always there is some good trump in here's some bad trump stop providing material seuronemy's first rule politics do not interrupt youroponents when they are making a mistake here is what trump said hat was good he said he wants a debate with bite now join are not koan given bate he is not going given debate for variety of reasons he is been be able to say that that trump wouldn't give anybody else a debate in the primaries which is true he is alsogoingto say that is not going to debate somebody who who tried to steel the election of twenty twenty after losing in who is hes now going to be con evicted of crimes and and all this kin of stuff that is what bid is going to say but trump consistently calling for debate and by running from one is a bad look for biding here is trump yes t day on on auras so you challenge him to a debate regularly is fora specific topics an other wits with not a wide ranging just one debate i for i all it'll doit when rowan you show on chosen you rig now and i would can do you you can do anybody you want i it'll take anybody from the see an then which is to very poorly in the ratings by the ways you go to in because i think you have an obligation in this case you have an obligation to debate gate that is a good line for trump what is a bad line for trump it is for trump to discourage people from using mail and ballast again have we not learn our lesson at this point if you are the republican party you should be encouraging your people to use mainland ballast and you thing that gets them you vote would be the thing that you should be telling them to do donate trump told people not to vote by mail in twenty twenty and he lost if you told people to vote by mail there is a better than fifty percent chance that you would have won those a very close election in the swing states and republicans refused to vote by mail because donna from told them they should not vote by mail and the probe is this even if ninety per cent to the people that is donate trump told not it vote by mail showed up on pollingdane voted ten percent did not and those votes we are never entered into the ballapox why would you do this the re publicans to one bout victories in places flora where the governor of the state to canthus he actual said yaglovote by mail do at ever yo have to d devote vote legally do we need to do vote early but vote for ox that is how you win but here is nounal trump again downgrading mail ad why why unless your actrigan t fight the law in the quarts and have laws change and overturned about mainland voting you have to play by the rules that are on the fields right now you cannot argue about the rules while the game is in process that is not that is to helpful or useful you means you are going to lose if you do that sort of stuff here is trumpripping and mainland bats lour is trying to save hem by the way that is lot o the interview last night as is is for engram trying to save trump from himself and trump being now ism noria directly into that trad that greatest amazing that do it if you are a man in voting you automatically have from if you have able telling lory you got yours you do not have it when you go in to what you voting place you go in to won an i any properly run state they look at you they give you give motor idea you give all sorts of identified i man it would be very hard to cheat in a match when you send to in ions i californium think this an the thirty six median ballast they do not have a voting booth in the whole place and then minions of ballast come back nobody knows way the coming from i potshot d n it do about it the way you win is by swamping them swamping them with what in day balloting it are not gun o work that is not hawed this works if democrats really up the anti on ballad harvesting instates where it is legal they push mailman voting they are going to win it is s the why why we n that the same the crazy shuffle gan that is just the strategic silliness o gan that that that that makes no sense it is politically foolish encourage your own voters to vote why is the difficult tell your voters to vote however it is legal devote go vote is it not hard can but that is not actually the stuff that that is going to to play into jobidon's argument the dona trump its a crazy person in dona trump he has many things going for him the selection cycle at this point namely jobidon his see nice namely tobidon is an awful president on every front namely he is in fact being persecuted by jobidons department of justice and a while variety of other public officials who misusing an abusing their office to target him all o that is true but it he does not have to do for example compare that to what just happen to electing volley again ism in a keepsaying this because it is true all o the things happening tonal trump are unjust and they are wrong and they are not on the order of him being taken awful plane arrested put in prison and then murdered that is not the same thing e bad they are they are different they are different version to bad and he does he hat to is the rob if he just said that he is being target in fairly it be true if he was saying that it is wrong in abuse of the constitution for the derogated to it doing absolutely true why then go the extra stop of comparing yourself to a guys who as just murdered in russia prison is that helpful forget about whether it is it is true or false is it helpful an here her his trump yesterday doing this now an that isn't new york civil fraud case this judge rather and you on world against you for act almost a h a billycan dollars plot interest that r wrong every day for i first tread as a eighty thousand thousand dollars a day how pul you put up that kind of money if as he a on to put up even if if yo apilyou got a put up it's crib money that a an that is a lot of i lot o nog form of nonoily it is a form of have come in is i or fashion i i the guiding not you have known this for a long time and have set it openly i no jury know anything on gay all that strikes up for it this is a form of the volley in really really e that unnecessary i simpofess it the m on every other thing that he saying there it is that last step that he just cannot stop him and it is because people told him not say that he says it this critique is meant to help don a trump's campaign it is not meant to harming it is meant to tell people the dona trump ought to curb himself because if he does he will win and if he does not he will lose an net it is also true that much of the stuff that the media r portraying as foolishness and craziness anal the stuff will have no impact on the race there is certain stuff that may have an impaction can there tub that will not have n i pact one of things that is noggin to have an impact but that the media made a big deal out of is that over the week ends dona trumpet to something called sneaker conto now this can of stuff it is stupid it is it is laughable but is going a hurt trumpet anyway no is her trump goes to he goes to sneaker con and he is selling golden trump sneakers and a in it is funny at the verily cargo bi this i something i b to en be e twelve years the to years mad i think i e be biniarinfluenc i that be very pop e the ben reallein fluent in and they love and they love what we have done he re this ten the team rock all that by you nowt is that can to haven't eat negative impact on trump you rased bye way the sneakers which were serin for the for her but pair they sold out immediately is a thousand pairs of four under gran on those sneakers now would you wear those round them all no and will they make you run faster trumphire but is that sort of stuff going to going to harm trumps sampan any real way not rally's the other kennostuff that that is problem for donor true i get meanwhile the left continues you demonstrate it is absolute inability to deal with the emigration issue new york city is a full scale disaster area new york city is now i am getting you not they are giving migrant a debit card according it to in a coltelenas writing for the you post major epic atoms is giving out prepaid cascaras to migrants and due apparently it will give migrant up to ten thousand dollars each in tax pair money with no idea check no restrictions no fraud control wygactly give up the credicards here the debicarts the mayors offer said that they were trying to solve a problem it is that migrant staying in hotels do not eat all their food and doc god these city's noted emergency contract for to provide migrant three meals to day throws away up to five thousand meals daily wasting seven point two million dollars a year and the idea is you give them an debicard another going they buy their own meals and it will save you money or alternatively if you want him ten divided people to e legally ma great tell them they come to york city and get a free ten thousand dollar give for doing in the state of flora we give a ten thousand dollar boys to

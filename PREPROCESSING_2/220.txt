when lucia truscott truss to explain how he is related homes jefferson he is as oke he is seventy three he used to visit a great grandmother who used to visit her great grandfather homes jefferson's grandson there was only when i was grown up an up when others of my great grandmother was only one dead purse om the tween me and jefferson when lucid was a boy in the early nineteen fifties just six or seven years old when we visit family in charlottesville sometimes they would drop him off with his brother at monk shallow jefferson's home lucia says it was before the place had been remade for tortious it is today basically visitors wore pay may be a dollar and walk through the house you on my great ant they treated the place it was still the family hall and we had the run o the place we used to full our pockets for of tables from the walk ways up there and go up on tat second floor and er floor was the crawl out windows on to the habitats an a supra the top of on chew and drop table n tor o or walking round the house an on yo very a solo behavior yes and an your talking to one of the probably the only person l over talk to you wife that is actually jump on lava jeffersons there man we we would play on the bed we go through that little doorway and up the stairs in to the closet which is above the there and set u there on the closing one tor came through the room we'd stick our faces out o the wend her u there say woo an scar answer hide on there at i you done know don't we provision it all now now the stud revisions all to ta room o we went through all e end and stuff up there and then of course we play down in the and a basement rooms and then of course what the call the dependent in which were the slave rooms that run under the two wings that on o out from on a chew self whole decades before the slave quarters a part the mount chela tor lucia says these a just empty rooms under the house no furniture ore anything else in them he and his brother would explore and run around and o i no play hide see or whatever little boys jet it is amazing to me that the degree to which it felt a family home did it feel the way he was a kid get el have to tell you that all of this stuff an my family was just taken for gran these days of course nothing about the weggasies of the founding fathers is taken for granted just this week the special committee appointed by the mayor of washington d c caught for removing relocating or contextualizing a month a monuments to slave owning founding fathers incooding' jefferson memorial and the watching monument which by the way the mayor does not actually have jurisdiction over me to the president of course has put his arms around this issue and if try began his reelection campaign he gave his speech at mount rushmore to make war that he does not not to remove any monuments o rename an h buildings or military basis but this great great great whatever it is direct descendent homes jefferson lucia truscott he is had a special perspective on this he led the charge to convince all the other white descendants of comas jefferson to low the black descendants of homes jefferson in to the official family association the black family members of course trace back to jefferson in silly lemmings on to people can slaved lucia thinks that everybody needs to get real about the slave owning passed of some of the founding fathers like how d you all about people taking down monuments of homes jefferson i affect they ought to be taken the i affect that the great on him at the homes jefferson is on a hell and i that its in a appropriate monument because it actually puts jefferson's life in context it puts his slave online as part of his life and in contact hi you visit on a shell to day you get to see were of the slaves live you will be shown for shelliavinc's brother john yid would work and jefferson's bedroom and study of for slaves gilt that i overhear slave beltway when is drawn up but its talked about to day the history about cool this pointers about half deffer on history half slave hi sure at si that appropriate as a memorial it it tells the story of the whole man not just that the the sort of got come jefferson wen walked rase to bettered what a we spent to do with the shameful parts of america pass is being talked about much to day and back in the early days of armidiosio and late nineties when of i contributor her about the history that took that on in this very vivid and complicated way she set out on the road with her sister my to visit the side of a historic tragedy whole then about part the on family hundred sixty years before that and we want to replay at this holiday we cant cause the questions that it addresses h things that it is obsessed with a all much more talked about to day than twenty two years ago when she did that story we o be they chico its this america life on your last we take a road trip into history to day say with us to serve allegory sister my would born in eastern okohoma what was called india territory before statehood that is for a story ans annas a word began the old citizens of the charity nation the parents which usually here is imported to the story here is o the opening line of very story from nineteen ninety eight being at least the little cherokey in northeastern oclahoma is about as rare and remarkable as being a mikhael georgia fan an chico i mean who is it i guessing d on need to explain that antique nineteen into a sports reference to any of you but i i do have one note before we play the rest of the story and it is about the word insane sir asked me to point out any one hearing this today that her grandfather was born in india territory before statehood and use the word inn has term of affection is never derogatory o a so picking up sir's parcheriky goes without saying that my towinsister my is to except that i have dark eyes and dark hair and the is a blue eyed blind and our grandfather nicknamed me insane and her sweet here is amps take on all this i must point out that while my sister and i do not really look alike we sound almost exactly alike i can't for listening to this story ism usually the grouchy one here is my i mean knows rob were assigned to us india and a sweet because of the ay we looked but it was also more the things we were told about ourselves and the know she was the one who was given me a cherry language but on and i was the one who was always told how much alike i was to our sweetish grandmother on and on i think i was probably six or seven or something before i realized that i was cherry too we are a little french and sottish and english and seminal too typical americkin much that the cherokey and sweeter sides of the family were the only etiology's any one knew anything about here is what we knew about ourselves ell's island trail of tears and i think to a kid trail of t ears the cherokees first march from the east to o klahoma where we were born seemed enormously more interesting just as a name even the smallest children know what tears mean and i think in my earliest under standing of where i came from i pictured myself to send end from a long line of lepers with blood shot is the trail of tears between eighteen thirty eight and thirty nine the us army wrenched sixteen thous and pay full from their homes round to them up en to kids and marched them across the country four thousand died every summer when we were chill ran our parents would drive us to a place about half an hour from where we live called jalap which is the cherokey word for cherokee collage is the tribes cultural center there is a recreated village a museum and this was our favorite part and amphitheater which stage to dramatic recreation of the trail of tears every summer we watched chief john boss try mad to save the cherokey land backseat we saw his hot had reveal it anyway ray of to the civil war we especially love the death of the phoenix a noisy me get to lit an her build of wants and which the m the bird would die only to rise again we would get these programs a pro she's and sera was kind of in charge of them and sometimes she would let me look at them she had a whole little file and you know we would look through them and a it was i mean i did take it to hart it was the story that was really tragic i caveat sort of reverence feeling towards it and i think its the was of this play b pay was serious and and told such a detailed story that e can it took this place of significance it was really important bandit really mater here is the measure o how important the ampathyater show was to my an me our father and our grand father used to show us photographs of cherokey leaders an books but even now when i imagine stand way i picture the actor at gala gee all my life i knew i wouldn't exist but for the trail of tears and it struck me as ha little silly that most of the things i knew about it were face on an amp theater drama i have not seen for nearly twenty years at first i thought id read some books about it which i did but then i wanted to see it feel it know how long a track it was i wanted it to be real i enlisted my perhaps she would to do all the driving a historical tragedy and five for teen hour days behind the wheel who could pass that up in i lie from chico thee from montane and one spring morning we find ourselves in a rental car on our way to north western georgia the home land of the cherokee before they were shut d out to oklahoma the place the trail of tears begins the cherokee therotory was an compost most of present taytenesy

many of these lived as civilized southerngentleman of the ear we nineteenth century they owned prospering plantations which meant they owned black slaves more than any other native cameroon tribe the cherokees adopted the religious cultural and politicaliteals of the united states partly as a means to self preservation by becoming more the america they hoped to coexist wit this new nation that was

southern states treated the charokey with the most hostility passed a number of alarming laws in the eighteen twenties an thirties undermining the sovereignty of the nation one of these laws required white settlers within the boundaries of the nation to obtain permit from the state of georgia samiel rooster refuse to apply for such a permit arguing that he had the permission of the charokey to live on their lands and that should surmise georgia arrested was there and imprisoned him for four years whose ahead to the supreme court and the case was driver's georgia became a great victory for the tribe the court under chief just john marshal ruled that the charokee nation was just that a sovereign nation within the borders of the guess and therefore beholding only to the federal government

uphold the constitution anyway the state of georgia was thrilled when jacks thumbed his nose a t the court and immediately dispatched teams to serval the charokey lands for a land lottery soon white settlers arrives here they show up two years later n eighteen thirty four n was the land lottery begin wat georgia soldiers an have gat the lardon lottery get off one small constitutional violation that was part of the land grab georgia seized the cherokeep printing press the could publicize their cause and wen political support in states up north the tribe was divided about what to do stay and fight or demand cash for the land and head west no one exploited the split more than drew jacks and no one annoyed jacks principal chief john boss rob was e refer son in figure in almost every since a founding father of the charokee nation in its modern legal form he preached to liberty while owning slaves an educated gentleman planter he was their cheer from eighteen twenty seven to eighteen sixty six in his later years corresponded wit the graham linen in his early years he was such a believer in the inherent justice of the america system that he lobbied relentlessly in washington d we believing that once the congress and the president under stood that the cherokee where a virtuous sibling republic that they treat the tribe fairly as equals once the state of georgia began a evicting the cherokee and john boss among them boss rote treated dogs we fined our selves fugitives vagrancy an strangers in our own country the vast me comity of the tribe wanted to stay put in supported boss

trail of tigers in theirs were week we are decked were america which means road trip pas tree bumps one minute amnesia the new we want to remember except when we want to forget a we bar we ope why why a we register at the chazan ache the d chat an new a the the it is a hotel now a gloriously hot beautifully restored holiday and in which the lobby is the ornate dome of the old train station an the rooms are turn of the sentry rail cars parked out on the tracks we are in giggles the entire night for the simple reason that the frame chew chew is completely addictive we try to work it into every sentence what shall we do for dinner stay here at the the the we and up going out for bar chi sank is is good but i cannot wait to get back to the who who we watch the piles in our train car commenting is it is me or this chow even better in the who who i sent male from my lap top just that i can write greetings from the chat a new cut the who exclamation point number of times i just send who to seven number of chest for ten can ton sadly we check out of the who the and drive across found to boss's landing it used to be where john roses ferry serves cheritpeople across the tense river but in eighteen thirty eight it was one of the starting points for the water rout of the trail of tears i stand on the sand and read to weather historical marker established about eighteen sixteen by john boss some three hundred seventy yards east of this point it consisted of a ferry warehouse and landing charity parties left from the landing for the west and eighteen thirty eight the same yer the growing community took the name chatanuga stere o can neck ton at all between those to points at som nice e left for the west baby o why a i have not mention that roses landing also functions as chatenewgas tourist center up the hill from the river is the gigantic tennis a aquarium and imam theater the place is crawling with tourists a crowd genarican in distinguishable from one another they swirled around us as a single teacher a hundred sixty years ago thousand of cherishes came through this site in the summer they were forsook to boats an faceted exhaustion and a trout that traded them without water to drink in the fall they headed west by foot the eventually trudging barefoot through blizzards either way they died of starvation disantari dare and fatigue e quarter of the tribe was gone and here in the shadow of the aquarium the trail of verses remembered by a series of quotations from disgruntled made of america carbon to a concrete plaza one of the citations from a cherikee name to dragging cane is from seventeens seventy sits the white men have almost surrounded us leaving us only a little spot o round to stand upon and it seems to be there intention to destroy us as in nation good call wrong were moving diagonally across the side was an hundred jacks in eighteen twenty it is high time to do away with the far of treating with india tribes as separate nations well step on that side was they are symbolic aba broken promises tarmacking that unit sans i here some of the cabers or crack to symbolized in the broken promises made to the indies most america have had this experience most of us connangtins or country's done that we find channel from the travesties everybody agrees were wrong the japan's and turned camps of the late date of slavery's abolition to merkyar partisan argument about legalized abortion or the canola gay world history has been a bloody business from the get but the nail were suffering standing on the broken promises at roses landing is peculiar to a democracy because in a democracy were all responsible for everything our government us this is the letter from rape walk o ember sente president martinvanveran in eighteen thirty eight a crime is projected that confounds our under standings by its magnitude a crime that really deprives us as well as the charity of a country for how could we call the con spirit that should crush these poor indies our government or the land that was cursed by their parting and sing imprecations our country any more you sir will bring down the renown chair in which you sit in ti in to me if your seel is set to this instrument of perfidy and the name of this nation hitherto the sweet omen of religion and liberty we will stink to the world and the path ends with a quotation from an unknown survive of the trail of tears who said long time we travel on way to new land people feel bad when they leave old nation woman's cry and make sad wails children and many men and all look sad when friends die but they say nothing and just put heads down and keep on go towards west many days pass and people die very much we bury close by trail that last passage this specially the part about when friends i bring his to tears and we just stand there look in hock towards the ten see broken hearted meanwhile they're little kids literally walking over these words playing on them making noise having fun we are to hate them for a second we ask a teacher who with a group of far greater why she is not talking to them about charity history and she says normally she wood but it is the end of this school year an this trip is their reward for being good sounds reasonable i ask an if she thinks these kids should share our sadness well i i think it is a sad story it is mean it sorta the hollicost just you do not have to be you i to think that that is o definitely as sad part of history and i thin the trail tears is you know an merit his version if inside and wen it really t started it over there you look were but the hit such ten still i cannot the my eyes off those children i envy them i wanted join them ism an mad person i had been to an i man theater just weeks before i wanted to come on this trip to get a feel for this trail that made us but standing here at boss's landing in his me how crazy that is suddenly the only thing i get out of it is rage why should we keep going do not know i do not know why i do not know why were here i seriously do not i know it is an interesting story yes we are always in tested in our past but i do not e comedos i wonder when good comes on that do not some i do not think it makes me a more cantina bursting it all info ti think i feel really haunted by all of this and i feel very find way down by the pain part of me thinks this hoping is is a mistake and and maybe i feel more knowing about it but i i mean it is not this is a sorry where the more the better your feet noel feel is just the ofpisit the more i learn the worse i feel i the more hatred i feel towards this country that i still loves and therefore the more conflicted and tit is the most i just feel all this anger everything in her standing o the stupid a quarry an bill the talking to to hard gods were do surrounding now there is a collapse and i me not i do not know now i just feel i feel worse i feel worse there are only many hours the human being can stomach unfocused dread i was tired and confused and to press and i needed the kind to rest but that can only come from focused resentment in the trail of tears await if there is one person your allowed to hat at angry jacks the architect of the india removal policy and since the trail of tears pass through nail anyway we stop in his plantation the hermit we tar air awol on er sis her en her the enemy's bedroom that is in a minute from scockabublegradio went our program continues it is a smart con life from our glass to day a program about the past and what to make of the past we continue with the story of sir vow an her sister my who are retracing the path of the trail of tears they have just arrived if remember for the break at the home of the president responsible for the trail somebody they hate and intend to keep hating drew jacks who insinoey is that when a president trumps favorite presidents a present turn place jackpot's portrait in the oil office he spoke id jackpot's home to commemorate the tenured fifty of anniversary of jackpot's birth in that speech you called out jacks as a people's president himself out for the common man somebody who defied the political class of his day it was during the revolution that jacks first confronted and defied an arrogant fleet does that son familiar the i wonder why they keep talking about truck an jacks jacksonant true i know the feel egandrew i a point out earlier that to day's proem mas resprocast in nineteen ninety eight in the up sincere anomy visited jackpot's home they have dated the exhibits the must there include exhibitions slaves and or native america removal said jacks an asked there is not er toward the focuses entirely on the enslave people who live there again from our original story her her awol the house and museum are close to the public when we arrived because of astonishing tornado damage pardon me wanted to destroy angry jacks and everything representable seeing all those hack to trees made me fee some one had beaten me to the punch i look at it an the trees or dare the wrath of god inside there is no display mentioning india removal because remarkably there is no display about jackpot's president set caroling bracket showed us surround the house a columned into vellum mansion that looks across between grace land and tea unfortunately for my spite spree i liked caroling bracket i felt bad former she would point into the library an say jacks subscribed to a lot of newspapers before his death and i say was one of them the checked phoenix she was not sure she wanted to show off the mansion's painstaking restoration all of e the rains that i have original wall paper all of the paper was conserved and had to be claimed with i a i all i sir the size of a pencil or i sir moi was quite an undertaking ism the portrait of jacks was finished nowadays before his death o i thinking he has o there antler of his life and that portrait ism the one i that he looks his stick in his ad at a care you see a bring om at his heart at caroling guides us pass the flower garden plan tod by jackpots lie rise and into the family graveyard there are a few pi day headstones and line graorome an monstrosity with an novelist rising from the center money guess which when in these graces jhacsehe actually have this design for richer and left ring for himself and o these for other family members i pull a book out of my back pack a book with the subtitle drew jacks in the subjugation of the america india caroling and and exchange a worried look well ism start ism standing here on em am standing here on drew jackpot's grave an there as part of me as a person of partly cherry sent that what it mightn't dance on it u no there's am a letter that a jacks jacks wrote in about the this the removal of the southeastern tribes and this is his opinion on the on o the south eastern tribes leaving their land doubtless it will be painful to leave the graves of their fathers but what do they more than our ancestors did north our children are doing to better their condition in an unknown land our forefathers left all that was dear in earthly objects our children by thousands yearly leave the land of their birth to seek new homes distant reasons and ten in in am can it be cruel in the government wen by event which it cannot control the india is made discontent in his enchant home to purchase his lands give him a new and extensive territory to pay the expense of his removal and support him a year in his new abode how many thousands of our own people would gladly embrace the opportunity of removing to the west on such conditions wen there is something or something start of nutty about old hickory in this passage just the back that that i that he just thinks w well took compare that removal of indies from the land they opportunity of his generation to just go at west do you think i mean what do you make of thank can you help me understand that mind sat probably not i having the interesting thing about that er was that the they really felt that they were preserving i this is haw tit just about it in their own minds i was that they were actually have been preserve it that this was inevitable i it was sort of early thought of manifest destiny that it was inevitable that this would happen i at the interesting my to me as i never seemed to think that we were gin a settle but country all the way to the wast all the way to calorie if the just kept moving everybody further way that would suddenly gut to a point where there was not into beans settlement which of course did not happen an we drive on into contucky towards hoping will when the trail of tears passhrough southern contucky an remember of eighteen thirty eight a traveller from main happened upon a group of cherokey he wrote we found them in the forest by our roadside camped for the night under a sever fall of rain a companies by a heavy wind canvas per a shield again the inclemency of the weather and the called wet ground for resting place after the fatigue of the day they spent the night several were then quite ill an an aging man we were then informed was in the last struggles of debt even aged females apparently ready to drop into the grave for travelling with heavy burdens attached to the back and the sometimes roman ground in the sum times muddy streets with no covering for the feet except for what nature had given them we learned from the inhabitants on the road where the indies path that they buried fourteen or fifteen at every stopping g john boss's wife died in a place this in winter of pneumonia she had one blanket to protect herself from the weather and she gave at to a six child during a sleet storm panthers is more in gets worse i always knew the cherokey own slaves that they owned them in the east and that they owned the in the west only in the corse of this road trip did it occur to me that the slaves got to india territory in the same manner as their masters on the trail of tears can you imagine as if being a slave was not bad enough to be a slave to a tortured india ma to walk halfway across the continent day three hoping still we stopped here because it was on the map but pulling into town we sawsiins for a trail of tears memorial park we did not know about en seen a good idea to go there you mark er and if we bother he a second a w had me about what the origin of this place is in we why there's a park here and how it came about o the feel was a washout stop along the way he tray of tears and the crikey camp ere we were here for we or while they were here tother chief ta and they bury upon the heel sad stark here and walk up to the grabber they're our the longs place on e one of the pose the last were just before you another grab were tell you about the to cheers white path clansmen the place nearest the grave says that white path was one of the choke who for under drew bacon in eighteen fourteen a the battle of horseshoe ben jacks even gave white path a watch for his bravery in that battle a cherokey saves jackpot's life we chance at the level of jackpots betrayal of the tribe had a cherokee not saved his life then whit path and fly smith might note buried here beneath our feet the graves are up on a little hill he can hear the highway down below but still its serene up an till this moments all the graves along the trail had been metaphorical all through tennessee an and i kept saying were driving over graves were driving over graves but even then we just imagined them there under the black top off in the woods but here the skeleton suddenly had faces pacific stories the graves were real i took the cherokey about six hunts to walk to oclahoma we are doing it in five days every ten minutes we cover the same amount of ground they covered in a day we drive with the sun in our eyes on back roads through kentucky we dropped into a remote section of down state illinoischicago and spare to trad a place marks ta spot where thousands of cherokey camped unable to cross the mississippy because of floating ice we cross it an under a minute in know we are going fast but it does not feel fast we plowed through more of missouri stopping yet another trail of tear state park here is actually a name for what we are doing it is called heritage tourism we sound grand its get to be one freaking a piffany after another but after a while we just read the sines without even getting out of the car at the end of every day we fall into our motel beds rest day for in the morning we plough through organ saw we get to faetvill in the afternoon we have lunch with two old roommates of mine radar lalawnie we take just to a little trail of tears marker next to a high school parking lot that looks black o on this sit in the summer of eighteen thirty nine there camped one thousand cherishes men women and children and rout to there signs facing a and my circular arantiment of borders any one who is ever been to high school would recon nice it immediately as the place students go to sneak cigarette or get stoned and once again it is striking how the two america tendencies exist side by side to remember our past and to completely ignore it and have fun we get how we treat all our national holidays do not we morn the dead on memorial day with volybal and sun screen do not we the people commemorate the forth of jury by setting meat and bottle rockets on fire with makes a lot of sense when you remember that a phrase as weird and whimsical as the pursuit of happiness sits right there in the second sentence of the founding document of the country o a chemist tapping less i find on the trip as when we are in the car and i can wear the chuck bury take by brought we drive the trail where thousand died and i listen to the musical think what are we supposed to do with the grizzly past i feel a right o anger an bitterness about every his stoical fact of what the america nation did to the charity but at the same time ism an entirely america creature ism in love with this song in the country that gave birth to it a o a a a ha to aka a listening to backing you as are while driving the trail of tiers i turn it over and over in my head it is a good country it is a bad country good country bad country and of course it is not e a a we o a ad o e oak and native america at ember the ones in n thing they to stay ochone is o a a it is about within an o thinking a cross the take line were in the western cherikee nation an the maddening thing the heart breaking cruel sad cold fact is that northeastern oglahomu look exactly north western georgia same old trees same old grassy farm land the charokey walked all this way cross rivers suffered blizzards buried their did and all for what the same old land they left we breeze through talcum the crikey capital even though the trail of tiers a facially stops there our trail will not be over until we get to our home town rags it is about twenty minutes away and we plan on spending the evening with our aunts and uncles there a wont a a tike to my uncle john my mother's brother it seventy for he is my oldest living relative i asked him about his great grandfather peter parson who came to oklahoma on the trail of tears twelve your not an he of a he he got up ere from we've your no and he was a stop ma an that ism o lis work

when we ere driving i just kept imagine the kidding where are we going wherever we going what is happening and i guess have been start of thinking about what it really must have been like have been thinking about those kids too but the person i identify with most in this history is john boss the principal chief during the trail of tears because he was caught be tween the two nations he believed in the possibilities of the america constitution enough to make char the cherish had one to he believed in the liberties the declaration of independents promises and the civil rights the constitution an sees and when the you ass be prayed not only the crikey but its own creed i would guess that john boss was not only angry not only outrage not only con fuse i would guess that john boss was a little broken hearted because that is how i feel have been experiencing the trail of tears not as the charity but as an america john rig one of the miners of the treaty of new a coda once to besides

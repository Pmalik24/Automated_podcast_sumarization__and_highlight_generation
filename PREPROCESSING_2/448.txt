welcome to the superman loan science science tace to we for i manner superman and on a professor of nerbilogy and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day my guest is doctor jack headman doctor jack headman is a distinguished professor of nerbilogy at the university of talifornia lost angels he is known for his pioneering work on the hero science of breathing we are all familiar with breathing and how essential breathing is to life we require oxygen and it is only by breathing that we can bring oxygen to all the cells of our brain and body however as the work from doctor headman and colleagues tells us breathing is also fundamental to organ health and function at enormous number of other levels in fact how we breathe including how often we breathe the depth of our breathing and the ratio of inhales to exhales actually predicts how focused we are how easily we get into sleep how easily we can ex it from sleep doctor headman gets credit for the discovery of the two major brain centers that control the different patterns of breathing to day you will learn about those brain centers and the patterns of breathing they control and how those different patterns of breathing influence all aspects of your mental and physical life what is especially wonderful about doctor headman and his work is that it not only points to the critical roll of respiration in disease in health and in daily life but he is also a partition er he understands how to leverage particular aspects of the breathing process in order to by as the brain to be in particular states that can benefit us all whether or not you are a person who already practise his breath work or whether not your somebody who simply breathes to stay alive but the end of to day's discussion you are going to understand a tremendous amount about how the breathing system works and how you can leverage that breathing system toward particular goals in your life doctor headman shares with us his own particular breathing protocols that he uses and he suggests different avenues for exploring respiration in ways that can allow you for instance to be more focused for work to disengage from work in high stress endeavors to calm down quickly and indeed he explains not only how to do that but all the underlying science in ways that will allow you to customize your own protocols for your needs all the guests that we bring on the superman lad podcast are considered at the very top of their fields today's guest doctor headman is not only at the top of his field he founded the field prior to his coming into narrow science from the field of physics there really was not much information about how the brain controls breathing there was a little bit of information but we can really credit doctor headman and his laboratory for identifying the particular brain areas that control different patterns of breathing and how that information can be leverage towards health high performance and for combating disease to day's conversation you are going to learn a tremendous amount from the top researcher in this field hit is a really wonderful and special opportunity to be able to share his knowledge with you and i know that you are not only going to enjoy it but you are going to learn a tremendous amount before we begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate for my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire an effort to bring zero cost consumer information about science and since related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens a lentic greens is an a in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens on the reason i still take athletigreens once or twice to day is that helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which our vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called got microfilm and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essential with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens i get the vitamins i need the minerals i need end the phobics to support my microfilm if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock come slash supermen and claim a special offer the will give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin d the k too the are ton of at and now showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if wore getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient in vitemend three and k too is also important because it regulates things carvascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic greenstone come slash supermen to claim the special offer of the fie free travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar have talk many times before on this podcast about the key roll of hydration end electrolytes for nerve self function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium and potassium present in the preparations all of those cells function properly and all our bodily system can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration end that your getting the preparations of electrolytes if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element do come slash supermen and you'll get a free element sample pack with your purchase there all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to element element do come slash supermen one quick mention before we dive into the conversation with doctor freedmen during to days episode we discuss a lot of breastwork practices and by the end of the episode all the s will be accessible to you however i am aware that there are number of people out there they want to go even further into the science and practical tools of breath work and for that reason i want to mention of resource to you there is a cost associate with this resource but it is a terrific platform for learning about breastwork practices and for building a number of different routines that you can do or that you could teach it is called our breastwork collective ism not associated with the breastwork collective but doctor headman is an adviser to the grew and they offer daily live guided breathing sections and an condemn library you can practise any time fretwork shops on breath work and these are really developed by experts in the field including doctor headman as i mention ism not on their advisereboard but i do know them and their work and it is of the utmost quality any one wanting to learn or teach breastwork could really benefit from this course i believe if you to learn more you can click on the link in the show notes or visit our breath collective doc calm slash supermen and use the coat superman at checkout and if you do that they will offer you ten dollars off the first month again it is our breath collective dock calm slash supermen to access the our breath collective and now for my conversation with doctor jack headman thanks for joining me today it is he pleasure beer that is been a long time coming you are might go to source for all things respiration i mane i breathe on my own but when i will not understand how i breathe and how the brain and breathing interact you are the person i call he'll do my best as there is a lot that we do not understand which still keeps we employed in engage but tho we do no a lo when we start off by just talking about what is involved in generating breath and if you would could you comment on some of the mechanisms for rhythmic breathing verses nonrhythmic breathing o k on the mechanical side which is obvious every one we i want a a flow in an hail and we need have a a flow out and the reason we need to do this is because for body went taboliswhom we need oxygen and when oxygen utilize to the met probe metabolic process we produce monoxide and we have to get rid of the condo id the we produce in particular because the comndoxide effects the s o base balance to the blood the p h and all living sells our very sensitive to what the age value is your body is very interest and a regulating that p we have to have enough oxygen for our nomometabolism and we have to get rid seal to the re produce how d we generate the sallow well they're comes into the runs we have to expand the runs and its the lungs expand facial is a balloon that you would pull spot the pressure inside that balloon drops and er will flow into the blow we exam pull a pressure on put pressure on the run to pull it papa the lots the p pressure in the airlocks called a vial and air will flow in because pressure outside the body is hire than pressure inside the body when your doing the expansion when you inhale it what produces that while the principal muscle is a the diaphragm which is sitting inside the body just below the long and when you one a in hail you basely contract the diaphragm and pulls it down and is o pulls it down its inserting pressure forces on the long the long on to expand at the same time the rib cage is going to to take up and out and therefore expanding the cavity the thrash cavity at the end of inspiration an the normal conditions when your arrest you just relax and is pulling on a spring you pulled on a spring and you let go in a relax of ion anal and you exile know relax in exile the exile is passive i at resist passive will get into what happens when you need to increased of the amount of an you bringing in because your ventilation yon me tables and goes up doing exercise o now the muscles themselves fella muscles do not do anything unless then nervous system tells them to do something and when the nervous system tells them to do something they contract there as special eyes neurons in the son chord and above the sponachor the region called the brainstorm which go to respiratory muscles in particular for inspiration the diaphragm and the external the castle muscles in the rib cage and they contract o these respiratory muscles these inspiratory muscles become active in h coactive for a period of time than they become silent and when they become silent the muscles tend relax back to their original resting level where does that activity in the these neurons that innovate the muscle which are called diner ans wires that originate well this was ta question that been banding around for thousands of years and when i was a beginning a system professor it was fairly high priority for me to trying figure that out because i want on the stand where this rhythm a breathing was coming from and you could not nowhere incoming from into you knew where was coming from and i i phrase that probably you couldn't understand how was being done until were ta look we did a lot of experiments which i can go into detail and finally down there was a region in the brains them that once again this region sort of above the spare cord which was critical for generating this them is called the rebut singer complex and we could talk about how i was name this small sight which contains inhuman a few thousand anurans it is located on either side and works anta them an every breath begins with anurans in this region beginning to the active and knows grans then connect ultimately to these modinurans going to the diaphragm and to the external the castles causing i to be acted in causing this inspector effort when the anurans in the presbyter complex finish their burst of activity then inspiration stops and then you begin to exile because of this passive o recoil of the long and ribcage could i a just briefly interrupt you o ask a few quick questions cover of we move a forward in this a very informative i answer and the the two questions are om is there anything known about the activation of the diagram in the intercostal muscles between the ribs as it relates to nose verses mouth breathing or are they activated o in the equivalent way regardless of we the not some one as breathing through their nose or mouth i i do not think we fully have the answer to that clearly there are differences between nasal and mouth breathing a at great that tendency is to do nasal breathing because the air flows that an necessary for normal breathing as easily a manage by passing through the nasal cavities however when your ventilation needs the increase doing exercise you need to move more air you do that through your mouth because the airways o much larger than and therefore you can move much more air but it the level of the intercostals and the diaphragm the contraction i is not is almost a agnostic to rather not the nose and mouth are open ora the i finishing correctly am there is no reason to suspect that there are particular perhaps even non overlapping sets of anurans in rebut singer very of the brain stem that trigger nasal versus mouth in has no i would say that the is tit is not that the prebutsin complex is not concerned and can not influence that but it does not appear as if there is any a modulation of whether or not as where the air is coming from with us coming through nasal passages of through your mouth thank you and then the other question i have as that these intercostal muscles between the ribs that move the the ribs up and out if i ashcan rely and the diagram a are those skeleton or as the brits would say skeletal a muscle or smooth muscles what type of muscle a re talking about here as as i spider earlier these a scelledem insayto ascend muscles but their muscles that need nobly put in order to move you talked about smooth muscles w they specialized muscles we have in the got and in the hat and these a muscles that a capable of actually contracting and relaxing on their own the hart beats it does not need nobly put in order to beat it the nobly put modulate the strength of it in the frequency but they beat on their own the sell the muscles involved in breathing are neednorlymput now there are smooth muscles that have an influence on breathing and these muscles that alining the the always and the always have smooth muscle and when they become activated the smooth muscle can contract or relax and when they contract in appropriately is when you have problems breathing an spa as mas a condition we get inappropriate constriction of the smooth muscles of the airways there is no reason to think that in asthma that the robot singer or these other neuronal enters in the brain that codthat active breathing that they are involved or causal for for things asthma as of now i would say the preponderance of evidence that it is not invade but we have not really fully investigated that thank you sorry to break your fly o but was terribly interested in and knowing answers those questions any provided them thank you know remind me again where i was in my w were just landing and robot singer and we will return to the naming of robot singer because it is a wonderful an important story really to i think people should i beware of but at many could march us through the brain centers that you have discovered a and others have worked on as well if that control breathing prat singer as well as be characters we when we discovered the prebutsinger we thought that it was the primary same of all rhythmic respiratory movements both inspiration and expiration a the od notion of a single source is they are night it is they are all coming they are of the same margin at the earth rotates and day follows night and we thought that the pressing of complex would the inhalation elation a and then in the series of experiments we a did in the early part of two thousand we discovered that the seemed to be another region which was dominant an producing excretory movements that is the execution we had made a fundamental mistake through since with the discovery the prebusinger not taking into account that at rest excretory musical activity your exculpation is passive if that is the case a group of anurans that might generate act of expiration that is to contract the excretory muscles the abdominal muscles of the internal into castles are just silent we just thought it was not there was coming from one place but we got evidence that in fact it may been coming from another place and following up on this experiments we discovered that there was i second oscillator and that oscillator is involved in generating what we call active expiration that is this actively wish the or wen begin to exercise after and action move that ere out this group of selves which is silent the dress suddenly becomes active to drive those muscles and it appears that it is independent oscillator when a maybe we just clarefivor be what an oscillator is lookanan oscillator is something that goes in a cycle you can have a pendulum is an oscillator going back and forth the earth is an oscillated because it goes around and say and night some people's moods a oscillating oscillate and it depends how regular they are you can have oscillates the highly regular that a in a watch or you can have those that are operatic or episodic breathing is when of those oscillators that for life has to be working continuously twenty four seven its thoughts in laid in the this master because it has to be working when your born and basically works throughout life and if it stops if there is no intervention beyond the few minutes it pul likely be fatal what is this a second oscillator called well we found that on in a region around the facial nucleus we initially but when this region was initially identified it we thought it was involved in sensing covendoxideor as what we call central sumo receptor that is we want to keep monoxide levels particularly in the brain at a relatively stable level cause the brain is extraordinarily sensitive the changes in p h if there is a big shift in scomdoxide to be ash big shift in brain p h and tatithor your brain if i can use the technical term out of wack and you want to regulate that the way to regulate something in the brain is you have a censor in the brain and a others basely identified that the eventual surface of the brains them that is tear the brains the that is on this side a was critical for that and then we a identified of structure that we a was near the trapizoy nucleus it was not named in any of these noranatomical thesis we just pick the name at the hat and we called it the retire trapisoy nucleus ashy clarfivorbele when we when a jackesan trapazoy does not can the trapezoid muscles trapeze refers to the shape a of this nuclystis cluster of anurans a parafatial makes me think that this general areas involved in something related to mouth or face a is it an area rich with a nurse's controlling other parts of the face i blanks nose which is o lip curls lips mass if you go back in evolutionary sense and a lot of things that are hat to figure out begin to make sense when you look at the evolution of the nervous system when a control of facial muscles going back to more primitive creatures because they had to take things in their mouth for eating they recall that the in the face sort of developed the eyes where they are the mouths there these nuclei the motion that contained the mote anurans a lot of the control systems for them developed in the immediate vicinity if you thing about the face there is a lot of subdual around there that had serious souls at various different times in evolution and at one point in evolution the facial muscles were probably very important in moving fluid in and out of the mouth and ma moving air in n but of the mouth and part of that of these many different of nuclei now seems to be in camels to be involved in the control of excretory muscles but we have to remember that camels of very special when it comes to breathing because wite the only class of vertebrates that have a diaphragm if you look an infibians and reptiles they do not have a daphrame and the way they breathe is not by actively inspiring and passively expiring they breathe by actively expiring and passively inspiring because they do not have my powerful inspetwe muscle and somewhere along the line the diaphragm developed and there lots of theories about how it developed on nothing its particularly clear there was they a a something you confined and alligators and lizards that could have turned into a muscle the was o diet to diaphragm the making thing about the diaphragm is that it is mechanically extremely efficient and what do i mean by that both if you look at how oxygen gets from outside the body into the blood stream the critical passage is across the membrane in the lung cold the alula salary membrane the alibis is part of the lung and the blood runs through capillaries which these the smallest tubes in the circulatory system and it is at going oxygen can go from the pail alias into the a blood which is amazing i find that amazing even though it is just purely mechanical ye ad y to it these little sacks on our lungs we inhale on the air goes in and lately the oxygen can pass into the blood stream pastis into the clutching but there the made of which it passes will depend on the characteristics of the membrane how what the distance is between the anvils and of the blood vessel capillary but it the key element is the surface area the big of the surface aria the more oxygen that can pass through it is entirely a passive process there is no magic about making oxygen to in now how do you get a pack a large surface are in a small chest we u start out with one tube which is the trace the trace expands now you have two tubes then you have for tubes and it keeps branching at some point at the end of those branches you put a little bit a little sphere which is now veils and that determines what the surface aria is going to brig be now you then have a mechanical problem you have the surface aria you have to be able to pulpit of port imagine you have a little square of plastic membrane it does not take a lot of force to poet apart but now if you increase it by fifty times you need a lot more force to poet apart infibians who were breathing not by compressing the lungs and then just passively expanding it were not able to generate a lot of force they have relatively few branches if you look at the surface are that they pack in their lungs rotative to their body size it is not very impressive were when you get to mama's the amount of branching that you have is you have fort or five hundred million anvil how if we were to take this fort of five million of a fie million foe hundred for of hundred hundred millions use me on and lay those out flat what sort of surface marry are we talking about seventy square meters which is about a third the size of a tennis court you have a membrane inside of your third desire in a tennis court that you actually have to expand every breath and you do that without exerting much of a you feel and that is because you have this amazing muscle f the diagram which because of its positioning just by moving two thirds of an inch down is able to expand that membrane enough to move air into the logs now the the at least the value of air in your lines is about two and a half leaders do we need to convert that to quartz no that is about to and a half leaders when you take a breath you taken another five hundred millers a half leader that is the size may be a list of my fist your increasing the volume by twenty per cent but your you doing that by pulling on this seventy squad met a membrane but that is enough to bring enough fresh air into the long to mix in with the air that is already there that the onion levels in your your blood stream goes from e partial press of oxygen which is forty milimitos of mercury to a hundred milimuson mercury that is a huge increase in on and that is enough to sustain no metabolism we we have this amazing a mechanical advantage by having a diaphragm do you think it that our brains are larger than that of other mammals in part because of the amount of oxygen that we have been able to bring into our system i would say a key stop in the ability to develop a large brain that has a continuous the men for oxygen is the diaphragm without a diaphragm you are an imbibe and there and and the there is another solution to increasing onion up take which is the way birds breathe but birds have other limitations and the still cannot get brains as big as a mama's have we we the the brain utilizes may be twenty per cent of all the oxygen that we take and it needs it continuously you cannot the brain does not when to be neglected this put certain demands on breathing system and other words you cannot shut it down for a while which poses other issues you are born and you have to mature you have the small body you have a small on you have a very point rib cage and now you have to development an adult which has a stiffer rib cage and the changes happening in your brain in your body we are breathing the normal control of breathing has to change on the fly it is not for things vision a where you have the opportune to sleep and while your sleeping the brain is cable of doing things that a not easy doing doing gratefulness the construction true comes en during sleep a breathing has been the change of breathing i describe as trying the build an airplane why its fall is flying busy win jack saying is dead on respiration science is more complex and hard working than vision science which is a direct habit me u that some of you might have missed but i definitely don't miss and i appreciate that you always o a take the opportunity a good new yorker to to yo to give me a good healthy a intellectual jab a question related to diaphragmatic breathing verses non diaphragmatic breathing because the way you describe it the diagram is always involved but over the years whether it be for you yoga glass or a breath work saying or you here on line that we should be breathing with our diaphragm that rather than lift in our ribcage when we breathe an our jest that it is healthier in our quotes or better somehow to have the belly expand when we inhale ism not aware of any particular studies that really examined the direct health benefits of diaphragmatic verses non diaphragmatic breathing but if you do not mind commenting on anything you are aware of a as it relates to diaphragmatic verses non diaphragmatic breathing whether not people tend to be diaphragmatic breathers by default et camera that would be i think interesting to a number of people by thing by default we are obligate diaphane breathers i am there may be mythologies where the diaphragm is compromise and you have the us are the muscles and that is a challenge i it certainly at rest other muscles can take over but if you need to increase of ventilation the diaphragm is very important put heart t increase orventillation otherwise do you pay attention to whether not you are breathing in a manner where your belly a it goes out a little bit as you inhale because i can do it both ways right i can inhale bring my belly in or i can inhale push my i disarm and belly out not the diagram out but in that is interesting right because it is a completely different muscles sat for each a each version a i in in the contacts of things breath practice ism a a bit i a agnostic about the effects of some of the different patent are breathing clearly some ogonect works of different mechanisms we can talk about that but at sodden level for example whether it is primarily diaphragm where you move your basement or not i am agnostic about it i think that the changes that that breathing in uses in emotion an cognition i have different ideas about what the influences and i do not see that primarily as how which particular muscles your choosing but that just to be my own precious ora i were we will return to that as a general theme an will bit i i ant to ask you about sighing i one of the ma any great gifts that you have given us over the years a is an understanding of these things that we call physiological size am can you tell us about physiological size o what is known about them what your particular interest in them is and a what they are good for thy a very interesting an important question everyone has a a sense of what a sigh its we certainly when we're emotional emotional and some ways wit stars we particularly happy will take a will sigh it turns out that were sighing all the time and ut when i would ask people and not particularly knowledge that haven read my papers for names the this book or listen to your pod cast a there usually off by to what is a magnet to about how frequently we side on the low side motherwort they s at once an hour o ten times a day we sigh about every five minutes and i would i encourage anyone who finds that to be the unbelievable fact s to lie down in a quiet room and just breathe normally just relax just let go and just pay attention to your breathing and you find that every couple of minutes your takin a deep breath and you cannot stop it it it just it just happens now why it we have to go back to the long again the long has these five hundred million of your line and the very tiny the two hundred machines across for the really really thing and you can think of them is fluid fill their fluid line and the reason of fluid line has to do it the a esoterica of the mechanics of that it makes it a easier to stretch them with this fluid line which is called fasten as a fact that is important during development at is a determining factor in the when premature infants o born if they i not do not have lungs of fact and that makes a much more challenging to take care them than after t o have lungs of fact an which is some time for remember correctly in the late second early fir trimester wish would appears in any cases fluid line now think of a balloon that you would blow up but now before you blow it out fill the bloom o water squeeze a had warder out and now o when you please all the water out you notice the size an a balloon stick to each other why is that but that is because water has whits call surface tension and when you have two surfaces of water together they actually tend to stick to each other now when you try and blow that be loon of that it or you will notice if you even done it before that the balloon is a little hard at to in late then if we are dry on the inside why is that because you have to overcome that surface tension well you'll veal have a tendency to collapse there is five hundred million in them they not collapsing at a very high rate but it is a slow rate it is not trivialand when it alleles collapses it no longer can receive ox a gin or take common side out it is hat a taken out f the curation now to have five hundred million in em in you lose ten no big deal but if they keep collapsing you can lose a significant part of the surface of you long now normal breath is not enough to pop them open but if you take a deep breath it house am oo through noassoanouth a gas's or it is just increase that long volume cause you are just pulling on the longs they pop open give not every five minutes i and with doing it every five minutes in order to maintain the health of our on in the early days of mechanical ventilation which was used to treat polio victims who had the weakness of their respiratory muscles they be put in these big feel tools and the way they would work is that the pressure outside the body would drop that would put a expansion pressure on the the longs ixia on the ribcage the riparian expand and then the long would expand and then the pressurewould go back to homo and the long an relation go back to noma there was a this was great for getting ventilation but there was a relatively hind mortality rate with a bit of a mystery and one solution was to just give bigger breath they get bigger breath in a mentality rate drop and it was not til i think it was the fifties with they realize that they did not have to increase every breath to be big but they needed to does every often to have one big breath you've a couple of minutes a normal baths and then one big breath just mimicking the physiological size and than the vitality rate drop significantly and if you see some one on event ventilator in the hospital if you watch every couple of minutes tat you see the remembering move up and down every couple o minutes to be a superbreath and that pops it open there these mechanisms for these physiological size just but the collapse to the lungs where you need a big a pressure to pop it open it is the same thing with the anvil younger a bigger or essay and e normal breath is not enough we have to take a big nihil and when nature is done is instead of requiring us to remember to do it it does it automatically and it does it about every five minutes and one of the questions we want it we asked is how is this happening why every five minutes what is what is doing it and we got into it to a back door at typical of the way lot of science gats tons is serin digits o a a then when you run across o paper and something elects and you just we you follow it up sometimes to go down blind ends but this tuned out to be incredible e productive one of the guise on y lay up was reading the paper about stress and during stress lots of things happened in the body one of which is that type osalenis which is very reactive the body state releases petites which are specialized molecules which then circulate throughout the brain and body that particular effects usually to help to better with theatres and one class of the peptize the release o cobomisin related septets and he also realized because he was a breathing guy can we distress you si more we said a right may be there related bombisin is relatively cheap to body we said let us by som bombisin throw it and the bring then let us see what happens and you the when the nice things about some experiments that we try to design is to fail quickly here we had the idea we throw bombison in and if bombs did nothing not nothing loss may be fifty dollars to by the bombison but if it did something it might be of some interest we one afternoon he did the experiment and he comes to me says i want quote exactly what he said because the a might need to be censer but he said look at this and it was in a rat rats side bat every two minutes if smaller than we are in the neath to sign were often this pirate from when from twenty to thirty per hour to five hundred per hour when he put bombs into the prebuzin complexisit and the way did that is he took a very very fine class needle and a nest a ties a rat and inserted that needle directly into the prebutzior complex it wasn't generalized the livery the peptide was localized to the prebutzigar the sprat went through the roof and i would a add that wasn't important experiment to deliver the bombisin directly to that site because one could have concluded that the injection of the bomisan increased sign because it increased stress rather than directly increase singing amongst hundreds of other possible interpretation the precision here is very important and that goes back to what i said at the very beginning knowing where this as happening allows he to do the proper investigations if we dint know were the inspiratory wither is originating we never could have done this experiment and then when we did another experiment we said o ka what happens if we take the cells in the prebutzinger that a responding to the peptide horns will respond to a peptide because they have specialized receptors for that peptide and not every noria expresses those receptors in the prelusive complex probably a few hundred out of thousands we use the technique we had used before and this is the techno the developed by dug lapping down in santiaco were you could take a peptide in conjugated with a mole called apron saran is a plan thrive molecule which is a cousin to iceland and many of your listeners may have heard of rice and pessimal to it it is very nasty it is it a single you know stab with an umbrella will kill you which is say oh something that supposedly happened to a vulgarian diplomat by a russia operative on a bridge in onion he got stabbed and the way rice and work is it goes inside a cell crosses the cell membranes inside the cell kills the cell and goes to the next cell and then the next cell and then the next cell it is on it is extremely a dangerous that it is firstly impossible to work on in a lap in the united states they will not letreush o rice because we have work with aspirin many times apron is safe because it does not cross sell membranes you gan injection o apron and will not do anything cause its tace outside the cells please nobody do that even though it does not cowbell memories please nobody inject apron whether not you are a operative or otherwise thank your injury for protecting me there of but what duglapy to get out is that when a ligan bis for receptor there is when a mole binds o its receptor in many cases that receptor ligan complex get's pulled inside the cell goes from the member in the cell inside the cell to you cannot go to the dance alone but it is you are coupled up you get in the door it that is right he to get at us e but apron to the peptide the peptide binds to uts receptor it gets internal ice and then when it is inside the e sell apron does the same thing ha sickened us it kills the cell but then it cannot go into the excel the only cells that get killed or the more polite warm ablated r sells that express that receptor if you have a big conglomeration of sells the have a few thous and and only fifty of them we express that receptor then you inject the apron conjugated to the rigid to the peptic and only those fifty sells high we took bombisin conjugated to spring injection the prebusin complex of rats and it took about a couple of days for the spring to actually a bit cells and what happened this that the mi thought it sighing less and less an excise me the rats thought is sighing less and less endless endless an essentially stop big am your student or stock was it murdered these cells and as a consequence the sign goes away what was the consequence of e eliminating sin on the internal state or the behavior of the rats wed in other words if one cannot sigh the generate physiological size what is the consequence on state of mind add you would imagine that carmendoxide would build up more readily or om the higher levels in the blood stream and that the animals would be more stress that that is the cot of logical extension of the way we set it up it was less benin than that when the animals got to the point were they were in sighing then and we did not a the terminus but the presumption was that the long functions significantly deteriorated and there physical their whole health the curate is significantly and we had to sacrifice them i cannot tell you whether they was stress or not but their breathing got to be significantly a o the urinated that we sacrifice them with that point now we do not know whether that is pe stoically related to the fact that then sigh or that it is the was secondary damage due to the fact that some solstice we never determined that now after we did this study to be candid it wasn't high priority for us to get the selthadorn punishment it stayed on the shelf ten i got a for call from a gradus through this thanfort cevinacl who stouts asking me all these interesting questions about breathing and am happy to answer them but at some point concern me because he was working for rent own by o chemist who worked on long in drosophila fruitflies a for cragsman no as new tor college i now and i said why you ask i me is and si was non to graduate you see away and you gave a lecture and on my undergraduate class and i was curious about breathing ever since that is hone those things which as a professor you bluff to here that actually as something really effected the life of us the when you burst the competitor but you had only yourself to blame no i i do not look at that as a competitor i i think that this enough interesting things to go on i know some of u porous sins colleagues say you can work on my lay but then when you leave my lab you gar t work on something different no one i ever trained was said that it is it is open field you onto work on something if you hive in the man and i but the there are people that nor scientist that i never felt i hear that their breathing apparatus are disrupted and the causes of brain is function that leads to the behavior use just described section not true m a but o but in terms of the i the before you we talk about the the beautiful story with with tackle and craws now and felt lab i want to just make sure that i understand if physiological size do not happen basically breathing over all suffers well the at would go back to the observations and polo victims in these hin lungs were the principal team as it was there was nolo hyperinflation of the longs and they many them teteorated and die am and just to stay on this one more moment before a a we move to what you were about to describe we here often that people will overdose on drugs of various kinds because they stop breathing a barbital its alcohol combine with barbituots as a common cause of death a for drug users and contraindications of drugs in the kinds of things you hear all the time about celebrities dying because they combined alcolhall with barbituots is there any evidence that the size that occur during sleep or during states of you know deep deep a relaxation om at and sedation that size recover the the brain because o you and imagine that if these size do not happen as a consequence of some drug impacting these brain centers that that could be one cause of basically asphyxiation and death if you look at the progression of i name to death you find that their breathing slows her a death through to connatural course there breathing slows down it is well stop and then they will gasp we have the phrase dying gasp wsuperlogi rest a there open describes an attempt to ore resuscitate that is to take that super breath and that may be it cookie thought the engine again we do not know the there to such things as gap are really size that are particularly lodge and if you suppress the ability to gasp in an individual who is e subject to an overdose then wheres they might been able to rearouse their breathing if that is prevented they do not get rearouse that is certainly a possibility a but this has not been investigated an e one of things that om interested in is in individuals who have a diseases which will effect presuming a complex and there is there is data in paukinsens disease and multiple systematrophy which is another form of nor degeneration were is loss of neurons in prebutzinger and the question is and it also may happen in less sometimes yer fir to his logarixacies a my coho claros crosses these individuals often die during sleep we have an idea that we have not been able to get anyone to test is that patience wait pawkinson's patience with i telesis timidly breathe normally doing wakefulness the disturbances that they have not breathing as doing sleep pogasif patients at the instates of the disease often have significant disturbances in their sleep pattern but not doing wakefulness and we think that what could be happening as that the proximate cause of death is not hat failure is that they become appear they stop breathing and do not resussitateand that resuscitation may may not be do to an explicit suppression of size but to an overall suppression of the whole apparatus of the rebutting a complex god thank you e yack calls you out he cauls us cause me up and is great hards superslot and he tells me about these these expermencitys doing we are keys looking in a data base to try and find out what molecules are en rich in regions of the brain that are critical for breathing we and others and mapped out these regions in the brains stay and he was looking one of these data basis to see what is en r etched and i said that is great we be willing to such a share or work together snow i my advisor does won me to do that said o kat but heavens a great kid and i in the joy talking to him and he is a smart i and what i found a in academia and is that the smartest people only one a high of people smarter than them the only one and have the province inter act with people smarter than them the a a the faculty who were not at the highest level and that every institution the say distribution the since above the mean an those below the me now whom below the mean a very threatened by that and a i saw heaven as i shining light and i did not care whether was going out compete me because whatever he did was going to help me in the field i would i did wherever i cannot help to work with heaven one point i got invited to give granrounds an neurology at standard turns out and undergraduate student who ad work with me was now ahead of the training program for neurologist did standard and he invited me and at the end of my visit i go to man crawsnel's office and heaven is the are and a postal jungly who was also working on a project was there and twas the end of conversation a the mark was to me we found this one molecule which is highly concentrated in who important region for breathing i wit that is great what is it and he says i cannot tell you because we want a work on it am course ism disappointed but i realize that is in they the ethic in some aliens of science of the custom in some years of science is that until you get a publication you be relatively striction in sharing far rain a a chat when i came back now well he may remember the story differently but a i said out and as am walking out the door i remember these experiments i described you about bombison and i was the only unusual mole you were working the reason ism rushing out the doors have a flight to cat i stick my head in i said is this molecho related to bombardon and then i run off in only wait for them to reply i b up for it ma calls me an he says bombison the pesto we found is related to bombison what is it do and i said ism not telling that o my and glad i was i d involved in the savagery not not but but that was sort of a a tease cause i said well let us work together and then we work together it the sisters dilemma at that point you yet i heaven able is spectacular i has on habit you see us a and the work that ism familiar with i from heaven is is worse mentioning now i or i it'll ask you'd it to mention it which is this reciprocal relationship between brain state where we and even say emotional state and breathing and it'd love to get your thoughts on how breathing interacts with other things in the brain ah you have beautifully described how breathing controls the longs the diaphragm in the interactions between oxygen and carmodaxide and forth but as we know when we get stressed our breathing changes when we are happy and relaxed our breathing changes but also if we change our breathing we in some sense can adjust our internal state what is the relationship between brain state and breathing and if you would because i know you have a particular i love of of one particular aspect of this what is the relationship between brain rhythms oscillations if you will and breathing this is a topic which is really intrigued me over the masticate i would say before that i was in my slope just interested about how the rhythm or breathing is generated and then really pay much attention to this other stuff for some reason i got interested in it and i thing was trigger by an article and the new york times about mindfulness now breathe or not although id lived in californium for twentieth of a time i never heard a mindfulness it is staggering how isolated you could be from the real world and i gurgled it and the was a mindfulness institute you see it and they were giving courses on meditation a this is great because i can now see whether r not the breathing part of meditation as anything to do with the reported effects of meditation i signed up for the course and as i joke to you before i had two rolls pone was to see whether or not a breathing hwan effect and the other was to levitate because i grew up when all these cone free things and all the monks could lev state when they meditated why not am we have a mile in the layup you cannot do anything interesting if your afraid of failing and if i failed to levitate while least i try and i should tell you no i still have not done it yet but i have not given up yet i have not given up am i i took this course in mindfulness and it became apparent to me that the breathing part was actually critical it was not simply a distraction or focus it you now they could hour move your index finger to the same effect i really believe that the breathing pot was involved now ism not an unbiased observer i creationist how can i demonstrate that i you feel competent the do experiments and humans and an feel like could design the experiment in humans but i felt ma o can study this an rodent we got this idea that we waking to teach rodent to meditate and it that is laughable but we said but if but if we can then we can actually study how this happened believe it a not i was able to get a a sort of stotogrant that not twenty one from once ye see i age that is the national complimentary medicines a wonderful institute till mention our government puts major tax dollars toward studies of things meditation breastwork supplements herbs acupuncture a this is i think not well known and it is an incredible thing that this that our government does that and i think it deserves a nod and more funding i i totally agree without i think that it is the kind of thing that many of us including many germany scientist things is to woo and and unsubstantiated but we learning more and more we used to laugh a neurimianology that the nervous system that have anything to do with this mine system and a pain itself can influence your mine system i mean there were all these things that we are learning that we used to dismiss and i think there is this real pockets to be learned here they when not laymen they fund end this particular project and none but a leap ahead because for three years we throw stuff up against the wall that did not work and recently we had a major break through we found the protocol by which we can get mice to breathe slowly awake mice to breath slowly i will not tell you normally they do not breath slowly no no now is whatever a normal breath is we could slow it down by a factor of ten and they fine doing that we could do that for we did that thirty minutes a day for for weeks book my a breath practice do they levitate we have not measure that yet i would say a privy we have not seen them floating to the top of that cage but we have not wait them may be the way less they may be you know limitation in silva is grated and may be a fou way less it for of a capital ovation any case a we then tested and we had control animals mice we this everything the same except manipulation we made did not slow down their breathing but they went through everything else we then put them tho a stand that fair condition which we did with mi college michael fancily whose one of the real curers of fear and we measure the stand the test is the put mice in a condition were the concern a receive a shock and the responses that they freeze and a measure of how fearful they are as how long they freeze this is well validated and it is right above my paygreat a describe the polity of the test but it is free halo the the control mice had a freezing time which was just the same as ordinary mice would have the ones that went through a protect rose much much less according to michael the the gree to which they we showed less freezing was as much as if there was a major manipulation in the might which is a part of the brain that is important in fear processing a staggering change how when we have now is the grand ran alimony the post that working an left and now we have to train piece together everything and a but the date is spectacular what think it is it am i just pause for a moment there because i think that the young talk about a road in study but i think the the benefits of doing rode studies the can get deep into mechanism a and for people that a might think well we have known that meditation has these benefits wide you need to get mechanistic science i think that a one thing that is important for people to remember is that first of all as many people as one might think a meditating out there a doing breath work afar far far greater number of people are not right i mean there is at the majority of people do not take any time to do dedicated breath work nor meditate am whatever can incentivize people would be a wonderful but the other thing is that it is never really been clear to me just how much meditation is required for a real effect meaning at a practical effect people say thirty minutes a day twenty minutes a day once a week twice a week something with breastwork am finding minimum er effective thresholds for changing normal circuitry is what i think is the holy grail of all these a practices and that is only con t be determined by the sorts of mechanistic studies that you describe s i this is wonderful i i do hope the work gets completed and m we in talk about ways that a a we can insure that that happens but am but let me let me at one think with a saying intrude when one of the idiot i think for lot of people is that this iplicible effect that is inhuman they can respond to something even though the mechanism has nothing to do with what the the intervention is and it is easy to say that the meditative response is cuppas as a big component which is supasible effect my mice do not believe in the possible effect and if we could show this the notified effect in mice it is convincing in ways that no matter how many human experiments you did the control for the placing effect is extremely difficult in humans it mice it is its nomination i think that that in of itself would be a enormous message excellent and indeed a a better point a i think a thirty minute a day meditation a in these mice if inerchancorrectly the meditation we do not n whether think in about at pact the legs of its breath practice that because we do not there presume we dare not thinking about their third center disposition levitation whatever it is they are not instructed as to what to do in if they were they probably into it anyway thirty minutes a day in which breathing is deliberately slowed or is slowed relative to their normal patterns of breathing got it a what was the frequency of sighing during that a thirty manning o nicely do not know well now we have the at are we just analyzing that they to be determined our to be announced at some point a the feer centers are altered in some way that creates a a shorter fear response to a rootstock a what are some other examples that you are aware of from working your laboratory or work in other laboratories for that matter about interactions between breathing and brain state or emotional state this connect or prier conversation i soften went off in a pension a we need i think we need to think separately of the effect of volitional changes of breathing on emotion first the effect a the the effect of brain state on breathing the effect of brains that on breathing when you stress is i effect it solely originating in higher centers if i can use that term effecting breathing it is the recepacal is that when you change breathing it effects your emotional state i think i think of those two things as different them the ultimately be tied together there is a landlord paper publish in the fifties where they stimulated in the a middle of cats and the petuwere they stimulated they got profound changes in breathing this every pattern of breathing could possibly imagine they found he sight neamigila which could produce that this clearly a powerful descending effect coming from teethe mile which is a major sight for processing emotion fear stressed what not that can affect breathing and clearly we have volitional control over breathing we have profound effects there now i should say about emotional control of breathing i need to seaway in to talk about locked in control locked in syndrome is a devastating lesion that happens in a part of the brains them with signals that controlled muscles a transmitted the fibrous coming from your mother quartan go down to this part of the the brain stem which is called eventual ponds and if there is a stroke there it undamaged these pathways what happens an individuals o have locked in control is they lose all volitional movement except lateral movement of the eyes and maybe the ability to blink the reason they are able to still blink and move their eyes is that those control centers a are nostril closer to are not interrupted tother words the interruption is below that they continue to breathe because the sent us for breathing do not require that volitional command and any case the below that there her fin these people continue to breathe normal intelligence but they cannot move thees a great book called the diving bell in the butterfly about a young man a who had this happens to and h describes his life and it is a real testament to human the human condition that he does us it is a remarkable book is the short book the can i the book by blinking de arise latter e redid by blinking to his caretaker it is pretty amaze an not of moving which i never seen with movie bardic as the protagonist but the book i highly recommend is a any one to read a psycholegue studying individual had locked in into and the this patient breathes very robotically totally consistent very regular they gave the patient the lowoxion mixture to breathe ventilation went up a seel to mixture to breathe infleshwen up all the regulatory apparatus for breathing was there they has the patient to hold his breath or the greet fast her nothing happen just the patient recognize the command but cunt change and all is on the patients breathing change considerably and they said their patient what happened he said you told the joke and i laughed and they went back whenever they told he joke that the patient found funny the patients breathing paten change and your breathing pattern when you laugh is you are knowing to ha ha ha ha but it is also very distinctive we have some nearest science colleagues who will go on name who if you heard them laugh fifty yards away exactly who they are not i it'll mamey a epic can dell to on has an inspiratory laugh it is famous for i suppose to exactly a exactly then it is very stheriatite but it it is maintained in these people lose volitional control of breathing there is an emotive component controlling your breathing which has nothing to do with your mission of the o velitial control and it goes down to a different pathway cause it is not destructed by the slotting sinter if you look at moth control of the face we have the political control of the face but we also have moth contra emotional control of the face which most of us cannot control when we look in another person we ten were able to read a lot about what they are their emotional state is and that is a lot about how primates communicate humans communicate and you have people wore a good deceivers probably use cops salesmen a pocoplayers when now pocoplays no have tells but many of them now were doc basis because the live tells you blink o what not peoples ice your to size people pile size us to tell am which is an autonomic function not as a a a sell muscle function but we have these only skelp muscles which were controlling which give us away i have t e have tried to get my imaging friends to image some of the great actors that we have in losantial i seem brain images brainimage ye em no it's o i mean you brainimages because i think when when i tell ask you to smile i could tell that you are not happy that your smiling because i ask you to smile i get your tabs a track joke but we we are old friend now i no a that that when when you see a picture it'd it a birthday want non want sat cheese you could tell that at least half of the people are not happy the saying these where's a great actor when when they are able to dissemble in the fact that their candor the happy you believe it did not faking it it is that is great acting and i do not think everyone could do that i think that the individuals are able to do that have some connection to the ports of their motive control system that the rest of us do not have maybe they develop it through training and may be not but i think at this can be image i would to get one of these great actors in a image and have them go to that and t think it a normal person and see whether or not they can emulate that i think you can find picdifferences in the way they control the motive things this a motive control of the the facial muscles i think it is a large pot similar to the otic control of breathing this that a motive control and there is the volitional control in their different get the different now the you ask me about the tackle stuff the tackle paper had to do with a sending that the effective breathing on a motion what heaven found was that there was a population of groans in the prebutzinga complex that we are always looking to things that are projecting ultimo modinorams he found the population of cells that projected to locus serious locussurius visas me as one of those places in the brain that seem to go everywhere again sprinkler system exactly exact and influence move and you have had pocks about this i mean it there a lot of stuff going on with the imams ucxcending the locusrilius you get into the locus srilius you can now spray information out throughout the entirebrate he found specific cells that projected from prebutzinger to locusrilius and that these cells are inspiratory modulate now it is been known for a long time since the sixties that if you look in the locus serious of cats when they're wake you find many turns that have repertory modulation none pay much attention to him why why bother not why bother paying attention but why would the bring both to have these impress wit heaven did with a since schmaltz ante lotion lobelia is they killed oblast those cells going to locusrius from prebutzinger and the animals became calmer and there beg levels changed in ways their indicative that they became calmer and as i recall they did just become calmer but they ware not really capable of hiarowsal states they were on of flat i i do not think we really our sued that in the paper o and we would have to s joined eugenol about that but is on the other side of my laps o we will ask i but but none the less am that beautifully illustrates how there is a by direction a control right well that is landing e motion well that did the two a the two stories of the locked in o m indium plus the jacal paper shows that the emotional states influence breathing and breathing influences emotional sates it which but you mention inspiration which always call inhalation but people w will wat fallow no let us find it i those are interchangeable on people can fallow that om there some interesting papers from come nobles ripened from a number of other groups that as we inhale or right after we inhale the brain is actually more alert and capable of storing information enduring exhales which i find incredible but it also make sense ism able to see things far better when my eyes are open than when my eyelids are closed for that matter i may i do not the doubt my non homework is grate i lemme back track o it because i i won people on the stand that when tongue about breathing affecting emotion of cognac state it is not simply coming from prebutsinger here lit thereat he least while there several of the sights lame sot of the si needle to go to them one is o faction when you are breathing normal normal breathing your inhaling and exhaling this is creating signals coming from the besom mucosa that is going back into the o factory bulb that is respiratory modulated and thou factory half has a profound influence and projections throw many parts of the bray this is signal arising from this rhythmic moving of air in and at the nose that is going into the brain that has contained in an respiratory modulation that signal is there the brain does not have to be using it but when it is the your discriminating on what not that is writhing on a oscillation which is respiratory related another potential source is the vaguest nerve the vagus there is amigo nerve which is containing difference from all the vessel difference just being a signal signals to signals from the visa it also has signals coming from the brains them down which are called difference but it is getting mason signals from the long from the got and this is going up into the brain stay it is there there very powerful recept is in the long that a responding to the long volume the long scratch for berrersthats marry that a t that will you we have an also like at the piano receptors of of this years bell prize yet thee responding to the expansion and relaxation in the long and if you record from the vagus nerve you will see that there is a huge respiratory modulation due to the mechanical changes in the long now why that is of interest is that for some forms o refractory depression a actual stimulation of the vaguest nerve can provide tremendous relief why this is the case still remains to be determined but it is clear that signals in the vaguest nerve least artificial signals in the vaguest nerve can have a plosive effect on reducing depression it is not a at to think that unto normal circumstances that that rhythm coming in from the vaguest nerve is playing a role in normal processing or can lemme lemme continue comdoxide an action levels now untie normal circumstances your oxen levels are file and unless you go to altitude they do not really change very much but so seal two levels can change quite a bit with even a relatively small change in your oval of breathing that is going to change of page level a have a colleague a least market who as working with patience to have ho anxious and many of them hi prevent elite and is a result of that hyperventilation their common id levels low and she as develop a thereputed treatment were she trays these people to bread slower and the to restore the seal two levels back to normal and she gets relief in their anxiety seal two levels which a not on effect brain function one breath by breath level although does fluctuate death by breath but sort of a continuous background can change and if it is change chronically we know that highly elevated levels of so to can produce panicatacs and a we do not know to gree to that is i the gets exascibated by people who get who have a panic at the gree to which their ambient seal to levels a affecting the degree of discomfort what about people who are am tend to be too calm meaning that their their feeling sleepy they the their underbreathing as supposed to overreaching is there any a knowledge of what the status of so to is in their system i do not know which does not mean is no knowledge but in unaware in runaway are but that is blissfully unaware i eve not looked at that literates o i do not know but i have go any most people or excuse me most of the scientific literature around breathing in humans ism aware of relates to these stress states because they're lot be easier to study in the lab or as people feeling am under stimulated or exhausted all the time it is a it is a complicated thing to measure me you can do it but it it is not our sal this easy tomes but in terms of that s or f the the measures for feeling a fatigue there there somewhat indirect resstrasyou we can we can get at pulsates anarch or van thinks also by imagine that these sir these devises that were all wearing will soon be able to measure will not a commeasure oxen level toxin saturation jisamazing yo a but opens you be pretty much stay above ninety per cent unless their some mythology were you go to out tat but seal too levels very quite a bit and seal in fact because they very you body sensitive the control of breathing that how much you breathe terminate is determine in a very sensitive way by the see too level even a small change in your seal too won have a significant effect on your ventilation this is another thing that nine changes of intimation but effects your brains that now another thing that can effect a breathing prow breathing practice can effect your emotional state is simply the the sending to me because breathing practice involves volitional control of your breathing and therefore this is singlets originating somewhere in your motor quite that is not of course that is going go down the prebutsinger but it is also going to send off collateral to the places those collateral could obviously influence your emotional state we have quite a few different potential sources none of them there exclusive there's an interesting apple which shows that a few block nasal breathing yo still see breathing way oscillations n the brain and this is we are i think the the mechanism is occurring is tat these breathing way oscillations in the brain they are playing a roll in signal process in maybe as sure total bit about the roll at oscillations may be playing in sing procedefinitely but before you do i i just want to a ask you a intermediate question we talked a lot about inhalation inspiration an exculpation what about breath holds in apnea for instance a people are holding their breath whether or not its a conscious or or or unconscious they are holding their breath a what is known about breath holds am in terms of how it might interact with reinstate or oxygen see o to and ism particularly interested in how breath holds with lungs empty verses breath holds with lungs full might differ in terms of their impact on the brain ism not aware of any studies on this a looking it a mechanistic level but i find it really interesting and even if there are no studies a i love if you care to speculate well why are the breath practices that intrigue me is when you bathe hyperventilate for a minute and then hold your breath for as long as you can to to style bema style or ye we call it in the laboratory because frankly before to to and before whim am there there it was it referred to as dislike hyper ventilation sos easily it followed by a breath and that bethel could be done longs felt we lump empty he a long talk with some colleagues about what they might think the unloving mechanisms are particularly for the breath hole and the early cop suddenly invasion that this a component with respect to the presents or absents of that rithmicity in your curtal which is having effect but the other thing with the hype inflation hyperventilation wen the opium is your shall two levels or going from lo ti any time your holding your breath any toe you hong your breath of and those going to have a profound influence now i have to talk about episode hypoxia cause there is a lot of or going on particularly with going mitualto you rest your florins doing some extraordinary work on episodic hypoxia in the these avid million a this some really intriguing work if i ask you to hold your great to exist if i gave you a looxian mixture for couple of minutes your breathing level would go up close you would not you want to have moroxiterare ye no stone fixity of a and for couple of minutes you go up you can real some study state level not hypoxia that you cannot reach an equilibrium and then i give you room mare again your ventilation quickly relax us back down to no if on the other hand i gave you three minutes of hypoxia five minutes of nomoxia three minutes hypoxia five minutes in moxie agreements poo figments in moan normoxiving or no o none there you radiation of of down up down up down have the last episode your breathing comes down and does not continue to come down but rises again and stays up for hours this is well validated now this was orally done an ounce renting humans all the time it seems to have profound benefit on motive function and conning function in what direction positive positive have often toyed with the idea o getting of types and an arisen oxen do not do this lessens getting an arisen ocean tank by my desk when writing a grant and doing in blue velvet and going through the the episodic pox to prove my cone function cops certainly could due some proven wen were francs but you could do this without the the low oxygen i man ye could do this o breath work presumably it is hard to lower your oxygen enough coquet were going in the experiment a studies they imply use eight present oxygen it is hard to hold your breath long enough and there is another difference here that is what is happening to you seal two levels when you hold your breath your option levels are dropping o seal to levels are going up when you're doing episodic hum hypoxia you seal two levels are going to state pretty normal course you still breathing is sis the onion level circle unlike normal conditions which you describe before were e oxygen is relatively constant and see too is fluctuating depending on emotional state and activity in things o that sort in episodic hypoxia so too is relatively constant but your varying the oxygen level coming into the system quite a bit i would say it is relatively i would ay seal to is relatively constant but in but it is not going an going a direction which is going to be significantly far from normal worse when your holding your breath you going to become both hypoxia and hypocapnic at the same time we had explain to people wat hypoxia an hypocaponic gar i has at a just a test l tone for low levels of oxygen hyper or you could a hypoxia lo hyper is high hyperopia or hypo capita low seal to our my burlap n your he levels olio to when you're in episodic hypoxia if anything you even to become hypo panic not hypercap and that could have plain influence in us when example that i i remember and going will have to forgive me i to escorting us is they had a a patient who had a stroke and had weakness an ankle flexion that is exes me ankle extension to extend the ankle and they had the patient a seat whether can measure ankle extension and then are they measured it and then they exposed the patient to episodic hypoxia and they measure again the strength of the ankle extension wen way up and cordon is looking at this the looking this now for spinal cord revere and i imagine for all sorts of nor muscular performance a you can be beneficial your cordon is looking in athletic performance we have a project which we have not been able to to piston an next level to do gulf we i i lingo all club cause you love gulf well it is it is because it is motor performance coordination it is not simply running as fans you can an it is coordination its concentration's a whole variety of things and the idea would be to we a group of golfers and give them the possible controls to do not know where they breathing a gas mintier which is just normal air where i polices mixture though they may be able to figure it out be on their response do it one control circumstances that do it into a net measure there blanket contrives a dispersion wont not and see what happens look if we could find that this works for golfers forget about cognac function we could sell this for unbelievable anoints of money that is soundly i tear who am a by the way ism not serious about coming we but i know your joking either people should know that you are joking by that no i think that anything that can improve connive an her muscular performance is on to be of interest for a wide range of both pathologic states injury t b e et camera ism in one of the most frequent questions i get is about recovery from from concoction or dramatic brain injury lot of people think sports they think football i think rug by they think holy but if you look at the statistics on dramatic brain injury most of it is construction work or car crash is bicycle accidents i mean it the the sports part of it is a tiny tiny miniscule for action of the total amount of dramatic brain injury out there a it i think these protocols tested in the contacts of gulf would be very interesting because of the constraints of the measures as you mention in it can be exported to a number of things i want it just trying imagine whether or not there is any kind of breathing pattern or breath work just to be direct about it that even partially mimics what you described in turns of episodic hypoxia have done a lot of tumor whimhawfsick my peroventilation type breathing before my laps studies this in humans in a what we find is that if people do sickle hyerovelation or for about a minute the exhale hold their breath for fifteen to sixty second depending on what they can do and just keep repeating that for about five minutes i it seems to me that it at least partially mimics the state that you are talking about because afterwards people report heighten levels of alertness a lower levels of a and of triggering a do to stressful events they feel comfortable at a higher level of autonomic royal connive focus a number of improvementsthat are pretty impressive that any practitioner of whipsaw for tuna will be familiar with a is that pattern of breathing even can we say that it it maps to what you are describing in some general sense i well they the explain this would be going mutual i would say it moves in that direction but its not its extreme cause i do not think yuan get them to the levels of i pox that they do clerical a i know that a pas at out breath collect of actually just put a machine could you by machine that does this i say and the borhtin a being to do their own self testing to see whether not the sassaby effect on anything that they can wish of course y after be concerned about self experimentation but i am i employed their curiosity in going after it hyperbaric chambers here a lot nowadays about hyperbaric chambers people are buying em ensuing em and a what your thoughts on hyperbaric chambers as it relates to any that hyper a hypo my barbaric chambers si see not going about out to to now i do not really have much the same a your action et surpoligal up a little bit and that could have beneficial effect but that is way outside my verger comfort i think a twenty twenty two i think it is going to be the year of two things i keep hearing lot about which is the deliberate use of high fault in take a for performance a blood increasing blood volume et camera and hyperbaric chambers seem to be catching on much in the same way that ice was were in and sawn as seem to be right now but my a prediction we can a return to it some at some point i the one to ask you about am some of the studies that have seen out there exploring how deliberately restricting one's breathing to nasal breathing can do things improve memory these couple papers in journal f normal science which is a respectable journal on our field am one looking battle factory memory that kind of made sense because you can smell things better though your nose than your mouth unless you are some sort of a floor something they were they can presumably they have some sense of smell in their mouth as well but a human's generally smell with their nose that was not terribly surprising but there was the companion study that showed that the hippocampus and triad solved in in coming memories in one form er another a was more active if you will and a memory and a recall was better when people learned information while nasal breathing is supposed to mouth breathing does that make sense of from any mechanistic perspective well given that there are this a major path way going from the factory system into the brain and you cut and and not one from any receptors in the mouth the degree of respiratory modulation going to see throughout the forcing is going to be less with mouth breathing than nosing it it is certainly plausible am am i i i think there is therefore a lo lot of experiments an need to be done to distinguish between the two that is they the was o component in the none days o component of these breathing related signals this is t n the see some times when you have a strong effect to be exclusive and i think what is going on here is that there many imports that can have an effect on whether the aepossile that some effect this part of behavior in some effect that part of be remains to be investigated the certainly astrongol factory component my interest is trying to follow the central component cause we know that this a strong central component is in fact this e strong mental projection the olfactory ball regardless of whether not this any in inn to the nose there is a respiratory in put into the factory bull which combines with the respiratory modulated signals coming from the sensory resembles interesting and as long as we are a poking around a forgive upon a the nose a what about one nostril verses the other nostril i know it sounds a little crazy to imagine but there's been theories in a yogic traditions and others that breathing through one nostril somehow active ate certain brain centers may be atmospherically one side the brain verses the other or that right nostril left nostril breathing might am a different terms of the levels of alertness or comments they produce i am not aware of any mechanistic date on that but there is anything of worth while out right nostril verse is left nostril breathing that you are were of id love to know well it it is certainly plausible i do not know of any dated demonstrating you accept the anecdotal reports of the the as the brain is highly literalized and we have you speech on one side and a i know dominant my in this on one side in the notion that if you you have the sue signal coming from the factory system and it the some degree of literalize is not perfectly symmetrical that is one side is not going evenly tho both sides then you can imagine and hence the signal gets a distributed in they way that is not uniform that the effect in this or the response is going to be particular to the quarter in which a either the signal still remains the the signal is removed from i see a what are some of the other features of our brain and body be it blinking or my movements or a ability to in code sounds or any features of the way that we function and move and perceive things that are coordinated with breathing in some interesting way factoid for that question a almost everything we have for example on the ordinomics are we have respiratory sign of serithmia that is during expire ration the heart slows down a your pupil oscillate with the respiratory cycle i do not know what the functional basis for that is but they do ausilat with the respiratory cycle when we inhale our pupils constrict presumablycause meters and increase and in hard in sympathetic tone i would think of constriction ism guessing as you relax the pupil will get can you ex in i i think you right but i always get you now always get the available at a on ans counterintuitigis people one think that when the pupils get am a me in depends i mean w you can get very alert and arouse it for stressor for good reasons am and the pupils get wider by your visual feel narrows and then the opposite is true anyway i d i guess the ideas that the pupils are changing size and therefore you aperture your visual window is changing in it incardination with brocade your fear response changes with the respiratory cycle on tell us more about that well s a paper by a thesalano which i thinks showed rather clearly that if you show individuals a fearful faces that the we measured response of fearfulness changes between inspiration expression yo no why but it does your your reaction time changes i took about blinking the reaction time changes between inspiration expiration your if i ask you to punch something the time will change between inspiration an expiration in fact i do not know the degree to which march out us exploit that you watch the breathing patten and your your opponent will actually move slower during one cycle compare to demeaning as there what would in which direction if they exhaling they can they can punch faster i have to say i i do not keep a table of which is which direction things move yes a mount of the marchalantsfiel what my a vague understanding is that exhales on strikes is the more typical a way to a to do that am and as be people strike they exhale a anoa as you you exhale but the there there aether components to strike and because won a stiff in your your ribcage onto make a saw salesman have a that you know both an inspiration in an expiration at the same time i do not i do not i do not know enough about when you say during expiration i would assume that we make you strike your actually sort of one is stiffed here which is o vasalven maneuver and oftentimes they will clench their fist at the last moment b anyway there is a a whole set of mother a things ate i we should we can talk to some fibers we we know people who know fighters w we can ask them a interest in what are me other a things that are modulated by breathing you i think anything any one looks at seems to have a breathing component because it is all over your brain and it is thought to imagine its not being effected now whether it is incidental or a just back round and does not really have any behavioral a advantage it is possible another case of on might have a verbal vagi men that the the biggest a i opening thing for me probably a death go was digging into literature and and seeing how much of cortical activity and selfcoric activity had a respiratory modulated component to it and i think a lot of my colleagues whoa studying quarter or oblivious to us and a i they find i heard a talk the other day the personal on name who find the lot of things correlated with a a particular movement and i think it when i looked i said geed less the things that a respiratory modulated and rather than it being correlated to the movement they were looking at i think the movement they were looking at was modulated by breathing as was everything else there was not that the movement itself was driving that correlation it was that they are all correlated to something else which as the breathing win whether or not that is they behavior relevant or behaviourly something can exploit i do not know i suspect your right am that breathing is if not in the foundational driver of many if not all these things that it is at least one of the foundation is its the fact round it is in the brain in a i oscillations playing important pot in brain function and the very infrequency from ma be a hundred hearts a down to what wen get tho circadian and sure a monthly cycles but breathing occupies a rather unusual place in all that because lemme thought about what the out people think elsolatios of doing particular fatal ones there important in coordinating signals across warrant a just in a computer a computers steps computing knows when information coming from another part of a computer that it was originated at a particular time and that discreet step by stealing is important n computer control now the brain is not additional device it's an analogue device but when i have a signal that the coming in my ear and my eye which is inhuman in speaking and ism looking at his face i see that is a whole but the signals coming in to different parts of my brain how do i unify that well my murals are very sensitive to changes in signals arriving by fractions of a mill a second i d always sure that those signals coming in represent the same signal well if i have throughout my brain and oscillation and the signals right on that oscillation at san the pity oscillation i can then have a much better handle on the relative timing and say those throw signals came in at the same time they may relate the the same object and a ha i see you as when unify thing spouting you k talking and these oscillations coming many different frequency ranges and are important in memory formation in all sorts of things i do not think people pay much attention to breathing because it is relatively slow to to this a the range when you think about no a seconds but we have important the things that i thought to be important in only function which are a few cycles per second to twenty thirty forty fifty second the second breathing an humans is may be point two cycles per second every five seconds although in rooms there up the four per second which is pretty face but breathing has one thing which is special that is you can readily change it the degree to which the brain is using that slow signal for anything if that becomes part of its normal signal processing change it that signal processing has to change and as that signal processing changes acutely this a change know you ask about breath practice how long they have to do it well a signal breath will change your state your nervous you take a deep breath and it seems to help relax o your see call it what you will oo what you will ah it seems to work now it is not it does have a permanent change but when ism getting up to bath or getting up tat a first teen getting to give a big flock or coming to do a podcast get a bit anxious a a deebreath of feu deprecates a tremendously effective in coming on down and a you can get a transient disruption but on the other hand let us take something depression i think it is you can invasion depression as activities sot of going around in a second and because it is continuous in the nervous system as signals keep repeating they tend to get stronger and then get strong you cannot break it you can imagine the impression being a something going on and on on and you cannot break it and we have trouble when we get certain levels of depression a m all of us get the pressed at some point but if it is not continuous its not long lasting were able to break it but if it is long lasting and very deep we cannot break it the questions how to we break it well they're extreme eyes to break it we could do electric convulsive shock we shock the whole brain that is destructing activity whole brain and when the circuits thoughts through get back together again it is been destructive and we know that the brain when signals get the structural a bit we can weaken the connections and weakening connections if its then in the circuinnvolved in depression we may get some relief an elector convulsive shop show does work for relieving many kinds of depression that is pretty heroic focal a see brain stimulation does the same thing but more local eyes or trains crazy of stimulation you destructing a network and while it is getting back together it may weaken some of the connections it breathing it is playing some roll in this circuit and now instead of doing a the one second shock i do thirty minutes of destruction by doing slow breathing or other breathing practice the does circuits begin to break down a a bit and i get some relief and if i continue to do it before the circuit can then build back up again i grass it can wear that circuit down i a short of liking this i tell people us walking round on a dirt path you build a rock to ruck get deep you cannot get out of it and what breathing is doing i sit of filling in the rut it by bet to a point that you can climb out of that rut and that is because breathing the breathing signal it is playing some roll in the way the circuit works and then when you destruct it the circuit gets a low thrown off kilter and when as when this when circuits get thrown off the nervous system tries to adjust in some way or another and it turns out at least for breathing for some evolutionary reason or just by happens things it seems to improve our emotional function are n or cognac function and were very fortunate that that is the case it is a terrific saguayint what i not ask you named in this part of a set of questions one may sure we touch on before we rap up which is what do you do with all this knowledge in terms of a breathing practice a you mention that one breath can shift your reinstate and that itself can be powerful i think that is a absolutely true you have also tosh about thirty minute breathbrak breathword practice as which is three mints of breastwork is it pretty serious commitment i think but it is doable a certainly a zero cost except for the time r in most cases what do you see out there in the landscape of breastwork that is being done that you i and why do you it a what do you think but what would you to see more of in terms of exploration of breath work and what do you do well ism were the new in for to breastwork through my own investigation of it i became convince that it is real and ism i basely a beginner in terms to my own practice and i to keep things simple and i think have diacaustic an before i in it to summon as a catch potato whose told they got to begin to exercise you do not go out run a marathon you know cauchpetan see can get up and walk for five minutes an ten minutes and then woman ow your working for a long a period you begin to rhyme and then you reach a point you say walk ism interested in this sport and there may be particular kinds of practices that you can use that could be helpful in in optimizing performance at that sport ism not were yet i find i get tremendous benefit bi relatively short periods between five and maybe twenty minutes of doing boxer it is very simple to do i have a simple a which tells me keep the timing to you recall what wait is is it the any a trainer is that the one while i was using calm for a long time but i let my subscription relapse and i have another one whose name i do not remember but a it it is it is very simple and works for me ism now trying this too because ism just curious an exploring it because of it may be acting for a different way in a one to see if i real i respond differently a i i do not have a particular point of yew now i have friends in colleagues or into particular styles gwimhoff and i think what he is doing as great in getting people are interested i think the notion is that i would to see more people exploring us and to some degree as you point out thirty minutes to day some of the breath patterns that a a some of y studs gwimhwf are a little intimidating to up s and i would to see something very simple that what i to my friends i but just try at five or ten minutes if you feel better through for a few days if you do not and stop an does not cost anything and invariably they find that it is helpful i well often interrupt my that m to take five or ten minutes a i find then am lay again there is i think there some pretty good data that your performance if the lunch the clients and very often what it'll do if the lunch which i did throw to day is take five or ten minutes and just sort of breath practice and lately what the at what is that breath practice look this just box brealyn for five or ten minute and your the duration of your inhales and holds and exhales and holds is set by the a i tat a well i i do five seconds five seconds inhale five second hold five second exile five five a and sometimes it'll do doubles are ten seconds i t just because i i i get more you know us i feel doing a and it is it is i it is very it is very helpful i mean it i now that is not the only thing i do with respect the trying to managing my sanity in my health image a number of things o they seem a because you seem very sane and very healthy i in fact know that you are both those things car you suspect an ass in but there is data i a while back we had a conversation a casual conversation but you said something that really stuck in my mind which is that it might be that the specific pattern of breath work that one does is not as important as experiencing transitions between states based on deliberate breath work or something to that extent which i interpreted to mean that if i were to do box breathing with five second in five second hold five second exhale five second hold for a couple of days or maybe even a couple of minutes and then which to ten seconds or then switch to tumor that there is something powerful perhaps in the in the transitions and realizing the relationship between different patterns of breathing in those transitions much in the same way that i you can get on to into one of these cars and amusement packages goes at a constant rate and then stops very different in learning how to shift gears i hundred up i use to drive a manual i still can her of thing about a manual transmission but even with an automatic transmission you start to get a sense of how the vehicle behaves under different conditions and i thought that was a beautiful ism seed for a potential breath work practice that at least to my awareness nobody has really formalized which is that you introduce some variability within the practice that somewhat random in order to be able to sense the relationship between different speeds and depths of inhales chaos ad holds and forth and essential its driving you on the tract but with obstacles am at different rates and braking and restarting in things that sort that is how you learnt how to drive what you think about that an am if you a it enough can we call it the headman protocol holds n i was asked om in this beys in of you once wide an i me at the headman complex said the prelusive chomp was it our have afeldman complex but sounds a secondatric disorder but but a i i think the primary effect is this destructive effect which i described and but the particular responses my clearly very depending on what that description is i do not know of any particular data which are son well controlled experiments which can actually work through the different types of breathing pattens or simply with a box paten just caring the durations a in primus to of similar but the mount of time you spending round the boxes different i i do not really have much to say about this a menhirs why we need better controlled experiments in humans and i think this is where of being able to studying in rodent where you can have a while range of a prohibitions who you doing moreen vase of studies the really get down is to which regions are effect that how is the signal processing disrupted which is still hypothesis but how is described could tell us a lot about may be this a resident point i which this optimal effect when you take a particular breathing practice and then when we talked about the fact that different breading practices could be effecting the outcomes through different pathways you have the of factory pathway you have a central pathway have a vagal pathway you have a defending pathway how different practices may a change the the summation of those things because all i think all those things are probably involved and we are just beginning descrach resurface and i i just hope that we can get serious you are scientist the psychologize to do the right experiments to get it this because i think this a lot of value to human healthier as you do and it's when the reason my lavish shifted to these sorts of things in humans a delighted that your continuing to do the hard more mechanistic work in mice and probably you do work in humans already the as well as you are not already and there re other groups a expel davit you see a sap and a number of certain see some papers out there about respiration an human habits more brain imaging i cannot help but ask about a somewhat unrelated topic but it is am important in light of this conversation because you are here and one of the things that i really enjoy about conversations with you a as it relates to health and negro science and and forth is that you are one of the few colleagues i have who openly admits to a exploring supplementation imam a long time a the supplement u fan i think there there is power in compounds both prescription non prescription natural synthesized a i do not use these haphazardly but i think there is certainly power and in them am one of the places where you and i converges in terms a very interest in the nervous system and supplementation is a he's a we magnesium now have talked at endlessly a on the podcastand elsewhere about magnesium for sake of sleep and improving transtransitions to sleep and and forth but you have a a somewhat different interest in magnesium as it relates a cognitive function and durability of conceive function would you mind your sharing with us a littlest about what that interest is where where it stems from and because it is the because it is the human ladpodcasting we often talk about supplementation what a what you do with that information i need to disclose as i am a signed of adviser to a company can her center which my gradual then going least am that said i give you some background goon although when he was in my lamb work on breathing had a deep interest in learning member and we left my lap he went to work for it with a renown learning memory guy at thinfrviction and when he am finish thin is hired by sosumatonicoanin it who also knows a thing or two to memory ism teasing douma has a no bell for his work on imuniglobulance but then is a the world class memory researcher and more am he is many things and and song had very curious very bright i and he was interested in how signals between groans get strength and which as to long competeniationaltp and one of the the questions that arose was if i have simple us to a loran and i get slip is the slip bigger if the signal is bigger or the noise is less we can imagine that on e listening to something of its latter we can hear it better worth this less noise we can hear it better and he wanted to investigate us i did this in tissue culture of hypohypocampal anurans and what he found was that if he lord the background activity in all the anurans that the let p he elicited got stronger and the way he did that was increasing the level of magnesium in the bathing solution this gets into some esoteric a electrophysiology but basically this a background level of nose an oceans and that part of it is regulated by the degree of magnesium in the exercise of death a woman x a you mean electrical noise bloxwil not om solution and if you inn what is called the physiological range which is between point ate and one point to million fouler which do not worry about the nolremember the milk mole of the madness evil i i always frightened that i get in i say micro or phantom or something i go off by evilest magnetic but a in that physiological ran this a big difference in the amount of noise in the neuron between pointed in one point to limo we playedamound with the magnesium man yo found out that when the magnesium is elevated time was more tipi i that is an observation in a is culture and i should just mention that more let p essentially translates to more mere plasticity more rewiring of connection innocence he am based this in mice and basely offer them a am y had control mice which can animal died in when that had on the rich magnesium and the ones that lived a in rich wild magnesium had high a cogent of functional a live longer everything you would worn in some magic pill this mice this that when exit rats a the problem was that you could not imagine taking this into humans because most magnesium faults do not passively get from the got into the blood stream into the brain they pass by a what's called a transporter transported something in the membrane the grabs a magnesium molecule madam and olein in to the the side if you imagine you have magnesium in your got you have transports that pull magnesiment got into the blood stray well if you had taken normal magnesium supplement which can buy at diplomacy it don't crosse the got very easily and if you walk take enough of it to get it in your blood stream yous that getting dare it is not a a a good way to go what is it it a igocanelis ah well said a he work with this brilliant champs famous and a fa look the whole range of magnesemen compounds and he found the magnesium three and eight was much more effective in crossing the the a got blood maria now they generalize at the time but three and eight is a metabolite of minim in sea and there is a lots of three eating your body magnesium three n it with appear to be safe and maybe a part of the roll or that now they believe its part the role of the three and eight is that it supercharges the transport it to get the magnesium in and remember you knew a transporter at the got into the brain and intesells the gave magnesium three n at to mice a who had a no lime back trick of it they did a study in humans they hide a a accompanied to do a test was a handoff test that is whether companies to gets tied by the became to do their cestode and they got patients who had what diagnose this mile cognac decline these are people had connive this order which was agent appropriate and the the matrix that they use for a determining how far off they were is superman's chief factor which is a met generalized measure of intelligence that most psychologist except and the biological age of the subjects we i think fifty one and the cogent of age was sixty one based on the spain jess i should say the mangy factor thoughts at a particular popular a level in the population at aged twenty and declines about one percent year sorry to say we not twenty year old any more a but when you get a number from that you can put on the carvancy whether it up its about duration not these people about ten years older according to that metric and longshore short if the three months this is a bonito control double blind study the people who were in the nosebag arm improved two years which is common for human studies does of beside effect the people who got the compound improved eight years on average and some improved more than eight years they did not do any further did noses is o what corgi ma connect but was pretty it was extraordinarily impressive it move their cognition closer to their by age i logical age m o what the doses of magnesium three and it is ai it is in the paper and it is spastically what they have in the compound which is sold commercially the compound which is sol commercially is i the by a nuts suitable whole sailor who sells it to the retailers an the makefast of a formulation in want am but i it is it is a dosage which is minutes thing is rarely tolerable i take hafodose the reason i take carfodosis that i had my my cesium blood mansion measure and i it was lo normal form age i took hairdos o became high normal and i felt comfortable thing in the normal range i but young the lot of people a taking the full dose and an a for it my age ism not looking to get slaughter of looking to the clime more slowly and it is hard as n i start for me to tell you whether or not its effective or not will you remember the mimoleor and say men a solution and on the high and lad i would say i it is not a well controlled study a when it is an end of one but i it seems to be working i when i when have recommended to my friends academics who are not by nature skeptical if not cynical and i insist that they try it they usually do not report hey major change in the cognac function of this sometimes they do report while i feel a little bit more hurt than mi move my physical movements are better but many the report the sleep better an an that make sense i think a there is good evidence that three an eight can a celery the transition into sleep and maybe even access to deeper a modes of sleep i for some people there a for many people actually a a small percentage of people who take three and eight including one of our podcast staff i her a have stomach issues with it they cannot tolerates i would say am just anecdoely about five per cent of people do not tolerate three and eight well stop taking in than their fine it cause them diary or something that sort i but most people tolerate it well and most people report that in it vastly improves their sleep and again that is anecdote my there are a few studies and their more on the way i but dit is that is very interesting because i until you and i had the discussion about three and hate i was not am aware of the a connive enhancing effects but the story make sense from a mechanistic perspective and it brings it around to a a bigger and more important statement which is that i appreciate your attention to mechanism i guess systems from your early training as a physicists and the desire to get numbers and and to really a harsh things at a fine level am since we have covered a lot to day i know there is much more that we could cover ism going to insist on a part too at some point but i really wanted speak on me half of a huge number of people just thank you not just for your time and energy in attention to detail and accuracying clarity around this topic to day but also what i should have said at the beginning which is that you really are a pioneer in this field of studying respiration and the mechanisms underlying respiration with modern tools for now for many decades and the field of narrow science was a one that was perfectly content to address issues memory and vision and a sensation perceptions at a but the the respiratory system was largely overlooked for a long time and and you have just been steadily clipping away and clipping away and much cause of the events of a a related to bovid and a number of other things a and this huge interest in breath work in brain states and wellness i the field of respiration and interest and respiration is just exploded am i really wants extend a sincere thanks it means a lot to me and i know to the audience of this podcast at some one with your depth and rigor in this area is both a scientist and a practitioner and the you would share this with us a thank you why i i wonder thank this is actually a great opportunity for me have been i isolated my solo for a long time and it is been a wonderful experience to communicate to people outside the silo have an interest in this and i think that this a lot that remains to be done and i enjoy speaking to people have interest in this i find the interest to be quite the mine coddling and i it is quite wonderful that people a willing to a in listen to things that can be quite a satirical times but it gets them the deep things about who we are and how we are go to live alive i appreciate the opportunity and i would be delight at to come back at any time wonderful we will absolutely do it thanks again jack i know

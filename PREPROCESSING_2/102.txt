republican candidates go right at each other to see who is up for the challenge of taking on donate trump from stray ruling could be the most damaging blow to his candidates yet and a mass crimes three in gulfs the nation ism ben fear let is the venthpiroshow to day show sponserabackxpress we it do you your ride history being seen and sold to advertisers now mean you the gun express we pan right out express we cans i calm slash men preliminary note today noon eastern time i will be speaking with melon mask over on aethers and space were get to be talking about melon mask an his fight with the antidefimation league standard of free speech on ax as well as advertising pressure on ax if you want check that outmaktsure to head on over two ex spaces at noon eastern time o k last night was the second big republican debate by big i mean dona trump was in part of it and of course there is no way to talk about the debt without talk about the fact that the front runner by thirty points in the national average right now was not part of the debate and when the front ruler is not there it turns in to a bit of a crab pot meaning everybody's just pulling each other now that there is no way to avoid that sort of optic the question is is anyone went merge from that crab pot actually challenge dona trump now here is the reality believeiter n howler still pretty early in this race it is only september twenty eighth at this point in the two thousand eight race which is sort last open primary race that we hade before trump stepped on of the scene in two thousand eight at this point there was a running gun battle rudigulyony and make lucky for thy re publican nomination in fact even in the two thousand and sixteen republican primary poles dona trump was was leading at this point but he was not way out ahead was still pretty competitive at this point another words some things can still happen now is that likely is that is that the most likely thing hat is on the most likely thing to happen however it is prettyovious that donate trump has some vulnerabilities in places i for example despite the fact that dona trump is leading significantly in i and also in new samphire when asked which candidates our being considered by voters in i an new samphire a huge number of i voters and now samphire voters are saying a they're considering candidates other then donate trumps they are not locked into trump by any stretch of the imagination anotherwords of something terrible were to happen in trumps candidates there a lot of people who'd presumably shift over right now for example if you look at that s b s news pole from yugov what it chose is that an i about twenty per cent of the voter block says they will vote only trump in new samphire that numbers abut twenty three percent which means eighty per cent an i and seventy seven per cent in it new samphire our saying that they will consider candidates other than trump thirty one per cents of voters and i say they will not consider trump at all thirty four per cent of voters in new hampshres if they will not consider trump at all and meanwhile of ask book of the voters in the middle the plurality of voters in the middle in both i and now samphire say they'll consider trump and other candidates what is happening right now is that all the people who are considering trump and other candidates are splitting about half and half for trump is o trump's got that locked in base of twenty twenty three per cent in these early states and then the other forty to fifty per cents of voters who say that they are considering trump plus everybody else are splitting about half for trump and half for everybody else since the field is looking very fragments and the same thing is happening with the people we're not concerning trump at all they are fragmenting along a bunch of other candidate it is it possible that somebody could theoretically consolidate the rest of these voters it is possible that the field would have to wino dramatically and that person would have to take lots directly away from trump t would not just be a matter o picking up everybody whose anti trump that is only about thirty three per cent of the republican base at this point they would somehow have to take the other forty five per cent the back and they would have to win that per center to the base or let split it in significant fashion s that is the state of the race as we move in to this debate now the field is to bate is pretty obvious that is going to consolidate right now there is three candidateswho are probably on the bubbleleby him shot chis christian ugburgham the take is self funded and not really running for presidents anyway and therefore he can stay in for pretty much as long as he wants with that said the field is likely to winnow and by the time we have another debate we are probably can be looking at nickel hale on to mantis penis probably will be out by that point out mansion there looking at probably valley verses to mantis is how this race is starting to shake down soup are the people definitely on an drop out whit your chis christy you are just waiting into new samphire you are hoping that the anti trump base can validate to new hamster sufficient two actually shows momentum over there but if you are looking at the state of the race right now in did their publican party valley into mantis are the two most bible candidates o i say the two most viable they are not on even footing tosantus is well ahead of daily in i and the running about even in new samphire if the cantus starts to pick up some moment on which has been restore of this campaign is the de mantis has been a solid number two and he has never caught fire that is been the story of the campaign far again i am somebody who is very support for governor to mantis an the you make a phenomenal president i nickel hailed i been supportive of governor to mantis and his candidacy pretty much this entire time in turns of whodwifink would make the best president among the candidates are on the stage well with that did everybody's still waiting for his campaign to actually initiate and that that there is been sort of a stagnation to the race it is been a very stable race basically since jury since tune jury when when disantuis first to jump into the race did the debate change anything last night o the short answer is now the bate change nothing dona trump basically used the the war games a strategy the only when he move is not to play don't trumpton show up he realize that if he did show up he'd get attack by all the other candidates on a wide variety of issues he was attack by them anyway for not showing up instead he decided tat he is going to jet over to michigan and who is going to do an event with a few auto worker is in and claim solidarity with the members of the union over there we not union has shun him and there just licking the boots of jobidon wo simultaneously licking their boots as well with that sad him avoiding the debate naturally means that everybody in the room is fighting each o the and not tonal trump which is that win for dona truck and that sort of the dynamic laser's a lot o people talking over each other people trying to get aggressive people attempting to fight each other and it turned into a mass it is a bit of a dog's breakfast will gets that

of coverage because they actually value you that is pure talk dot come slash chipuro pure talk wireless four america by america i are let us jump in to the debates last night the debate was moderated by a person from units on which i i do not understand my fox news of partnering with univisian that that is a far left network it is sort the names and b c of the latent community his banixsand and latino ware voting republican or considering voting republican in the primaries they are not watching univisian and and every question that came out of univisium was was by the left it is sure vary from fox business and you ad my friend want a person from fox news and through no fault of their own and i cannot plain the modern its is easy to blind modelers but it was just it was just a pile up it was just a twenty car pile up on the my ninety five that is all it was shut that it was complete car crash pretty much from beginning there is a lot awkwardness wat a weird moments some entertaining moments but now for those who suggestive the debate over all it is not a commentaries an one individual candidate the debate over all was relatively unwatchable that is true if it was a it was a not watchable the now again i think that some of the has to do the modern some of it has to do with the way that these tomatoes are don when i person is asked ta question every other much on the stations to be cut that is just the we this laugh to go and then when the clock expires then the mike should be cut it should be that simple if you strictly set the rules then the rules have not been set but nobody does that in these debates it is dunno incredible to me i do not understand why fox news does not just set those rules right at the outsets you at let have some sort of order the problem is they right now you've seven people on that stage all aggressively attempting to eat the microphone and get into that that camera with the red light on and they have no intensive to stop sir there is a tun of people talking over each other the there is a a ton of sort of non understandable none else were bulorga it just sounded late late gray noise over your ear just on an optics level it was not a god debate now as for the particular candidates nick valley came in with some someblin to momentamen i say some one someone i mean again if you leave a polling atom she is doing better new samphire than she was she is down better an i than she was she is still third right now two the mantis by a pretty significant margin in i up and she is now in the scrum in new hampsure meaning if she is second or i she is tot er if she is forth it con all the same because the reality is that is trumpet fifty and the its to mantis and christy and valley all between nine and thirteen presents she is got some there's no question that nickel has gotten some momentum off of the last debate u and she came in very aggressiveshcam in very hot meanwhile the mantis was planning presume to stick to his playbook his playbook is every time you come to me am going to give you my accomplishments and floored which is a fine playbook that is totally five you are a butted some attack some really i think scurries attacks by moderators talking about for example the florid education plan to band critical race theory but it was not in me a moment where he serve elevated as always these these debates are not friendly territory for is mantis because he is at least on the stage of the front runner an he is second to trump everybody a second to trumpet he his on the stage the front ruler which means she has to fend off all this attacks the value apparently had a personality transplant he went from the first debate where he was just aggressively smarmy over the tops smarmy and just grinning we're are the whole time and and insulting everybody on the stage to much more humble the stand he must have got en the expels from the last debate and seen that it actually blunt impel about his momentum and he decide to change it up sits got by contrast decided that he had to get more aggressive because he is also seeing those poles an what they're saying is everybody thinks times got as nice kind nobody knows why he is on the stage christy christy was just christy christy the one thing you have take for chis christy that you is always christy christy he is never not chis christy he is always christy christy except when he is getting tonal trumpicok but aside from that he is always chis crispy i and then tug burghal no one knows why and mike pence he again i i the vice cresenem he brought a heavy dose of awkward last night just in terms there is a lot of cringe to the debate watching this debate felt watching the earliest episode to the office before they'd her a hit their stride where is all super cries humor not shrift your even allot to laugh or not ay the debt by gan with several of the candidates nocking dona true fer not trunk up to debate which his perfectly appropriate doll true isothere publican candidate for the presidency he should show up for the debate and every moral level also on ever strategic level he definitely should not trump for the debate anus con a point out that strategically speaking when you are winning by forty points and you don't true to the first debate and nothing happens your numbers there is literally no reason or you shop to the second date gad be of course all the other candidates are going to are going to attack trump over this chis christy led the pack and attack and trump for not trunk up tot debate with the running gun battle for heaviest those of crunch last night i mean this is lake fatal dose of cringe here from chriscristy now what a look of that cabala now tell you donate i know your watch you cannot help yourself i know your watch o cay and you are not your to night not be cause o poles and not because if you are in shipments you are not here tonight you cause you are afraid to be on the stage on defending your

said that yet that not not not good line there from cries crispy hes tacks off strong there any thin you are not here i know your watching there you are to watching is because your is because you are i as a i thought maybe he is going to go to lake needles in back to the future too sthecause you chicken you chicken make fly you i a salad stuff there from a from cries crispy hay will get to i more of this of this bleep so debate in just one second first as ism on the road and ism on the road i god tell you ism even less inclined to yo have fruits and vegetables because the food in israel is fantastic buti'll tell youwhat is still bad fruits an vesterbals but you need the fruits of veins because they are the thing that keeps you alive and healthy this why i reason balance of nature balance of nature fruits in venues are great way to make sure that you are getting essential nutritional ingredients every single day through balance of natures advanced could packing process the bitumen's minerals and fight citrins of the fruits in venues are preserved sennit that vital intuition in every capsid balance of nature's a whole food supplement with no additives fillers extracts synthetics passivizes ranituger the only thing in their capsule pure fruits and veges balance of nature sin the bunch of that product down to the studio from i him to try and we all of them producers

keepers than can also i be having balance of nature stuff when you are discipline enough take care your health you rep the benefits your body will thank you go to balance of nature dot come use a promalcoat our pixel for thirty five per cent off your first order as a preferred customer that is balance of nature dot come promicothur pig for thirty five per cents off your very first preferred order okas christy was not the only candid who called out true for not being there to mantis also called out trump and this obviously is a much better celebrated attacking what are your you are you donate up mamammamma the this a this bitter here from thesantis where is jo bison he is completely missing in action from leadership and who else is missing an action donor trump is missing in action he should be on this stage to night he of i to you the and his frater ere they added seven point a truly in to the dead that set the stage for the inflation that we hat i go say this is governor florid we cut taxes we ran sir cosses wee pate down over twenty by present of our state dead and i bed od wasteful spending when can my does can is your president when they send me a bloating spending build that is tat a cops your prices to go up ism in to take out this pe do and and ism we to sender right back to them and that is a good pitch from onestansis now again does that damage trumpet any serious way mean trumps not even there and unfortunately huge percentage o from suppers do not actually hold him responsible for many of the things he actually did while he was in office but if you are one launch an attack on trump that is the proper attack on true come the fend your own record can meanwhile makpence decided that he was going to woman mana with cries crispy in the awkward lane a he decided that he was going to talk about yeas asked about join showing up you a double you strike he was asked about on a true shoring up in speaking michgan an when he was askedabout biding he he dropped what he thought i thing was a preplanned laughlines first rule of debate do not have preplan laughlines you cannot predict when people are going to laugh particularly when you are laugh lines are this awkward here is my pence talking about jo widen on the picket line week i do disagree with something to cut just si jo bison does not belong on a picket land he belongs on the employ e line and then on he looks into camera waiting for waiting for people to laugh or no or not now first mall he's trimming off o all pagan it is an old real regulating his is recessions when your neighbor loses his job in to pressing when yo lose your job and recovery is when jimmicarra loses his job as he is basically can a twisting that line a do ya the the crowd is a no that were over let a led balloon ay meanwhile nickel hale i she show very aggressive last night sheobvy sleeps camped up and you could tell from from her manner singe poorly last night it was just that he was very aggressive per formancefrom nickel hale which was can of a difference from her last debate performance which i thought was actual very good i here is nickel on a immigration for example and what she saying is totally right it is just that again when you are when you've watching these things the cat in sort of matters o what happened that when to biding wave the grain flag it told everybody to come and now we thin six known people cross the border we have had more satin of that if told america and the arc meet n amour aft gan a tan words combined we need to mac i that we are a country of laws the see that we stopping a con her laws we give up everything that country was founded on we happy to to cure the border the way we do that it is first of all de fin tanker tits you see what happening an philadelphia right now with s got a stop is all this is good by nickyhal la all this is good panicky kalian start off the debate in this mode as you will see a little but later on in thedebate she kept getting more and more grescipid again she start us od there is a reason why in this group of candidate halon in to wants our currently doing it the best ay meanwhile evade was there and om again i grew the lot of what take was to penning on the day and i an evade yesterday was talking about the the southern boarder and heres what take had to say out southern border militaries the southern border stop funding sanctuary cities and end foreign are to mexico and central america to entry insentips to come across but i do go a step further you are right about that alias i favor ending birthright citizenship for the kids of illegal immix grinding this country no the left a howl about the constitution and the fourteenth amendment the difference between me an them as a really read the fourteenth amendment what it says is that all persons born or naturalized in the united states and subject to the laws jurisdiction thereof or citizens nobody believes that the kid of a medical diplomat in this country enjoys birthrightcitoenship not a judshal for legal scholar in this country will disagree with me on that of the kid of a medical diplomat does not enjoy birthright citizenship then neither does the kid of an illegal migrant who broke the law to come o e tokens o whet the thacasang them by the way actually is is a good legal argument that it as been a very very long and an interesting ongoing legal argument among consevetabligle scholars where the birthright citizenship actually was ever meant to extend to kids of people who are subject to another jurisdiction if you are a medical citizen beyond america citizen you come here and than you's drop kid you it's that kid there frown america citizen as a case from the supreme sort in the late nineteen century a sort of suggest yes this ness birthright citizenship is the way that that this is done i proving a constutial amendment to overturn thatchers aringbollad he could do with an active congress or not is an interesting legal argument this was the the debate the bake who showed up and much better de bate take the problems that there was hang over from the last lobate the bate and last of a vice was really of noxious a he is i have got om state and he suggested that every single person who was a who's on the stage was bought and paid for which led you him scout actually taking out a baseball bat and clobbering wit a on the state and it was really this point the to mate where thing started to get out a control o front from here on in i the beginning you had some people manes

from last to bate is the evade piss everybody off and everybody decide they are going take they are venge heros up pence slamming romaswammy i he again he he they they were going atom a take also because he use everybody on the stage being corrupt and now they'll do y you tried to cut a deal with the same chines business partners the under biding cut to deal with here her's pence first let me a g a we the we pull out a this business teal and twenty er tan and chid at must oft about the time you decided to start voting and precedential lection election let me let me speak to the sionober one o that get were don there that say that is all we need from from pence but again just de demonstrative of the kind of your that people had for take on the stake nickel hailed also could not stop going after evade last night this started off actually when the take romasuammy was asked about ticktock he had this very weirdflipflip on tiptoe re said ticktock shul be ban and then he made a big statement bout how he was going on tie tockenout listen i think ticktock should ben ism on tiptoe because my view of this is pretty simple ism to o over the balls are ism no for tables barbecue thtotherwise the bad guises get the bolls if ticktock is available two people ism not count precedents not available have the same view of this that i have about ballet harvesting or about early boring when these things are available you have to use them because the other guise are going to use them and that is at that kind of what awake says right you are ut then he can t goes further an suggested may we should not ban tictocta here as vague talking about tick talk is bound a got a go the issue devices because of its is to the chief god yet you join tic talk after do we also and influence cha who should the collandin she be easily persuaded why influence the answer as i have a radical idea for the republican party wen he to win elections and part of how we want elections is reaching at the new generation of young america where they are when i get into office up an very clear kid's under the age of social under meet of sixteen should not be using a deceive social media we are only go a ever get to declaring independence from china which i favor if we actually win case you voids the question whether toe ban ticktack or not and this leave sticky hale getting very aggressive and some of e f others a good moment for nick half i she do not thing this god moment for nice half be cause again nick whale's entire approached has been very genteel a specie's been aggressive enough to attack people but tom yet i do not lean this moment went over for her particular were sit infuriating because take om as one of the most dangerous for me d asidhat we gat had and what you've got i honestly every time i hear you i feel a little bit damar for what you say because i a o e no a we e no a that that tuition what her down in the kinin fifty million people are on tie to that mean thin can get your in tax that can get your financial information that can get your e o that it gin just say ta thin i the is s o ta us e i no t r tat e i a the ti is very an o won a ta you join you you to ta of man main in china omen you o waning in grin on the social media tartan is for a you wen you ere a bis is wit the chin that a inner bin i not to we cannot shot you we toad of you we a tin as ti t i i i i i i i he kept going than then and then league had it is many lesion be attacking each other upon the stage when literally last debate that is what he was doing again the person who was rising up from the scrum in all this was to it his steadily which is arista over the side yer a you got under your carcrashthing um to belie over here in mainly succeeded did one of one of us moments that distances had last night was his moment on abortion he as a specifically that a portion policy the his goal trump has been incredibly aggressive in calling out to dances is six week abortion ban in the state of florins in fact going far as to suggested it to moral to pass party bills in the states which again i do not see how any proline person can say that you can say having it is tactically wrong to suggest a a hearty bill at the federal level because not going to pass and is just going to take off in to pennyvoters i understand the tactics but to suggest as a pro life or that it is bag to passage bill is of course ridiculous here is ta sand is the answer on abortion a portion was on the ballet and six stays and twenty twenty two republicans lost all of them net here a parson i likely beyond the ballet and arizona that is a must wan state governor to mantis how are you going to win over independent pro choir bothers and arizona same way we did in florid we want the bigreatis to re publican victory in a governor's rates and the history the state over one point five million bones we were winning places my me a county pom beats hat nobody thought was possible a because we were leading with purposing o vices and i reject this idea that pro likeness are to blame for mid terms defeated i thing there is other reasons for that a the former president a though he is missing in actionstod night he is had a look to say about that he should be here explaining his comments to try to say that pro protections are somehow a terrible thing i want him to look into the eyes and tell people who been fighting this fight for a long time ya no good for hisansis good answer an then of course the since has got attacked over supposed misteaching of slavery in the statesngand this a good defense by discants here was i the reporter from unifies you in an t this the leftie question from ait from an mason latino reporter mean is ten basically what univisin it is a eternal mason be we suggesting that the teaching of slavery in florid talks about the mass of benefits of slavery which of course is not true we tie not his ostensibly an the programs folie it very much resembles the associated press standards of the the the the privet of the prior teaching standards then replied in state of flora our pretty much mirrored here all was is that slaves could use skills to wondering slavery opportunistically in order to advance their lives after slavery that is not mean slavery good thing tesla it is the something o suggesting that if you if you went to jail and then you somehow got it agree while you ran jail you used that after you once job me jail was great for you is me jailing amazing blaze in any case here is i here is it diseases from bunting this ridiculous question slaves the bit of skill we can some instances cut be a like pit the person o befit you has tat slave the bit of skill in spite of slavery not ecosofit but many our skill hurt for the sentence of slave this is persona what it is your message to them first of all that is a hokes that was perpetrated bike coal hair a sing we are not to be doing tat one second of all that was written by to sentence of slaves he is are great block history scholars we need to stop playing these games here is the deal our country's education system is in the cline because its pops dining doctor nation to nine parents rights we eliminated critical race story and we now have a medical civics in the constitution in our schools in a really big way just president pagan ass fore and is far wile dress back in nineteen eighty nine florid i showing how it is don worse standing with parade and acids or benefit then him scout again the this is where these debates sortitanigoff the rails and it is a show who has limiting who dis not i do not badly calibrated attack attack hero to ones him scout going after thisantis on the slaverything is is really scirrhous it is really scirrhus ans beneath timscot for shore your ascot going after going after onto mantis on the standard which again he's to ridden back by onto mantis who is written by a group of black scholars in florid tears a erygeamin quality tin slavery t n cool sou just takin the once sin of cow my to us ism sorry the e the that is ridiculous that istriicks no one is suggesting it is slavery had redeeming qualities no one suggesting that an over times got to do that again gross do not it hand will get to more of thedebate in just one second first as much as i love watching bastion rooting for my whitesoks i got s his my whitest are awful this your a truly historically awful team which means i not enjoying t as much as usual i halter him protects to make him more enjoyable prospects is the easiest and fastest way to play daily fancy seaports i pick totosixplayers an you choose when thy will score more or less than their prospects projection if your if your whipsaw fount alwaystaking under he can went up to

slashed house protocol ban for a first deposit match up to one hundred dollars as priapic dot come slammed with promocoben far deposit match up to one hundred dollars o ka ism but hard on take he did have one sort o shining moment in the bat last night and that was when he discussed transgender's which again dow trump was asked can a man to come a woman the hesitated in an interview a national eve about that be take certainly did not have any hesitation on that question i have to be very clear about this trains gengerism es specially kids is a men toll health disorder we have to act knowledge the truth of that for what it is i mat two young women early in this campaign may a corransarit an school parents have the right to know and what the hypocrisy of this is even new samphire fail tally cetpassipese of legislation here the very people who say that this increases the risk of suicide or also the one saying the parents do not have the right to know about that increased risk of suicide and ism sorry it is not compassionate to firm kids confusion that is not compassion that is cruelty i mat two young women closing kat early in this campaign whore in their twenties now regret getting double mastectomies and the misdirect to me one of them will never have children and the fact that we youlou that to happen in this country is bar baric i will bans ran out the genital mutilation or chemical visit is all good from from awake the teethe biggest issue of the bakes sir sort in terms of sort f how e speaks to camera is that every issues the same level of intensity but what he says here is of course absorb right naturally he is then hit immediately with a fact shack suggesting that transgentersim is not a mental disorder spoil oil er it is a mental disorder it is literally in the d see former and the ahem five and it's literally in the d ahem which is a which e list of mental disorders generous forgo or gene identity disorder i get the debate concluded with pretty much everybody trying to explain who they wanted to leave the race what they thought the race was about in the end they're really only two candidates on the stage when running to be the presidents of the united states in the end desanston half everybody else is up there for different reason and you could see it in the answers the last dit question danaprin targeting lot of craft for this because she

the nomination o back can remember you was directly competitive with dona trump the vague is running to b a center from a highish trumps indorsement or he is running to to get a pod cast or he is running to do and whatever it is he is doing he was asked why are you running when you are basically just a a true many me and his answer was well i am a true anyway and n hereof i think trump was an excellent precedent but the america first to agenda does not belong to one man it does not belong to donate trump it does not belong to me it belongs to you the people of this country and the question is whose could unite this country and take the america first agenda to the next level o a the thercaci fid the promise that is running it is a quit extent began do that he is an excellent present i love his agenda and we need to take it t the next level he is standing right daring meeting you forty points do leg that that is some people here are running and some people here are not running there

halo be minus tor van ill give a we s play triste see the we minus en that donate dock joke was just painful might pencil does timscoto d and dug bergamot sure his great in understand in meanwhile donate trump again played the organ's tray the when he moves out the lite he instead decided to head on over to plintntownship michigan where hes supposedly speaking to auto workers unclear how many actor workers actually showed up to this thing since the a be as in jobiton's pocket because he is in their pocket he says in a robbers of pocket being in in any case donate donate trump goes there and he and he speaks about the auto workers and get some have lines this is smart politic can by trump again he he is he does have an inmate instinct for getting attention and for misdirecting me cameras to a place he wants them be which is wet is all fired frustrating that for the last eight years donate trump his not use that magical powerless direct attention where it should be in any case he goes to michigan and and he jumps in on on his trade o trunk suggesting that globalization or what he calls globalism not quite the anything may the globalism is responsible for ut for what is going on should give me for more years and i will give you the end to this horrible globalism that is killing our country i can yo to re turn of the united states of america the greatest an stronger a us nation a i on her to gan the we will this manor the corrupt power structure that is feasted an the suffering of the america auto worker and the workers of any kind not just to workers workers of any kind we will cast for power the financial forces that have turned america cities and to ghostouns to build skyscrapers in banging china we will wield every lever of government to defend you ant to hold accountable those who a profit from the betrayal and suffering up the america factory workers story as your forty seventh president of the anentstates i will be your protector i will be your advocate and i will be your greatest chanting the grinscha an i i that about of the suffix trust i think that manufacturing rousing an come flowing back into the united states thanks to president trump i candy i do not i do not think that anybody has the capacity to bring manufacturing cobs nineteen fifty stay manufacturing jobs fact tor the united states that is not what the statistic show however is that a solid mid western russet pitch sure it his better pitcher is going after the by administration for the electric vehicle mandate this obviously is true here is here is truck yesterday in michingan en dey want i will terminal by in electric voice panda i will can tole recon calling regulation that i striction america auto workers i will unleash a thing called america energy stop the ban on the in turner combustion argon and we will rill bad dill an we will i and ism again all of that is got any smart for true to go to michigan gets attention away from the date now the biggest issue that trump is about to face is actually this fraud case believe here not all of the criminal violations that he may or may not have committed i think three of the four criminal cases are basset think one on classified documents is very difficult for him to defeat just in the in the actual court of law because he says tape that he does the grime but those are not really the bites threats in the biggest threats him in the thing ism ism sure that he is worry the most about is this fraud case in new york now the fraud cases absurd it is from surd case law in the state of new york i looked it up yesterday the law in the state of new york suggest that the government is capable of what they call disgorgement of profits of a business even if no crime has action ben committed against any one s they are not charging wit the crime they are not they are not convicting you of fraud you have not to fraud in any one in the sense that the person who you supposedly bamboozled is not suing you it is meou and i make a real state deal i inflate the value of my real state assets ism inflatingthe valued by real state assets you make me the lone we both profit there is no loss by you in the state of new york you do not have to show loss the state of new york does not have to show loss there is enough to ben criminal fraud they can then push for disgorgement of profits by filing a civil lost and that's precisely what happened in the state one york to the tune of two hundred and fifty million dollars against trumps businesses which is wild i mean that is wild that is a that is that is a crazy regiment of law that if they detect they think civilly that you committed as series of frauds andotherwore to just completely kept inflating the value of your assets in order to a get deals at at lower intrestrats the make new you inflating they gave the lone anyway the stake can then come in post fact after every one is benefited and done great and the state has got more taxes was everybody degrade and they can disgorge the profits from you by identifying a pattern or practice of fraudulent conduct it is winning about finding at harm there is no harm now normally in a case h have to show harm here yam have to shaw harm just go after people here is what is happening in that case according to the your times in your judge ruled on tuesday that trump persistently committed fraud by inflating value of his assets and strip the farmer president of control over some of his signature new york properties there is a real prove for true if all his properties going to receivership that is a heavy duty burden on his sets if he is using those assets to say take loans out against the assets in order to raise legal funds that is not available to him it is a serious issue for him elect totally speaking according to the you times the surprising decision by just as author anger is a major victory for a turning general at is names in her lookout against ta trump effectively deciding no trial is needed to determined that he had frauginally secure favorable drums on ones an insuranceteels nemesis argued that trump inflated the value of his properties by as much as too going to billion dollars and i seeking a penalty of about two hundred fifty million doll less in a trial schedule to begin is early his money now if that goes forward and these properties are putting receivership what that means that trump cant manage his on businesses those business is now god to the hands of a third party receiver who decides how to dispose of the assets two pay off creditors for example and one of those creditors now would be the state of new york to the tone of to in or fifty million dollars true for his part said that justice en grow was a democracy call them deranged while the traveled determine the size of the penalty andiron's ruling grace of of of the biggest punishments at names sought the cancellation of business certified gets that allow some of trumps in york properties to operate a move that could have major reproductions for the trump family business the decision could terminate his control over a flag of commercial property at forty wall street and lower manhattan a family estate westchester county the trump tower an midtown manhattan his golf club in west cheater it would not dissolve the company but the decision could have a sweeping in pact on the companies new york operations would shut down in entity that employs hundreds of people working for him in new york effectively destroying the company this is a serious full front to assault on donate trumps financial wherewith all his asset base in the state of new york which is where the majority o his assets are located and not only that encumbers the assets for his kids even if trumpet stuff off the political stage to morrow even if god forbid him they were to happen him to morrow it would then encumber the assets for his children this is a real threat two donate trump because it bean if he does doe that money to run his campaign where some one on to come from presumably ton keep coming for downers or owning money to his campaign he's going to use it to pay off all of his legal bills none of that moneyscgins newsmen on electioneering is corn's i rout election inter french this case actually might be the largestack of lection interference in the entire election cycle and that something people should take in to account again if what you care about is victory over jobidon massive burdens on the republican front runner make it very difficult for him to win yes there been some position poles for donate trumpet in the recent pass where also your and a half out from the election four criminal cases have get to take place and if his assets going to receivership he is got a serious problem on his hands herein lies the problem and this is the case that really nobody made the toe bate last night it is a very simple case no one on the stage is lost to jobidon here is only one person who is lost to join donate trump lost o join an twenty twenty run me right that is what every one all stationed ben sang the last night run me i do not lot tobidon you dinsyht poles but those same poles suggest that donate trump is running dead even with jobidon and again donate trump though those pulls had killed come as can be dona true there is only one thing we do know is that in an actual voting just donate trump lost two jobidon and if your ruling take tat risk again go dona trump but whore he could go with somebody who has not lost to jobidon before if vac trobidons made petty clear that he would to run against dona trump my that is the case that everybody basically should have ben making on the stage last night and nobody action made that case which is always kind of surprising to me again the poles are l over the place eyes another pole out to day from the economist you go and shoes bid up five inside the space of a week you have an eighty see this wash into postpothrom trumpeter and then you have ne comes tumor poles showing by nut five i that is a fifteen points wing that is were the hello i do not now where the polls are whet i do knot is that trump has very major steal hurdles that he is been to have to overcome then he is he this not in easy election for him by any structure the imagination and every single legal join comes down against him justify d or unjust fight it does not father whether decision is right or whether the decision is wrong the unloving the matters is whether it stops from from from beating jobidoen and meanwhile pavan knew some who is desperately hanging around in the hopes that jobidin dies mean that that is all i can imagine he is doing here because the years twenty twenty four not twenty twenty eight his sitting governor californium he shut up at the debate he crash the party and shut up at the debate i do not no one knows why except that that you desperately wants attention best mean i saw about him recently is every time pavan news from smiles he looks a move villain who just poisoned you which far cha try i jet set it in from the nineteen eighties is the the lead character in america psycho is young takin in the back room put none him put on some hip to be square in are going at you with an ax gavenusm in any case here is gavenusom crashing the party governor won i gain e tear o o be oi me i think it will be clear true comes out the gone force after the stop i in this is the ex this it en e cannot a sain this is may be may be o ispresiect what you doing is guys are getting laoosnitinn close is notion in viand i wets most intestine mes e the ex nasectwher the exon the so a and run gas the i whatsit the way o the prospect o be the nomen to we some game binary hoist the the day sot o a hoist pose gene the gas come a consider and the thing is themselves r otherwise the wasting everybody's time and i say ti e loving expect n what are you doings in then some of the advertising bin this count i time bat he on want o to i because they know that on the mill again i repeat the question what is this due is doing there what is he doing there do you shut tabs i feel gansranimally he shut to the j v gam j my volley boy game on a on a random wednesday night is that is thatching that you do we her very strange behavior from gavenusm then gavenuwsome drops and even stranger thing we know that gavenusum is slated to have at the end of believe next month he is on to have debate with on to mantis and should be really interesting he is an he is are two very different visions of governing the country the basis wants the debate because he wants to beheld to take it two gavenusum and demonstrate since he s his piedmont debate him that the stand in for biding is very bad governing he is hoping it will give taboos news wants if he is anything that they gets gavenusumoun ten is something gavenusum wont gavenusom then bizarre went on a went on a show on a and explain that because rontosantis his debating him this is qualifies him is president which is superweird tag is the news has been following around to mantis asking for debate and finally tdosantitur round to t r what is do it and then newshims ha you cannot be present cause you are dating me we take pavan o bag a debate between you and on to sand this nonmember thirty boxing channel on entity in georgia without a crowd i just the two of you why are you doing that and what is your strategy and i do not know that is the right present is he down is the i question he is running i the ism not sure after to night but curry's many for present instance a you think he till gan o bi an you thin is till the a candidate of ember third using at any question part of me wonders you the fact that he took this to bat the fact that he took o bate he relation to this the bat is he is completion closet a the present insane that is my humble replies that your bating an with the debate o foreign he was the bating a is women when he for president when he is when e for present he showing o it the ratan library hollow ground and he puts out an ad to day not firs president sampan to promoted the bat against the governor aliform i mean this give distracted in he is a big weirdham he is a big big weirdham debate me but if you do debate me that means your bad is it is a very weird take from avenue om who is again just sitting around hoping the join die let us be sealed office it is all he wants in life these he figures that since he is running a shadow campaign if that happens then then he picks up the pieces meanwhile again mobiles ad ministration continue to be asleep so is the thing that is keeping republican's competitive in this race p buddhijadge the secretary of transportation who theoretically should be the one involved in was the sectary of transportation in the you a double you issues or sector of labor should be in to not yobidon cordon shows up the picket lines we discussed yesterday on the program in one of most corrupt acts of ever seen from the united states president he shows of whet in a you a double you had in the middle of a labor dispute which is totally grazing and buddhijadge was asked does he support the u way double us agenda since the way soul he wants a thirty two our french work wee the they want a forty present parades of next four years cost of living adjusted they want de fined benefits pension plans they want the moon the sun and stars do you did you think by in green that bud judge cannot say yester that because he does then bindlesslike a shill since that he tries to way the question they are asking for a forty per cent pay in care for say we things that tons the presidents support what they're asking for specifically but i cannot spent to individual terms there in contract i you stations being worked out at the table to day an you cannot speak to thus i have not could who speaks he fact end the president went were you a double you had on picket line he speaks that gent this misadministration is just awful meanwhile the d de administrator is out their admitting that sentinel is pouring into the country a mexico and tat wise the order open to all about the gather an explain why it is difficult scope first of all i think we shown start even at the be get at which is that mental is the tat lea strike tract we have ever faith it is also incredibly cheap to make and it is easy to transport are his because these tiny quantities the amount confer on the tip of a pencil are are deadly and this has concretely changed the faith of narcotic training in the world these are man made synthetic trugs starting with these chemicals coming from china going to mexico where they are made intephentinal powder and then often past into pills the powder and the pills are coming a cross into you at ism then why is the the border open that would be the big question and jobidn' very very bad at the presidencies it'll a time for some things i and then some things that i hate things that are since ism an israel i constantlyget asked for you non travel recommendations while you area israel here is one of obit off beaten fathers tons of amazing stuff in jerusalem r there is amazing sights pasta but here is one that the pigswill really there is something in israel it is in a splice call bit cherish call the biblical museum of natural history and it is very very cool basically this museum was started by a rabbi who looks at the bible in light of science and he goes through the bible and he and he looks it what the language of the bible means with regard to animals for example when it talks about deer in the bible the word for deer actually means ball but because people were translation the bible weren't living israel that no the species that actually they were talking about when they translated the bible and you actually have to go back to the original it is it is is very interesting and cool stuff it is again a merger of science and religion that is really worth the visits is would go checked at out the biblical museum on natural history to my kits there yesterday and it was indeed a lot of fond if your looking for more travel recommendations if you ever come to israel ism happy to give them in fact i thin ore not be putting to more material than your future about some places you should in definitely should not go if you are visiting around hero gate time for some things that i hate they last night in philadelphyet every liquor store in the city clothes every single liquor store in the city they close because several locations were looted shortly after the conclusion of peaceful protest against they judges decisions to dismiss all charges against a former philadelphia police officer in a fatal traffic stopshoting the police made dozens of rest following tuesday night's luting and they said they are prepared make more of things got out of hand on wednesday evening out of out of concerned for public safety they shut all forty nine redo line and liquor stores in philadelphia which is the the sign of a well functioning cities you shut all of your retail establishments because you are afraid that people in a outta living crab out of it in fact there reshape of juveniles looting mulspal stores in philadelphia this was tuesday night here is hat look lauders ransack inseteritic for first then policemen tat port richmond and outta philadelphia as caravans of kidsantin roe fast from location to location here is what we have learned overnight at least twenty people are under a last two guns or re covered at least one bole car was damaged and there are no report of injuries and detent reading tilinhaw liveanthetertadin near one the bis is lured a rend police say the letters we taking advantage at ta peaceful protest involving the deadly shouting of any advisory her police calling these lauders criminal per tunes to a went out after this peaceful protest had ended hitting stores the lululenin this is en written housewares of busy night witnesses report being a hundred or preteens young people even some children ransacking stores it is going amazing is going grate the cops were completely outnumbered clearly the issue here is police brutality not mass criminality there is one cop there look company criminals o they a cannot hand is late u sinning there in filming an a laughing hysterically that is grape one protestor was a wat standing savor shouting everyone must eat it is a communist uprising in which everyone requires their big strain have vrybdoyou mean drink it is e liters ism anta and meanwhile people screaming that they are free phones for everyone as well as that is exciting got a got a nail that that self onshore grad yourself an fun question where are the parents where are the cops why have the cops not an allowed to arrest every single one of the people and their parents why is it that we are supposed to pretend that mass criminality if it is disproportionately of one particular race is in fact something justifiable i promise you that they ware vast vast crowds of looting white teens geans the center of philadelphia and stealing things i do not think at you be o be getting a kind of national media black out that you have ben receiving for this particular written by lasted philadelphi is not the only city that been hit by the stuff shicogo has ben hit by the stuffsyatdleas been hit by the stuff li evangelists been hit by the stuff obviously race ties into it it was tied into the protest in the first place the entire li that the police are systemically races has led to a feeling among a certain a certain small subset of a certain group that believes that they are impervious to actual law abidingness that they have a right to go into stores and an steal things now inland understand how person has the moral impotent to believe that you have the right to steal a thing where is that come from somebody obvious he feels morally justifight everyone must eat three phones for everybody laughing hysterically while people unmask commit acts of criminality in the cops there to stop them i mean this is this is society ruinous stuff but it is being the ted with a with a with kid gloves specifically because if you were to say the opposite which is criminality of any race is disgusting despicable and criminal should go to jail and we more cops to rest more people who commit criminal acts t t they all go to jail if they commit criminal acts anybody who commits criminal back show go to jail if that were the actual take then the immediate response from bluffly is proportion number black people going to jail racist terrible furious we know is exactly what happening two thousand and twenty man the wages of the wages of racial intersectionality when it comes to crime vast criminal b behavior a digits the rest of the ho continues ran out you are not in a

a quick warning there are curse words that er beeped intodays at pesos of the show if you prefer a beat version you can find that at our whibsli this america life network from do be easy chico it is this america life ism on the baker sitting in for iris lass kids have a stage where they learn to be embarrassed it begins when there toddlers but some of us do not seem to take the lesson to heart my friend jane marine item known jane for years she is to work at the radio show and her shamelessness was the quality i most admired about her especially is a woman she did not care what people thought am i acting nice am i dress chi sexy and mi being loud she did not ask those questions she was totally opinionated and scrappy jane was never embarrassed and for a pretty specific reason the way she grew up she was methodize she was taught you are not the center of the universe which made her feel free no one was wuatcion tod be embarrassed would to be would would be to assume that any one in this room or any one who witnessed this actually spends more than five seconds thinking about me and they do not why would you think any one but god gives us shut about anything you are doing ever they do not you are nothing you mean nothing in the world lit is obnoxious basically ink ha any of your actions that any one actually looking in your direction this world view that others were not judging her helped her not judge herself those thoughts just did not occur to her did you have an inner critic what do you mean by in er critic way i come again i was surprise when she takes to me and said she would heard i was looking for embarrassing stories to put on to day's radio show and that she had one a big one that she would never told anyone but her therapissed something that changed two she was and it'll get to that story in about a minute the first let me just say i love embarrassing stories i always asked for them at parties if i hear a good when it'll retell it for years some of them funny but that is not the only reason i them i think the best one say much about us reveal sides of ourselves maybe we would rather not see and to prove the point that embarrassing stories have a lot to teach us i decided to harness the power of the radio program and we asked you for your embarrassing stories people send in over a thousand of them to day will hear some of those and talk about what they reveal but we are gin to kick things off with jane story because honestly of the hundreds of embarrassing stories that have heard have never heard another one jane were it changed some one deeply her story is our first act let us call it bell of the gall lane's story starts at a big charity event at a booty hotel in every hills the night as the fund raiser for children with at peeps it is held in a grand ball room within shining excessive center pieces and some of the most powerful producers and executives and hollowed this is not jane seen she is there because she is interviewing for a job a job with a big studio a job that would be a made leaped for her and that a ton more money than shed ever ma they would met with her several times for interviews and they would invited her to night and pay's for tacit as at cannon you fun looser let us go to something more social and see how we all hit it off knowing where it is howled and knowing it is a gala share were a ball got a two p dark green dress that shows off her midriff with a giant billows skirt she walks into the event and to her surprise people were wearing business casual instead of it was not black tie and ism overdressed they are passing around champagne flute i grab one but promise myself on only get a half half of this one glass of champagne before we sit down at the table i am going into this with full control of myself i am you are there to make a good impression i am there to make a great impression on these people i want o work with them and i want them to think ism respectable and it is a heard thing i hate that i still have to talk about the world this way but when you are the only omen at the table or one of two women at a table and they are all old older white dud see times who have in a certain way have your future in their hands it does not feel great in the ball room of maybe five hundred guests there seated at the main table front in center during dinner lane's looking for opportunity to shine a moment when they'll get to know her better but it is not coming the we o guise all talking over her there is no moment to jumping in the conversation no one seems curious about her at all there they they get to the auction portion or the sundries are portion of the evening and there's a you know person up on stage is calling the the auction and they say all right let us get things kicked off here jane has an idea one time the only other time she is been to a gallant they would had an auction too and to surprise her table as a joke when they started the bidding before any of the celebrities that night lady gogaor angel basket or high glum could get in a bid jane raised her paddle it was for an item that was tens of thousands of dollars jane was brow her friends at the table knew she could not afford it but she figured ism surrounded by rich people some one will absolutely out bid me and they did the item went for hundreds of thousands of dollars everyone thought it was hilarious she looked at this table of c of and thinks i know how to spice up the evening cause have done it before ism get a throw my paddle up again i men to throw my paddle up again get things crank and have a funny story for our table to laugh about and they open the bidding and what i here is welkin a start the bidding out at twenty five thousand dollars and i shoot my paddle up in the air wit the same confidence that it will get outbid immediately and then we are moving on and then we are cooking with gas and everybody's you are a blast jane feels a rash hah i a fun she waits to be out bid and i had somehow not herd that this round of bidding was really just it was not something that any one else could bid on it was not an auction at all it was a pledge it was a twenty five thousand dollar pledge from the eight people sitting at my table it all happened really quickly after i raised the paddle they were like yea and they put the name of our table and everyone at our table up on this board there was a teeny screen a large teeny screen hanging from the ceiling and the name of the company i was with and our table number and the mount of mi pledge and i look over and the one person i know best at the table it looks he is having a a hives an attack every one else is just slack job oh my god jane what did you just do what did you just do what did you just do and ism and there nothingness or even just saying et out loud depending on how close they are to me they all just stared at me and we are how a you going to fix this for our table sometimes when something embarrassing happens to you you exaggerated in yer head think it ha bigger deal than it was but in this case no i wish i could take this away from jane and tell her her memory's wrong her memory's not cause i here to tell you yes it was that tat it really was it was that that you are not making that up that is madam davidson lane's only friend at the tale he is the i who broke out into lives as ism remembering it i just that feeling a a was we was was a the universe is different now the universes fix it fix it were off course a that i ki get om mrchency wait is i part of the panic is if if i do not stop this ism going to have to pay twenty five thousand dollars a yah cause i thought i would it what if what if there is no way out of this and i have to macks out all my credit cards no i really was can you look i cause i do not have a auction experience also my can you take it back she decides to try at the other end of this giant ball room there is an exit jane thinks there will be people in charged there they can help me she bolts ut but of her chair and heads there fast as she can through dozens tables full of people i may i really was having to be excuse part parting excusing excusing part me part me sasin just i at here i get through the double doors of the back of the room as quickly as i can and its slams shot behind me who is running the auction she ells a volunteer points or to a woman with a lap top jane rushes over and explains its all a mistake i do not have money the woman is surprisingly understanding she says what would you to i route yo i was why just been to i take it back i cannot spend that money and she is bosket and then deeply black she is in her computer and but what i and i think you oke and then i walk back in to the ball room and ism looking up at that the leader board as centrally of all the pledges and were at the top and than it disappears right as i walk back in the room it felt a spot was turned on the whole room turned e n whole rooms e backwards scratch and every one knows that i just took twenty five thousand dollars away from this charity but of course it was not lane's name that was on the screen it was the companies the one she is hoping to work for very quickly it was not o jane did it was our table did this again lane's friend madam and it was not we went from first to second er first to third we went from number one to the bottom ye i i was embarrassed i think everyone at the table was embarrassed yes we were be wouldn't you be bees and i get back to the table and i sit down and have kind of a was not that a nervous laugh am no one is enjoying that and i just start focussing on and anything but the people around my table a ism just really intently listening to the auctioneer guy and and and and we have to watch is really sat video that is a many documentary about the children in that worse was to be there to help am and they dim the lights the move is about fifteen minutes long the music is emotional it is parents in their children at that beeps talking about you scared and sad they feel how much they need treatment sitting there in the dark watching this this is the moment they hitch jane the hardest it is not when everyone looks at her it is when she realizes what she is actually done she would only thought of this evening is an opportunity for her to make an impression that was grows what i did it was rose and wrong and watching these children with his illness to a big screen i was just i am the worst person on the earth that i bid and then i took it back and then i said now e as a part of me that was cud i just take out a humor cretic curtsy at then its a title wave of what just happened and what i did and how mortifying it is just the layers of the reasons i should be embarrassed and criticizing my that euro why would you even do that why would you do that then when you did do it why would you try to get out of it the answers to those questions are uncomfortable because they force jane to see things about herself she does not embarrassment can do that it can show you your blind spot it exposed a fatal flaw that i half too pay a lot of attention to now what is that fatal fa dubious something about that made me feel my confidence had bad consequences that there was something bad about it the night ends she does not get the job and she has that ism pretty good authority that the decision boil down to her big mistake that night this stings but that is not the crux of what that night did to her it has actually changed a lot about how i i act on public ism just much more self conscious after that really i used to get superposed about going to a party and now that is kind of fraud i know this is on a sound counter intuitive but have started leaving the house sometimes without make up because it is i don't want people thinking that ism thinking about what they are thinking i that make sense i do not want any one to think i put make up on for them this is is the weirdest stuff that nowpops into my head about what other people are thinking where it'd wish i did not care have always been that way worrying what other people are thinking about me and i cannot imagine what it would be to discover this is a full on adult jane says everything feels different turn now i feel completely neutered a lot of the time nearly yet i do i feel am it made me second guess myself a lot i guess i ye writ i used to write essays about parenting and sex and i i would give advice and i would i o on radio shows and now ism just shot up jane shut up jane shut up jane shut up jane shut up no one is asking and no one wants to hear it it is crazy to me theca it do something embarrassing once and suddenly you have that inner policemen for the rest of your life is there anything h can make it go away you think i do not know i what could change it i do not now i just on have the desire it does not it is why would i want a change it that i could put another ball on on and go in embarrass myself in font of avouch people no that does not sound fun it does not sound fun any more like i do not think that the lesson i learned was necessarily all bad i not honestly when i think about the old version of me it is kind of gross in a way tats just kind of a noxious it is a that is a baby it'd honestly never thought of embarrassment as being helpful to anyone it pummels us humiliates us but lane's glad this happened to her she is glad for her new awful self consciousness she says her ego a smaller now which means that with everyone in her life she is quicker to a went when she is wrong and apologize and over all she says it is calmed her down she observes mar hangs back never wants to be the center of attention which she says is a lot was backpack jane marry is the host of thepyecast the dream o auto judgment day part of the son in ma interested embarrassment is because of this realization i had resmintly i am embarrassed of myself all the time at least once a day i break out into a rash from embarrassment a couple of days ago when i learned from a coworker that all my life have been mispronouncing the word incongruous we i get embarrass when i think people are looking at my eyebrows or when other people see my dog pop embarrassment is on me all the time and i want to get it off and one o ways my obsession with embarrassment has played out in the last few months is ism in a group chat dedicated to it there are four of us in it one of the people k s e layman i only met when we started this group any time we feel embarrassed er ducking the embarrassing we write to each other it is how i know we have both words banks for decades or that he is self conscious of his hairline or how he walks these little secrets you would never know about some one otherwise sometimes we swop stories of past embarrassments the time say was teaching a class at ass or college on hyppapa's literature and the elemi magazine wanted to to a story on him this was back when he was in his twenties they did the interview and then a photographer comes to take his picture when a library and all a me me to a and look cut you crouch most

then gaining a back then losing sum by exposing everything about his struggle with his weight he overcomes it near the end of the book he writes i am no longer ashamed of this heavy black body something else he talks about how important his grandma is to him she is funny the voice of reason in his life and she is one of the only people this never on his case about his weight and heavy he writes about his grandmother she responsibly loved me and never harm me he is disappointed her many times dot kicked out a college lost all his money to gambling but writing this book was a waitapproved er her he is not his failures and it is is attempt to fully explain himself but a time it comes out i think i on a lot of warden that i tin expecting me an with every a war i just was yew

writ and at the time i did not understand a wat i did not the i was having a panic at set because of embarrassment shame at my grandfather call an e set it was some combination of humiliation shame and embarrassment shaman embarrassment often get lumped together but when makes in harassment distinct is is always tied to other people you need an audience to be embarrassed i can be shame in my house am a a ti don't say lake i can be n shame a bull in path shame embarrassment to me is much more dramatic right i feel in you ask me stories about embarrassment there all point to e stories about how somebody saw me betas if my if i came in my house and wuss nobody day but my my granulation id that it would hurt i mean it would it were her but it would not come close an at her of having her

to look and feel not just fat but gross to my family dis you also feel you had in writing a book and working as hard as you possibly could to look at the stuff that you had overcome the capacity to feel ashamed of yourself yes i i thought in writing about among other things bodkin sex fatness and sex i i i did i fool myself in to believing that i was delivered from it and i think when i came in the from thinking a heavy wit wheel me from the critics and and being greet initially o in ta my grandmother calling me fat looking at me a fat nodi seeing anything but a fat was middle age man which he looks at me is is critic i is my griptinit the would always been the one person who never judged him and when he tries to make sense of this turn around the best he can come up with is with the success of the book and the money at brought in she now saw him as a man and in her eyes men more suppose to be productive and lean he spends the next few days with his grandma and she keeps bringing about i looks key big my he is as big as the house how d to get fat and i just think i was embarrassing to think tot a book was going to change o life and make you not look and feel fat to your family

queens i in for to make er a ta point at all i o poke used you o case of that is people cut in alive a the me another good i guess i especially love the category of embarrassing stories where people tried to avoid embarrassment and in doing that they embarrass himself to get come me here one that i gets this happened to this lady many gray from curls inlet south caroling she is a bride's maid whose dress arrives and its way too small day the wedding she evinces another brides mad one sises up to swap dresses with her ora this dress fits but it is its tight and she started to get this a rational fear that if she bulging out of her dress she is get upstage to the riding groom oh if people look at her instead of exactly this cannot happen and then this idea hits her sir ran rap i go into the kitchen i found the her ran rap i get it out and i just start wrapping when i i round and around and round an i am pinched and the dress sees up beautifully and i think yo this is gonna works air genius and out the door gap she is standing in a hundred and five degree heat at the alter s out along next to the riding ground and there is a big crowd watching and she just starts getting hotter and hotter and honor i can the old the sweat starting to kind of roll down my back an ism looking down at the floor an ism seen spots and ism a fainter i know i know what that means am i it is subtly if possible i turn round to my grandma partner and i ask him to us up my dress and of course he has no idea what ism talking about dislike what is said i mean we us up my dress he does it the and es my dress now every one knows that ism wrapped up and ran rat and are you just mortify i am just really focuststene ill not passing ow ti decide that i am going to take off she ducks away dresses open she misses the rest of the ceremony gets i water it is funny greatest fears that she as can upstage the bride groom and she does run a and than that leads her to do ex at tat she upstages the bride again it she is the thing that everyone remembers about that wedding from start to finish i am my own worst enemy in this story up said the must haunting story that came in try in box the was this one and it is embarrassing that the woman who rented does not one us use her own lame ora merging a call er my my as taking the sari this this last year she get a pi to grad school man because of loved she had to take it on line in her home office but it is a very regimented process just o they know the not cheating there is a proctor sign to watch her through a wet camp before the test i have to get them a little tor of my testing space ant it under the desk over the desk the walls just everything that they know ism not cheating we do that everything's get to go i start the test away through the test she has this pain in her stomach and she is o now she is got a go and she is got a go now she manages to hold it in till the break but then to aurora the next brig in just one minute long right wo she your messages the procurances tit can i lea even come back in a minute any tells her if you leave the frame you will forfeit the test ah and ism sitting there and i do not know what to do either i leave now i give up i go to the bathroom and do not take the jury give up gradscool or i do what i actually did what she actually does as she does the do on the floor we will staying on camera nothing is happening at a ala she she point positions er arms on the chair stopped with this mental man get not gs i get keep gone with the story which s a this is surprisingly a category unto itself we heard from four other people ho had to make this same call during he sandrdise test what i made the same decision ya a they tried to hold it in it did not work for thew what happens she seems the worst of it is over she makes it all the way to the next break its time in a break she is ballad to leave the room o join the break ya but quickly i realized then at the end of the ten minute break i had to once again give them this web camp tor o my testing aria including under my de oh my god now i realize o get the ten minute break means cleaning this up keep it in in the proctor is still watching her through her web camps she has to army crawl across the room on the floor oh to stay out of the camera s gladly exactly but you got away with it right the proctor where never saw had no idea here is the thing i was telling this story to some friends overcome and ism sitting at the same best where i took the jury and i told this story and anxiously tell laughing whatever and then one of my friends tingle quietly waits for everything to die down and then says is that impure behind you and it what i have in fool sides standing nearer behind me and i i went back to the door of the room and crawled all then and reelected everything and all i could here was them laughing i was not even sure i was i could you see it or not could you see t or not but they warrant breathing and eventually on sad at you can see everything for the thing that six out to her about this story is it it showed her new information about herself the new on from nation being it what love she is willing to stop the ice think as i think tat in much more positive way of how far shell go to get what she we section is to get that is not her take on it at all that is one of the big things with these embarrassing stories is li people never take it the positive way for the most part though they always take it the way where they are i knew all my life something was wrong with me and now i know now for ever more me getting into gradschois wanted by this experience the thing that i cannot get over with this is that it was it was a choice i man it did not happen to me it was i choice does not make git better or worse i do not known i think it m inks to worse i demo you a goo your somebody who superseded embarrassment whet you thought about e let experience tod a lot out just something that that that going to a thousand of he stories i showed you that you did not actually know before people in these emails they were tortured by this mistake state you totally embarrassed and often carried them their whole lives and and sometimes you were really small mistakes and reading i i feel get just made me think oh actually i think the problem is that we think we are not suppose to make mistakes we think wires a make through this life without doing this after the other and if you just say at of the worse my lifetime ism going to trip an fall public me tops on to fly off whet it is not supposed to yours area except that that is part of it that is part of the deal i the you bring this stor heart worming in t another your being sarcastic but your welt am i want to share one last

liked a lot an emergency room doctor they personality always smiling reliable he told a lot of funny stories about the are we are calling em out the way she remembers it they been seeing each other for about a month they slept over her place and it is the first night she stays over it his as carried is drifting off to sleep i just remember being really really tired and really needing to go to the a three and that was kind of my lost as i was fooling to sleep was ah i really to pee but i call beobleh to get up finebawthream and then i had this dream that i really need to go to the a thrum and i was looking for one and i could not find one anywhere and i was pushing this big metal do in my search for the a thrum and it was locked on i could not get thresh when i was really really frustrated and then i wo cap and i was naked standing in a stairwell pushing against a big door that wen from the stairwell into the rest of the apartment building all my god it was my mind melted just the logic of the situation just it made no sense barrette had sleep backed out of dog's apartment apparently she done this as a small child just a few times though she had no memory of it at all and she never sleep backed as in a dust it did not occur to her that that is what is happened i felt it'd completely lost my mind hat just how am i here how is this a thing that is happening how on my away carried pushes open the metal stairwell door and sees to her relief dog's apartment at the end of the hall she runs towards it and then i realize i enough this is is apartment and i turn around and looked and it was just one of those new york buildings i just a bunch of apartments to each floor that all kind of look e same and i realize i soils a nightmare it was was fill are fly i hunting night ma carriage approaches the door she thinks his dog's apartment though she is not sure what i decide to do is an nock on the door and then i run away from the door back into the stairwell before they answer and put my ear to the door i crack the door to the stairwhelsto i can hear them but i cannot see them they cannot see me this way if it is a voice i recognize i can run around the corner and into the apartment and if it is a voice i do not recognize they will not see me and hofullee they will just close the door was her pretty brilliant plan thank you thank you i do that and it is not a voice i recognize and i stop to realizes the depth of the horror of the situation ism in people can a stop getting up and going to work and i can not be there when that happens by the way i still really need to pee i me ape badly that it will not be open may me sleep work she decides the least conspicuous place to pea while naked is at the bottom of the stairwell leaning against the door to the lobby if some one tries to open the door she can push back and if some one's coming down the stairs she will hear them she swallows her pride and does it i horrified i was horrified i remember very clearly just sitting down on the stairwell and just crying this is just such a ridiculous situation that i could not get myself out of and if only i had been more aware of my surroundings i would have known that he was in apartment to be whatever it was how could i have not paid attention in the live and i remember drying my eyes and could even lite my nose on my sleeve u bring my nose on my arm and just thinking or right buck up you have to take control the situation and fix it you do not have an option just have to fix it and i started very gently trying all of the doors in the ape building her help is whatever door she came out of will still be unlocked and i went systematically floor to floor and i tried every door and on the top floor that was one upon e that i could hear voices in and they having a great time is sounded some one was having a pity if she cannot find another solution she thinks ism in a knock on this door but first she tries all the does again and then they answer occurs to her man boxes his name will be on his mail box she runs to the ground floor and sees through the door the the lobby is all glass windows there is no way to get to the mail boxes without everyone in the street seeing her naked she heads back up to that party on the top floor rings the bell and then runs and hides behind the door e woman comes out she is clearly tipsy carry calls to her asking if she come over to the farewell which the woman does how are you even able till i cover or hide yourself i mean there really is not o is just that atone one om across your bones your little hand is a filled i mean that is all you can do in that situation carried explains her predicament and asks if she can borrow some clothes the woman she's totally an face of course its happens all the time she gestures for carryhad to come on in and walks back into the party carried weight no no no but the doors closing she reluctantly follows five people are there they see her naked carry dives behind a couch the woman brings her a track suit the whole party rallies to try and help carry ad salve this situation she describes dug to them the woman thinks she knows where he lives they knock on one or two doors waking up neighbors who were not hin they call carry cell no answer eventually the woman tells carry d to just sleep on the couch carried wakes up at seven the next morning tries her fun again and gets an answer and the person on the fun is not the guy the i had been with somebody else and they really angry and he cat saying what is your name what is your name and i kept saying i want to speak to the sky and they would not hand the fun ta and is getting really past because is wall he we i e just given the fine and they said what is your name what is your name is a carried another said whats you are lost name and i said amen and then this guy gets on the for she means dug and he is just what due for where ought he is really angry it turns out while carried had been running round the hallways naked he would woken up in the middle of the night to find carry ad's clothes will it one but no care at it was she would vanished i talk to dug he did not want to be on the radio but here is what he said he looked for her everywhere he peeked into his room mates room to see if maybe she would accidentally crawled in their bed then he open the fridge then the oven before catching himself and thinking why would she be in the oven next he searched the building outside the building eventually he called one of her friends they didn't know what to do he thought she is been gone long enough with no clothes on this could be serious by now it was almost morning he called the police they shut up twenty minutes later he explained to them i was out with this girl she came back here she appears to be lost one of the officers started questioning him aggressively he is not certain if they were disturbs but he remember thinking they were probably more suspicious of him because he was black it went from the rode to a hundred fast as dug put it i remember feeling this is the most screwed up situation have ever been in this you does not believe ism telling the truth maybe thinks i killed her just as things were escalating carried finally got through on the phone care takes elevator down to drugs for when she steps out the police greet her she realizes this is who would answered the phone once she explains her side of the story they leave and its just carry out in dug i think it took me a minute to recognize the gravity of what had happened to him but i think once i really realized that at one point in the evening he was a suspect oh the they were not on your she is found that is such a white person thing to think yet ye of course of course is ye i felt the gap i felt how much we did not really know each other in that moment am but i just remember saying ism sorry ism sorry because he was genuinely very shaken up and dam and he being the largely guy that he was if he was just hind just ism glad that you are o say but i have to get on with my day they never went out again though mostly because he moved across the country a few days later this state had been planed as kind of a last night together but they stayed in touch a year later when he came back to visit he an carry had went to dinner with his friends the gentlemen t that he is i remember we were of chatting he said i have not told them about the story and i said oh it is fine if you want to tell them you could tell me said no o no no no i think he was worried about embarrassing me and then i went to he bath when i came back and everybody was cracking up then he looked to me n he said i told him i told him y i could not help it and we all laughed about it he he also left that pa out in order for it to be funny since things came out of say in the end they each tell it this a at parties they leave out the fear most of the embarrassing stories have heard an collected for this week show the person does something that results in their embarrassment mate lake we have this lady she sirranraps herself for a wedding eh there is someone who reason of paddle in an auction in goes are and i i get why they feel embarrassed but you did not do anything you did not over step you did not make mistake but you still feeling harassed yet i suppose if you take blame off the table it takes may be a set in flavor of that embarrassment you but i does not take the embarrassment away there is something inherently embarrassing about running into a room full of people you do not know naked they could still happened to you i still happened to me yet i suppose i should feel pretty bullet prep now should not i they think once something really embarrassing happens i do think you shoot across that that threshold somehow and if i fun if that say like then why be embarrassed and for a long time i would thing correct you got yourself you off this sit you at your not naked insteadwill on the low side you can figure a says ani ending the show there someone who was not just embarrass she lived the experience that is a

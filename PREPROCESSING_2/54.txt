point four million dollars in taxes hunter by now between twenty sixteen and twenty nineteen a period where he has acknowledge struggling with addiction again that is the associated press noting that hunter should basically be let off to hook for not paying millions in dollars of taxes because he liked the drugs but as the indictment points out hunters taxfailures post date his addiction issues as though any one else could claim that their addiction was responsible for their failure to pay their taxes prosecutors no quote notably in twenty twenty well after hunter had regained his sobriety and when he finally filed his out standing twenty sixteen twenty seventeen an twenty eighteen forms ten forty the indictment says that if and men did not direct any payments toward his tax liabilities for each of those years prosecutors say that hunter subverted quote the payroll and tax with holding process of his own company by with drawing millions outside of the payroll and tax with holding process the maximum sentence for bison's alleged crimes seventeen years in prison the fence attorney abylowl blamed special prosecutor avid wives he said that he was savings for publican presser to rescue towels had quote based on the fax and law if hunter's last name was anything other than bison the charges in delftware and now californium would not have ben brought well frankly if hunters last name was anything other than bison he would be a poor derelict and he would be in jail long ago he neverwold made this money all the money is because his last name is bison and then his immunity is because his last name is bison if his name were hunter smith he would already have been in jail for drug charges tax charges sex traffic charges violation of the foreign agent's registration act in fact special council avid wise only brought this prosecution after one o the most botch plead deals of all time in which the department of just run by hunters daddy tried to dismiss hunters tax charges by attaching them quietly to his gun charge pee a plea that left him with no jail time the whole purpose was to slimy any investigation into hunters financial relationship with job when the judge in that case notice the sneaky tactic the judge blew up the deal because when it was publicized even the apartment of justice was forced to walk away from its on deal none of that would've ben made public except for two heres whistle blowers marry sharply and josh giggler will ledge that the do jay had intervene to stop avid is from using the kind of power necessary to prosecute hunter in the first place in other words the tax charges are coming now only because the hunter biding cover up imploded now sort g to prosecutors hunter spent money on drugs strippers luxury hotels exotic cars quit in

over six hundred eighty three thousand dollars on various women as well as a hundred an eighty eight thousand dollars on a dust entertainment first fall has not the quiver looked up the internet were porn is free anyway is this the end of the hunter began story now the he is being prosecuted there is every chance that the go ja will claim that the in investigation has had its end point to spite special council wisps claims the proud remains open after all what better wait to buried jobs involvement in his sons corrupt schemes then to send that is on to jail and claim the justice has been done all after the bidanteem tried and failed to cram through a corrupt sweetheart deal with hunter no matter what though hunters can be a man our headache for jobidon all the way through the twenty e twenty four election cycle job we will have to answer for first that at tempted sweetheart do that wist tried to cut with hunters to fence teem whistle lowers as we have talked about have already a ledge that the bison do jay tried to hamstring wisps investigation those questions will be piled on top of questions about jobs involvement in hunters business given that we have years of evidence that jo was involved and just as many years of jo lying about both hunters innocent and his own ignorance jobidon's twenty twenty reelect effort is in serious trouble and it should be fillet to more

speaking of cordon's corruption long article in the walsterjurnal by the editorial board talking about how jobidon has assisted hunters business quote house investigators keep digging into the bite an family business this week it comes new evidence of the ways that jobidon helps his son using lies evil accounts heres agents shapely and bigger we talked about provided to the house wags and means committee more information from their multiform investigation into hunter bison's taxes and businesses the documents include and eleven page log showing a list of three hundred twenty seven males jo sent or recede from twenty tens to twenty nineteen under sudnims including robin ware four fives and robot el peters mister widen was a big user of those shadow accounts apparently the national artisan records administration says that it has up to eighty to house pages of males and documents sent o received under those aliases was jo was vice president the three heard twenty seventymales listed in the log are exchanges between job and hunter or erk sclera a former hunter business partner who handled the bison family finances the committed has fifty four of those exchanges are between jobidon and erk schwarin five males were exchanged within five days bisons twenty fourteen trip t ukraine another twenty seven were exchanged prior to his return trip to ukraine in nonmember twenty fourteen those trips coincided with hunters lucrative board position at ukranian energy from seriema the trips proceeded jobidons twenty fifteen roll in forcing the ouster of the ukranian prosecutor investigating seriema and it seeyonac li is love check for corruption another thirty eight males originated from within the white house and were sent to jo bison aliases with hunter bison copied the committed does not know the contents of those males but further evidences provided to congress raises serious questions about hunters roll at seriema and the political access that he was peddling an again all of hunters former business partner say that was exactly who hunter was involved in these businesses in the first place hunters former business partners have an archer previously told congress that quote melisma would have gone out of business if it didn't have the bison brand attached it to it also wagon means has new males from giggler that a revealing about what melisma wanted from hunter one is from vadimporsharsky and adviser to seriema two hunter in aril twenty fifteen again jo was veep at this time the ukrenian thanked hunter for quote the opportunity to meet your father and spend some time together in octobert twenty sixteenymale between a bluest employ blue star is one of the companies that was run with hunter bison in one of those males october twenty sixteen between a bluest employe and erk schwerren includes the news the ukranian government had ended its prove in is lovechetzky schweran congratulates the demounted to assume work the bluest employ writes thanks you brought us in take a victory lap all which suggests the job knew full well that hunter was selling the family brand again all of the stuff's can be swirling around jo and it is not that donate trump is going to be all to confront jobidnon stage about this there will bend debates ms telling you right now hoiden is not getting on stage with donate trump one f the reasons dis not gang on stage dona trump obviously issues health his senility all the resident the other is that donate trump chalk would pummelhim on the hunter stuff in this time it would have some teeth last time jokes lied about it last time said mason never did anything wrong he never had a relations with china governor dollar from china trump worn dollars from true all of that has been blown up trump would hit him with the kitchen sink if trump is indeed the nominee as expected there not con be on stage together but that does not mean these stories are going to go away surrounding jo and the chat surrounding job is the biggest threats to his potential twenty twenty four run his entire case right now is that the chat surrounding trump is bad that your better off with the chaos rather than the other chaos to a battle of chooses and all of the cha surrounding trump again is his best case that is why all of these trials are going to be damaging to trump thinks jo bison and he democrats think that now the problem for them is the gat we have been doing this for a while now if the filial a hit trump with all these trials they should aveannounced all these trials next year they hid it a little but early and that means that even while the trials are going on most america to me redeem this before now trump for his part he has file motive on thus day saying he is going to appeal a d c judges ruling that he is not a mine from being charged with federal crimes for his efforts to undo the outcome of the twenty twenty election the notice is minor procedural step according to the washington post but it sun's in motion one of the most potentially consequential parts of trumps legal saga as the first former president to be charge with crimes because again this has corned with the time line than the actual outcome of the case if the case is delayed beyond twenty twenty four and if trump becomes president case goes away his trump presume la just pardon himself or the deuce is now run by trump and you would expect that the case basically gets jumped at the altar with that sad if the case goes forward drums in spend an awful to of time an court and has trumpets pointed out these cases are a scratch the only one of these cases filed against annal trump that has any legal merit at all is the classified documents case in florid and again he is made the political case that that is in fact a political prosecution given the fact that apparently everybody who is involved the federal government has ended up with classified material in the basement now the count our argument to that from the prosecutors gan be welt yet and then they all turned it in when we found out about ears suppose to u you're shifting boxes ant all the but in the world of politics it all just looks one wall of sound one wall sound directed against trump if the idea true the bison administration is that trump is a threat because he is chaotic and also he is a fashion well when what you would need to do presumably is not look a cot a chaotic famous but that is exactly to bid administration seems to be doing on the regular and that is a problem and in fact the prosecution of trump is helping trump make that case about to bison here is trump yesterday talking about how once again this e witch hun up in washington d c and in new york an clothe rest again that case that he is making right there it had a lot less that to it had a topless feel to it when it did not feel as though hoiden was actively attempting ho stop donate trump from attaining the president we the more cases get piled on top of cases the more it feels exactly that s on the one hand you have the entire democratic party swiveling toward the trump is a phoshus message will the do jay is going after donate trump an after the do jay tried to cut a sweetheart old hunterbidon and then that in floated that is on the one hand in the other hand you have the jobidon teem trying t o say the trump is a chaos agent but the problem is the democratic party is a party of has right now nobody feels secure jobidon is the president if your feeling chaoticrae nonce okas dona trump if your feeling a sense of chaos about the international scene that is not because a dona trump if your feeling chaotic on the domestic sene democrats run the senate and democrats run the white house very difficult to blame donate trump an the republicans for that even if they are in fact a chaotic mes of a party which they are an the republican party is a chaotic mesa party no out about it the problem is for the democrats are they and there he ones in charge right now and typically when people do a bad job they get kicked out on their rears illness that in just one second first this season why not give the gifts of comfort to

bison's use of the deojetogo after trump looks pretty bad for widen if case number too is the trump is a chaos agent and we certainly cannot have a cars agent as the president well then you got a look a little but less chaotic and right now it looks jo bison is ready to either fall down or set something on fire or both every moment of the damn to day and sos is party he the democrats and congress who keep pointing at the republicans in saying their able so which again is true i mean they are just as much o a blip so and there the one tor in charge the the the radical wing of the democratic party has yet to be disown by the democratic party at see for long time which ever party runs to sanity first winds and lot either party is interested in running toward sanity at any rate of speed yesterday was a banner day for the squad in congress between defending hemal woman and defending antisemitism they really to themselves proud alexandero cost cortex it completed you she she spent yesterday defending tromalbomen for pulling a fire alarm she i got a say i will never cease to be amazed at the fact that some people consider this human being to be intelligent that is an amazing

woman moving to lasher him today new york republicans a that is a onfokest and unable to make people's cars matter that the decided to believe there chaos are getting worse i that what is to day is about they are wasting our time there wasting the country's tire o there is your party what rises to censure i mean truly the is arguments that are being made here what is next she walking we walking i mean he pulled the fire alarm to delay a vote he pulled the firearm alarm to play a vote the disease of of crazy hands by the ways getting worse and i thinks true for pretty much all of our politicians i will in fact landowner true for this h done true he has the specific hanmotions in the little boxmasley let bit out here about mostly in the to did ready in here in the icebox and then

a lota and i it is greens climate in action she is in the boxy she is in the everybody stop e the hands it is too much a ka but again back to the democratic hast the squad which has yet to be disowned by the mainstream democratic party because there the future the future is more on with double diet i cues what extremely radical in their socialism that is to the democratic part can to his own ion pressed spent yesterday when she was not stumping for truballboban a fellow idiot ion press the address member of the squash is the ring star of the squad she is one everybody for got about i but to mana press she suggested yesterday that it is important to expand access to the belabor tho sixteen year old as a boson city counts er prior to my time here congress i was proud to advocate for expanded access to the ballad box requiring balance we made available a multiple languages expanding early voting in local elections and in congress i led effed i let efforts and legislation to lower the federal voting age to sixteen and urge the reggae to aggressively protect voting rights and tho fight against motor suppression she sixteen year old to vote sixteen years or some the dumb is people on planted earth just come i mean other than members of the squad but sixteen sixteen year old about we raised the voting age to people whoa non dependent on their parents out that i you have t have independent income vote about if your dependent on somebody else than your vote ought not count that seem a better rule if we going change the voting rules h about that about of all of your income is earn from somebody else you do not get a say that mas a hell of a lot more sense than making sixteen sixteen year old heres all an allowance from their parents is ridiculous these are the democrat pagan your make the argument tat these vows ought to be the the non cat this is this is the sober party this is the sober party by the way the party is sober will not even denounce it is only anti some and mean it is full scale were she end to leave ell can o for anti commie yesterday were sheeted to leave was out there suggesting that anti schematism was being caponized to silence her because she actually is not an anti say mi despite the fact the she is a radical anti him mi to mean she age the wooden here heres we sheeted to lead terror suborder all those that from college students to those in the work place ism getting the calls of people being a push to silence being more i some people caponizing a antisemitism in a way to silence voice asnicinan all of that needs to stop america have a right to speak up america have a right to to he institutions they work at or the people that represent then to say look just as my opinion i believe you should support exurban see i an again we have to be able to mike sure that as we look at all these forms of hate that it is not being caponize in a way to silence voices myself and are many of the voices that are here she is a victim and the democratic party still refuses to say this meanwhile sorry bush another at member of the squad but just as terrible she is the bedlam member of the come squad i she says this this is hysterical honestly this is really really penny when you have democrats are now blaming that words cannot hurt anybody the entire party is predicated on the notion that words hurt people that is literally what that is their whole stick ton trumpets of fash because he says mean words to them and other headwords do not hurt anybody a special when we are calling for the death of all news that is thus just mean words here is sorry busting this routine yester be robber for the s anta for b we you'll o for o rash first of all let me just say i have condemned antisemitism eight hundred time over and over and not to ninth october the seven but this is the thing ism as much as it is unacceptable and it is i intolerable we a cant isolate the criticism of israel tut is rely government with antitimathis and we also half to stop with this i darns as then anessama this word you sat that word just at this wore it it hurt me well has lay chavicat now and do people flat a with om fine that is

five one eleven seventy two four more in formation of to speaking of a democratic party totally in all to dislocate from its radicals yesterday tape broke of a personage not a wad he is executive director of the council on america ironic relations and yours openly celebrating the october seventh comose terror attacks on his relies the worst terrattack in the west since nine eleven here a was cars executive direct r the people of gaze only the side the the brag the siege the walls of the constantration cam an october sevens and yes i was happy to see people breaking the siege and throwing

occupying pop the no have thethrie the set defense a passwords were perfectly in line but the council on america atomic relations generalized antisemitism and radicalism on october seven the date of the compass massacre care which they writhe group car national twee to quote we join the america muscle community in reaffirming our support for the palistinian people's right to freedom and calling for an in to the israel occupation which sparks the deadly violent we see again and again including to day on october seventh before any is rally response care also called for an end to america aid to israel as well as an end to the abrahamic words the group has not offered a single word condemning compass but here is the thing care remains a go to organization for both the left in media and democrats in politics in may in an attempt to counter accusations of antisemitism from inside the democratic party the white house organized a national strategy to counter and antisemitism that strategy included a group dedicated to cross community solidarity and that group this anti antisemitism group to fight antisemitism included care which the white house said would quote launch tours to educate religious communities about steps they can take to protect their houses of worship from hate incidents such as instituting appropriate security measures developing strong relationships with other faith communities and maintaining open lines of communication with local law enforcement i was care included in this enterprise well in order to support that interjectional coalition the be administration is attempting to build now the news do not really fit in that interjectional coalition of course they do not fit comfortably in the oppressor oppressed metrics that under scores left wing ideology because news are both highly targeted for hate and also highly successful but the last likes the pretense that news belong in the coalition care is the price of jewfish belonging since there is no substitute for care in the organizational coalition to represent museums jewfish groups are expected to swallow hard and pretend that care is legitimate as table magazines arm in roman size quote the aihdiellan care might not get along but they are protected by the same dynamic they both providing nearly identical service to the same larger coalition which returns the favor by keeping both groups at a level of prominence that crowds out any potential rivals that is the bid administration's program activate that interjectional coalition of the oppressed at all costs and that means covering up radical muscle hatred for gets and that means including radical muscles even in the program to fight antisemitism that was the plan at leas bid special convoy for monster in and combating antisemitism teberlipstat admitted that car was problematic in her words but said they could be included in the white house working group on antisemitism because quote if they are really willing to change if they are really willing to say hey we now see this as a serious problem than they are welcome but of course car was not willing to change that was obvious from the word go to actively opposkamas would violate karat entire reason for being the roots of the council on america atomic relations are fascinating in frightening as prosecutor anna earthy writes in his book the grand had comas supporters gathered at a maria hotel in philadelphia on october twenty seven nineteen ninety three with the intent of creating a new public relations organization in the united states those coma supporters included one oar ahead president of the salami association for palestine concerned about being reported ahead re feared to himself as oar yakka and referred to same instead of mamas same is comas backwards of course ackhmad at the meting said that t would be worth while to lie about the agenda that the new organization could not admit quote we represent same mamas or that ahead seen the had of mamas represents me instead they would claim that was all about pushing is a back to the forty a borders away who is at the time the pair director for the i a was also at that conference away of course is now the executive director of car there according to mac earthy away was an active participant in themeetings where he agreed with ahead about adopting line to america quote when i speak with the america i speak with some one who does not know anything as for the palistinian who has a martyr brother or something i know how to address him you see less than one year later after that meeting car was born car was length the holy land foundation and the muslin brotherhood from its foundations as dance pipes explains quit comas designated a terrorist organization by the us and many other governments indirectly created car and two groups eremainteit examples in nineteen ninety four karma nehatowad publicly declared his support for comas the holy land foundation of comas drunk group contributed five gran to car in turn car exploited the nine eleven attacks to help's money for the holy land foundation moltzba board members and staff car have been arrested or s unit entry to the united states or were indited on and played guilty to terrorism charges car defended the nineteen ninety three world trade enter bombers calling their convictions a quote travesty of justice they did not condemoson been laden for nine eleven until beholden himself claimed the crime they apposed the deportation of terrorist fascia odd they steadfastly tie virtually all antiterror efforts to phantom is lamaphobia in two thousand eight the f big cut off relations with are but under democrats the america government has never been willing to let go of the illusion tat the council on america sonic relations represents o crucial part of the interjectional coalition into thousand eleven the aroma justice department declined to prosecute karma to founder oar ahead ahead as we have said worked closely with the holy land foundation and with the salami association of palestine that declaration to prosecute came despite the fact that both attorney general colder and then a big director robot molar had serious reservations about car according to reporter tactic duo quote indictments were scuttled last year at the direction of top level political appoint es within the agama justice department and possibly even the white house the trumpetministration when it came in cut off relations with care but under the bide administration here was bath the hot wad has spent years being fitted by the media because the left wing media require a muslin organization within the interjectional coalition no matter how extrema thus a wat is welcome to national t v to pretend to moderation even while he spouts me ass talking points here he was on mean be s just last month i mean in thistekin the throw then we we have in tor lies for for age is tin young jewfish a medicals our

directly from his mouth he claim that those were people were fighting on behalf of the people of gossip can come ass now of course he said the quasars out loud that he likes comas that you likes october seventh and all of the rest the question is when the left will be willing this time to admit what is plain that care is a radical psalmist organization now the white house house put out a

from most radical members of its own base the university system continues to struggle with the facts that they are funded in large measure not only by radical lefts who actually come ass for example but actually by governments the government of cutter cutter has spent literally hundreds of millions of dollars at america universities i mean it hundreds millions and this has been attempted to be obscured by various college president's butt the reality is that again cutter which is very very from my with iron has gain has gained power at a lot of these universities the reason that they they give money to america universities is not because they love america higher education it is because they wish to dedicate for example middle eastern studies programs tat are stacked to professors who promote the pro iron anti israel pro radical slam point to view columbine's middlestern studies program is just the best example of this but governments cutter they give runs of money to these universities they are asked about begat university presents were asked about this at that hearing a couple of days go an they pretend that they had no clue how much money was actually flowing in but the answer is not just hundreds of millions dollars over the course of years billions of dollars have been flowing into america universities in order to again by access or to prop up people who they think agree with them according to we net news three weeks ago the flow of cater fun to various sources did not concern anyone money was delivered without interruption but some of that money was being delivered to academia the cater governments and billions of dollars to ivyleage america colleges yearly forcing institutions to adapt and la violent propalisinian protest for example according to the free press cottar again has been spending tons of money in these places it is not a giant shock at these universities are fully in line with the needs and wants of the canaries according to a piece from elf lag over at the three estrus last month since nineteen ninety haven cottar has donated more than a hundred three million dollars to virgin commonwealth university far fine art campus since

engineering campus since two thousand four cottar has donated seven hundred forty million dollars to carney mulligan university for computer science campus om as he li likes us one might expect that scholarly institutions that a benefited from this autocracy's money would rethink their partnership after costar's for minister said that israel alone is responsible for the pagromup perpetrated by comas derris or after cottar's prime minister has kept the compass office open in its capital not the universities have decline to make any statement about at all in fact hall brown spokeswomen for a ten san it had quote maintaining relationships of countries cottar serves a broader purpose including fostering international dialogue and cooperation tea a an ms relationship of covers foison educational and research activities i mean we exactly would they be doing all of us again the reason there doing all this is to buy access that is why you do it or to promote people who are already pushing youryour own perspective on these issues and the fact that that this was considered wildly non controversial for twenty years as cannon amazing amazing thing until tweeting twenty one the highs profile recipients of coward money in washington d c was the brooking institution in twenty thirteen it received a four year fourteen point eight million collegian tell fund the bookings dohacenter bookings receives another for your grants in twenty seven from costar but in twenty twenty one the institute ended its relationship with the dona center claiming was focusing on the future on digital and global engagement why exactly well because the dohacenter closing overlapped with an friar investigation into retired marine general john allay whose present bookings between nonmember twenty seventeen and tune twenty twenty two because whose acting is an in register lobbies for cottar again these universities there's a lad a money tied up in their left wing a agenda the good news is that people are tarting to see this and pull their cash according to acids university pensylvania donors with drawing a gifts worth round a hundred million dollars to protest the holds response t antisemitism on campus the final straw for rostevens founder and of stonerige asset management was tuesday's testimony from pen president limb gill he is pulling his one hundred million dollars there are therefore other outlets there are now turning against the university system in excellent ways for example there is a group call planter planter is now opening up a hundred and eighty hiring slots to students afraid of antisemitism on campasand will s tire you directly out of college during you hae to finish up her college to green a the owing out want from palentier is expand that not only to jusafraide of antisemitism but to every one everyone needs to start hiring people to erectly out of high school and stop worrying about where they want to college these colleges are in indoctrination mills that are designed specifically to rack up at and also two indoctrinate your kids into left wing world views this is why people should stop complying with the nonsense that these universities are are somehow training and honing the mines of these folks according to media rabbi avid worry who i know ism friendly with with rabbiwopi is a visiting scholar halyard's tiny school he just resign from the university's anti sexism advisory committee on thursday just two days after president clodyan gazes controversial congressional testimony earlier this week whole said as of to day have resined from the antisemitism advisory committed at harder without rehashing all the obvious reasons that a ben endlessly alum rated on line with great respect for the members the committee the short explanation is both o venison campus and the painfully an adequate testimony reinforce the idea i cannot make the sort of difference that i had hoped that of course is exactly rights that is exactly right its time to abandon these universities it is very importnaturally that people abandon these universities because it is not just that they are anti israel and pro radical is lot is it there wildly left wing they have embraced in instructional idea of life that is deeply damaging to theamerican body politic have been saying for twenty years people need remove their money from these universities and glad that some people are finally catching on to all of that meanwhile in israel israel is gaining the upper hand in southern goa as well israel is taking over a major city in hon it is called counts which is located in southern goa meanwhile cams is literally firing rockets out of civilian set up israel sing up civilian air is wore civilians can go for safety and comes is immediately insetting there and then firing rockets from those places shocker because this is what they do meanwhile even palstinians are not talking openly about how humanitarian aid being sent in the gossip being stolen by commanders an elderly palistinian woman saying this san age zero again the shock is not that she saying is the shock is that age zero allow it to be roughcasts usually age zero again owned by costar tries to cut this off and siphon rooted in this a the admit that that is showed woo no angel says not all to here can not find anything to neuter drink says everybody is suffering we said the situation divicolt all that no right is coming shoes all the aid goes to the tunnel's hundermen it does not reach all the pivot we came in from gosh city all the aid is meant for osmium not afraid of commasi'm talking o them as well all the aid reaches the gozisralei costa i e a lot of ait is coming in is being distributed this is what they say hat's the reporter an says no commas takes everything to their homes they can take me shoot me or do whatever they want to me again this is what israel has been saying is what israel ben sayings that we are sending in aid and then the first thing that happens is that the compass fighters an tear steal it and then the internal tonal comment blames israel for not dentin enough are which compass then steals and meanwhile the media re doing chassis work yesterday israel released photos of israel is rally soldiers who had arrested and detained a bunch of comas terra who had surrender and photos were released of the surrender naturally seen then treated this as though this was terrible and evil apparently in intruding the segment sign ends phillmattingally open with new and disgusting images this morning showing the is really military detaining dozens of men and gozaseen strip downs their underwear well actually it turns out that tom these people are all compass members they we stripped to their underwear because again they might have bombs on them they might have boys on them the the notion that israel is stripping random down to their underwater for no reason an justaresting them is silly but of course the met are doing the work of e compass is what they all the time the u on by way also doing the work of commas the united nations which is the most disgusting organization on plant are truly an awful organization the run security council is expected to meet to day to discuss the war on got after secretary general on condo gutter in a rare moo formally urged the fifteen member council to use all

minister of israel says gutenris is ten years angered world bees his request to activate article ninety nine and the call for a ceasefire and comic constitutes supports of mass and indorsement of the murder of the elderly the abduction of babies in the rape of women any one who supports world piece must support the liberation of goa from compass that obviously is true the matter whether it is true er nouththe you've is a terrible gross place that is no shock at all meanwhile the bide administration is starting to recognize from the ton booboos one those bob's by the way as when the

border patrol on wednesday the total number a rest ad drop slightly to more than eight thousand bringing the two day total of migrant tore to nineteen thousand that is in two days the flood of legal emigrants continues it is not abating in any way shape or form meanwhile the bid a ministration continues to not acquires to a bill that would include some border security changes to actually secure that border instead they are yelling at re publicans for a teaching border security measures to crane israel tie wan funding bill there sing it is really bad really terrible and in fact creenchomp here is i mean this takes truegall blaming republicans for the border crises that is taken place solely and completely base of the bide administration here is green chomp here republican a talk about a emigration reform the talk about order security i the president on day one the present qitforan emigration policy for a comprehensive emigration legislation to start that conversation especially to start negotiate on day one it is been three years and they have not been moving forward in good fate they have not been trying to get to a solution in good fate the system is broken we want a fine real solution the presidents ad yesterday you is rede is willing to have a serious conversation about this but they the wears the good fate we have been very very clear about a about the supplemental how portent as as you have saying the on be director has been pretty out are out there under different net works a making the case a an wanted ha things that a she has said is that it is running it is thing hat we have gotten to this point i it is tuning that weave gotten to this pointed that republicans in congress a willing to give putter a a a gift the greatest give that putting could help could help for that is what we are saying and they are playing chicken with all you have to do is signed of bad being here your ring check ministry will will remember them harshly no histories can remember that you is were admen about leaving the border open the you allowed you crane to wither that is what his series can remember is it the easiest by partisan bit in history seriously as one super easy not because republicans love ad u trade but because republicans are willing to sign off on that for a few more word control guarantees andyou gas are no not going to do it why is your priority leaving the border open that is the question again republicans are willing to acquires to your desire for you manage they want the israelate they want the ti wanted why are you guides not willing to acquires on the order it is amazing surely it does make you asked the question why do they want the border wide open why are they desperate to keep the border completely out of control why why isn't they only want mere moneys they can trot process people and send them to the interior of the united states where they will ever be heard of again until democrats am to see them why why why are you intent on doing that as suppose strengthening our laws with regard to the southern border but again this the entire bide administration this one here is the own be director colons a young saying that she is stunned republicans actually want a secure the border alongside you cranage we are always willing to have a conversation i but i believe yogis has been talking about this long enough and unhappy i that the question was called in fortunately i people who no mistakes who are supporters of you crane were supports of israel i decided to be politics a had of our i natural security interest they frankly i i i man stone by that why are you stun by that again this is all parting p again this that this caring in biding should be making himself truly he should be making the argument that in order to say fight terrorism you need to close the border is not it if began actually wanted to win the election the moderate position is on emigration it is closer to the righting position down trump its winning on the emigration issue by leaves and bounds you knot could jobidon could do he could he could make this yield and now would allow him it's actually go to the moderne america an tillissen i tried to shut the order ism doing my best even signed to bill a by partisan bill with republican suborn to do things on the border and then he can go to his radical basin ta is i did not want past the billbug you lase want end the cranage i wanted the cranage we needed the cranage he's a perfect wind for him and he refuses to take it that is how in hock to his own radical base e is to that called intersectunal coalition it is a wild thing it is a wild la i cannot imagine the political calculus going through the minds of the bite administration i guess not much i guess how much the really bad

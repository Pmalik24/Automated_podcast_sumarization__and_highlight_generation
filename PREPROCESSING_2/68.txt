today shursponser by expressive we pins you your web history being seen in sold to advertisers now me neither can express be plan right now at express we piandacams lash men we are not afraid we the citizens of the west are not afraid and we should not be afraid the massive procomoss rallies we have seen in nearly every major western city and across college compasses our designed to intimidate that is why they do viands it is why they fly terrorist flags but here is the optimistic reality far more people in the west a pose compass than supported for more people are in favor of israel weapon compass off the map than are in favor of compass retaining any level f power at all the silent majority may be largely island but it is in fact in majority that much was clear yesterday on the mall in washington to see where prove israel rallies mostly jewfish came by the hundreds of thousands three hundred thousand in all the larges single gathering of news in modern history they can from florid and californium and new york and new jersey they can from cleveland and chico and newton and they came for one reason to show that those who support israel are more numerous than those who support israel enemies the rallies actually showed far more than that actually they showed that those who support israel wove the west and by extension they demonstrated that those who hate israel generally hate the west the contrast could not have been clearer that pro israel rally was replete with america flaslike everywhere with pride in the united states the prove israel rally featured no hate chance no calls for genocide no blood curdling baying on behalf of the turning of mission people instead i featured prayer solidarity and love as one police officer reportedly put to quote i received a career's worth of thank us in one day meanwhile here is footed to a procomosrally yesterday in state island they want is a destroyed that is wat that is loganmans look an member of mast find the crowd help blocking off their faces s then do not want to be seen localized the intifada and ins dada is a violent uprising this is a new york city i this protest devolved into attacking police officers we can seed his roll commons next literally punching at striking out at new york city police officers at the unwiputy yes the contrast is rather obvious it is obvious to me it is obvious to you it is obvious to most america the support for israel yesterday at this big rally was by partisan here is newly rented speaker of the house mike johns yesterday the auditory was full recall against and democrats of the hows then they welt does we wash the fill together most cookie set through it the this rally officers were kinin out en their halls by bar barret commons terrorist fort simply being jewfish of if o of israel this promenister then the a her well this is a fight between good and evil between light and dark's between civilization and barbaric the cause for a aspire or outrageous now was my johns the current speaker of the house in your of the dental presentiment towards leader trashier my frendingonclosion the missis gall whats to scare us then those perpetrating the poison of the into tantiseitisom an bigotry around the world or trying to scare us but we will not alow hi tret of side back to the days of the hallo cops when yes or magic and murdered at butcher instead the jet biopsy be resilient an it or going we will no it in the fa of for city in a mom tin i real on i shoe him now the rally agitators of course from us supporters vandalized the medical tent at the rally the night before s we a see this nonmedical ted to see the medal had this while in round the outside we had to flit them around this is whit it was last night we aunt of this morning all the tens had this on the outside of them we had the flip around the canvas in been spraypanted by procomas nets prey three gaze apparently bus drivers refuse to take news arriving from out of town from dubious air part to the rally itself in a clear case of religious discrimination is buss companies can be sett of distance here was the announcement a board a charter plan from tori the way this force by the ways to fly charter plane into an airport you cannot d plan unless there is on the tarmac some sort of vehicle ready to take you off the plan and to your and your destination the bus company that had been chartered fore this refused to actually participate in bringing news to a prove israel rally here is what at sounded on the plane here is e bar o try this community members to attend the march forgisrael and washing and deny we are proud is icdenro an number travel to the agent the busses that were higher to take over nine hundred progensians o doliginter dentin of report o the taste of the march bad to appear the lay the arrival of many or most in our room we are leaving that this was arouse by a the liber and malicious walk off of drivers fortunate a many were able to travel to the mart we are great for the drivers of dose posse em are while we are segment disease by the disgraceful action or is no to proudly stand and solidarity with the people of israel to condemn entisemnetism the manner cero every ha i all blame is everything rat tespakan prayed by the boy company of there rain what has happened all this is pretty depressing of course it is even more depressing to see such sentiments in the halls of power emanating most entirely from the far left canada prime minister just intrude who just the terrible person spent yesterday ripping israel an unsurprising development from the morally blinds out who is definitely not definitely not fell castoff head here is just intrude ripping into israel yesterday i have been clear that the price of justice cannot be the continued suffering of all palistinian civilians even words have rules all innocof life is equal in worth is rely and palistinia i urge the government of israel to exercise nation restraint s the world is watching on nevi an social media were hearing the testimonies of doctors family members survivors kids of lost tor parents the world is witnessing this just intrude is a disgusting human being trying to suggest that israel is somehow not exercising maximum the strain as we will see in just a moment is totally insane meanwhile representing hemal women of new york took a break from pulling fire alarms to claim that his opposition to israel was actually an attempt to uphold nudism the gall of this is just in a i love that he is flanked with a bunch of ridiculous looking human beings with shirts rabbits for seas fire and it is a it is an overweight female who is definitely definitely not a rabbi in any real sense i do love these folks are trotting out fringe elements as though they are representatives of nudism truly insulting suffer and have heard what was said here this evening before that by me calling for see fire wit my colleguesing sera he amity i am up lifting deeply what i actually means to be jewfish because a saltines his definitely aga gagemaboman uplifting the jewfish apple a feel greater the be standing here well harapagado hemal women there speaking on behalf of the jewfish people that is not insulting at all meanwhile woman's fellow come mossquaed colleagues to a different back elhanomar claim that all people of take should oppose israel no bigamy or not not not making a brother pale but apparently opposing israel something fascinating and bazar an in the fact that there are people who them to be aft that there are faith and people other people of faith rabbis out here asking for fire and it is it is bazar because you would who that if you are a religious leader if you are a f peer that your number one priority would be to look into your fat into the pickings of your fat and to fay i oppose violent i oppose violins from illhan oar who yet to met a terror group she does not provide support truly amazing stop by the way where are all the moms for out they're calling for compass surrender where are they can you name them ruler and then there was the inimitably idiotic to c fellow traveller at t commosquad who suggested it israel needs to not engage in military action against commas instead they have to find a way to wait for it negotiate with terrorist who have openly stated that they wish to murder every new on plan and earth to see she is now the cartoon ears this famous carton of john carry trying to negotiate between compass and israel and the commas nacre is holding a science saying deaf tall just and the news sitting there and john carry is saying can you meet them halfway that is now doc we fire mean very no military solution only a diplomatic and cultural solution a relational solution a reckoning with our they girl mutiny with the people where cannanatits f fire now mean she is pathetic in truth however and this is all depressing these are in fact fringe sentiments according to newpole from pharisaic sixty seven per cent of america believe israel should continue fighting commassuntill compass is defeat in and israel hostages are released for than eight in ten america agreed that israel has a responsibility to protect its citizens this is the true america not the pictures you see on in an or the minority portrait is majority by our pathetic media in fora structionwill get

try hallo for three months free at hallo come slash apart that hallow god come slash shipper case of speaking of the media they spend most of yesterday ignoring that giant rally the biggest rally of news in modern history maybesons sign ahem and instead they decided to folks in on astrotroping resistance to israel finishing off comas for example the front page of the website of the yer times at last night carried zeroes mention again of the largest gishrally and centuries but they did have a front water article about five hundred anonymous members of the executor branch writing letter to jobidon protesting his israel policy literally that pro comas groundswell is building says the near times the media continue to do their damnedest to undermine israel ability to defend itself because again israel is an extension of the west me do not the less there for israel most be undermine despite the fact that ever major media outlet of the last twenty years has reported the comas has placed military head quarters beneath allshiva hospital in the gazes strip the press continue to treat israel as a political leper for pursuing that military target no matter that the pensagonspolks person literally confirmed yesterday three comas and palisinian is lomicchehod use hospitals as runs for military sights we do have information that mamas and the palistanian as gamic chop uses som hospitals in the gazes strip including the she for hospital an as a way to conceal and support their military operations and holds hostages they have tunnels underneath these hospitals and hams and pace members operate a commanding control note from she for hospital in gaze city they have weapons stored there and are prepared to respond to in is railing military operation against the facility this is ism just telling you what we as the an intelligence community assesses is happening and gosh city how hamates using these hospitals to operate but absolutely we do not want to see a fire fight in a hospital where there are innocents of ill ants the no one wants to see a fire fight in a hospital the only problem is that compass is going to pursue fir fight in the hospital and is literally doing that as we speak no matter that this behavior a come under international does transform such sits into military sits in twenty sixteen as the waste journal points out here is forces attack to hospital in model actually house is forces did just attack the hospital they hit it with an air strike here is what sent comet of the time quote based was using the hospital as a base of operations and command and control head quarters in support of the rock security forces collision air craft conducted a precision strike on the location to target an my fighters firing on a rocky forces no heartburn from the media after all brokobama is president at the time and yet israel is going in and attempting to take out come hos room by room all well trying to protect gain civilians and still the media are treating that as some sort of war crime many members of the media keep asking if a hospital suddenly becomes legitimate target just because compasses you not using it as a military steal the answer by the way is yes here is article nineteen of the geneva conventions quote the protection to which civilian hospitals are entitled shall not seas unless they are used to commit outside their humanitarian duties act harmful to the enemy protection may however cease only after due warning has been given naming in all appropriate cases a reasonable time limit and after such warning has remained unheeded israel has warn compass and medical officials inside alive a hospital for literally weeks israel has facilitated exit from the hospital for the sake and the innocent but here was the be c openly lying about what israel is doing in the hospital and make no mistake is not a mistake to is a lie because the baby see lies is the baby we is effectively a come hospropagan to arm here we go at this loment we are hearing from riders that is reporting that israel it says its forces are carrying out and operation against mamas in gases el sofa hospital and they are targeting people including medical teams as well as arab speakers a they are also saying that israel is calling on all mamas operatives in the hospital to surrender at this point once again we are hearing from riders that israel says that its forces are carrying out and operation against mamas in that hospital that we had just heard of they are targeting is arab speakers as well as some of the medical staff there and they are asking all mamas operatives in that hospital to surrender they repeat the lie twice they say that israel is targeting arab speakers and medical personal and they repeated twice that is a lie in fact israel is exposing its own soldiers to fire from terrors in allshifa and according to the idea those forces quit include medical teams and arabia speakers were undergone specified training to prepare for this complex and sensitive environment with the intent that no harm is cost the civilians being used by compasses human shields an otherwards israel is literally shipping in medical teams and arabia speakers two facilitate help for the innocent and the sick this is something i no army in history has done ever literally ever the b b c with egregious here they were force to apologize again for this particular blood bible this follows on their other blood bible her the came that israel had boy ta hospital early on in the conflict and then had to walked out one off yours be we apologizing for the we in pot for the bbtbbtis leave chat report is rate fortress enter got as man hospital we said the medicoltinsen rocs win total is was incorrect site arêtes report we should have see id ones into medicoltins an relics o the operations that we apologize for this e falpensal editorial sane well here is the thing it did not fall bearer usual editorial standards usual editorial standards are ye hate israel aware not fond of the news either yet here was elizabeth's spires cherish frequently four the new york times and here is what shetsweeted i actually think the morality regarding civilian kits should be apparent t everybody any one we tells me palisinians are using children as human shields f off that is rarest by itself and has been used to justify all manner of atrocities yes it is now races according to this columnist to point out the commons us human shields she is mostly taught to compass because apparently they are also races because they brag openly about using human shields in a second we will get to the encouraging fact however because there is something encouraging about what is going on will get that momentarily first are you few years are decades out of school and wondering what that dad i even learn we the point of hufthan you might be thinking ow have time to learn something new if that is u you are not alone it is not too late hillsdale college is offering more than forty free on line courses learn about the works of s louis the rise and fall of the roman republic or the history of the ancient christian charge with hillsdale colleges on line courses if you are not sure where to start check out constitution one o one the meaning and history of the us constitution in this twelve lecture course you will explore the design in purpose of the constitution the challenges at face during civil war and how it has been undermine for more than a century by progressives and liberalism the course of self pace he can start never and wherever our country needs more america who understand the constitution and can defend our freedom against the encroachments of an increasingly large and on accountable government had on over to hillsdale dot edgy u slashed two in roll there is no cost its easy to get started that hillsdale dot edgy u slashed two in role hillsdale dot end uslashmen again i do not recommend colleges lightly to people and hillsdale does it great hillsdale has always been a font for actual virtue and good information great place senor red hillsdale dot edgy u slash men here is that they watch the media lye you watch lefties politicians lye but here is the thing nobody with a brain actually believes the media's moral equivalence game their people who are soft headed who our interested in the moral equivalence game because it makes them feel sophisticated there people who do the moral equivalence game begs it makes them feel they can have a level of disconnect from the conflict and that makes them feel very good about themselves the easiest position in any conflict is to both sides the thing but the reality is the vast majority of america are not doing that and that is encouraging be cause in truth all come ass and its allies have is fear that is all they have that is the whole thing have intimidation well we are not afraid the west does not need to be afraid good news we do not just have right on our side it turns out we have might on our side that is well ill can meanwhile the congressional clown show continues i have to say are elected officials to very serious time another world's always very serious time but it is a particularly serious time right now and the more clownish ore politics gets the worse it is and this is not just a republican problem it is democrat problem as well we have now created a massive dis location of incentives with regard to actual governments people who enter congress were supposed to be originally public servants they are supposed to be people to actually had in mind the best for their district for example and then power was supposed to check power ambition was supposed to check ambition the quiet the thing was the in order to advance in the political realm in the united states tow men the you had to play the game politicsthat meant that you he to cut deals and mean that you had to manipulate yet be mot givellion you had be clever yet that should get thing's done from time to tie yen to exert power n you sometimes had to take a laws this was the push and tug of politics in the united states for centuries and then it'because everyone is a politician a spire to be a higher level politician if you are congress person you wanted to be assentor if you are a senator you might want be the president if you are a governor you might want to bathe president if you are local state representative you might want o be the governor the idea was be good at thattrob and you might elevate to the next job but we have now completely done away with that instead everybody apparently in congress a spies to be a political commutator they want my job and the thing as my job is very different hin their job my job is to say things that i think are true there job is to get things done those are not quite the same job now you can say things that are true and also get things done but what that would require is you to admit to your public that you are not always going to get everything that you want because life is not fair it requires than instead of pestering you hae rally hae to make a deal an then go back to your constituents and explain to them the deal that you just made and why you were not able to meet all of their dreams and the is a prom for politicians because again the politicians most likely to win are the ones who promise you the world now that is not really a prom with the politicians in the end it to probe with the electorate the electorate needs to get over itself the electorate in the united states is true again across the board have a tendency to fall for politicians who promise them the world and then they cant deliver the world and then people get frustrated and then the politician that i feel your frustration and let me telly commit ism to fix it i giving you the world the more well that sounds amazing i would love to have the world and then the politician cannot give you the world nonstop practical and they fall short and get frustrated an the politician comes back to it if you give me more power guess cereal do it'll give you the work wo i would love the world that sounds amazing slamming our head into the same stupid wall over and over and over and what you wend up with is a bunch of clowns in congress that is what you actually and up with is a bunch of people ore idiotically smacking each other in the back of the had munch due school kids stinging gaming each other is hair in order to get attention that is what you wend up with and it isotron all sides of the isle and his frustrating in its idiotic and meanwhile the government just continue spending instating a mounts of cash and making really crappy policy because in the end the people who actually do the deals are the ones when in the back room hashing the deal out and there is a up if we just replace those guides with some on who promises me the world that will fix the things thine that does not fix the thing the incentive structure is wrong again i cannot emphasize this enough when it comes to politics it is incentive structures that matter it is not the politician toucan get a bad politician to do the right thing if the incentive structure is correct and you get a very good politician to do the wrong thing if the incentive structure is wrong all the incentives are missilined right now and everybody is playing for camera time everybody's playing for the viral clip and nothing gets done except by the people in the back room which again is what the populists we are saying we need to avoid is the people in the back from but people in the back room there going to do the deal anyway sentry question as whethey'ue gin select politicians ware goo to making the deal or batty making the deal mess jungle throw jitney of just absolute clownish behavior by members of congress over the course a next you minute we begin whit the senate there is a senator his is mark wan mulling his a united statesenator from oklahoma and monas a fine senator he is i hat will as your publican he threatened to get in a fist fight with a union boss in the senate yesterday and burned standard who is a socialist clown who has never done a productive thing in his entire life suddenly is the voice of reason here that is how far we have on we have now onto the point where the jerryactric communist who literally was thrown off a commune for being too lazy in the seventies and refuse to pay life any of the paternity bills for his kid wacky he is now the voice of reason in the united states en it that is how clownish this is this all let off by the way because the union boss who was tat who is testifying the inter national brotherhood of teamsters president show organ he had a apparently twee did against mulling calling him a clown and a fraud who pretends hes self made and he said quit the tushy act in the senate hearings where to find me any place aneahtime and hears how it went down in the senate yesterday the i time this is a place young run you mow we can be titan tinting it allwecan canso he in the in can it now a not to spirit now e stay o but i he stand o but of e a a her lav a a the do i yo a your o i ti ut it actor o e you with high it a i algin end no i a i o i the you will have you i o o yo i i her go o y mapeoplecongres i wo you yuan a wo why i you over i ti oi yo mi i o mi god burned sanders again the voice of reason he crazed old socialist is the voice of reason and evil never here senders a ow is town to mow do come macho and he is ready to go and you i hat the union buss the goats this right now is to right you right now moll is than i full it is topis thing i first of all got mud it would watch ten out of ten would watch would watch actual is fight in tie sent because honestly if these clowns ain't going to do anything if the going con be be complete useless people we may as well get a you have sea match out f ut by the way martian mulling would win give you actually look at parkway main's background i that i actually kind knows how to fight is apparently the story but ism that is pretty wild stuff it this outsoushart tels just one element a gain because this clownish behavior has now ben intensifies because the reality is that is he get a pap penal the for that politically no and democrats now the same thing because democrats er don set now republicans our busy being bat at their jobs that there doing it more often than democrats you seen clownish behavior band democrats for sure y got more on small bowman pulling a fire alarm and then pretending he did not know that a fire alarm was a fire alarm and he thought that it open doors overtime you opens his fridge thinks he is open h he thinks he starting his shower or something he is a clown i got lose who makes a living out of being a clown got actual terror supporters in congress and then he just have sort the regular clownish behavior of members of congress i got to say why would you trust these people with more power in anyway shipper but republicans because they are bad a governing right now because the class is fractious they have decided best thing to do is to hit each other so apparently yesterday there was a a bit of a throw down between even mac earthy the expeetger of the house from californium and represent him birches of it tennessee and pe a con gressional correspondent cloudy out rasallis first reported the en counter on ax saying it happened when she spoke with birch after the jet piece conference meeting on tuesday she said have never seen the sin capital hell while talking it is o represent him birches after the hope he conference meeting former speaker my earthy walked by with his detail and my earthy shoved to birchatt merchant lunge toward me at i was joke it

never can a chicken move is that your pathetic man your pathetic merchant tars to walk away from my carts is what a jerk and tit says you need security cabin see i jerk its a childish little he says

your glue whatever bounce is off of me sticks back to you and then circuit wen to giant bowlder and painted a tunnel on it in the hopes that celiac earthy would run directly into the giant bowlder but rev my earthy escaped bi going into the tunnel and betcha try to follow him but then he actually hit the giant boulder that is that is what it is apparently happening the halls of commas but do not worry the clown show was into over then mandates who is the best clown a circus to display he showed up too mac gates had to get into the story because this clown car cam fit you thought you thought

the collate man with his giant hair and his big teething his a yea a he is ready to go the a but i what i love most about machetes seriously is that his deep and abiding hatred of heaven my earthy is extraordinary it is unbelievable he is did some one say he is a thousand miles away man's the teat signal goes out come my party's in the news is i some one is that is the undertaker's music he li runs right there she glib do this thing machetes herd this rumor about cam my earthy getting into physical altercation with him bucket what did he do he immediately files a formal ethics complaint

people in congress it is about changing the invent of structure and that comes chiefly from the electret some you do not your congress people maybe should thing seriously about not electing idiots anyway machetes immediately filed is it top him us the same house republicans who did not vote to impeach elhundro amorous and who are about pasty jean spenningbo those same house republicans there what what we magnates is i t use we my earth's really important and not only that now that he is not the speaker any more ism a care stomp that guy he he files in ethics complaints bis ton at come my earth's supposedly telling him birches says congress has seen a substantial in creasing breaches of the quorum unlike anything we have ever seen since the precise water yes when i think of congressional quorum i think of mat gates yes that that that great guardian of congressional to forum who i mean literally wore a gas mask on the house floor in a vote about bovid now get that is funny and weird but the cuprum from mandates what are you've talking about what the hell excide show bob songs like we n decorum her the too much clowning a i wonder why there is many nothing that the republican parties a bunch of rooms and morons why why would they think that i do not know it is confusing what could we do i do o my god gates took birchart side that i myself give been a victim of outrageous conduct on the house floor as well that of course was in reference to wanna house arm services committee my chair ta chair i make grocer's album lunge tat gates during the election my earthy speaker back in canary but nothing an open in public assault on a member committed by another member the rots starts at the top mac earthy was that was aspects at o god i think affects is a

table emotions proceed on a house past bill according to the hill there provide that fourteen point three billion dollars an emergency ait to israel to your member jo began ass for a hundred and five billycan dollar foreign a package some of it it sixty billion with another you crane fourteen point three was going go to israel seven bill was can to go to ti wane this me some border funding in all the rest and your bin want of that all its tied up withe pretty and turns out house republicans not hot on the u grenade i we not we don't see an all frame there we do not know what exactly your planning to do those battlelines really stagnant what is the enroll there now that is not the same thing as the war that is currently ragi against commons israel has military superiority then you rearmament in order to finish that job and they will finish that job if given the rearmament if given more rearmament you crane someone con no push russia out of don bastrocremeus it is a different situation on the ground look a the house pass a bill that fun did the aid to israel and they included in there a rider that would cut the tires is budget the so will take the money out of the tires is budget and whenstead will give that money to for aid to israel the medal the war and the democrats voted unanimously to table that from the democrat perse gaga was a poison pill we need or as funding but from a re publican perspective the question is you are tires running is important they are not willing to pass a bill in the middle of a war to aid israel in its fight against verism president widen had also threaten to veto the housebill out in reality there will end up being a deal that it is cut here but it is evidence have a sort of the prioritization the democrats have i think the next step here for my johns is gig to be put to pass a clean israel funding bill without the tires cots and then watch is the democrats tried o vet no that because at that points i goat you have no excuses that when you cave claim that the rider is the real issue and the senate operates the senate operates and are tending otherwise don't change the fact on the ground or can meanwhile everybody in the democratic party has severe heartburn over hoiden long piece over at politico called sere is how bison can turn it arounenge top democrats agreed the present needs more aggressiveness more help from his friends in a few more friends and their calling on leaves chain ad it round to help ye a good luck on that one not n arms them helping but in terms of om anyone listening to them this entire piece is just about the heartburn that democrats have over over bison and what he can do to fix this thing they say that basically he needs to show more life enough of the bravado and realism his ads are under no illusion about their challenge even some of his most omitted loyalist told me he needs to make changes yet the president often displayed his resentments and ways that do nothing to move public opinion and only delay needed adjustments some of this younger ads mimic his shark shaming or ignoring toe sentesn't make it go away and now that you have jolstein is greenparty candidate in mansion new newly teasing his presidential run it is possible that jobidon could easily lose and one of the one of the recommendations here is that join should appoint more people in positions of his power help share the burden that he needs to move my donation who's his a alter ego over to the campaign they need to move the white house to warfooting he should bring back on plane who did in amazing job of course now that these all the recommendations but the realities the robin's policies are failing because they are failing and part of that failure is going to be his meeting with design pang this week gejampang is coming to californium san francisco has cleaned up apparently all it took to actually help the citizens of san francisico is for the chines president to arrive they clean alba the homeless on the streets they took the they took the open needles off the streets the poop off the streets again all that took was the chines dictator coming in what exactly on the addenda between between jobidon and gesiampaign well there very few expectations for major break throws g is action coming in week right now if you were going to exact concessions from the chines now to be the time to do it g actually has a very week economy on his hand is waster journal points out they say on the eve virtual meeting with president bison at a aria pacific summit last fall we was formerly formerly in shying to chensmost powerful leader in t generation but china economy is now beset by multiple challenges from a deflating property bubble an unmanageable local government debts to slump in confidence in toe elation just meanwhile recorded its strongest quarter in nearly two years and inflation is starting to subside that means the united states actually has leverage here what exactly should bison move foible certainly he should move for we to calm down on his military antics in the south china see certainly he should push for g to open the books on say covin nineteen is biding in to do any that a of course not he is gin o do climate change jobidon is trying to assure serial pang do not worry us we are it we are not we are not trying to de couple from you i mean ism sure i personal level job does not want the couple from china since again he was the big guy who as probably receiving chines money while he was in the vice presidency and postiche presidency ere of his career here is jointing do not worry do not wordy we we want what we really want is to is to continue to be handing glove with the chines and what for o define re ye back out e normal course correspondent being able o pick up fond talk to one another crisis ben able to make sure are no tears to a contact cannot take s i toldyou we we are not ting to decouple from china o were we were crying to do e change of relationsion for the better for my prospector if in fact the finish people are in trouble right no economic i theeverytomoner e homo ever sasin china tell have a decent ago e pifisam in benefic out nay well we ill see what sort of concessions bid makes to g to have confidence that biding is not can to get rolled who would o have possible confidence in that considering how many times he has been rolled in the past on agings jaundice is trying to relieve bands on manufacturing of sophisticate a microchips on behalf of the chines government they also want the america government to stop helping out ti wants democrat democracy progressive party which oppose is the the closer ties with china he want he antsbase lev he united states sell undercut all of that also she is going continue to pitch america business people on the idea o the china is a place of opportunity but again the united states has a lot of leveret here an the united states should be pushing for more militarization more signals of conciliation from g gunman that is what bison should be pushing for is he going to be doing that i i have serious serious doubts army an just one second will get

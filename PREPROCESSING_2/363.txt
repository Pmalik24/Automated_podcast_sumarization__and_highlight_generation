welcome to the superman alone dick science science pace to li i manner superman and om a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day my guest is doctor savanna sober doctor hosanna sober completed her doctoral thesis work at the center of inflammation and metabolism and the center for physical activity research at the university of copenhiggen and denmark he research as focused on how deliberate cold exposure and deliberate heat exposure can be used to enhance human metabolism she is the first author of a seminal study which discovered the minimum thresholds for deliberate heat and deliberate cold exposure for increasing brown fat thermogenesis which is essentially a mode of increasing heat production and metabolism in the body and for establishing actionable protocols that can be used outside of the laboratory to improve metabolism and human health doctor sobers research was published in the journal sell reports metabolism in twenty twenty one adding to a long and important history of research focusing on the roll of cold and the roll of heat in altering various aspects of the body's physiology including hormone health metabolism and changes an narrow transmitters such as dopamine and epinefran in fact to day's discussion with doctor sober focuses on the roll of deliberate heat and deliberate cold exposure on metabolism but it also includes discussion of the effects of cold and heat on things narrow transmitter production namely dopamine and epinephrin and orpine from the call cat coalmines which strongly impact mood and metabolism in addition doctor sober anarch many common questions about deliberate cold and deliberate heat exposure including for instance the difference between cold showers verses cold immersion up to the neck verses total body cold immersion including whether not going back and forth between heat and cold changes fundamentally the way that heat and cold impact the metabolism hormones and negro transmitter product ion and we talk about almost every single wants and variation on deliberate cold and deliberate heat exposure protocols as it relates to the underlying science in particular how cold receptors that the level of the skin are impacted verses cold reception and perception at the level of the brain and how all of that impact systems of the brain embody relating to mental health physical health and performance based on her scientific research and academic training as well as her understanding and use of deliberate heat and deliberate cold exposure protocols doctor sober is considered one of the world's leading experts on these topics in fact she is the author of a recent book entitled winter swimming which is i have to say a terrific book because it breaks down chapter by chapter the different aspects of deliberate heat and deliberate cold into its various constituent parts including cold aclamization the cold shock response dangers and safeties of cold water the impact of cold and impact of heat on various aspects of human health as well as specifics relating to sanaverses ice verses cold swimming showers et camera it is a very thorough read in a very easy and accessible read that if you are interested in deliberate cold are deliberate heat exposure ere both will allow you to embrace those protocols with the greatest degree of confidence that you are going to obtain the specific and points that you're interested in and to do safely before we begin i emphasize that this podcast is separator my teaching an research roll at stamford it is however part of my destroy efforts to bring zero cosmic consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of today to day's episode is also brought to us by elements elements is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar of dock many times before on this podcast about the key roll of hydration and electrolytes for nerve r sell function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have soda magnesium and potassium present in the preparation all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and dehydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that you are getting the preparation of electrolytes if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is elements dream slash huberment and you'll get a free element sample pack with your purchase they are all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to element elements dream slash superman podcast and now for my discussion with doctor hosanna sober doctor hosanna sober welcome thank you great to have you here i feel i should give a little bit of the back story of how we got connected which was that for many years have been interested in colthermagenisis it was the topic of my seniority assistant college and if of course followed the a popularity of wimhoff and we have had doctor crag heller my colleague from biology department at stamford who works on cold and it is impact on physiology and sports perform ait for a long time have been interested in this area but there is been a real a lack of new let us say high profile quality scientific information in terms of how for instance cold plunge is and sand how that impacts human physiology i know there is been some information out there but it is been sort of scattered and then little over a year ago i see this paper in sell reports medicine and was immediately struck an the first fall the fact that it was in cell reports medicine have been on the see pressed editor ryalboard for a long time now as journals are of course phenomenal journals and the title and the content of the paper was directly in line with the sorts of practices that people are very curious about and then are striving to emerge things sawn a cold plunges and there was your name first on the author list and i readout you through social media and we have done a little bit of live content there together and have been tracking what you have been doing in the world in terms of your book and talking about the results in your manuscript and talking about the science and impact of deliberate cold exposure and soon and i have to say that it is been a wonderful and remarkable thing to see and your bringing much quality information about this area that for a long time i think it was kind of niche and is now becoming more and more mainstream ism in a start off with a thank you for being here and a thank you for the work that you have done and ism looking for to talking to you about it to day my first question ism to get things started is what is happening when we get into an uncomfortably cold environment for instance if ism really hot on a hot day jumping into a cold pool feels really good but if ism already kind of i at room temperature ism a like bit chilly getting into that same temperature of water does not feel good right there is a shock there if you could just walk us through what happens when we get into uncomfortably cold water whether not it is by way of shower or cold plunge at the level of our physiology and if you would our psychology i think that is a good place for us to start because i think it will orient people to their own experience if they do that and for those that have not done it i might start to peel back some of the the layers as to what the underlying mechanisms of cold are ye thank you for that question it is pretty good sugjestagdrest what i tally happens in our physiology when we get cold and you can get cold in many ways say you can just heat out though the one ti gives you the most patientest dresser which is submerging into cold water and but you could also go in outside in the cold wind that is also on a private your an you sympathetic nervous system get all these neuaterancs went a going in your body and you you catacomb mines an let us just address that we are taking a cold plunge for example if you are very hot for example an before you go into the coat is gong o feel less is going to feel less tress wot what the the temperature a difference from your skin to the cold is definite going ant give you a a shock but your cold temperature is warmer and that is going o feel a live a better that is why when people going sand for hemal and go out an in into the cold water they they they can do it easily a ye see are then if they were cold beforehand could i as i ask you a few questions you you mention the sympathetic nervous system which for a people listening who are not familiar with that is the the branch of our nervous system that is responsible for creating accelerations and heart rides a feelings of alertness it is accompanied with stress and the stress response but it is accompanied with waking up in the morning for that matter it is not always about stress and the you mention the catacolal means which em our demean pan efferent and nor up and efferent maybe a lo it later will talk about those individual nor transmitters but you raise a really important point which is something i get asked about a lot for people that are curious about using deliberate cold exposure which is how cold should the water be and i know it is very hard to give a straight prescription for that because i think it boils down to what you just said which is it is really the difference between your current temperature and really the temperature of the surface of your skin and the temperature of the water if your very warm getting into cold feels good if you already cold getting into more cold feels stressful a is there any way that we can start to gauge what is the best way to approach a deliberate cold exposure protocol should it feel we uncomfortable and that leads in the question of how do we balance the discomfort with the amount of time that we spend in for instance if it is just a little bit uncomfortable we will spending more time in the cold get us the same benefit as getting into very uncomfortably cold water for a very short period of time yet t is really good question and i dent nobly think that this could be and future studies on this as well really unravel a what kind of protocol it are the are the best way or also for which out comes of course if the temperature is a very cold and you feel that at you also feel very cold then you use would stay in the water a a bit longer s i think it is just you should get uncomfortable cold as long as you get uncomfortable cold it is cold enough and you get this what we call the cold shocks to the cost is activation of your sympathetic nervous system and delay activation of the the catacomb minds with you just mention before job the shock mean that ism having trouble controlling my breathing is at a good gage i ye you can say because that is can alike how we define it you high povinsulate you have a faster and a breathing rate and that increases also because you activate your gasping reflects if you are new to this and but if you are adapt it it i kind of subsides with time i with adaptation what you can do is that you can train this cold exposure and you can canalize get adapted to it you do not have this high povinsilating response every time you go out in the cold waters this is building up your raciliens building building up your adaptation is gonna make the shock subside a bit is it is always harder in the beginning but you should do hard things riot is not something that we you should not think about cold water and cold were immersion as something that is comfortable i should be hard because that is the point of it ring if you enjoy it then yet then ism ism thinking something wrong is not r you did not an get for this is an important point that you are making because i think that many people shy away from deliberate cold exposure because it is uncomfortable in a way that at least from my experience is very different than the discomfort of exercise because with exercise for instance if running her in a running fast and breathing hard is uncomfortably can slow down or walk if lifting weights is uncomfortable you can remove some weight or produced the number of repetitions or stop with deliberate cold exposure i suppose you can be sort of half way in half way out of the water or partially underneath the cold shower but it is very hard to high trade an adjust the level it is an of all or none and have seen i shouldst i can tell this by anecdote i have done some work with military special operations i will not say which country this was outside the you ask and these are very tough individuals there used to going without sleep and doing hard high consequence high risk kind of work and they were asked to do some cold water exposure training and i was there that day and it was remarkable about a third of them just went straight in ans cone of grinder through it lake they looked stoic anyway to me there were a few whimpers no cries about a third talked a lot and got really you could tell that they were agitated and anxious but t he made it through and then about a third of them just simply would not get in pass their knees or lies we are just it seems they were just dreading the whole experience some i she did not shall go in completely which was really surprising to me and that you could not tell based on their physical appearance for anything else about them their all high performers as to who would have this response seems people very tremendously in terms of their ability to embrace the discomfort of the cold is that from your studies is at your experience as well or or there the weird mutants who seem to just love going into the cold for the first time some people just feel better in the cold and some peopleare dread the cold even more and you can say the more people are pushing the cold away they might feel the cold pain even more they they they would definitely people who are may be the soldiers you just talked about they some of them might be already adapted to the gold cold if they are not scared of the cold they go out and they embrace the cold in a better way it could also be that some people have a more sensitive nervous system and when you are but sensitive to the cold you of course try to get a away from it riot and you will also have the cold pain more and feel the cold pain more if they if if you avoid it the more you a boy at the cold the the more pain painful it will feel and when you go into it ye you mention being outside in a tea shirt verses and cold immersion up to the neck verses shower i think and this is something a lot of people wonder about what are the differences in terms of impact short term and perhaps even long term between cold showers cold plunge to the neck i could be an ice water just very cold water a immersion with dunking one's head and then coming up because obviously you w one to come up rare at some and then simply being outside on a cold day in shorts in the tea shirt or something of that sort the different outcomes and because the they are very different e exposures of the cold to your cold receptors in your skim them more you can say you cover your body in the cold which you do in cold water because there of course cover totally and then and the molecules ate a closet your skim youwild have a more rodent and exhibition of all your colt receptors in the skim that one will definitely activate your open enormous a nervous system more and rapid e we compared to going out in a teashirt in the cold wind just go for walk and but that is also something that is gone activate your a sympathetic nervous system meaning them that you we have an increase in door peneferan e and you well activate something cold i the the brown fat this is a healthy kind of a fat tissue that we have in our body and when you activate that that scanner an increase your metabolism before e turnabout brown fat and ism glad you brought it up am because much to talk about there what about cold shower in obviously cosher somewhere in between am being out outside in the air cold a verses a being immersed up to the neck if we had more studies an in cold showers we would learn more about how does that activate on metabolism how does that increase or and nouritrous media in the brain which could also have an impact our on our mental a balance i think that would be interesting for the future and but what we do know is from from a from activating brown fat and both from rodenstowed a studies but also in inhuman is that as soon as we get cold on our skin we will activate our brown fat it is canalize our first responder in in the body to keep i our an temperature up our muscles is the second tissue in our body two tissues which can increase our ethemagenasis the brown fat which is always temperature regulating our body and then we have a the the muscles which will secondary a stop to shiver and that gunner increase our an temperature in the body but as soon as you go into a cold shower you will activate your brown fat a also immediately it could be good also for increasing establish in theory because we have not really any studies showing how much does actually activate the brown fat if someone out that once to gest think i thought about why there fewer studies of cold showers and cold immersion and i think the answer to my mind is that from a methodological standpoint is just harder to do because if people are getting into cold water up to the neck they are getting into cold water up to the neck were as if people are getting into a cold shower some people are larger smaller some people a want stand under the shower with it hitting their heads some people aback o the neck you could direct people to do it but it is a little bit more difficult also i think of for you and i are both research scientist there is a little bit of a mete logic cold challenge that might seem silly to people but it is a real one which is if people are in a cold shower also the water is going to be am kind of pushing their clothing against their skin there is a certain vulnerability and a for most people am coming to a laboratory in the first place let alone being absorbed while they shower at was when you get into cold immerge in cold immersion you your getting under the water and that some people might roll their eyes and silicate really is that the barrier but science exists in these real world contacts and this will very by culture and things of that sort but we run human subjects in my lab andi'll tell you just am the process of getting people to laboratory and having them park and find the lab and it is a whole new environment with people in lab cots and people moving around and where is the rest r me its there is there is a certain among of stress just associate with taking part in a study for most human subjects a i a tolly agree however we need more studies of of cold showers it is just a harder environment to control a in my in my mind it sounds any form of cold to the skin that people register as what you call the cold shock or an uncomfortable i this is kind of a jawing activates the brown fat do we know what the pathway is from cold receptors on the skin to the brown fathoming how does the brown fat know that we are cold real good question and it seems that i i think that of course in the future will know much more about these pathways but what we do know is that it the colerscepters will send a signal to our tomato regulating center and in the brains the h thalamus and and that sooner be am the taking in this message and we have many coperceptors in the skin it is going to be very fast as you can say if you emerge the body into cold water this is going o be rapid a it will have a rabbit increase in a no transmitters in the brainpan nor granola at rejoin cortisol and a which is not that much but it is but it is still there you w have this increase in a nor a crinoline which will then immediately activate the brown fat an because the you can say the activator is the most potent one cold and nor franklin does con activate the brown put there is also a direct pathway from the coperceptrs the skin to the to the brown fat which really s shows that if because of these different pathways it shows that that it could be that this tissue to keep us warm as was is developed in in our evolvement e as humans to keep us warm and to save us whenever the temperature o on our skin verbs suggested little bit to keep us in that right whom eustatic balance we do not get my hypothermic and but also we do not get my geothermic but because it seems that the brown get is so activated when we get warmer your skin it is o and may be a temperature regulator in our in our body your the pathways is different i think it is so a third pathway from daily from the muscles the brown feat is also activated an even though the the muscles are starting to shiver there is a an extra pathway that way to keep our your temperature up muscles and brown after working together to to keep us warm we do not suffer too much in in the cold water superinteresting in word here you pointing the is the existence of three parallel pathways and the motion a parallel pathways comes up over and over again in biology as you and i know and and i think it is important for people to know about because as you said eloquently the when something is very important to our survival or and or evolution the brain and body a install multiple mechanisms for it not just one tan to and it sounds its cold skin cold on the skin triggers and a response in the hypotholemas which the activates brown fat cold receptors in the skin directly to the brown fat and then shivering in the muscle to the brown fat u i want to talk about brown fat in depth and learn from you more about brown fat before that however i want o ask about shiver have heard that shiver causes the release of succinate which then activates the brown fat is it known whether not inducing shiver is important and when should be people shiver i have gotten into cold plunges and shivered while i was in there and then have also had the experience of getting into the cold plug your a cold shower than getting out when even standing outside on a warm day after swimming in a pool and then starting to shiver the shiver comes later how important is shiver and does it matter when shiver happens i was shivering is s good because that increases your metabolism and that was going to burn some colors in your body you should not be afraid of shivering i think because de shivering as long as you do not get to hope with them i if you do not if you do not sit in the cold water for too long and and what you just sat by shivering after you get up that is because of the after drop something cold after drop is when your cold temperature it decreases even after you get out of the cold water and it always does that am your body because it w as soon as you get into the cold water a old dey your blood vessels has gone a con strict because you need to keep your the blood in your core and and keep your a bite of and swarm as soon as you get up that this blood vessel would open again and the one blood would flow out and get colder and then flow back again into the for and that is going to decrease the temperature in your core of course that is the drop that is the drop i o lad you explain that heard a years ago whimhoff i heard him talk about the drop and fort coleys mine talk about the drop that is the first time have ever heard it explain clear limit let me make sure i understand that a i get into cold water obviously ism cold vessels con strict to keep blood near the center my body keep me alive i get out the warming up of my body allows those vessels and claries to dilate again the blood goes out to the surface but the surface is still cold and that blood is could and then my for body temperature drops and that is what your referring to as the drop and that is what induce o shiver exarate and then am i right in thinking that then the shiver activates brown fat which then warms me up again yes god is why you should end on the cold we can get back to yells over sending on cold is a it is what i refer to as and what is now become known as the sober principle which is a a really important principle about the importance of ending on cold an and not doing what i do which is to get into a hot shower or ever back in the sounds but u will get back to that in it in a few minutes em that is wonderful a that you can explain that clearly because i think that shiver is something that a lot of people do avoid people think o i do not want the and shattering the teeth then am and feels a loss of bodily control which really it is it is it is an nod atomic response debut i do not thinks the popishould should avoid that much it is just seeing shivering as away off your body in in a light it is training it is training for your for yourselves is training for your muscles it is training up your metabolism and that is got increase your it what is called the insolensensetivity if you can in your mind get use to the thought of shivering is just when you go exercising in the training center and get that feeling off of titis tough now it hurts the little bit let's gone a hurt because that is what shivering also do us but it is just a different way of training yourself and your bodies going to create what is healthy stress is called homes in the cells and the more you expose ours your muscle cells are your brown fat cells to these kind of healthy stresses exercise cold and heat exposure it is going o make them a better at exciting and also and at i keeping you healthy as long as the the cells get exposed to this it is going to keep them on its to you can say because it becomes more rubiest and increasing ease heat yock prolines and closure routines in the cells to and make you and more rubiest for the next time and that is also what happens when you go to the training center and i keep to i drawing that parallel because p people to day no more about win no more about exercise and what that is is is going to do to your muscle cells and and but the same kind of training is also what you do when you go out and and into the cateran submerge in to cold water because that is just your coat training center you can sand and also your heat trainings end o going into the son because the cells are getting stronger with domestic stress it is the same process just different practise ism glad you brought up the fact that the discomfort or the embarrassment or both of shiver is still crucial to i see to reach for in try in experience the same way that with exercise i i think a lot people do not realize is but when we did our series with doctor any gallant it began clear to me what should have already been clear to me and i think that most people do not realize which is that if we were to measure ism hurt rate blood pressure ism stress hormones and inflammation in a human being during exercise it would look as if they were ready to die blood pressure would be high inflammation at at through the roof but all of that is setting in motion an a adaptation or set of adaptations that allow blood pressure to be lower at rest that allow a inflammation markers to be lower at rest all the things that everybody is seeking with exercise in addition to of course the esthetic changes that people are seeking with exercise sounds the exacting things are happening with the cold am the redundant message here seems to be that the more discomfort provided it is done safely just with exercise the more shivering the am the more cold shock provided it is not to the extreme and stop somebody is heart i we can talk about thresholds for that walnut later it sounds all of that is going to set in motion some long term changes that will make people feel better and will improve health could you just touch on a few of the longer term changes that are known to occur ism well aware of the study showing that thing was european journal physiology it was a european journal physiology showing long lasting increases in catacolameans dope nor up and efferent and am pan offering for many hours after deliberate cold exposure what are some of the other things that happen at the level of metabolism and brown fat in let us say the hours in a day after a deliberate cold exposure as soon as you go in of course there is the ectodation but it seems i no your asking for the the later outcomes blood pressure stuff lie gat is that what you mean you have blood pressure but also interns of metabolism i know that ouknw in your study you should and will talk about brown fat in depth here in a moment but that there were changes to the brown fat that it quit to changes in for instance people's ability to be comfortable in colder environments when they are not doing deliberate cold exposure or in the same way that i can a exercise on an exercise bike r gout for a hard run but than if i go hiking a with the family on sundae and whits a steep clime i could do that steep climb more easily because ism quotient quote fit as a consequence of the of h exercise what is a what i some of the fitness adaptations of theliberecalled exposure yes what happens is that you you get adapted a lied every time you go you will exercise get a limpet stronger every time you go into the water for every time you will be more exposed turn you will you feel more comfortable in the cold the youwerl on unbuild you adaptation which happens on a midsabolic level which is onto be the brown fat we have more activation of your brown get the mite conjure in the the brown fetselves are gone a be an you have more of those and they will be more efficient at heeding you up because it expects the body expect you to to do this again you are prepared in a way the cappilars in your skin is saucy peowill also become better at constricting you will have a better shield of your body to a prepare you for the next time o will be become better at a going into the to water in that ways o the the body makes these mechanistmen changes your body in a way you can expose yourself to the next time right and e and also you will have and also a your am street response will also be a subside a bits a yo have a less increase of your a catecolumines an with time with time also you have because of this activation of your a brown father your mussels you have not increase in them a in in your metabolism which will then i make your insolent sensitivity a better and this is shown and in studies for example and there is this interesting study i found just before i i started my pigsty which was from em get or stoker and it a from two thousand an sixteen where they measured an mittabilism not in or not on down fat but they measured insolent sancetivity in middle age men and women at during one winters women season they were not very long they were in my s study e but they were the were middle age than i think this is very interesting they during these four five months they were when to swimming they saw that i had a low syrup pressure after the reason and i had a lower hot raid and they ala that they have a better incelenstensitivity and i think that is very interesting because if you can have a better incelensensitivity you can prevent life style ceases a man we lower syrup pressure which as at very strong outcome also for selling how much inflammation to haven the body and because t it did not measure a brown fat a i figure that it could be that was the misting link that was to one of the explanations to why we see this am less inflammation in the body a the longer out come said the long turn outcomes could be that you lower your burp pressure and have a lower hot raid m you also m have a better inches transitivity and a better bucks balance but that was shown that is sown in my study it'd to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called a g one is a vitamin mineral robotic drink that covers all your foundational nutritional needs have been taking athletic green since two thousand and twelve some delighted that their sponsoring the podcast treason y story taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athletic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets to me the robotics that i need for got health our got is very important as populated by got microbioda that communicate with the brain the mean system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate in long turn health and those robotics in athletic greens are optimal and vital for macrobiotic health in addition athletic greens contains a number of adaptions fitments and minerals that make sure the all my foundational nutritional needs are met and it taste grab if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock calm slash humoral and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you are on the road an the car on the plan et camera and they'll give you a year supply of vitamin d three k too again that is a let i greens dot calm slash superman to get the five free travel packs and the year supply a vitamin three k to it well get back to the a insolent sensitivity in glucose balance ism that is it in an impressive list of benefits i ouzo blood pressure of course most people are aware of blood pressure an what it is it is what the measure were we go to the doctor and i it is not very sexy nowadays on blood pressure plus yon blood pressure it is not don't be wanting here about the inflame at tome and the micro boom and all of that stuff is really interesting but i i think that blood pressure does not get enough attention i and we have spoken to on this podcast to doctor peter at who i is an expert in longevity and health span and things of that sort and and i was surprise to learn again i should not have been surprise that the number on reason people die world wide is sreetale vascular disease and party vascular disease and they're busily three things on the list of things to a dress one is not smoking ism ore raping by the way ism notes going there are few other things a relate to blood marker's apobeien things that sort but then the big one is blood pressure and it is it is interesting because we do not think about blood pressure that much any more as a as the kind of people interested in health optimization and health but blood pressure is vital to control it is wonderful to hear that deliberate cold exposure is one way to control blood pressure ism guessing in concert with other forms of exercise i let us talk about brown fat and i if you would if you are willing i lift to drilling to brown fat it at a deep level i again my understanding this is is far more elementary than yours obviously you are the expert my understanding about brown fat is that it is lo tan specific areas of our body i maybe more widespread than when i learned and school i thought it was i was thought it was just at the capitals in the back of the back and upper back but who knows i learn that there is more of it when we are children maybe more distributed throughout our body and that it is rich in mitochondria but what is special about the brown fat like waif we could just go into the biology brown fan a little bit what does it look have you have measured it in human subjects where is it distributed really can it expand its distribution can we active ate and expand the amount of brown fat as adults and am for those of you that are cringing already thinking we are talking about getting fatter it is quite the opposite we are talking about not subcutaneous fat but fat located around the the organs but please educate me am tell me where ism wrong and am expand my knowledge on brown fat yet you are not wrong but an it is definitely true that they are more locations of the brown fat the than we previously thought an there is this very nice to study from two thousand an seven seen by light nor at elm whet they they have made these appetites a overlaps of an they r subjects whet it can see where in the body do we have brown fat and where can we grow more brown fat an to say am the brown fat is can is very plastic means that it can it can grow into can decrease and disproven an in studies whet we have seen am and people with the far cry coma is a very specific candles type where peopewi were from the seventies when we can see that if they have the specific kind of a cancer type and the ability to have this tumor on them a a general gland they have an acute increase in not at drandolem and because of that they have this continuous activation of the brown fat and they have grown a lot of brown fat in the whole body my a a don't know where it is location these six different places but it is less bet very much compared normal people and and what they then see e what we learn from this study is that brown fat can apparently grow if you have i and increase in no adrenalin the body it is not you want that because when that happens you have a high blood pressure you do not want it chronically right you you just want it on a short amount of time and then it can grow forbid but you do not want a chronic of course not but because it it activates also your sympathetic nervous sister they have also showed they have highbrow pressure they had a they lost a lot of weight of course because this is activating your metabolism they they found luckily that when they my remove this bit benign a tumor a that it the brown fat i decreases again to normal size and they gain went again and they had a nomoblow pressure o the story and well but this cannoli proof of concept of that brown fat can actually grow it is plastic in it in its way of it can grow and i it decree again that is very good good studies to to see what it what the body is capable of but we do not of course want all that brown fat we just wanted sold be am wo just want to keep it actually and and keep it activated because what we see and studies is also that after the age of forty an people am it the studies have shown that there isn't a location with having less brown fat but increase o cecity of course we we do not know yet whether it brown fat decreases with send therefore we get o be or we get o beaten therefore we have less brown fat but as brown fat is and insolent sensitive organ in our body and we get u be a just the muscles get less sensitive am island sensitive the brown fat does as well and therefore it may be decreases it could be a theory that i think could be one of the reasons why we we do not see that must bound get an an elderly e people some had a lot the you people working outside thither a study showiness who people who wife outside do physical work outside farmer massage yet they interesting n y think to dust themselves to its tho don't do not just keep it in the way it is and i suppose we should clarify for people in kiss they do not know that insolent sensitivity is a very good thing you want that you want yourselves to be pensive to insolent insolent insensitivity is type to diabetes an is associate with obesity such as a point of clarification there a ye it is interesting to me i i i usually work out at home but i go to a him once or twice a week if i can because it is good if i see a the outside world u and there are a few individuals at the the him who they are not particularly large or muscular but they're incredibly lean and they are postures great presumably from the muscle skillital work u and they they are in there seventies and eighties and it is remarkable right n and and i know all the tell tell signs of person augmentation ism very good at spotting that or if you tell tell signs have talked about this on other pod gassing they are not that is not why they they are they are there fit they are they they are clearly of that look and you see this an outside the him too of course for people that look they have done a lot of physical labor they are whole life ye there just moving a lot that they have strong hands and features and t they are they are not necessarily excessively lean but you can tell that they have been using their muscosell a system and i to talk to these people bosom like not what are you doing now for your work out but what what did you grow up doing and i would say in obviously agent run statistics on this but more than seventy five per cent of them respond that they drew up on a farm or that they did some sort of manual labor or were a postmen or a postwoman ore doing something where they moved a lot for their earlier and threw out middle age and most o them are now in retirement but some of them are still working and they all still moving a lot the relationship between shiver and brown fat make sense to me but is it the case that as were just moving around ism afeard of t need non am exercise these stereo genesis of were just moving around am that we are activating brown fat or is does there need to be this stressed does there need to be shiver and a cold stimulus or a heat stimulus to activate the brown fat in other words am is just thing active enough or do we need to do some sort of temperature a shock type thing deliberate cold the exposure yet i think that is really good question because how how wat why do we have this tissue than if it if it has to be extreme then you can question what what we need this tissue for but it seems that you can activate the brown fit with just a little bit of exposure to to coats the codes of the most potent stress or activator of our brown fat because it is our temperature regulating an organ and abodes a first responded to that the muscles will be a list too late a and that or we have may be these two kind of tissues excel it just exposing yourself o o hand actually just to cold waters the studies have shown and that if you just put your hand and to wade r not that you're going to going to do that all day or or every day or anything it is not it is it is not something you have to do but it just shows that you can activate your brown fit just by getting a temperature change on your skin you can go outside and teach u that is why also we were just turning about while people who works outside or move a lot or get out in and out of it changing the temperature of the body all the time they will have more brown fat and e activating that is going to keep your metabolism higher and your insolent sensitivity is study have also down the the brown fat can be activated as soon as you just change your timberture in the skins o going outside in at tea shirt wearing cooling best also studies have shown this for ten days it is gone a grow your e you brown fat you can get more brown get if you expose yourself to the cold you do not have to start in a coat a shower you do not have to start in a cold a lunch if you are not really ready for that yet but just exposing yourself to the to wind has also shown to activate your brown fat or if you do not want to be a in this awake state in then you can also jo sleep in the cot and you will not notice that that much may be but studies at shown that if you sleep in nineteen degrees sensuous and then you will activate your a brown fat and you will grow your brown fat you have more of it this in very nice studies and from hansom it out from two thousand and seventeens show that a a group of subjects who slept in a room at twenty four degrees and then they made this petite scannings to see how much brown get do they have from the beginning o what we call baseline then they measured again after an a month of sleeping in nineteen degrees and they saw i think its remarkable just one month at nineteen degrees sleeping there they had a do bet on and they were still had close on wen to e sleeping to they are under a cover under ya under under tat ya danger the subjects o sleeping at nineteen degree for one month had increased is insolent sensitivity then next month they stepped at twenty four degrees the measured this again and and the had decreased actually a little bit and then they slept at it twenty seven degrees quite warm room actually for for the a fourth month am and they saw a even less a activation of the brown fat and also insolensensitively it seems that you can expose yourself and pet rapidly the brown fat will respond to this because it is sensitive to not adrenalin riot if you keep exposing yourself to little bit of cold you'll also get a limit a date to it but that is because the brown fat and has grown these more math contrive in the cells these small energy outbreaks that is going t activate the cells and that is going to take up glue coss and fat from the fatty assist is from the blot stream to keep the thermogenesis rock and that is going to clear up some sugar and is going to clear is into in the blood stream and some some fat as well the brown fat can in that way decrease a our unhealthy fat which is the white fat and and the white fat is what we do not one too much off but we stop need some of course in and it is our energy storage it is very important that it is there we just do not need a lot of it on our thighs and also around our inner organs that is where it is it is locate is if we can have activation of the brown fat just by going out in the cold and just by sleeping in a cold room or if you are have courage for it you can go out and expose yourself in a coat lunch and coat showers is also going to do the trick you can do different variations of this just exposing yourself to various temperatures is going to excavate the brown fat because it was involved to keep us in a perfect whom you static balance regarding temperature to keep us alive incredible i would not just get a clarification round this nineteen degrees series ism room that their sleeping in their under a comforter day and am any mention the clothes on a the room is nineteen degrees series but the temperature underneath their blanket might not be nineteen degree selsyn presume my it is the cold on their face that is activating a the the increase in a brown fat that was observed is that is that a reasonable an expectation i i think years because it is you have many a coverceptres in your face as is is actually it is enough and i think corresponds very well with the studies showing that you can private the brown fat just by putting a hand into a a pocket of cot water and i did this experiment myself in in my studies just to see how well did they a respond to cold water it was a four degrees cestus a cold water for four minutes and then i just measured blot pressure and heart wright to see to they have an accusation of whites i actually also measured the brown fat during this era cot exposure for four minutes with an inform thermography camera to see can i see that the brown fates activated and just just to tell i go back to the location of the brown get usually you cannot really see excavation of your bound e casts located es sensually in your or around your sense nervous system an and and the biggest demo as you mention before is up here e under the the clebicular bones an and very close to the skin's surface and because it close to the skins surface i could measure it with this very expensive camera and it is not very feast for people to go home into this do not because it takes a lot of practise i can tell and but we measured the brown fat with this an and and i could see that after a few minutes that the excitation was there and increase in temperature i arose from that in accusation just four minutes it is very rapid and ism also measured in my study how deep was the brown fat under your skin it is very close to the surface which also shows that it it needs to be there to to heat you of and he e he your inner organs but ism delighted to hear all of this not t it'll tell you why and one is by way of anecdote i mention a love bit earlier that as atoner grate id i work on all have the study from ma dances and were can that in animals but we hare this room that was very cold the whole room was called i the i who i worked for at the time an am very carlyleas a very accomplished physiologist he came from this linen i do not know if this literature still a discussed much by its a beautiful literature am from wrothwell and stock they were the ones who discovered a non exercise in duce thermal genesis the fact to people bounce who bounced their legs a lot and move around a lot and have a lot of kind of a sarcastic movement a burn up to eighteen one thousand eight hundred calories more per day than people who sit more still aunt incredible and just incredible a i do not think that work desert a gets as much attention as it deserves publishing journals nature very a fine journals but in any event a one of the things that i notice when i started working in that laboratory was that i was cold because the room was cold and a doctor argyle harry a said well the key is to wear a teacher in here for about two three days and then you will cold adapt i thought well would not i want to put on a goodie and get warm in there i was comfortable n he said no actually what you want to do is get yourself uncomfortably cold active at your brown fat and indeed when i did that i think was just two days of being in that cold environment then i could come back on the third day and be perfectly comfortable because the brown fat had expanded a were it were added mydocondrio or both and i was perfectly comfortable in that environment i also got very very lean in those a in those days on weeks now have never been somebody whose very lean norm y somebody who carries a lot of excess at of postissuum t have somewhere in the middle ism sure i could adjust that with feeding if i won to but it was it was striking a what a powerful effect it had on my entire system of thermal regulation and one of the things that i a also delighted in when sell reports a medicine published your study as they had in an accompanying a press release that went out to to those of us that remove press releases in it described a a a saying and scandinavia which is a essentially ism not an attempt to i speak a danish eventhough i have a much of my family as in denmark a believe not from denmark we have lot of dates in my family i will not embarrass myself my trying to speak danish as i did before the the microphones were rolling but that there is a saying that i think essentially a translates to in the fall when when you are approaching winter you want to actually wear fewer layers not bundle up when you go outside that you can prepare yourself for the cold of winter and be able to heat yourself up using your brown fat and that in the spring as the temperatures are warming rather than removing layers you want to wear more layers in order to be a little bit uncomfortably warm that in the heat of the summer you are better at cooling your body do i have that right any do the saying and would you be willing to share it only the swedes and a and dates will be able to understand maybe the norwegians to if you do not know it that is o ka ya i know that i know that the concept of it because we say it ye should you should wear a less before winter and they and more before summer there it is in the pallor itheecause it to be ecerteri ye and and you are completely riot and i think this is ta this is just something that we know in the scandinavian country es i think that we we we inintoitively know this but if we just go back i the bin i history i think that is i around in nineteen fifties e the russia government went out and said while we should do something about the to tobaccolosisa in pen the make i or epic ta make the worse at that this time that they wanted to have to the people am be more brasilin to the cold and also increase our humans e system in scandinavia an extiosintrussia we have put our babies outside to sleep a in the prom and that is to i to to get more resistance to the cold but also to increase our man system ad we still do that and then mike the we you really yet we do abies are taken out in the cold an the snow and frosty rain everything my to boys have been sleeping out in winter or at least the fir their first many free for five years because it is very good for them an they get a the a better a union system and get brasilin to the cods that it will have less cods and also they run around in a tea shed when it super to because they have activated all their brown get i did not understand at that time i us s i must say but i cannot into it to be also new because we have inherited this a way of doing things with our culture and have heard people coming from the yew as saying a days a crazy they put their babies outside and props and leave them there the nickel inside and drink coffee and the id all the pains are crazy i i i i adore the a a the other amazing a culture and people ism fortunate have family members a from denmark but i did notice when when we were in copenhagenan and i know am we we saw you there not long ago it was tune am the water in the harbor was was cold yer for even though the pacific is close to hear on which is very cold i felt pretty cold but i it was summer time is a people were in summer time mowed night to shirts in short somethings that that sort but it did strike me that people in copenhagen are dramatically fitter then they are in the united states me for saw everyone is bicycling everywhere a not many people wearing sun glasses trying to extract as much futon energy from the sun as possible which i support ah as everyone knows at a bicorn of getting sun but also am when we did see swimmers am they were swimming in this cold water and it was nothing and there the ranging age of the swimmers was what was remarkable you saw the kind of fit triathlete looking types but also young kids i really young kids and the people probably in there again there the seventies eighties made even nineties really a remarkable a vastly different than what you see if you go to the ocean here in a loss angelisern or elsewhere i a you skananavians are on to something with this it'd to talk about your study ism if you could give a solicit of the backdrop about what motivated that study and then mum and then walk us through what you did who the subjects were mum what you had them do what you measured ism ins much detail as you would to share because i think it is such an important even fair to say landmark study because it also explored not just cold but son and the the to use of cold and sand as a way to probe metabolism and brown fat and other markers as well and as you do this it's hoping at some point that you might an tell us some of the observations that you might have made that interested you that perhaps were not in the paper are that is one of the great benefits of sitting across from somebody who who did the work in details ism of you could tell us about your study and o what you did in what you discovered think you for the question drew i i love to a explain a let what did we do because when people read this kind of paper they just see the numbers they do not see what what happened before that an human studies are very different from from my study my study you can do a knock out of something and then everything is perfectly matched and control you in human studies is very far different from that because people are different even in the groups ya but what we in when estate this repeat in two thousand and sixteen i did not really know what the brown fat was to s tot reading of on all this and i was very interested in preventive medicine am also to studies that i did be orbit brown fat was a very much in the preventive side how can we that was about something else but it the sweet tooth and how can we lower our sweet both and stuff tat but after that i wanted to to do something new i look into the brown fat got high in this a fantastic research group were they it is the sell groups a day mostly did sell studies and they did not have any one to do a human study yet am an them but they really wanted me to to do that i get upon a lot of research about how does the brown get gat activated what have been done already and i mentioned the paper before with sleeping in the cold i found that particular paper very fascinating and that was where am at that time as case cold exposure as an intervention of sleeping in the cold could be a good thing to go out and say shall people do this but on the other hand is first of all it was already done there was one thing but the other thing was well i wanted to to see if we can do and some kind of activity we can have people move a good do something do something together or whatever an and an the cold made us think about well wat about winter swimming and it was cannot a bit of a joke in the beginning as i wine swimming yes can i estivate the brown get riot but but when we read the literature we could not really find anything about exhibition of the brown fat with cold water besides hand in a budget of cold water that real there was already there we were just think it of it should be very potent em exhibition of the brown get if it is cold water but very different from cold are it was cannot also a new thing we were going in to and if we knew that we were going to do a more of a m a a proof of concept study a at the beginning of at because it was winter swimmers am must in theory celibate the brown fat right but we cannot did not really know with was this kind of stressed too much too little or what will happen actually but we had this idea about wile we always say that cold water winter swimming will decimate your metabolism but do but do we know if it did does that know we do not and and while this idea was a little bit a fun fun at the beginning and we canceler accepted it was lie o careless just try this out but because we did not have the funding for it we was orca let us do a prove a cons up study and let us go with a small number but enough to see and at difference between the groups the power calculation of that study is done on eh what we know i from petty scannings of the brown fat that is the main outcome of that of course and and we wanted to go little bit smaller e numbers of participate because we wanted to particulate bi deeper into the different mechanisms and also we do some of the e the days i really wanted to do that to see if i can replicate also the fine things and that is on to take a lot of a lot of a funding but its also going to take a lot of time to do it and the prove a monster was just going small but looking at different mechanisms we also took and fat bi a sense for example and looked at the white fat to see if there was any differences between the groups before and after and stuff that that is canna how it started and then the first year was i feel study for me i was not a winter swimmer when i started this it was just or really no i was not an at all i non ever say ours a bit o hit of the cold myself and bit of a cold sissy an always cold having big socks on and sweaters and smelt that though us i am comfortable ism just everybody else very comfortable i being comcompletey temperature neutral and but i start lying with the thought were if this is healthy in theory i should not pack myself up i should start not doing that but the first year observation i when to swim us undertetty they and of joked about as they come on as under you need to try this you cannot study this an unless you have tried it i now how very funny of course i can do that but i could not i i read the late to i understood an theory what happens when you go into to water but i completely understood it when i first tried it the first few times not funny it felt painful it was just running too long i after a long break and you and your muscles have the day after ride you you completely regret that you took that extra would about when you say uncomfortable you mean uncomfortable when you got in and when you were in or uncomfortable afterwards because i find that i on rare occasions i should just at full disclosure i i do deliberate cold exposure every morning for about a minute to two minutes in a cold plunge there are days that i miss but when ism at home i do that and when i travel i do a cold shower i do finish with a worm shower i and we will talk about why that is probably not the best idea but i and have ben doing it for some years now i on and off a but i just full disclosure on a devote tee i and i have family members that i hate the the cold but have got into it and and are starting to it but they do not and i do not necessarily the experience in the cold water but i love the way i feel when i get out and i e ism a hundred per cent on that statement about loving it when i get out occasionally it feels good to be in there it feels invigorating i think have learned to control the gas reflects and the hyper ventilation and i just have told myself what we know which is at the forebrain struggles to engage for the first twenty or thirty seconds but if you can't pass that wall it is it is far easier to to push through i but when you say that it was really uncomfortable you mean the experience of getting in or you also tell lousy afterward now and very important to clear that out i only felt very uncomfortable doing it at the moment but afterwards the first time i went i with with a group and actually my husband was thus as well because i i really one is some one i knew am coming along because his very normal if you have not done this before you feel a libel anxious about it did not this is join studies as well because blow pressure and harbored goes up in in those who are new to this kind of activity am i was fibered anxious about it it was really uncomfortable just doing and put afterwards as soon as i got up i feel fantastic and we went in to the son and i did three rounds because i just loved it i love the feeling afterwards because you have all this newton's riders going in your brain and you feel more positive you feel i feel invigorated had much energy and that i i could totally see why people would do this to get energy throughout the day because i definitely had that i did not have to do three dips to to get that i think one would be enough and i often do that also now to day i to one dip sometimes i do two o three it dips i in in one round you cutin one day but i often is just one or two times to week for me that is enough to to get that energy and to get that positive feeling and and i think that that is also why i i put up my study in that way i wanted to study the lowest dose you can say the lowest amount at we can get away with but still see am helve benefits what i observed there on the teddy was that some didst a long time there were in the water for a very long time and me it seemed maybe a li extreme to give me an example a long her well maybe there were really swimming and they cut bit twenty minutes of half an hours a long her that is a long time and there was ice and people who came up i mean i just did not really feel that this is a something that i wanted to go out and recommend to people after i mi wantinyyyser subject dying yer gas i you are not adapted an y people of people cannot do the also at twenty minute cold shower or twenty minute cold plunge i know people do it but is probably not a good idea not probably not itsconexhaust yourselves and a then make them age too fast exactly that is e when you pass that domestic stress as the healthy stress level that is what is happening be quite opposite s is a almost chronic stress equally in themselves well what happened then was that am i found out that if i want to have this protocol get through ethical comedy i i really needed to go very sleep with they not too long and and make sure that they were also very healthy and and to get approval of course of the study an but what i did was to to recruit win to swimmers who already have been swimming for two or three seasons and i just observed them i said ism not gone it do and intervention study yet i did that after but i i wanted to do a proof of concept where they were already adapted to the cold and then compare them to a match control group who were matched on am on you is a diet weather vegetarian or not am and one of them worse in each group e also they were not all vegetarian no no no is one in each group i can say with all the amazing fish in meat in i then marry to have a hard time ma better no rads or amazing the fruits on beguiles to but ice to the were couple f vegetarians in each group ketone one in each younger and they were rattled vegetarian i have teen remembers yo vegetarian ism just coke e ye but the were they were match on different things what we usually match them on is also be am i am we chose one gender in this study and we would always choose both men and women o milk but we do see that there are different a brown get levels a depending on gender women have more brown fat than men really interesting ye a thing is interesting e a deserve study ye ye why actually i think it is interesting because women are also smaller in size and mass right but they also have and an lower perish temperature especially on hands and ears and is a right that is that is document end the women do run colder than men ye and there is oologically i did not my psychological no no no we will not we will not go to the psychological that is different yer something else that's a different part cast another time women are just colder physically is on hands and ear sits meshed on that an and and an feet as well compare to men and men have bigger hearts than women and they can pump out more plot a period than in a woman's body they the could be an explanation for the colder handpick simple comfortable state is also different between get genders men are more comfortable at twenty two degrees sepsis and women are the me comfortable at twenty four degrees sepsis and these are the thermostat work of home have been now valid shares the study degrees else by the way prior to a starting recording a i made the executive decision that we were going to go with easiest throughout the podcast an because the majority of the world uses else for those ye that think in fare here am the internet is your friend in making those conversions we were sticking i series men tend to be there comfortable at twenty two degrees series women at twenty four i interesting explain a lot about so some arguments in the homes where men are turning down the eater and women of threader and they cannot really it is it is really is ism on both sides here i understand the men we understand the women but there is a difference there which was also one of the reasons why we had we in this protocols have studied you one gender it is not only because we wanted to study men it was just to see to eliminate e old the confounding factors which could have an impact on on our resorts am that was one of the reasons am but also because we yes women have have more brown fat than men otherwise we would have to do four groups or something that and not having funding yet we were ache we need to do which is one a group just care group and then i and a group who always winters swimmers i recruited when to swimmers wo have been win for two to three seasons m because i wanted them to be already adapted but not going too long in the water they told me e i did a lot of screening here of course beforehand and intivews to see toast tom how much do you do and am how much do you how long o you stay in the water and i am monitor how long did did not stay in the water recruited based on am that they only did to to three times to week it seems reasonable e for for denmark at least to do that and they stayed only in the water for one to two minutes the cover subsides very quickly and you would get this exhibition of your rest ti just system which is your parts impact nervous systems of the the other branch of your order e famous nervous system and you get that exhibition because you submerge into cold water and when you do that you have an exhibition of your diving response and the that is gone a slow down the you can say the the consumption of oxygen also in your body and that is gonslow down your heart made and i pause you on the scan i hear this before that when we get into cold water show or or immersion we get this sympathetic autonomic response o increase blood pressure increase heart rate release of troupe an affray from the locus rubious in the brain release of ism a gentleman demean a gentleman from the from the renal do not b mean presumably within the brain but that the part sympathetic response is activated when we put our face into cold water or go under water and that is a calming relaxation response this brings us back to i do not not take us off track from you describe in the study but this brings us back to the first question which is if i go completely under water for a moment when i start my cold plunge does that change that physiological outcome as comparative i just submerge myself up to the neck in that actually now dis there'isthat seems to be a little bit of a movement on line of people putting a bowl of ice water on their countertype and submerging efface into it you see thus as ta start give canon artists about yes m con you just touch on what the ivory fleets is and why it act perhaps activates the per sympathetic response o this calming response let us the the diving reflects is existed when you submerge into cool water am even just to the neck ye or i thoughtyou had to get your face under i not not arguing different hourly expert i just want you new i have not really i have not read that i just seen i that you can private your that diving response as soon as you go under water with your body and you do not have to do it with your face as far as i understand i could i could be wrong though i ye when when you private your a diving response you slow down your i your oxygen consumption and your band does is because the body tries to represser am oxygen you will not get hypothermia too fast is kind of a survival system in your body and this survival system is very i important for use of course that will be excavated and they because of that you after maybe one minute or i ta cannot be precise on that because i may be also very bitten inhuman one to two minutes you have full exhibition of the sympathetic nervous system but also the prison paying the system em and that is going to exabyte for examples something likes toxin in your brain which is also got for mecca balas and people feeling in mental bellman's afterwards they after they go up i that is mess your dona e question airs and also meter ligan an and a dotes of course people tell all the time that they feel good after what we need studies on this if any one sitting out there thinking that is interesting then please do some study som that i are to get more out of that ye you had you observe these winter swimmers who are done this for a few seasons ye they are coming around for a new season of winter swimming and you have decided retreat them he subjects they are getting into cold water u climbing down a ladder or jumping into the water up to their back ye climb ya get climbing down a ladder into the cause is done outdoors what a fun study to do my my aqua the is was done under florescent lights with no windows in i in a building at am ad ton o for as a pay e soon asyehat lived in the laboratory as area she soon i loved it much but m not something require to do a pea she by the way but they are climbing down the ladder ye getting in up to their neck staying in for one to two minutes and then getting out and how many times a week er they doing this a tit do this two to three times to week and for each time they go each day they go if they take three rounds o feds and two sonacissens they start in the cold and they end in the cold water o case it is get in for one to two minutes then get out and get into the sand ye what is the temperature the son about eighty degrees serious o k the en how long are they in thisonor they stayed there i for ten to fifteen minutes depending on if they went two times pe week or three times the week of and then they get back into the cold for a few minutes ya to minutes up to two minutes yo then back into the honor fifteen minutes or yet then back into the cold for a third round yet back into thisonour then then then there ending on them then back into the cold again and then ending on cold gain i and we will told about wise important end on cold the called sober principal am how cold was the water in this particular given the average cause i rase its out door winter swimming its can a very depending on win shill and things as wealth of course it is the very uncontrolled environment to do this kind of studied and but i wanted to do something that was a very close to something people can do for free going out in nature and u stay and also have the nature it is very healthy unpack on us it loves our stress stress level at swell by doing i also gesture the temperature every time they went i homeless grab and is sexually in winter swimming book it shows the temperature and then my going from october to aril and its like stops at twelve degrees sir think it surround travel to twelve degrees i session him the water and then it goes down to two degrees in on average and canary and then off again and it is within the spectrum up very cold water i was save from around fifteen fifteen degrees sumptuous and and down but it was section not colder than two to four degrees in in on average when it was the coldest does not have to be that cold to be good enough and and enough to estivate our metabolism and and what time of day or om the prercecipence doing this coldsonor alternation i think they did this a threw out the day i did not control w whether they wanted to go in the morning in the afternoon or or in the evening at that time where i set up the study i will i was not controlling it in that way i wanted them to go whenever they had time and i also think that is the most important message to give out to give to photo is when do it when you have time it is not if if if doing it i when you get home from work and it is six o'clock in the evening and this is the time where you are when you can do tin an en try out if it is on impact your sleep or not if it does not impact your sleep than fine but you have to try for yourself and find out what works for you its the same for coffee i san maid some people can drink coffee in the evening and go to bed and they can sleep i cannot er exercise or exercise exactly i cannot i cannot do that and that is because the coffee exercise cold water and immersion s gonna celibate your a sympathetic nervous system you have an increase in street response in your body and an that is going to make it really hard to fall asleep for some people at least and maybe you are stop exhausted anyway and then you'll just crash n anyways but yet but and that that is the only thing it'd just told them to do this if they can during the daytime and and that is primally what they also did and then all long your measuring brown fat by way of this informed camera right i what did you observe in terms of changes in brown fat how quickly did that occur and and then it'd to ask also about son a bit more because earlier you mention that you can active brown fat with son is well with heat i mud your for get the surface of the skin how long did it take before you observe significant increases in brown fat and was it increase density of my brown fat or distribution was it showing expansion to different regions throughout the body and i maybe could also touch on some of the changes in insinsolent sensitivity in metabolism ye a very good question and and i did not mention the spirit before but besides measuring i a temperature as an outcome for brown fat activity we also i did pi am or eye scaring a of the brown gets of disdislike the the golden standard a for measuring brown fan in is not very feasible for normal people to get and and a pit seeds or pit am or i a scanning of the born fat is superexpensive and we had both a to see if we kid have a continuous a measure of brown fat inhuman because that was already not not out there wanted to see during both the experimental days but also during day and night what kind of suction a rhythm do we have in our brown fat activity that is why won id have that as well the persist scanning a or the pit am or i scanning was to see upon cold exhibition and stimulation for some hours do we have animation can we see the brown get in this subject and also during theminautrality of them comfortable state a how is that existed in each of the group of course as do you want to see how comfortable people were away from the cold water and honor to at different temperature increments is at right yes i also measured that how comfortable are you i had i made the scale be sure an alone scale and asked them how comfortable do you feel with this temperature and and threw out the study days during cold exposure and the for comfortable day the had a whole day where just kept them a them comfortable to we do they activate the brown fat if they are just completely the for comfortable as good as we could get with that us you were asking people an on a scale for on one to tan and five being the m comfortable where are you on the scales of one would be very cold and ten would be super burning heat and ye and that was the way to it try to figure out how do they actually feel my also doing the studies also measured i in elector a biography a of of muscles to see to they shiver during the cooling they a sometimes people shiver before they know that really shivering i have interesting ye a is or a conscious perception of shivering might not be the best read out of shiver yell you if you also get adapted to the cold water you would have if less shivering the would be less vigorous there would be very small you would not probably know that your shivering because this the shivering is small and e ma to wonder in the muscles sells would be thence that it does not need to shiver may be that much to get it that a some for genesis going an compare to when you are completely new it to cold we water exposure you are not adapted than the body needs to create these mite contra these energy fabrics to keep you warm and that is also what is the exercise is in the beginning but am when we measured this we we did see that the winter swimmers were shivering less e or e having less a vigorous shivering when they said ism cold even though they they perception that perception of the cop was pretty similar and n in the in the groups and we could see that the the expiration of the the muscles that we measured on an were different and more biccurous in the control we the subjects in sent of uses to be in the study when they paid or anything of that sorter they just happened a doing a golden honor and that is why they did the study an while they got paid a little bit a for i but not much and an it the that is how we do this sore i was just aura ye yo i just cures there might be some folks of wonder what did you discover in terms of changes in brown fat insolent resistance or insolent sensitivity rather and am madame demoiselle what we we saw e was we had this kind of different measures an to see what is to than on wool what was actually going on when they are already adapted to the cold water compared to a control group who was i match on on barbarous pyramid us we we did see that the winters swimmers had and increase insolent sensitivity they produced less insolent on all the experimental days besides from just cooling them and measuring the brown fat on each of these cooling days her two cooling days and one to more comfortable dey ran i wanted to measure insolent winder just they were fasting meaning that they had not eaten in a eight hours before the study day and and they werecompletely long still not moving just in a bet and and we measured insolent a during the experimental day just to see how what level are they on and we could see that the the the winter swimmer had lower production of insolent and they a when they hat and bluecoat thank we give them that to see if they to test before we enroll them in studies to see if they have diesis for extend and not knowing for exam i that that would not that would ruin may be the studies we test for that and see if they have a normal curve what ways did seen that was at the winter swimmers had a fast a glucose clearance in the blood stream after two hours we could see that they had a lower level and went the curve went down faster than ancantro grows dis pay having lower insolent release they have better blood la cost clearance which is really what you want what we all see careful excessive insolent is bad insolent being a more or less a chaperon for a blood glucose i a can do all sorts of other things as well of course but a and having his bogle cops obviously terrible we for ls especially brain cells i do not think people realize how talks high blood at glucose is have not higecotis turd b if you you want to kill naans you make you make the each put him in in environment where there is too much sugar a oh ye very a very narrotalksic i mean that is and the mechanisms insolent that buff for that we keep en keeping blood glucose in a reasonable range that a that does not happen o man i think that is why people will go into insolenemic shock a hypoglycemic shock is also possible that range in which neurons are happy is not a bit is not a tremendously large range incidentally the range in which neurons are are happy in surviving a is much greater as one gets colder than when you heat up i mean that you n basely destroy brain cells by getting too hot for too long y a you can deviling destroy brain cells permanently by getting too cold for too long but you have to get really really cold for a really long time ye a the rains fifty ye were thinking about doing a an episode on i his for survival of the brain after death kind of things which actually happen o you here about these people who are declare dead and then came back and there actually now lot of cower preservation type approach is for that disks a an way we a risk going into the the a the esoteric now swell stere aback to our discussion about your study but am if i do the mat these subjects are in the cold let us ay there doing three rounds of cold for one to two minutes three up two or three times a week what were the thresholds that you discovered were important for getting these positive changes in such as reduced blood sugar or clearance of blood sugar a being more efficient a reduced in silent am improve brown fat distribution and density a how much cold exposure do people need how much heat exposure to people need in order to extract these benefits yes the when wether calculated the numbers together we can see that this was ended up being eleven minutes a in total per week a not in one session of course but they had to to free visits to the water and de son per week when we divide that out it corresponds to being in to water one to two minutes at a time but also in the son ten to fifteen minutes at a time an i think this is very a also similar to what we see in other studies when we look for example to the observational studies from the finish a color study from a a loin it ell for resembled that published this very macing paper in two thousand and fifteen am some resorts from this long for study where they show that am that up to thirty minutes a in the son was a healthy and they you you lure your risk of cagubasculincees and that is the threshold and if you go further than that than there was not more a i healthy benefits to to gain from that and before that is nineteen minutes then you will have this dose responds relationship up to nineteen minutes that really increasing your risk of cargubescular diseases and i think we are elite week ninety minutes per week a ninety minutes percussion icessionly a percussion if we i a then compare that with my study which was ten to fifteen minutes permission then i think it fits very well with what we call the domestic stress o healthy stress you exposed the cells to this kind of potent very stress for situation a whether a increase heat shot perinea in the cells and that will repair the cells but if you within overdo it and you go beyond there may be thirty minutes in the son this observational study from a finland with more than e ought to two thousand son bathes wit have fall of these for twenty years they see that a thirty in is possession is enough and if you go above that you do not get more health benefits out of it i think that is the window where we can say the healthy stress corresponds to ten minutes think it is lirsession permission and it is not it's not much actually you do not need to it shows that you do not have to expose yourself very much to the heat or very much actually to the cold to get this healthy a benefits er from me going into cold going to heat and have healthy benefits on your cotibescular system think this is very important also message to to to get out that you do not have to go extreme you do not have to a swim for half an hour in the cold water you can go in the water for once or two minutes an permission but go up to eleven minutes per week and total and for the son a my studies showed a fifty seven minutes in total per week and if we also then divided out on these to three days and two sessions each day correspond to ten to fifteen minutes it is a low treason but i think it is it is good to have that to maybe we can aim for that if if people needs to have something to to aim for and i think and i think it is really good to have that because then you you do not have then you do not overdo it and if you overdo it you exhaust selves and that will increase your risk of cadubesco vidicease also i get a lot of questions about this and i did solicit for questions for this part caisson on twitter in one of the questions to day tot was as one becomes more cold adapted to the benefits start to wear offer can people do too much cold exposure of course the answer to that as year you become hypothermic but ism since in a different answer now which is if i understand correctly and the threshold is eleven minutes total per week of deliberate cold exposure divided into two or three sessions of maybe one to three minutes depending on how long somebody says in and then fifty seven minutes i want to be careful not ta round up a to an hour but divided into maybe three twenty minute sessions or i one does not have to be perfect as longs you get about beyond that threshold but i i wonder something which is is it the case that if somebody said oh ism just going to do one eleven minute session per week that might actually not be as beneficial as dividing it up because what you told us earlier is that the hermetic response depends on having that cold shock you actually do not want to become too cold adapted i mean once the blood pressure response drops down in minute four five and six you are getting very cold and your shivering but your one is not getting the autonomic stimulus that they want i guess i could in this to if exercise worked in a way where it was only the first few minutes of exercise that really triggered the adaptation of course is is not outworks but m in fact probably quite the opposite but if that were the case then it is not simply the total amount of exercise but dividing up the the the sessions into little bouts where every single time it acts as it as a stimulus that seems to be the key here i this is very important i because having watched the landscape of this on social media but also in books and generally i i think you are the first person to really touch on this that the goal is not to get cold adapted that you can sit in for the full eleven minutes in one session where the goal is not to be able to do an hour of very hot son if you want to i suppose people could d it for other reason but if the goal is to improve these health metrics then the ideas to keep the stimulus a stimulus short exactly retreat will this also i think there is practical feasibility as you pointed out as getting into a cold show or coldimmersion or natural body water for a couple of minutes is far less a i challenging to most people thin finding a full morning to go in a so n there but have never really heard it articulated that the longer sessions might not be beneficial and might actually be detrimental that is very important a were there any other observations that you made that did not make it into the paper or that were kind of in the the martian notes in terms of psychological benefits it were anything of that sort there was this recent study and soldiers that talked about wait loss a sort of a controversial study for letter reasons but one of things they remarked in the paper was that there were a lot of psychological changes improved buffering against anxiety they even the men and women in that study reported one of the significant effects was a significantly improved sexual satisfaction of ort they did not tell us what that meant for these subjects and we will not go there but but a number of subjective improvements was there anything that you observed or took note of and in your study that perhaps did not make the main abstract bet the we should be aware of i there was them am and ism a to day i regret that i did not pressure on sleep for example i i frankly did not really think about that when i i when it assigned the study and we were very m much occupied with the metabolism and cannot had the thought maybe this could impact a sleep quality and and i wish i just i had the thought that why do not you just asked the in a question now but i asked them every morning or everyone who was not many more is to just two morningsectually ism we measured on and but the winds o swimmers and told us before i wrote them that they had a really good e sleep quality the conto who also had that but they told me on the day when we gestured a brown fat on a on the day and the night a i tally two days and two nights and they told me that they did not they had a good nights sleep but they also woke up is just telling me that they also had a quick wake up and then they fell asleep again em and the winter swimmers as did they have a really good sleep he s and in general they all they say we we sleep very well i sleep very well said it is anecdotally general it corresponds to what i heard in my study but nothing that i measured on and which i could be fund to do in the future but we did not measure her on sleep quality that would be have been a really good idea to do they also told me that they were very comfortable an when they were cold they they do not mind a winter swimmers the do not mind i going out for example and in in the colt with a tea shirt they were also less e scarred off showing the skim that as o select and sent the for can of reduced social anxiety yet they were just comfortable in the lap yours you just venture before coats on and everybust morning around us very busy and and all the other in sins test out in the whole way and the also my supervise had her out office down down the whole way and and one of the winter swimmers one day just got out of bed after i have been in the study for it eight hours we the was a long day right he jumped out of the bed and had his clothes in the bath room and he went out completely naked he did not care he just went out it was that is a side of fact a of getting a too comfortable what i could on i were not recommending that now though in your book you did they a you dedicated some all me said the e again although in your book you dedicated some a pages to naked winter swimming work i should say naked cold water exposure as opposed to a with bathing suit ye are there any data on this observed chasing bun i think it in most places in the united states its i skinny dipping is not am is not legal a most public beaches the are few in fact where my laboratory before moving a stamford was in sanies and i at the talk institute for biological studies beautiful building incredible sciences done there the beach right below that is called blacksbeach and and it is a no need beach and whenever tourists were having down the stairway there i would yourselves let them know especial if they had kids id let them know yet t and it is a new beach of a particular of a particular jokers i i give them all warning about what what they could expect down below it is e in any event those those beaches are quite rare in the united states may be compared to rope i do not know but eyes is there anything special about am clotheless verses clothed am exposure you have thinking in that sense ewe have be more free with this kind of be but remember we also have this winter swimming closure for up a hundreds of years and then mine and the and it the oldest winter swimming clubs that we have especially the one we have in copenhay can where i did my next study which we have not talked about but and its also not pub published yet but and in that wen to swimming club it is the oldest one we have in its hate and this the swim naked at it is e facility men and women men and women and they have a no where they can go in together and i also have the separates on us but it is very much i a danish thing and and i think it is i think it is i think it is good if people want that and and i had it in my book because people want to know if they have to swim with their bating suit on or if they can take it off or what the what is the difference is the any difference in this and if you ask me there is no difference if you have your little skinny bekinyon is not going to do any difference to your a cold exposure or your adaptation is not going to do any difference for your benefits of course but i think that it has something else it has something to do with how you also upset yourself how you u suet your surroundings is some si some see o freedom and skinny dipping i think people in ben ma cudustis is they do do went to swimming because they feel free when they do they to come home from where they go to this club and they skinny dip and they feel in touch with nature and they have may be done this the whole life this is an old tradition and den make in some of the clubs an but the new york clubs there coming they do not stay do not a skinny did every one has bathing suit i never skinnydip because the people around people with phones and taken precious old i time this is different different nowadays everything nite refrinente yet ya and oh is this old tradition is sass fating away because of that ye i i you swan old at home but when i travel the there is a a by russia bosnia has hotsona and cold plunge m there is one in samicisco called archimage bony and that one is clothing optional some people are clothes such as myself and then other people are not and it is coed most of the time i think they have mel a female separated a evenings or something that and then the other bones spy eighty eight which is n on wall street in new york is an amazing bone as well u and these are trying to crop up in different cities or maybe they have been there for a long time and as the liberal cold exposure and son a gets more popular more people are using them the the one in new york that i that a spicy is always clothed u and that it is interesting because people here a naked or skinny dipping and that they they might get certain ideas in mind it ye all these places are very well lit and they all have a tone of kind of a of health that is about the kind of health and and and wellness i guess the point being that there is no requirement a to do one thing or the other although in the studies that a you did obviously people were clothed but i i did i did pay attention to those pages in your book tho n isatin the you put som some dedicated a passages in your book of relation to this and i think it my publish o knee that o you no a a a i was not me an y publish a really anti to have a little discussion about that e oke we i think it points to a larger theme which as i think for a lot of people who already do these practices there is no shock there for people that do not do deliberate cold exposure or sand i think that there is the s idea perhaps that owing o these are traditions that are are kind of fringe or that they are cut and i just i wanted cut that point because there is many things that are happening right now in biomedical research and medicine in serious quality previewed studies publish an excellent journals your paper on things deliberate cold exposure sand the use of particular supplements natural natural herbs and supplements an me the is entire branch of the national institutes of health the united states dedicated just to the study of supplements and behavioral interventions for health meditation and breastwork blecredible incredible and psychedelics of course being something that for a long time was part of a certain community and feel and now is being u frankly adopted by mainstream me medicine even farm it the the times are changing and a yes i thing it is imported to know that it is perfectly acceptable and encouraged to wear clothing absolutely absolutely in one other thing that is i wanted to to mention going back to your questions around with there were any observations an the studies which we really maybe having discussed yet maybe it is in in the back of the the paper ism not mentioned that much was on of the wince to swims did not have any brown fat when we measured him zero cero and e in we do see this i in in in previous studies as well that some humans do not have any brown fat was he did he carry wot of white fat at of was to so was he was he ones no he was not know he was not obese because that he would not have been in the study them i all right a yes ye mention is termed for him an know but he was them but what i did observe before i knew that he did not have any brown for was that during the cooling experiment where i cooled them for e two hours before they go into the petty scanner e he was not able to control his a shivering the winter swimmers i could he got he got very a cold very easily i compared to the others and without our did not know what was different about him but we could l all or me and the three others were working on experiment we were oke what is going on because we turned down the temperature but he started shivering and then we had to turn it up again and it was just all over the place the temperature is not it was not that controlled the others was pretty similar protocol i could just do pretty much the same because there was same size and e also said jammer it it it was easier e to foresee what was going to happen when will they start shiver i quickly learned that but with this subject it was just with to say volunteer was just very much different and then when we scanned him and did not find any brown for i i i did not even think about it when we scanned him we did not see anything i told the pets see peoples who oh you put up the wrong scanner it was tits acknowledge ye it tin acknowledge was this scanning look the third a neutral day the third comfortable day when we also scanned them to see if they have any brown fat you had made a mistake i was pretty sure and the reanalyses anal analyzed this i scanning and they just concluded well it the scanning was fine the experiment went well it was just that he did not have any brown fat he was what we just in the paper called at a brown fat negative he did not have any and in nicer studies i would be called a knock out he did not have any brown fan but the observation with him and i think that would be that is interesting is that he both shivered very early on and did not regulate his temperature as well he also told me that then he was a five on the scale of how comfortable he felt with the cold an e it was from one to ten and five being more comfortable and and being a very a cold e and and one very thought on this s scale of an of and down and he he was more up and down on this scale than any of the other it was an observation that i did and but we did see in his blood samples also that his blood samples looked a bit more the control group and also his i insolent levels were the control groups o a la bit higher than the other winter swimmers and he also had an a a a the his block to coast clearance was not as the fast as him as the he the other winter swimmers he was an outlier what we call it and indianalysis we also had to take him out e of the analysis because he was an outlier and the results showing that the brown fat e is a more efficiently activate in the winter swimmers is without him having him in that group though it did not ruin us the study if i tried to put him m in as well and didn't it did not ruin the results or anything but just to to keep it more clear we put we to come out of the analysis yes has a me tent a dockhand ism sure there out there a very interesting few river early am then perhaps you have less brown fat to begin with all that hard to conclude from one person that sort of the the the implication there are you have an adapted to the cot you must it build that outer yet right in addition to looking at regulation of blood sugar round that metabolism and on were there any markers that you examined in the deliberate cold exposure group as compared to controls a that reveal to you that deliberate cold exposure could have additional benefits say for i a mean system function i or for any function for that matter yes for we looked at inflammation of course measure out the outcome of lot pressure and on but we also measured the lie six in the study just to see also and inflammatory and inflammatory marge i six went up ended also follows with the lie ten that is is also very known in the literature we measured that and i think it is very important to to think about the cold explosion the heat exposure as something that then lowers the inflammation in the body and would if we can do that we will have an open door for an a preventing lifestyle decease is in for an type diabetes but actually also for some men a deceases as well as known as depression and anxiety and also elsetime is decease we share all associated and in research also new a refer showing that a that inflammation increases the risk of representing set and and else imps in neological deceases we can decrease inflammation in the body we will decrease or modern lifestyle de ceases but also these increasing a e a mental deceases that we see in these modern lifestyle times an i think that it is i think its very interesting that we can o out in nature and we can use these natural stresses and t it i do not want to have it sound very romantic or anything it is just it is just exposure to temperature actually just a cold or to heat that its on end t work our body into an natural state again and and re said it were the the homeostases the balance has is lost a bit the body is gone to repair itself in that way and nothing is beautiful that we can do that just by changing the temperature of our body and although people are very scared of doing this because in our times we have been a way from cod away from heat temperature if for some for decades now am since we isolated our houses better and there we are more sedentary we always sit more indoor we do not move as much is very i modern sedentary live style has made us more temperature comfortable just neutral no no wonder i mean that ability is increasing we do not exposed ourself to the naturalstesses that we did earlier on am in in our embodiment but us ooponte may be the seventies the sixties where we started having more a comfortable live styles right and ability increases in the in the eighties we can see that from statistic i think that if we can taken cold and heat and you mentioned other things also beforbut of course exercises very important here and also a bit of fasting actually because it all increases the domestic stress in the body it is does not have to be other than natural stresses to the body which than could keep us in that natural balance again could we talk about what i referred to as the sobered principle which is the end on cold and the reason i call it the sober principles because an in reviewing o by the wee was not a official reviewer of your paper but i mean in reading and am reviewing your paper for it is after published contents i notice that you had people end on cold and this has been a long standing debate in the the deliberate cold exposure community should you warm up in it with a warm shower afterwards o get back in this honor what should you and on colder end on heat and the sober principle says end on cold as i understand it in order to force your body to heat itself back up and thereby increase metabolism further still is that right yes when you when you end on the cold you you force your body to heat up by itself and that will require that you celibate you keep your brown fit exhibited and also your muscles which is a good thing it is a good collaboration to keep your themagenestiself and that is and and exercise even when you go home in that way you do not have to think about your cold exposure dipping in in your lunch a wail can see yo what it is as just a and exercise that you do for one to two minutes and than is over if you i end on the cold you have not exercise for your body going on for hours afterwards and that is not only on your metabolism but is also going to keep your new transmitters i exhibited as well and increase that because your body is still cold you need that i ex those netrancemitted to celibate the brown fates well that is going to make your brown gets as more efficient and also your muster sells more efficient increasing my conjure and selves which will then generate heat very fast if you have done this for few times may be three for five times and been new to this but have tried it a few times you wen notice as witch where you feel that you get easterly warmer and you can keep yourself warmer and that is also what we shown and in my study is that the the enter swimmers were physically a warmer on the skin compare to the control group that wend they are out of the cold when they are out of the cold just relax thing and we tested this an in on the days when they were sleeping in the lap we could see that they had and more accusation of the brown fat higher temperature probably becausethey all loose heat it they have high heap loss to the body a combat to the control group an because to have a more muscular a skin t because of the contrast of cold and heat they loose heat faster from the body during that day but is that a bast thing no probably not because that is gone to keep your brown fat and your moss as stupid activated we you would have to it it has to work to keep you warm and i would hypothesized that it also might lead to some of the subjectively reported improvements and sleep because in order to fall asleep you need your core body temperature to drop by about one to three degrees yes it is not just sufficient to be sleeping in a cold room and under the blanket you also need your body temperature to drop yes and what your a snuff understand correctly is that by forcing by ending on cold and forcing oneself to heat up naturally am that increases the brown fat stores which i her see as a come the oil in the candle of the furnace that is thermogenesis and that in turn leads to increased heat loss which people might think o i do not want lose heat from the body but yet there are not tome an want to lose and from the body busy it soundly what we want is to be a very efficient heating and cooling system yes that it is not about being cold or being hot it is really about keeping the system tuned well keeping the oil in the candle is brown fat am functioning yes whencould ask one question about fed or fasted is there any r rather are there any known benefits of doing deliberate cold exposure and organ a fasted versus am after a a meal say within the last hour something o that sort i do my deliberate cold exposure first thing in the morning in general and fasticause i do not even to bit later in the day a but what is known about that and was that looked at in your study i know you measured glucose but that was as a separate us i we at from the cold i way from the coda but i was contested bucks on the days on the cold we miss yip that as well an on the cooling days em specifically on fasting and fat i do not know i do not think that i have seen studies specifically on this more science needed a number of people ask about the use of deliberate cold exposure to off set some of the symptoms of various diseases now here we are not telling about curing disease were thing you offsetting symptoms one question have seen quite often is whether not people with rained indium this is a indium and my ha school girlfor had the indium and it'll never forget a we went er at a school dance together and this was when we first stared dating and a she had rain notes which a leads to very poor blood flowed to the the o the extremities and and she was very culver she left to go to the bathroom and warm up her hands in the warm water and i was left standing there at the dance and people came up to me and asked why i was there and who i was there with and i kept telling them who i was with and they did not believe me they couldn't believe that she would be remade total sense if i knew me at the time u i was i i was way out of my league with her u at the time i to think of eventually i caught up but in any case a she was in the bathroom for about an hour saw at one point i did consider the possibility that she had just left but indeed she hadn't she warmed her hands back up but people with rainbow sufferer from this from this thing a very very cold extremities be their finger tips will even turn blue as if they were starting to get frostbitten it is quite dramatic an that question gets asked whether others any use of cold to try and increase the om elasticity the plasticity of the of the a small cavalries an vessels by everything you have described am of until nowitsens that would be a logical thing to do om and in addition to that weather or not people with autumn conditions people with o any other types of conditions are known to benefit from deliberate cold exposure ism not aware of any studies but i get asked about this a lot and they were a lot of questions about this for you in in the titter sweet thank you for those questions an i get them as well on social media and i have to say that i i have not seen any studies directed on this outcome and measuring donuts a centrum and i do know that it is it is it is not that ray i actually a problem and i know that many women a more men women than men e suffer from this and but logically it would help them if they expose their hands to cold and also heed to make the vest it more muscular but and i have hurt from people saying that it had help them but also hurt for some others saying it did not help them studies are needed on this specific tag i think i herd my hands when i go into the can i do not have this cram at own i but i keep my hands above the water you do ye oh i do that an often i take a little bit of a swim and then of course i have to have my hands in the water i but it helps me when i then get back to the ready an and then take my hands off because then i can stand there for a little bit and get mi one to two minutes exposure and then i can go of because then otherwise that would stop me from it being in the water enough time that i as long as i i would to people suffer from having this pain in the fingers and it that it can be better intense just take the hands of a bit from the water and the and that is gong to help you also highs near pain boots is on o help on defeat some people have the e an feel the pain in the feet and in the ankles and that is gone to help them a soot of bit so there is no problem with keeping hands out or feet inn near prim booties it if people feel the need to do that if that is the what the if in a pain of the hands or feet is a brier for people doing a deliberate cold exposure than it seems it would be of to do at to keep hands out or to keep your feet yes because then you you do get the exposure i thought of course hands and feet are very potent a places in your body to get a fast expiration e off your nervous system of course but if you can just you can also just dip them and and take them up it is nonstick on a private that but you have your full body is covered in in a cope receptors you will have a full expiration anyways you've you maybe providing very reassuring information to people cause i know a number of people that do not to put their hands and i find that the more of my body i get in the more comfortable i am psyche i soft know what psychologically and or physiologically i find that if where there is an interface between the water and the cold it is most uncomfortable i proverb just get everything under i keep my head out although i these days have been dunking all the way in and then coming out and the dunking once more with my head under before i get out after the the plunge a that raise a different question now we regretting into cent of the practicalities of deliberate cold exposure which i think are are important sometimes it'll experience and i her from a lot of people that they will get a kind of back of the head headache at the interface of the of the water i when they are in doing cold immersion to the neck a no i bassoon this has to do with blood flow that there is vas of constriction right up until the back and in the region surrounding it but that may be there still blood flow to the head but do we know what the origin of these headaches is and again this does not happen for everybody but some people do experience o ye i have not really heard about that one specifically an but i would say that there are different reasons for may be keeping your head out of the water an but it seems i may be for some that could be a reason for just getting a dickhead dunk going all thewy and yes yes what have started doing gan eliminate it was not getting headaches but i did i notice that interface o c and i was not in the rest of the experience it much experience of it much i hurried dunking all the way and i noticed in some of the photos that you have put out amend in your book that you will sometimes we a cap yet while you go in ye coquette and well it comes from different reasons a let us talk about some of the physiological reason when you submerge in cold water up to the neck and study have shown and this is from denmark studies from a besefipya hospital an that is a when you submerge into cold water up to the neck at cero degrees as her degree celsieas very cold and you have a decrease blood flow to the brain by around thirty to forty per cent and make sense because you activate the sympathetic never system and and therefore you'll have a less blot flow to the brain makes you maybe a limit this e year and proof again that ye you need a heart more than a brain becausewhen the symathiic nervous system gets activated a blood flow is maintained to the heart to keep you alive but obviously taken away from the brain to keep you from thinking that is wit is hard to think when your trust you at the muscles and then then your vital organs need to you have to be able to run away from that tiger i like the ratio now as total fancy who am i to disagree with mother nature well but yes one of the reasons being that you should keep your head out of the water is that you could increase that blow decrease in blood float to the brain further if you don't the heat there's is a very nice paper from an from a a such croup in canada where they have collectively looked at different papers where they a compared heat laws in a crew in the papers where they dunk thread and compared to heat laws a submerging up to the neck to see how much extra heat to we loose from our for when we don't the head e and no thing is very interesting that which you submerge up to the neck you have a he laws of eleven per cent from the body for and when you then a also dunk the head you would increase that heat lows rate by thirty six per cent that me ism not saying that ism not ism not here to say what is right and what is wrong i just think that people should know the information they can for himself evaluate what is best for them but if you increase your heat lot rate by thirty six per cent from your core thatsconne increase your after drop which we judge upon lobelia even further that meaning that you are closer to high pufthermia than you are if you just submerge up to the neck you should really think about whether this is something that you want to do or if it is just better for you not to get that cold in your core the beans is also because i have a litter a sensitive ears it meaning that if there is wind and because we mom in the open sea and denmark we have a lot of wind our win our conditions are just very rainy very windy and when the temperature is also freezing you could get this in what is that cod in very cold and light headed just from wind if you also submergchin to cold war on you then get up you you would get a brain phrase immediately it is enough to just go up to the neck werabinneac show just not get this also because the the i the heat lows is increased of course but it also the blufffloat to the brain has decreased the benny would keep you a little bit warmer you can stay for one o two minute it is just a way of g thing around some of the conditions also people can choose that if they they feel tat bout it is quite quite noble its to do in inscandinavia were bin of it and for those of you afraid of doing two minute cold shower when a doctor silver just a described a let us a you see how she and others are capable of doing things far harder than that when in the way you describe it with the cold wind and scandinavia and a is is quite striking it along the lines of covering the head there is this seemingly paradoxical a thing of people going into hot sands and wearing wool caps if you go to cabana or you i go to sand and therefore people who are am well from eastern rope a typically a finland or am russia you crane or elsewhere what you will see is that many of them are wearing wool caps in the sand which many people think it is to make it hotter that is i shall not the case it actually insulates you from the heat environment the urge the sense of urgency to get out of the hot san is a brain driven mechanism and the reason that people wear wool hats in the sand is it actually lets you stay in the sand longer m because takes a lot of heat to the skin before you feel that you half quote half to get out whereas when you insulate the brain u you do not get that signal it is pretty interesting have tried this before just by putting a towel over my head in the sand and you can stay in there much more easily and for for much longer you as we talk about these different stimuli for a the hermetic response the adaptation distress it occurs to me that tithe big ones in our evolutionary history have been light right i mean you're thing out seasonal changes we know there especially as you go up to sordid countries there seasonal changes in the amount of light by time of year dramatic ones in fact a as ism less at theater of course u light temperature food movement and it is sort of interesting and and at the same time perhaps it should have been obvious to us that there are stimulate that our bodies have evolve to adapt to in very powerful ways and the idea that temperature heat and cold could evoke these tremendous physiological changes that are beneficial for us probably should not surprise not all i in main this is win mean that these are not gesso esoteric mechanisms they are actually that the foundational mechanisms by which are our body and bodies of other animals adapt i do have a question about the a different ways that people could approach deliberate cold exposure for instance children have been to boys where there kids know six or seven years old with their parents at the bosnia u and they are in hot son ism not suggesting people do this if they are if they are not adapted to it any dock your parents kids and taught your kids parents i touch your doctor but is remarkable i mean a children doing sand from a young age or deliberate cold exposure are there any date on this and is it safe assuming that you know obviously the they can swim in or they are doing this unit in a tub or shower u and then it'd also to ask you about are there any additional male female differences i know your study focusstimate am on men but other studies have focused on both and you of course are women and can attest to your own experience with this children men women differences there ism in terms of protocols is here anything that people should build into the structure of their deliberate cold exposure that is unique to that i yes o dis as an uncle exposure am ye i think that em shining with the the question about children u i think that is important to to think about a as children are smaller than at all we cannot really completely transfer all the information and the benefits and also protocol for how long and and and stop the two children we cannot do that because they are just smaller in mass and one study that actually in approve this is a study where they have a compared the heat lost a in children the boys who were twelve years old e compared to a adds in men and looked at h heat lost of the your temperature and exposed them to a a one or one or two minutes a cold expose to saw emotion up to the neck and what they saw was that the the the boys in this study could actually defend their court temperature in is same way as the ales could but they had to use their muscles way fast it means that they could not stay for as long ay and they used more energy to defend their court temperature compatually to the does but for one minute it seems that they could actually come but they would be colder when they then come out because they are smaller in the mass to their ratio right it means that if the surface is large on children and their mass and muscles being smaller to that rate it means that they can be in the water less time before they get high hypothermic just think about that they are just smaller they cannot defend their temperature for a very long time but in this study the sow that forum to i think it it was a minute or they can one milia god you mention i prefer and small bodied people children a is toque som on pacific ocean swims in the morning om without wat suits and i adapted to it pretty quickly and the fairly long swims hen we brought an excellent swimmer with us u that was in turning with me for a while he's sixteen years old at the time and very lean and he was not small for his age but he was smaller than us atingle the was all eyes on the swim that day ism sometimes women join us u and he got hypothermic u and he is excellent swimmer and he did not report feeling overly cold but fortunately we got him to shore and heated him up again he lived i do not think his mothers can ever let him go swimming with us an hes thriving in the world he is a universities to now and he recalls that swim i m this why you always want ocean swim with body with evil yet he he became hypothermic his teeth turned yellow he was got slurring is words he was not making san he know we got him on to shore and he was an jelling in a lie semi fora had was it u hype therme is no joke i think i y yes i i am really glad that this is coming up because the cold is a powerful stimulus and night and kids are at a and smaller bodied people are a greater risk of hypothermia a good reason to approach it with caution maybe there is our recall showers yet i then cold immersion an still water natural water and open bodies water of course are always going to be more dangerous for other reasons currents an thank that of foin ye important note there what about any additional male female differences or similarities that we should beware of and this comes up all the time on social media any time i post anything about a study it is what about women because oftentimes there are differences oh ye an an an the we we also just talked about the difference in in in in temperature in men and women it means that if we did we we replicated my study in women it could be that they would they have enough you can say cold exposure with just nine minutes per week it could be because they apparently a oust just colder and and they have increase mentabilismen the browned is just to have more brown fat it could be but this is just something that i i i i frankly do not know but women a do colt exposure winter swimming with the eleven minutes protocol i do it it myself and feel a good about it i would say that an women a also regarding exhibition of the brown get it should be the same an in theory but i do not know if women actually do need to have another protocol when it comes to this rapid cot exposure i think that it is another question if we are talking about ice swimming when it comes to how far can you be in the cold water without getting hypothermic then that will we difference as in mene and an female been but if you do this colt exposure for very brief amount of time which is what i try to to talk to b talk about it what we call of some microstressing the buy to to increased the domestic stress to healthy stress then this is such a short amount of an it is exposure that it it is fall the same i think i think women can look at this as a fall a good protocol for the for for them as well i always say that if you really dread the cold and am do not the cold than you are a perfect candidate for using deliberate cold exposure because the sympathetic a gay the stress response will be greater and thereby the adaptation to that shorter one or two minutes is a is going to be much greater rite for people that are perfectly comfortable in the cold it is harder to get at adaptation response the same way that if somebody is very strong and they can lift a very heavy weight that hat very heavy weight is unlikely to evoke the same kind of i seem degree of that of a adapt give responses if somebody is not quite as strong another reason to keep these exposures relatively short and more frequent than to do longer duration n exposures frequently however let us say somebody only had two days a week om to do deliberate cold exposure maybe they do not have access to ussona maybe they do would you suggest that they get in for one or two minutes then get out then get back in for another couple of minutes then get out and call that for e know four or five minutes om to try and get to that eleven minutes total per week om as a pussy getting in for a full five minutes i and then getting out and coming back a second time that week i know this is getting down into the weeds but these are the sorts of things that i think people really want to know because no a lot of people either do not live close to a body of water or do not have a cold plunge om that they can do this with although cold shower apparently works to almost people live close to a shower yes the definitely i think the the changes in temperature is what is strangetheing your you set m your cells in the body if you can do the short amount of a exposure and then get out and get back in that is goneyou can say i i strengthen yourselves because you are challenging them to to adapt to i changing temptemperatures during one session you can change this ride you can do it if you are able to go to cold water but also a son then you just do that automatically you will have a change in temperature but you could also do it what variation the temperature and your cold plunge if you have if you have a punchy if you have the open sea ye you have seasoning seasons even you have we have ten been mark we have four seasons and the temperature is gone to vary with that soul we have nature who can just change this false and we do not have to think about if you have a cold plunge well then i would say that changing the temperature is what is gone a create this domestic stress and also keep your sells on its to you can say because you are try the body will still be i stress to try to adapt to the new the m butter as they would seen us something equally toxic to the body rid is a small small piece of lucidity that you are exposing yourself to you do not have to swallow it but it is enough that you tuned it sexily a the great a great way to frame it am that brings me back to the idea circadian time y in your study you did not control fears the specific time of day and now ism realizing that may be a great asset to the whole thing we know for instance that our bodies go through pretty dramatic shifts in temperature from the time we wake up i my body starts heating up as we wake up and ism continues to heat until the afternoon and the sauce o drop in the later afternoon and then assuming all things are working correctly i that body temperature drops what we sleep i could imagine that doing deliberate cold exposure at different times i just by way of convenience or by way of intention could be very beneficial because my body temperature is going to be quite a bit warmer at one time of day verses another and in that way keeping the item tuned and that is really what i keep hearing coming through in as you explain these data and all these a beautiful studies yours and others is that it is not really about getting cold it is about going from warm to cold and from cold to warm it is not it and i love this idea because i pro said this a hundred times on my podcast in a million times in my life and it'll continue to which is that biology is not in event it is a process these these a meatball can therm o regulatory processes are indeed the turning of a knob it is of verb yet it is it as supposed to known and i and i i think if people can internalize that idea that they are going to a have a lot more flexibility a lot more fun an and get a lot more benefit as suppose to thinking o cay i need to get into ex degrees of water for ex amount of time on ex number of days yet in a verentii is way all the time on how much and how cold and and i mean it is not it is just well because e also do not have studies sowing exactly if you just keep five degrees in your water and you do that for month than what happens we maybe the future we will know much more about this and ism ism sure it is going to come and i really hope but i just think by logically changing that temperature up and down up and down and you also do that in your water it does not really is not that important what temperature you you'll have your water than than just keep changing it going up and down it you be all up to twelve degrees measures your gong to private your brunet anyways i mean twelve at nineteen degrees cold air is enough to activate your brought is maybe we do not have to go as cold as i think many people think and and putting ice even all the time you do not have to it is not i do not think it is necessary to to expose yourself to that cold it temperature all the time an but very o bit keep the system off balance and you all the mare give it tend ye you mention at i study that is more recent an on going that is not published er m if you are wiling ism could you share maybe some of the a data from that or findings from that study m with of course the the cue to everybody that these are not yet published data that the conclusions could change the date i could change for that matter yes we we have not analyzed all the debt yet and i i know from the study that we did publish that we we would need to look more at the that a i do not really have any results yet that i can share because we are still in very preliminary analysis of this have i would not know yet what to exactly say about it but what we look that was both men and women let them that is that is coming oh that fantastic at and that answers going to please a great e number people and an intrigue everybody well son i want you really thank you for coming here to day to talk about your work i an and the incredible direction that it points to because i think that am no one study is definitive but your study really again stands as a landmark in the a landscape of exploring deliberate cold exposure and heat how it can impact and potentially impact our health because frankly there just haven't been that many a high resolution detailed modern studies of this there have been studies of sauna there been some studies of cold there a lot of groups in physiology that work on a hypothermia and very cold exposure but am most of the temperatures used in those ladies just are not practical first all i just want to thank you for doing the work that you have done and for the work that you continue to do ism a a waiting with baited breath as they say to a a to hear the results of this a study that is on going on both men and women a all have to have you back to or us about that soon and i want a thank you for a the incredible public education efforts that you have been doing on social media am and in with respect to your book am and we of course we will put link all those things in the shownote captions people can learn from you and can continue to learn from you we we certainly need more scientists who are both experience with doing hard core research as it is called and who also do the practices i think tat wonderful additional asset you are not just behind a lap cote or bundled up in a in a down a in a down feather jacket as everyone else is getting into cold you do these things and that you are open and generous in the way that you share a knowledge which includes coming here to day to to share knowledge with me and our audience a thank you ever much yo very welcome i am please to be and thank you som mi plain biding me and i call explain my study and i can share them of my insides for from doing that ism very grateful for being here delighted and we will have to have you back again thank you for joining m for to day's discussion all about deliberate cold and deliberate heat exposure science and protocols with doctor hosanna sober if you to learn more about doctor sobers research or you to learn about the

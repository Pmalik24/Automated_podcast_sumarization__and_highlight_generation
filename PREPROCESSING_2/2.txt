already folk big wind for a dona trump aft the supreme court to day the supreme court rules nine to nothing unanimous court the you cant jest tossed oral trump off a ballot for the presidency of the united states in a state colorado you will recall that just a couple of months ago these supreme court in colorado decided that t was perfectly acceptable to invalidate donate trump on the ballot in colorado in the primary and the general because he was cotnquot an insurrectionist the basic premise of their argument was really stupid it was that because the constitution of the united states bars from office insurrectionists this means that the state government of colorado can simply to the clear trump in insurrectionist and then toss him off the ballot that had a bunch of legal probes of it probnumber one how do defined insurrectionist promnumber two even if you were going to defend insurrectionist that would theoretically have to be done at the federal level not the state level because state federal piece of legislation promnumber three how do even find it in terms of which party defines it in the federal government is that done bosoms or of elections wars done by the legislature how does it distinguish itself the insurrectionist class from say issues with age because a state could theoretically throw some one off the ballot if they were not say thirty five years old and running for president the coulsay this person is not eligible that do not get listed on the ballot that would be pretty obvious from the federal language that persons not allowed insurrectionist is a vague turbary boom line is the court rules nine nothing in favor of donate trump he has to be put back on the ballot in colorado there is some minor controversy between the justices over exactly how in the future these sorts of issues are going to be adjudicated but again the big rockaway is that nine nothing including all the democratic appointed justices they say the colorado state supreme court can not simply declare that dona trump is an insurrectionist and therefore he cannot be on the ballot according to the court proposed by congress in eighteen sixty six and ratified by the start and eighteen sixty eight the fourteenth amendment which is the the section of the constitution that has the insurrectionist class expanded federal power at the expense of state autonomy and thus fundamentally altered the balance of state and federal power struck by the constitution section three of the amendment restricts state autonomy but through a different means it was designed to help insure and injuring union by preventing former confederates from returning to power in the aftermath of the civil war section three works by imposing on certain individuals i preventive and severe penalty is qualification from holding a wide array of offices rather than by granting rights to all its therefore necessary as chief just is chaste concluded and the colorado itself supreme courtitzelf recognized to ascertain what particular individuals a re embraced by the provision the constitution powers congress to prescribe how those determinationsshould be made they say that under section five of the fourteenth amendment to the constitution it should be congress finding who is an insurrectionist and who is not is a congress is section five power is critical when it comes to section three the case raises the question of weather states indiction congress can also in force section three we conclude states made is qualify persons holding or attempting to hold state office but states have no power under the constitution to enforce section three with respect to federal officials he specially the presidency the cutters making two separate arguments argument umber one is that only congress to define the word insurrectionist for purposes a who gets on the ballot and who does not argument number too is that even if that are not the case the states do not have the ability to do that theoretically could have a different part of the federal government that actually created an enforcement mechanism that was not the legislature but states do not have any power to en force section three with regard to federal offices especially the presidency according to the court power over governments is not eaten to federal office holders in candidates because federal officers owe their entire existence an functions the united vows of the whole mot a portion of the people power over their election and qualifications must be specially delegated to rather than reserved by the states again pretty easy obvious opinion now does not mean there is not any controversy with regard to the opinion basely again there are two arguments that were made the argument that is made about that it can only be congress that determines whose an insurrectionist in who is not that argument was not amino the second argument that was made which is that states cannot simply toss people out for federal office because that is the federal government's job that particular argument they agreed with as the court says all mine members of the hurt agree with the result our colleagues wetting separately further are with many of the reasons this opinion provides for reaching it far as we can tell they object only to or taking into account the distinctive way section three works and the fact the section five less in congress the power to enforce it hay this leads to a concurrence with with the slight descend o on sort o the ration out from the liberal justices to mayor pagan and jacks and this entire opinion is written specifically to creates or f a side show off controversy because agates amino meaning there really is no controversy even agrees color catch as toss trump off the ballot and lines catch o cross toss trump off the ballot michigan the same the minority opinion here concurring in judgement tries to fine a point of differentiation from the majority opinion specifically they can say that the majority opinion is over reaching in favor of trump and that is actually what they say r the actually try to go out of their way to say this the decanters to mayor taken in just action and they concur but their dissenting on s one part of the opinion they say that allowing colorado to simply declare who can in cannot be on ballot would violate the constitution of the united states but they say quote the majority goes further even though all nine members of the court agree the independent and sufficient section all resolves the case five justices go on they decide novel constitutional questions to insulate this court and petitioner from future controversy although only an individual state action is at issue here the majority pins on which federal actress can enforce section three and how they must do the majority announce is that it dis qualification for insurrection can only occur when congress and acts of particular kind of legislation person a section five of the forcing themendment and here is the depart they say duo in doing the majority shuts the door on other potential means of federal enforcement we cannot join an opinion that decides momentous and difficult issues unnecessarily and we therefore concur only in the judgment what fireman understand that alternative theory of who exactly would decided they say the mortal pines on how federal in forcemeat of section three must proceed congress the majority says must enact legislation intersection five prescribing procedures to ascertain what particular individuals should be disqualified these musings are inadequately supported as they are gratuitous again they there's actually offer and alternative theory as to exactly how somebody would be disqualified but the bottom line is that they say that there going out of their way to basically ripped the majority on the court eventing the agree with the majority on the court they say quote section three serves an important the rarely needed roll in our democracy the america people have the power to vote for an elect candidates for national office that is great and glorious thing the men who drafted ratify the fourteenth amendment had witnessed an insurrection an rebellion to defend slavery they wanted to measure that those who'd participated in that insurrection and in possible future insurrections could not return to prominent roles to day the majority goes beyond the necessities of this case to limit house section three can barn oath breaking insurrection as from becoming president although we agree that coverage cannot in for section three we protest the majority efforts use this case to find the limits a federal enforcement of that provision we concur only in the judgment they say the quart quit reaches out to decide section three questions not before us and to fort close future efforts todsqualify a presenentual candidate under that provision and basically what they are sings they did this for trump now what is weird is that the their claiming that the supreme court majority went beyond its remit in order to help trump presumably because they think that if say congress were run by democrats a simple piece of legislation not defining insurrection but just saying donate trump cannot run because he is not insurrectionists might be sufficient which again very very doubtful the that is the case bottom line tho in the end is what alimony bearitsays she says this nine zero we are done here big win for tonal trump again the attempt to bar trump from the ballet failing only helps trump and again that is not the only factor trump has going form the polling day to they came out over the course the last the days is devastating for jobiton's campaign jobidon is in serious serious trouble we say this often but the reality is the jobiton has not led in the poles against dona trump for one third of a year hay the fact is the donate trump is the leader in the club house right now if the election were held today he would not just win he would win by a fairly large let total margin he would win about two hundred and ninety three electoral votes if the election were held today and may be more given the trend lines in this particular election the latest evidence comes courtesy of a terrific pole for jobidon from the we york time sienna it came out over the weaken and it is just awful for jobidon this pole show that dona trump is beating jobidon forty eight to forty three but it is not really just the result of the pole the top line result of pole that a problem for jobiton is all the cross tabs the cross tabs are a disaster for jobidon crossbars our the demographic break downs by group for the candidates under this rubric the near time sanapole rubric by race donate trump in this pole wins his panics outright forty six to forty what is just be clear about this dona trump the guy who once treated out that he loves pelicans because tools is beating jobidon fort i the forty in this pole the guy who the entire media suggested would never be present him because he said that medical tapas for crasis backed is winning his bandits forty six to forty which again demonstrates his panic not a great catchall category not a great catchall turfman actually encompass a wide variety of people from a wive variety of backgrounds and countries he is winning them outright forty six to forty but the is not the only shocking crossbar in this pole among black voters hoiden is wining just sixty six per cent verse is twenty three per cent for donate trump sixty six per cent is the numbered note there twenty three per center it if any republican with twenty three per cent of the black vote in a presidential race the republican will be president of the united states but sixty six percent for jobidon is a full sealed disaster area you win two thirds of the black vote and your a democrat you are toast in a presidential race now again these crossbars yet to take them with a certain grain of salt they've huge margins of error up to ten points margins her for some of these crossbars because can we you a pole the accuracy of the pole depends on the number of people that you pole the larger generally the pole sample size he more accurate the pole when eagre looking at a pole this somewhere he might have ninety people who are hispanic responding there is a lot of margin for air however if this pole is in remotely clos jobidon is basically those at this point dona trump is winning white voters outright fifty three to forty interns of age demographic this kind of a shocking one jobidon is winning people sixty five and over but his gone o surprising because very often the older votes tent she republican but in this particular pol and i the selection cycle voters aged thirty to sixty four badly favor dona trump over join in the selection particularly people age forty five to sixty pole in other words the people hard just above the materials the her men ex people those people are voting fifty four to thirty six for donate trump according to this pole women are split evenly between bison and trump there is not one good piece of data for jobidon in this pole and the most important thing about this pole is that what it does not show is that jobidon is wildly in popular among democrats for example he shows there is it shows there is a lackmenthusiasm for jobidon mong democratic basevoters there not quite as enthuse to vote as republican basevoters would be the real problem for jobidon is not with his bates is what i been saying the real problem for jobidon is not with the comossnics in newborn michigan the real problem for jobidon is not with radical been let types inside the democratic party the problem for jobidon is the he governed as a radical burning sanders type he got into office and he decide who can govern far to the left instead of entering with the coalition that brought him and then dancing with them he decided to jettison the entire center of the political spectrum and dona trump is gradually taking over the center of the political spectrum as we discussed last week on the show you cannot name a position in modern america politics where jobidon now occupies the center and dona trump occupies the periphery it is virtually always the other way round including main stream democratic is abortion it is jobidon who is saying things a portion up until birth and it is dona trump who is not saying we banabortion all the way from inception in conception he says we should banabortion federally maybe at sixteen weeks which is a pretty broad concentric position in the america popular jobidon has abandoned the moderates jobidon has lost the moderates how do you win those people back seriously how do you do it i thing is too late for him this a disasteraria for name silver points this out name silver excellent polanalist who again has fallen out of grace with a munch left wingers because he suggested killer canton was likeably to win in the twenty sixteen election and then she did not another they got mad at the messenger then then because inmate silver tried to explain why that it happen the i very angrier him to name silver has a great piece over at his website natesilver don't in which he breaks down the problem in these poles for jobidon he says s democrats usually assume the win elections through turn out rather than persuasion is not a crazy proportion by any means but it looks a loosing approach for twenty twenty four for most of recent history more america i identified is democrats than republicans that obviously did not translating to democratic victories one hundred per cents of the time until relatively recently democrats did better among non college voters than one college graduates many democrats are also rich mi minorities who face steeper barriers to voting et camera's our but he says that typically speaking this has been the democratic strategy particularly since twenty twelve have pointed tissue before democrat's fell in love in twenty twelve with the barakobmama theory we do not need to lefter the median voter the median voter can be safely abandon all we need is our coalition of the oppressed and some college to get a white liberal ladies that is all we need not silver points that out it is ad it round in the twenty tell election actually one independent voters but because democrats had a bigger base with thirty eight percent of voters in the national exit identifying his democrats compared to thirty to per see republicans barakabama one comfortably but as ante silver points out broke mama's coalition cannot be up dated for jobidon barokobama was a charismatic figure bragobamo is the first black president jobidon is an old white man who cannot speak english any more and what is actually happening with jobidon is that he barokobama in twenty twelve has given away the moderates he is given them away as ante silver points out when it comes to independent voters is a great it is a great thing to think about if you are not independent voter and you switch your vote atsavote bison in twenty twenty a inure voting for trump what you just did is actually worth twice what a base voter showing up did a bates voter showing ut means that the bates vitality their national voter did not not in twenty twenty did voting twenty twenty four let say the you have twenty people who are voting and then a marginalized voters shows up in votes for us to now you an eleven to ten it here is what happens if an independent voter who voted in twenty twenty twitches let us say that it was split ten to ten that voter takes a vote away from one side and gives it to the other creating a two vote martian instead of now being eleven attend it shut to eleven nine an independent voter is actually worth more in terms a margin of victory then just any person who is going to vote for that the the democratic sideband did not show up in twenty twenty ray says the underlying arithmetic of how votes are tally means that flipping o voters worth twice as much as turning a non voter out plus the composition of the electric has changed democrats have lost their edge on party idea in a lot of pols this what happened by the way in the state of florist which is now turn bright red that is because republicans did the on the group work of going in registering republican voters which means the democrats do not have a bates turn out advantage in the state of flora plus in dependents ten devote republican in the state of florist which lifted am purple state to a very red state as natesilver points out in gallop pulling throughout twenty twenty three the same per centare for magicians identify now as democratic and republican forty three per cent now it ideas independent which means independent voters ho be more in portal to join but that is who he is forgotten about sos one thing to say to appeal to the bate when thirty eight per cent voters say their democrats and thirty two per cents say the republicans is a whole mother thing when twenty seven per cent of people say they are republicans and twenty seven per cent people say the re democrats and forty three per cent say neither which means the hate both candidates whosegona winthose people now as name silver points out the reality is that donate trump is winning those people going away the pole from the wartime sienna asked voters who they voted for in twenty twenty and then ask them who they plan t vote for in twenty twenty fore bizarre the pole showed that the recalled vote in o people who said they voted in twenty twenty what they said was that they voted by bison by it twelve point margin now again that demonstrates this is this setula democrat heavy pole because the reality is that hoiden ten not win by twelve pants job one by four point five per cent thane point but they say that they voted in twenty twenty this voting base fifty three forty one for jobidon now all those sane voters asked region vote for in twenty twenty for said trump forty eight to forty three which means bid and lost ten points off of the twenty twenty vote among these voters and dona trump gain seven points which make cents right not everybody who shifted from began loves dona trump but most of them are willing to vote for tonal trump at he says is that in the pole only eighty three per cents o voters who say they chose widen an twenty twenty plan vote from this year ninety seven per cents of those who voted for trump plans vote for trump again those are swing voters people who are willing to move from one party to the other and there are many of them and the pointhenate silver makes is that for every ten voters where voting to donate trump fewer than one are switching over to jobidon from the trump camp in other words donate trump is winning independence right now and that means that he is likely to win the election this told data by the wight is supported by further pulling over the week en from both wallstree journal and we be news according to a brand new s be news pole when asked how they would rate the presidencies of donate trump and jobidon when the say donate trump looking back was it excellent are good or fair or poor forty six per cent say excellent or good fifty three per cents a far or poor about dona trump jobidon far only thirty three per cents ay excellent or good sixty seven per cent save fair or poor when they look back on the economy sixty five per cent of people told in the we be pole which by the way shows trump up fifty two forty eight over jobidon sixty five per cent say that donaldtrumps economy wasgood compared to twenty eight per cent who say the it was bad n the we is pole hoiden thirty eight per cent say the economy is good as post to fifty nine per cent who say that the economy is bad and again a huge per centare of this is about in elation fifty five per cents registered voters say the jobidon's policies make the prices go up as poset to thirty four per cent who say that donate trumps policies created in elation because obviously they did not now again these are disaster numbers for jobidon and issue by issue it is almost impossible to see how jobidon wins the selection under the circumstances most democrats are dis hardened about what is happening in the selection cycle by the way are most republicans it turns out that most people generally are not superhappy about the candidates they have but they are way unhappier with jobidon why because their their hopes were disappointed jobidon actually have pointed the count many times when jobidon came into office his approval rating was the mid fifties lost to sixty per cent he is now down in the forties when donate trump entered office his approval rating was a forty eight per cent and when he left office his approval rating was forty three per cent in other words people did not have high hopes for trump and then those hopes might ben mildly disappoint hat am not talk about republicans sometime out the general voting base jobidon came into office on the wings of eagles and then he proceeded to drive the playing directly into the ground for himself according the this we be newspole most of bison's voters field the election is mostly about stopping trump most of trumps voters say that they are voting trump because they him not because they hate jobidon democrats don love with jobidon many switching over trump disaster area for jobidon again whilst journalpole same same data to day trump up forty seven forty give voters are slightly more up eat on the economy but they do not credited to jobidon there saying that this happening in spite of jobidon an underlying all of this of course is the simple fact that jobidon is just too old that every pole shows a huge majority of people including huge m majority of democrats think jobidon is no longer with us because he is not and here is the thing that isn't con reverse itself jobidon could reverse himself positionally he could theoretically start to embrace moderation on the border he could theoretically start to embrace moderation on spending he could theoretically law for example is told to defeat compass and stand up against comosnext in his own party he could do all of those things and that might marginally change the trajectory of the race but in the end people ten to boat basted on who they see in front of them and what they see is a corpse what they see in hoiden is an actual dead person and i turns out than america in tween twenty they were promise he stayed sober ad ministration the adults back in charge and if the gid was slightly see nil of and it turns out he just a crazy old man who ran at the moon and walks into walls well gruel falls out of his mouth and that is not a great look because now there being ask to choose between crazy on one hand which is how america perceived dona trump and crazy and see nice in jobidon because again jobidon move you fire the left it was one thing to say ism a house plant right this was his claim he is a house plant hiding the democratic party radical waterscape it's what news therefore big waterscape right down on the carpet take president house plant put him on the water stay all your probes are solved and then it turns out that the houseplant is leaky hand's making waterstans significantly bigger and most america particularly swing voters do not this at all and all of that just reinforce his feelings about his ahead he are not getting younger that is the one thing he cannot reverse do not care how much crap you shooting to that guy that dud is dead and he i mean physically he is no longer with us and it is omit it is the more you see of him the worse it gets and ire's a big problem for jobidoen the more of donate trump you see the hormonal trump you see have said this since twenty fifteen twenty sixteen donate trump is a mud monster the more mud you throw at him the more he just becomes full of mud jobidon every time he goes out he hurts himself every time he is on camera he and and everything he is not on camera he hurts himself because we know that he is hiding you can play a basement stratify whenyou are not the president of the united states and i fact that is what donate trumpet should do in this campaign hoiden cannot play the basement strategy he is the current president of the united states and is the guns are starting to open up even from the left on jobidoen see gan see it is every day every single day the bit administration has to trot out people who are not jobidin to convince everybody that burn is alive that the corpse is actually alive and it is not working because first rule of politics if you have to explain that you are not the thing you are definitely the thing s when you send out alehondra marks to talk about how bright and with it you are behind closed doors but then you walk out and you basically are stumbling around bumbling around well it makes your people look both liars and and also political hawser's alehondro medical being both i i tan ti this art tat the the ties they try to make a point that there is that the than the i there's a reason that the tit a hall thing about jobidon that yo what to have that a i statement about it about what you witness a they should dam spend a bit of time with job bison i have done a let ley share something with you bi prepare a lot for meetings with him and engagements with him because he is remarkably detail oriented pro being and operationally focus a that was on sundae cape the prior night sarnaght live did not entire opening skite about members of the bi administration saying the stuff and then they went on confirmed sundae by doing it here on sauna live is manat live performing the rare feet of actually attacking a democrat by pointing out that all of his administration officials all his allies our out their claiming that he is totally with it when he told he is not don today president job bison on the michican primary but in new york timespull today hasn't down five points and many voters still have concerns about his age here with me is governor of californium and bit an advocate gather new them grab to be with you down o i understand people care about the president's age but what they should care about as his record look i what jo widen has done for america he is created more jobs than he president i history in elation is down the shamrock shake his back and be i say has gone country thank you job we are now going line by secretary of homeland security a hunt orcas they for haven me down i man i am exhausted i was with jo bison for the cows we get an yo he wipe me out i i thing you feel he is up to the top then i was just with him and behind close tors he is a dine am this we can we both went down of the border town of brows fill texts and job went into be shot he said we got tighten this border look always i can prosit then he pour for of to the top i up drop lit into the real bran and came back up with a fiction his out when sonnet it is going aft for democrats you now that democratic in serious trouble pillar also going after job because bill will say truth about mobile which that he is no longer with us the late lamented presidents of the united states instead of trying to refute old the too old to be president slams job must embrace them stop with the i sharper than ever nobody's buying that don try to deny the age thing lean in to it lean in leaning your eating soup an just an mini say yes ism bad with names and i walk a toggle with a full diner i we en on i i i because job's problem is not a new one for democrats not the age thing specifically but the idea of letting the opposition an intimidate you into being defensive about who you really are yes that we have seen before john carry pretending to be a duck hunter killer carrying hot saucier purse america hate that we yourself and job yourself is old o say the problem with that is that no one wants so stop tounerock and airplane am men air's living him the best advice which is you cannot avoided just embrace it but the promise no one wants that and does not just old job is not with it he stumbles out he go and then a fire breaks out i the implies he stumbles but ad soddenly there is a riot somewhere and nobody wants that no one left is are now in the middle of seething and coping the now they they are now performing the calling kenned strategy it we call the calling kennedystress o calling kenned is the had of the last film the vision over it isn't she is been in charge of the star wars franchise for the past debate or and she as taken the most prize to ice and the history of a medical see mi and driven it directly into the ground because she is terrible at her job calling kenned and the people it into have come up with a strategy it is a strategy that is now being imitated all over hollywood and thestrategy is this make a moving no one likes and then yell at the audience about how intolerant they are when the move fails you make a move the last teddy andyou make an absolutely interminably awful character rods and then when the audience doesn't the move you say well it is because you just do not avian people in star wars that obviously has been a giant fail for hollywood because it turns out that ripping the audience is a terrible way to get people to comes to your movies and actually it does not it does not when your friends does not when you an and does not make in movies better and it also blinds you to the reality which i that you need to course correct when it comes to your on movies because you end up just doubling down on stupid if you keep blaming the audience over and over and over then you are just gin to keep making the same crappy move eighty seven times into and every time it fails you instates not me it is the audience they well jo bison is doing that right now and his entire team is doing that right now democrats have decided that it is not jo it is you this is a strategy for failure and to the media was replete over the week end with members of left suggesting that the real problem is voting america the real problem is the insane insipidity foolishness of the normal voting america the normal voting medical just does not get it their racist their sexist their terrible their threats democracy for example amassed b c which is the repository of this entire strategy hat on a university of meriland political science professor n am tomb smaller who promptly explained the white rule voters are it are a threat democracy now what a normal political party would do is say why don't winning white rural voters what are they concerns perhaps we should listen to those and make be give some crop maybe we do not maybe there a agenda does not cross over with ours at all which is can afore go their gods that's what a normal political party would do this democratic party has decided if white rule voters we will not vote for jobidon which by the way is the reason you is nominate it is because the idea was who is going a cut into donate trumps white rural voting base and by the way he did if you look statistically speaking dona from actually under performed and rule areas and over performed in urbanaryas in twenty twenty sun call work for jobidon then he promptly abandoned those people and now they are relegated to saying that all those people are races nachos not see out mistakes why are white roll voters attract o democracy that is fight he would think as we pointed out the looking at to bid's back crowd and dottle trunks that that the opposite went pictrou i ma we lay out the fourfold interconnected that that white work voters post country first of all and we show thirty poles and national studies t demonstrate this we provide the receipts in chapter they are the most resist xenophobic anti emigrant anti a geodemographic group in the country second they are the most conspiracy croup cut anon support and subscribers election denials cove denials s scientisscepticism obomaberters third anti democratic sentiments they do not believe in an independent press free speech they're most likely stay the present should be of that latterly without any checks from congress or the courts or the democracy they are also the most strongly white nationalists and white christian nationalists and forth they are most likely to diseuse or justified violence as an acceptable alternative to peaceful public just they are all mazes o case of this again if you at were to look at the data on us what youwould see is that the data tend to suggest that a fairly small minority of people actually believe all the things that this person just set he says they are the most likely subgroup in the united states to believe this t doesn't mean the vast majority of white rule voters tomatoes but even if that were try the reality is the if you want to win an election presumably you are going to have to figure out some commonest have just yell at them you are can win their votes pretty obviously and again this is bazar because bill cantons inter pitch in nineteen ninety two and nineteen ninety six is that he was going to wind those voters that also happening the pitcher for example howardene in two thousand four and then it was the pitch once again of actually baron bomb in two thousand eight he went after a lot of those voters but democrats have decided that since twenty twelve there is gone abandon that voting base and then if they lose there just con a call every one that is tree with cozies which of course reinforces the entire reactionary swing the country is experiencing right now a yo under saran who is not a member of the right why and nova ye very nice person bay is also a good political analyst from the last and choose on boar and they are talking about this and she says the promemfor jordan is not that he is losing his base is what the stats show the problem is that working class voters do not him they feel he has abandoned them and when you just rip into voters ha turns out they do not you very much she defeats be worried about the hundred thousand uncommitted votes in the minivan primaries the red bat this will protest votes obey policy to e come in the election the to tea thoughts i think that the media really really wants t put this narrative out there that by in is gene lose michigan over gaze in the truth as he is going to lose michigan over six hundred thousand auto workers because his e v market was extremely punishing to auto workers and like sent earlier there is been this big realinemen where working class america are very very very much on the trump train people who used to be democrats and used to vote for democrats and rather than admit that this outrages that democrats lost the working class vote and try to figure out how we can appeal to them again a they are looking for excuses and other things to blame o this flowing good they will call them deplorable or they're called them racists because they do not want admit that trump has picked up a lot of the policies that used to be democratic policies in the nine these controlling the border for example the idea that an open border and mass me ration is extremely punishing to the working classic drives down their wages it is class warfare against the working class it is an upward transfer wealth from the working class went of competing with he to grants to the elude to and up implying them and now they can employed sheep emigrants instead of having to pay working class america living way she is totally right she is totally right and democrats used to own that crowd and now they have given up that crowd again what the poles are showing is that hoiden the entire medal of the country what we are watching what what the selection could be we not guaranteed still very early you could be watching a political refinement in real time and democrats thought that they were going to be able to unify in entirely minority base with some white college educated ladies that was the twenty twelve basin they were just going to replicated over and over the dirty secret of twenty twenties that job n actually carved into some of the blue collar bays the donate trump owned in twenty sixteen in twenty twenty course can lose a those people not only can lose all those people it turns out that believe it or not demographics is not necessarily destiny it turns out that hispanic voters may in fact turn out in larger numbers then certainly usual for donate trump one thirty thirty five percent of that vote the last couple each intycles he could whin forty to forty five per cent in the selection cycle if you get twenty per cent of the black not that is double what any re publican has received for generations that could happen too you could be watching in actual real linemen not caused again by dona trump it real linemen cause by the failure of hoiden because he decided that he was going to be a historic precedent and his eagle overtook him his eagle made him think he was going to be l b j or it r but the dirty secret about l b j an aft r is thy had the white working class on their side who the democrats currently do not have because the have separated them off from the priorities of their party the white working class it is a real problem for them an it is not going to stop and everybody who is looking at the economy can see this happening for example fascinating article n you a daily mail to day guys tax pay er funded guaranteed income programs that hand struggling families sup to thirty six thousand dollars with no strings attach are being rolled out across the country according to the ucadaily man the schemes who is total value exceeds a hundred twenty fie million dollars have stored in popularity since the pandemic as progressive leaders em brace cash hand outs to support america below the poverty line but the radical projects have ben criticized had her emerge that one mother of three in washington dock spend more than half of the ten thousand eight hundred dollars lump some payment on a luxury holiday to madame along with the new wardrobe for a kids and a glow up for herself this sort of stuff is quite reminiscent of the sort of welfare queen rhetoric of the nineteen eighties you could be watching the remaking of the pagan coalition in real time because democrats are terrible at this meanwhile jobiton is racking up debt at such an exorbitant pace of this point that there is no way out but through the america government is going to have to do two thing simultaneously one cut spending and figure out the helped with entitlements and two grow the economy gangbusters nobody believes that your bison is going to do either of those things and what your looking at is the possibility of a fairly serious long term secular stagnation seculargius meeting across the entire economy not into any one industry a secular stagnation according to a carton professor named homes he says that thee thirty for trillion dollar debt burden of the united states could upset the world financial markets is early as next year especially if a presidentellect announces a raft of expensive policies hell that that is exactly what youbidan is going to do he keep saying it over and over that he wants more expensive policies which of course wand me it difficult for america to raise for debt meanwhile the by administration is pursuing the world's worst emigration policies won bout ye camera there about the fact that you are now having a democratic party that is importing cheap labor in order to help business allies that is one hundred per cent through that is obviously the case the democratic party has to prop up the inflationary economy with deflationary wages that is the only way you get to deflation the way you get that deflation is by lowering the wage burden democrats have real problem if they want in flacionary economy they need unions right is what the if you want if you if you want union power that inflates wages artificially another by administration works with the unions but a the same time you cannot let the unions dominate the labor base because if they do is going to inflate the currency what do you have to do you actually have to bring in a sub wage labor base you've to bring them in and have the murky legally the same time they are pushing the unions tower your political allies than make their money and then spend that money on you getting elected yet to bring in a labor base that had toxin a lower prices for the vast majority of america consumers which is what cheap labor does from me legal immigration the problem is that america can see what is happening in real time in they do not it by the way the is amazing the by administration is now starting to openly admit how many people they brought into the country according to axis more than eight million a asylum sewers and other migrantswill be living inside the united states in legal limbo by the end of september the is a one hundred and sixty seven per cent t in crease in five years alone that is insane they are only three million people where living inside the united states in legal limbo had not had to hearing or whatever as of twenty nineteen it is now up to eight million the backlog has absolutely exploded under jobidon and that is not just because we do not have an ago funding for the border courts it is because jobidon has opened the border wide and given everybody a date certain to come back by and no one shows up again and as the wallstry journal points out things is our long more on signal workers as labor shortages persist according to the pastry journal dependents on imported workers is approaching on healthy levels in some places stifling productivity growth helping business is the lay the search for more sustainable solutions to labor shortages again libido has made this entire probe and as you can tine e in ta talk about the fact that he never even took a call from his for chief for three years we gets that momentarily first one year ago heresy's announce that a man we be leading t their woman's day campaign we all roll our eyes we thought we would have to buy from yet another company the believes that men can be women well we her at the daily wire had a different idea in twenty four hours we lunch enemy's chocolate because you should be able by delicious chocolatefrom accompany the chairs or values now jerky's chocolate is turning one year old all our little baby is growing up to celebrate make sure that you get yourself some jerseys chocolate as you can see we have some he him with nuts and then we have she her without nuts because that is both the way the chocolate works an also human biology it also comes in micro aggression size get yours at cremes chocolate dot come to day well came meanwhile and the bide administration is trying to make the claim that they actually are not at fault for what is going on at the border but they have a rather large problem with that that of course is that they are clearly responsible for what is happening at the border former border patrol chief to or tees was on sixty minute this under jobidon h was the word patrol chief he says he never talked to jobidon yah this might be the fault of be administration in our interview or tease criticized governor abbot for not concert with a border patrol and claim politics or immigration but he also expressed frustration with president bison have never had one conversation with the president or the wise president for that matter and i was the chief of the sorbet i commanded twenty one thousand people that is a problem yes yes it is how much of a problem is this for the bi administration but the attack hats have not even started this on be a superbly election psycho every one is this ones conpartpicularly ugly especially because you cannot get anyway to your candidate people who love trump of trump everybody else mean people who love bison do not exist that means that this election is going to be about tearing down the opposition as he usually is and this a target rich environment for the trump campaign because jobidon there a certain certainly on emigration you can clearly identify victims of jobidon's emigration policy one of those victims is lake an rely we can rely of course was murdered just last week at university of georgia and tom the response of the local mayor was to c aim that this was the fault of dona true she was murdered on february twenty second twenty twenty four she was jogging and her body was found near a capable wooded area her self was caused by blunt force drama the person arrested was of course aneleglimegran elhondr metrics was asked directly about this look at the way that he deals with us this a disaster for he my administration a twenty two year old nursing student i know you have been following thus a lagan rely in the state of gorge was murdered a legally a by an undocumented veniswailand migrant the suspect had been detained by porter patrol upon crossing released with temporary permission to stay in the country he then went on a legislate to commit crimes a twice once in new york for driving a shooter without license and once in connection with a shop lifting case in georgia did those states and their law in foremen communicate to the federal government that this had happened should this man have been deported a a few thoughts first margarita first and foremost and absolute tragedy and our hearts break for and our prayers with the family number one number two and importantly as a prosecutor having prosecuted violent crime and other crimes for twelve years one individual is responsible for the murder and that is the murderer and we work very cleverly with state and local lawn horsemen to insure that individuals who posed u threat to public safety are indeed our highest priority for detention and remove o yet there is only one problem of that which of course it is not true true persengentemen in the country in the first place sanctuarosev policies all over the united states have allowed career criminals to stay in play this administration has been incredibly soft on crime and they got a real problem on their hands medical also suggested that executive orders don't going to solve anything which of course is not true because it is mobile's executive orders upon coming into office that opened up the border wide given that see an anis reporting last week that the administration it is considering executive action that would block migrant claiming asylum if they a legally cross into the united states can you tell us exactly what is on the table can we a consider options at all times that is the responsibility of good government but an administrative action is no substitute for an enduring solution when we take administrative actions as we have done a number of times we are challenged in court legislation is the enduring solution and by the way we can not through administrative action plus up the united states port o patrol customs in borrow protection by one thousand five hundred personnel the legislation proposes we cannot through administrative action ad for thousand three hundred asylum officers the we can work through the back log and turn the system into an efficient and well working one which it has not been for more than three decades well you to t you could do you could put back in place dona trumps remain a mexico policy in which everybody who applies for asylum has to not he entered into the united states and they remain in mexico to await their asylum determination which would stop he vast onslaught on the border and then you could also redefine the interpretation of asylum law such that you actually have to show that you deserve asylum to be let into the country not merely say things i fear to go back to my home country that is not enough and mean what be he democrats went go this they will not let go this again they have ben captured by the radical base and the the smart move here of course would be to moderate on the border and they will not do it to christmurphy while a member of the wild left connecticat senator who makes his appearance on the sundae shows pretty much every every week he says that we cannot change sanctuary city policies which of course is a lie of coursican change sanctuary city policies and of course you should turns out the people go to sanctuary cities to receive the benefits and magic of the sanctuary city his hat bell that is not a magnet of course it is if bi bought p beside him i do not out store ting free donuts for every one ism to be out do not ut pretdamned quickly here is christmurphy we saw w york mare dams are call for drastic changes to er cities sanctuary policies as as the whole sanctuary city woven taint go too far we see the roll back of that should there be a roll back of that well you'll we treat immigrants compassionallyn connecticate as well and these think that speaks to the best of this country ultimately the solution has to be on the border and in the countries the people are fleeing i do not think it is in the best interest of this country to push immigrants in to the shadows once they are here to me the focus has to be on the border the folks has to both but but the will not do anything at the border which is why total trump is winning the border issue by twenty to thirty points in the pulling data here is non a trump of the week and going after jobidon this message is going to tell it is going to continue to do body damage to the bin campaign every day jo bi is given akin comfort to the foreign enemies of the united sates he is actually giving ay and they do not respect us tasty more a country three years ago we were more respected than ever before and now they have no respect for us whatsoever an put yes that his talked about newcomer i d er that right newly he would not be talked about nuclear by way here he would not e by the wayward dirty little secret here is normal trumps outflanking chorion on the right with regard to penferputon the bottom line here is that join is in serious trouble and he keeps he is operating on a completely false theory here his theory it is belie by every piece of pole data is that the biggest problem he has is base turn out that is not correct i big is probe that he has that independence an moderates are abandoning m in droves yoorntic a look at ha we know this john fetterman for example is the senator in pennsylvania john fetterman's apbruvalrating is thirteen points above water he is a very popular senator from pennsylvania he as taken the most prove israel position of pretty much anybody in the united states senate hoiden is under water in pennsylvania he could easily lose the state he is running at best dead even with dona trump in the state of pennsylvania it turns out that america do not really it very much one say you appease terrace your baseman but it turns out that most america including in dependence do not nay is the began administration continues to send all the wrong signals in the least again in an attempt desperately to win dearborn michigan and it are not going to help they are not enough votes in dearborn michigan to make up for the fact that he is losing the white working class in states michingan it is we jobidon is in trouble but again the democrats ben totally captured by the editorial board of the her times theditoryaboard of the wartime's got capture by the woke interns and the mans are of captured the by demonstration who seems to believe that they just repeat canary sixth on on broader and louder volume the magically there can o win this election and they are just catering to the comasnacs in dearborn at michigan over the weak end for example comely arris vice president of the united states suggested they're needed to be an immediate sense fire and gossip now the white house immediately tried to walk this back alotlbet they try to say t what you means that compass should agrees with seas fire because i turns out awkwardly over the weak end israel agreed to many of the preconditions for a sense fire and comose turned it down the reason comas try downaseas fire is because they believe that the west is going to force israel to stop without come giving a hostages without comas going into exile with cams retaining control in the gossip strip but the possibility that casein gains control of less bank cams may not be wrong considering the pathetic leftism of our currant crop of western leadership but here is comely arris making a fool of herself in this issued just yesterday age the aster goatherd must band the never oke there's only one problem comas rejected that deal what is she actually saying the white house tried to say that what she was saying was comasneas to accept the seas firer but y can hear the crowd they do not think uts what omasa arris means and comas knows that the more this ad ministration dos p are for e seas firer the more it helps compass they know this crismurphy the dulled from connacticat he is doing the same thing there it was suggesting that bid has use all his levers shouldn't to along from was fire leverage on whom on whom i mean it it can be levers on compass because comas leverage dos an apply israel bombing them forward into the stone age and killing all the members and there still mot giving up power what ex aptly with the leverage be other than presumably some sort of carrot from the is rallies that leaves comas in power what exactly is he advocating here that the ma icon of idiotic diplomacy's that it lies in vagary that is the magic of identical give just say words sense fire the magically they manifest i carry power if you say the right spell sees third bedyro if you say that sort of stuff then magically peace breaks out it is nonsense here is cristmurphy making a fool of himself as for our usual arrangement can won turn to what we satin michican were over a hundred thousand democrats let to the poles invited non committed ah obviously a protest vote to the presidents handling of the situation in gas how concerns as a political matter i should should democrats be i do not think we should be concerned about this as a political matter because this is such a critical issue relative to america national security and the security of the mill least i would hope that the president does not make decisions about what to do in gas the mill least face upon how the votes lined up listen i think it is time for the presidencies all the levers that he has i to get a long term sense fire i think if that says far does not come it is in israel interest for them to possmilitary activity to solve the humanitarian crisis but to the extent the president is using additional leverage on israel he should do that for national security reasons not for political reasons these issues are too important to be dictated by the poles likes have that they are being dictated by the bolls and because again jo bison caved rhetoric analog of the stuff the democratic party then pushed way the left now he is following as he always does the center of the democratic party according to this branny whilstergornal pole sixteen per cent of republicans only say that israel has gone too far in responding to compass seventy per cent of democrats do seventy per cent forty per cent of democrats under the age of forties of the united states was doing too much to help israilies compared with thirty three per cent of democrats aged forty and older the same pole shows by the way that over all fifty seven per cent of the america people believe that the united states is giving about the right amount or too little supports to the israilies only thirty per cent think that too much support is being given to the israilies and that over all some forty three per cent of america believe that israel has either been about right or not gone far enough a plurality i should believe the opposite but democrats are on the long side of theamerican public on this and they are attempting to flip the america public on this even as comas exacerbates the problem comas is stealing aid that that they have the help the mediohomas because the median comas wore cannon glove in fact when it comes to the coverage o the gos'strip comas an the mediate one in the same many members of the senior comas fellow travelers working hand and glove with comas and ti we have hard this vast bevy of stories recently about human writes abuse is with regard to the the provision oft did in the bosses trip the big problem is there is no one to provide the aid in the goes try because compass will not surrender comes high jacking the aid the people are not getting the aid which means that israel has to hirer third party drivers were egypt and costar do those third party drivers are very often being high jacked harmed by members of the comas contingent as well s the gases population the israilies have hundreds of troops stacked up the border and there is no one to take them in there is no one who is willing to drive them in and distribute the aid because it a bleapsho her there cause moms will not srebyagain all the tend the minute thekamas surrenders is been pointed out by the spokes person for the idea alonlavy here he was it's for the specific question of humanitarian ad we wont the see as much humanitarian get into coset to the people who reedit well making show get mamas panel toilet thou that is why we have dung on the one hand exponent capacity at the israel crossings there is now molten double the access capacity at israel crossings to get for at ad away speak right now there are three hundred trots worth of humanitarian aid sitting on the gases side of the karamshalom crossing waiting for the hunt to pick it up and distributed the aid is getting in the problem is that the can is struggling to distribute that d at the paste that israel is facilitating its entry into gosh all of that is true but because there is nowntatu distribute the aid the bottoming is that the west the united states places teen ere in the arab world a working with the israel government to air drop aid into the middle that is not because the israel will not distribute the pigs because there is no one to distribute the aid because comas will not surrender and they are trying to kill people and hijack the aid meanwhile the hear blaming israel for all of that at the same exact time all this has happening the whether actually sank another ship is the first ship that the hoo the have successfully sunk at this point according to the washington post a cargoship sank in the red sea after an attack by hotly militant taking about twenty one thousand metric comes a fertilize or down with it posing i significant environmental rest to one o the world busiest waterways in the home of many quarterlies the rubymar was struck by an antibolistic missile fired by the hobbies on zebra eighteenth at sank early on sturdy after slowly taking on water since the attack it will cause an environmental disaster apparently the whole attack last month cause in eighteen mile oilskin and force the crew to abandon the ship again the west has as been unable to curb the washings out of a primitive terrorist group a terrain group that again the by administration the listed is a terra group early on in theiradministration meanwhile antisemitism all over the world continues to percolate the washington frebeakon reports that when is rally lawyer ran part yoshovat we speaking at university of californium barely his speech was cancel after violent protestors choked to female studentendy spit in another penny's face broke into the auditorium where baryoshovat waited on stage the administration had no apology to offer meanwhile over the course of t e last week there is a shooting of a jewfish doctor in sandbag by a muscle disgruntled expiation no motive has yet been offered in that particular shooting in orthodox jewfish man was stabbed in switzerland by somebody shout no the usual a shouting antis medic slogans this sort of stuff continues and yet the pressure on the democratic side is for them to cave to homes that conto make them more popular but the america people is came amebic people do not comassery much do they rally think that is can buy them at hunt of good will and votes to pressure is rail into in two stopping early and leaving compassion place democrats also of another force coming down the the railway tracts for them that is going to be very ugly and that force is the back each that is coming from these trump losses politician names and she is the person who is been going after donate trump in new york she literally came in off is pledging you get donate trump which is not exactly how law n foremen is supposed to work typical you identify the crime and then you prosecute criminal you do not identify the person and then seek to in cover the crime beliticia names did the latter and it turns out that most people i do not think are gone alike the fact that she went after donate trump on a bunch of civil charges their absolutely absurd as the waster journal editorial page points out because letitia names could not demonstrate the banks relied on trumps misrepresentation she rest her case on a sweeping state civil fraud law known as executive law section sixty three twelve that is that that statute substantially mirrors federal criminal from statutes but typically federal courts require proof of property lost or damage to prove fraud show prove neither judge grow in that particular case along with letitia names an now find him four hundred million dollars now names is tweeting out the trump who an additional hundred and fourteen down and dollars and interest on state every day that he does not cough up the money is that going to make trump less popular or more popular meanwhile fanny wills and her ridiculous case against donate trump in georgia this recon case that is a a legal joke a fanny wills it turns out again with stopping the gushy hire to be one of her cheep prosecutors and then moving money around and particularly corrupt ways is that case going to somehow redound against trump here for example is a lawyer for one of the other defending in fanny willies's prosecution on canary six going after fannywells in pointing out her corruption the general rue on conflicts of interests for lawyers is in run professional conduct one points and we all know it is all trunintousts that we cannot have a conflict of interests and if we do we have to withdraw or we will be disqualify the plastic idea is it a conflict of interest in payers the lawyers independent professional judgment that is the test of a conflict and whether it can be way and whether it is disqualify and the that conflict is not just financial it can be any conflict that impairs your independent professional tuck my and you see that i he lock when we pay there are six inflict actual conflicts of interest in this case any one of which wars qualification but collectively practically compel first the financial conflict that is already been cover second be perse ambition political ambition the third there is a of talk or polity castle of the see and concealment of the relation ship anthem money forth the speech of the church fifth the motion for protective order that the d a find an mister wanestabst case sixth the way the state has conducted the defies of this motion to disqualify especially the cure fanny wills if she is not is qualified s a matter because the case he is still not going to renown against donate trump the democrats and their attempt to get down trumpet throwing everything against the wall have made themselves look foolish it is not going to hurt dona trump in the end donate trump for his part he up he added his commentary on fannywillis and again this is funny he worked with funny even this spell fanny f a and i fanny how about that one how about that one with her lover within way her lover let us go get trump because if they go a the trump he they can pay him more money and then she can take beautiful trips on the sea beautiful trips to foreign island heard her lover the have such a good time the i got paid almost a million dollars and he never did it before but he did the other thing before that he did with funny he did plenty of that that is what he is good at i guess yet well if any wills case i do not think that is going to renown to democrat's benefit are not to coming up we will get into some cultural commentary a say smith who was once just a normal a dud has turned into a a public free show if your not a member became a member use coach of pure check out for to man's grand wile angel plans quick that lingo the description join us

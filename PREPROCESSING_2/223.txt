down town idly walking past this big huge recreation area called hurt park and boom there was the protesters how many of them worthy they three hundred that is what three hundred just a mass of t all men and the thing thy were pro testing was user here were user drivers on strike i said two thousand nineteen you might remember at there were lot of be strikes all over the world round this time user had been in kenya for about four years and these drivers had the same complaint that fall owed the company wherever its give user makes too much off the rides they make too little they want more of the pie and they were mad benjamin waited into the crowd of strikers with the microphone because thaws what he does he hoses of podcast her might have heard of called benjamin walkers theory of everything and this story was right up his alley he stop lots of stories about the gig economy and it is this contents this one driver hear said one thing that would get them more money his rules more rues e is just about regulations no one nova do regulations nowhere regulations we need regulations for the revival be got en y aregulatit you on not come of he make money what do you me yo stogie

wen de at it that was another driver there he solidarity means every one participating in the workstopige except from what benjamin saw that week there were plenty of other user drivers still out working in fact even as they were all standing there three hundred strong protesting against bur a a in at a a a see that is a her a there is a road that got through this part of the park and the some ki user driver the sides go through the protest through the crop test ye y and they know he the number driver homies the little user sin in his window it ye ye ye and the swarm is car ten they let the er o the tires that is the deli a at a at the do a that is awe do a us and what did the i do a you e seem pretty used a he can a at there shock for while and the stayed in his car he got out vbenshall even some of the protesters helped them one thou of the way wat no a i o aka a we do ma hes we to tat at we we we frighted i i we had i i i him ta yes this was one of two user drivers that tried to drive through the middle of the protest while benjamin was there and one of the protesters said o the reason there still driving is that with all of us on strike the surge pricing kickstand she once who see bat end make more money which is to say it is hard to beat user an this game house always win but then as they'll stood around discussing ti one of the drivers told benjamin about a kind of work around they had up their sleep a cheat coat si o question i a the last two days i took the users i told you en i ye ism heresy thursday ism not going to take another over how mi any get what do i do to find a face driver at the obeli is i re you even too carer rays day is the we ma quasi it teaaladwic can you do e get t i a i you look at the estimate you sweet of thus you go the the minute with yo mes e boo get we lot get the coming such as to be clear a main you request to ride and it automatically shows you how much it is on a cost and when the drivers shows a you say to them how but i hit cancel on the a and just t give you the estimate in cash cutting out the middle man that is what you gal a o i was to say you to a driver i wan a go care with at ta hi would the yes yes can you go a i de i they do a we want to what i can you goad you a a the to in yes in you homo my ay sir this ride i was married my ride is three hundred eighty i want to give you four hundred and we go carry i cans i for i can'seit yet how did it feel once you once you did that o rat on the one hand it salve all my promise for the rest of this trip but also i almost feel have got the answer to my question i wanted to know how you win and there is something about going court which is basically using the tools against the company is it is great and it subversive one of the protesters re feared to it as economic sabotage i e until we get more rules governing user we are in a breaks i asked tuber if i could talk to a company japan canna about going carry the spokes person for all of subsaherin africa rote back saying in carried repeat canceling by either a driver or rider could be flagged by our fraud technology which will then result in an investigation she also said it is not safe to go off a for the passengers or the drivers which for the record some of the drivers will tell you to that they do not to do i because having a record of the trip is safer for them course going under the radar this is not really anything that novel cab drivers in new york will sometimes say he howbuty turn off the meter an you pay me in ash but they do not have a name for it benjamin and i both wondered my carry it is the name of a foreskin my ruby carry forest but none of the drivers benjamin credit could early explain it beyond that a cant to a we ta mamma a ta an when i started calling around to drivers and a transport officials in my ruby this funny thing happen are ye that is e the cost all of them giggled when i said it like o that you want to know about that how do about that and one of the drivers said oh you can go court yes to y art i are the can one of them told me before user came to town those informal taxis that you haggle with a lot of them stationed themselves around court forest now i was a kind of catchall phrase for paying any sort of driver under the table that is the most rational explanation but there was this other explanation that came from a driver who ism calling roger care yes i think i a clue is thirty years old as one your old son been driving since user first came to canal he is also a graphic designer as a degree in business an i tea because wont in the hotel industry he is done a lot of thing caul the forest yon we see desanrus that we just got for the forest suits quit an pot hang genro in cost gangly you sang jungle law yes jengalo heists it is something not aloud and a gain something but inlay the constitution o tuba something not in the laws of user yes am genoa lo you for oses i say if user are the authorities then court is sort of skirting the authorities yes definitely are and how does that how does that feel when you are going a horses using the camp you see it is a i feeling let me see that because covin a betcha coin extra coin and i you just we la you a for it and you don an nobodies dish to get a chat of it i can see a stamped in tums e felt up an minded a date nut mother is not being de company antis a de classis wo you do yo to up an up your mind and a that to me that de decision to make a nextracoin probe yotolesint to the company an home intended right it is up to you at that point you have to make yes it is up to an independent decision yes but it is breaking a rule yes yes yes it is i mean i guess i wonder if that factors into the decision making of slikewell i know it is a rules should i break this rule i propose to follow rules and everything cost you see a then of the day bison get up an de say to o get to piss and then of the day get home with something you see you fun de say you points full rules most the days you going to get home intended and mostolaza i can for e famish you see yo wife yo gets does you fun de say that yo going to be strike day it to the latter that you going tofu o the believing me o famish me tosipai it is not just empowering to break the rules sometimes sometimes it is necessary to break the rules for anyway it feels it is and to day on our show we have stories of people defying regulations violating the social contract to make a point and in one case to strike out against the inequities of a six great class please stay with us tanoooback one time bandit there is a moment this were when i watch some one break the rules right in front of me the most dramatic way dramatic is the operative word because it was during a performance it was not just in front of me there were hundreds of people in the audience this was during an event that i go to every year if i can make at on new years day it is a ten hour long marathon of performance says i call it a marathon at the saint mark's poetry project in a two hundred year old church in lower manhattan imagine a spring cavern sanctuary with a podium on the altar up from mostly the marathon is set up as a kind of churn there are more than a hundred fifty people on the program and it is not just poetry readings but ban's play in their coiographeris and committals have seen paddy smith perform there and chilli glass and a everybody only gets two to three minutes each to read or play or whatever the time limit is a big feel as they need to fit everybody an occasionally some one gets on station between acts and tells everybody o keep it short an i the sort of rules shattering moment that happened was not one of the famous is on stage i was somebody it'd never heard of aroma is is a compose a comformeran writer is reason word from alas composer musician but he did not have an instrument with him or even anything to read off of he just real climbed up on stage stood in front of the my and i had to admit i was early just looking down a my o man a not an tan an when he started talking the brazilin state of trot the gross tho so has a law mandating that season companies offer of fifty per cent and then he stopped talking for a while and i think it was at this point that i looked a and saw him sort of staring wide eyed may be trembling a bit ism playing this in real time by the way normally it'd end it these silences down but i wanted to give you a sense of how confusing this was at first and uncomfortable fifty per cent i had no idea what was going on far he had said the brazilin state of math gross soul has a law mandating that siphon companies offer a fifty per cent discount to and then you can hear he is during these kind of little breathy clicks and pops and i was o it some performance a thing self on companies spotty coverage in brazil to the customers with fifty per cent discount to their customers with and then he breaks into portuguese which you studious not timprsaso enough facia the far customers with breaks in the timing influence of speech that is the customer so have special pendents myself that is what was going on they have to the customer has to present become has a stutter a signed statement from a speech language a significant one speech language speech language pathologists to prove their pathology i first encounter this la in a book about strange laws from around the world the author of the book was mocking the law but i see in the law and attempt to address the issue of temporal accessibility temporal accessibility when it comes to when it comes when it comes when it comes to ti sailed speech i was first invited to participate in this magnificent event i was struck by the two minutes time limit which later became a two to three minute timeout and i understood intuitively that the purpose of this time when it was to create as non hierarchical with space as possible but in removing one hierarchy the time limited introduces another a time limit assumes that all people have relatively equaaccess to time through this speech which is not true shuddering is very unpredictable i can rehearse something as many times as i want but i do not actually know how on will take to say anything until i have to say it what you just heard us about half of team's performance as he performed it that night my commentary not withstanding the clocks in it about five minutes practically twice the length permitted itself it'll play you the second half in a bid but in just those five minutes it'd gone from barely paying attention to being totally raped everybody was the pass is continued some of them longer than what you just heard and in an enormous room packed with people there was barely any other sound i do not remember hearing a cough or paper rustle we are all just kind of spellbound partly i think because as serum said himself what was happening on stage seemed very unpredictable that is what it felt in the audience e and in the weeks and on since then i realized i just had all these questions for from the way you wish you could call up the person who made the weird obscure move you just saw that you cannot get out of your head or who wrote the book you just read i just wanted to know how he thought of what he did how it felt to do that terms chon car you i doing well i called him you ski o i friendly his face and had not had a hair cut an a while everybody o thing i serum told me he got the idea after the director of the poet you project sent him an email inviting how to perform and mention the time lame just reading that gave him this range of stress and i was is like i noted the stress not i think it ism interested going towards that stress an explained that he says that confusion i felt at first that is what he was going for because it common for people to have that feeling upon meeting him they doftkow what is going on until he tells them it is not easy to bring hundreds of people simultaneously in to an experience you live every day but he managed it i also wondered if he had kind of improvised what he was going to say but he says he wrote it all out ahead of time re hearsetet reading it off his phone while walking down the street which was way easier than deciding it on stage he says what was the shortest amount of time that it took when you were preparing when you were rehearsing it i was sat a it you in a half minutes soon half mines yet and i was important to him he says to write something that some one who did not stutter could recite within the time limit she that way he was simultaneously gathering to the rules and breaking them at the same time and since muttering some predictable serum says there was a chance the whole thing could have taken him only forming and it was a funny situation were stuttering less might have made it harder for people to understand the point he was trying to make i figured simply being on stage would make him more likely to stutter but jerome'sas know it is in fact quite soothing to be on stage don't si it is sike i aptly feel that that i that i have the time ism an i randan into some ways the stage the stage audience relationship is a more tomporly accessible environments then there environments of veil vet veil veil e communication that i engage wits when he worked at the colombia law library just to give you some background of his life off stage become worked at the circulation desk and not only did he have to take in calls but he had to transfer calls to other people answering the phone that is one temporal expectation and then having to explain to some one else whose calling while the first persons on hold now he is squashed between two temporal expectations it was restful also this show and radio in general is not usually an accessible environment for differently able speakers am leaving in a lot of become stutters in the interview part of the story but ism still cutting out some of his pauses and repeats and mind for that matter as a group of professionals were by us toward more fluid talkers and became acutely aware of that while editing our conversation and just to let i tried to quorum quote clean up his answers as little as possible cause i want to bring you into chrome's daily experienced too anyway i think become stuttered less than usual on the call with me because i know he stutters he says it helps to disclose at relaxes him and then there are other subtler ways that he is able to payment sometimes when he is talking to people sometimes prefer to it is my super but sometimes i referred to it as these studier these shudder because to me shuddering is not bound to my body that it is a phenomenon that occurs between me and were m seeking you i to think of it it is something that we share and when chrome's in a conversation with some one he shudders partly cause the burden to talk smoothly is only on him exactly exactly one way a say that is he is shudder but hit is notherway that is there is a sudden happening and we are both contending with it s exactly and his talk at the poetry project was that on a gran scale that is what he wanted for each of us to shoulder a little of the wait of the stutter that was happening the reason for those long silences on stage is something that i did not know either chrome's particular kind of stutter is sometimes called a bottled lock the way he explains that when your vocal words are at rest they're are part and then when you go to talk they come together and library but sometimes chrome's vocal guards gets stuck in the middle between being at rest and touching he can still make little silence with his teeth and tongue and lips but not his voice and stalking to him on skip the same thing would happen as when he was on stage when the little block came he got this look kind of frozen wide eyed stare he was stunned except on stage it was more dramatic his face would turn upward and remember thinking myself is that just effort is it fear ye and i other look yer you've speaking about ya it is like some stars woo there their body will willing fact move about while the studding there face woke we will move a certain ways which which ice id sometimes but in general my my body responses acts is a freezing i an am i and i saw breathing often too just if us everything stops for a second or five second longer i part of it is that is that in freezing part of it feels my body goes into a kind of supplication or prayer almost i have a friend who who once referred to it as watching watching me ask for the word and wait and ait for it to come wait for to come ye and embianic as i often look up it is a very specific state is a this there is some ways in which i totally leave the room and i i thing that speaks to the the looking upward and i then just a all come back once the word arrives and it was not fear he says he does have a lot of fears in his daily life thinking too much of some one's time not being able to order a shake shack when there is a line behind him but this was not that if he was afraid of anything e was falling back on the tactics he usually uses to get around to stutter synonyms for example swapping out a word he is blocked on for one that is easier to say he wanted do that on hostage and him i i dinrulis that until now that i think that was the primary and i did do that two or three times and i regretted it afterwards i do you remember which words you did id on by any cham yes try the customers with there is the portages word with i he stub which you scabious my impress which i had literally translated to in my text i translated it translated it translated it translated it translated it translatsit to try disturbance and as as you just saw that word is still as is very hard for me to say that i did it the performance was customers with i said breaks breaks breaks in the time and influence in the timing influence of speech and that was one that i i did not that i did that i what i wanted to do was what i i jut sit with wit with you is just wait wait for the hate but i but it was especially especially does he can be really painful i well i as mi avoided that one and as fresh as myself a us at happen i breaks to me to does not capture what i wanted to capture are names particularly difficult yes ye yes because as a condoms for them heron blocks on his own name haw since he was four years old when has stutter started now trying to say his name or any name he says it is hes for again i even i even in some situations for a few years i would say i john tons my middle name but very interestingly i an begins setting on john and then i and then i was such saint shown and because some sometimes the shut sound as e the just sound as i has a harder attack and also it obviously show is just in and inn incredibly beautiful name and ti was belly i me now as my do as my main reasoning for joss i well if ism n it i man to choose the new name while i just got to the top just go for the top ans young and that i setting on that i mean i just find that that is beautiful its like it is always out paying me in in a way you find that beautiful that it is out pacing you ye ye i man i find it painful to but i but a i find it a deep beauty in that i what is the beauty bet for me it is the quality that it is the sudden it feels the thing that it is deeply and time with my body my mind my emotions everything and yet i i cannot figure it out or i cannot grasp it and and and even more when i think i have grasped it lie when i think about smart it it even my switching my name i the something about just i we plosive it is the second half of chrome's performance was just one sentence it took i four minutes and nine seconds to get through partly because it had a name at the beginning the black framings the sentence began the black feminist scholar somberly crenshaw once road and then a quote climbing on top of crenchaw's name alone took him about a minute forty five seconds i have not paused the recording of the performance by the way it is still running underneath thus my chest was heading much sit and whiles doing of catch i just give up and leave and was know i mean i have done that somebody a me the many moments and in life where over i just i just stop speaking that is to one to put in in the labor of finishing my thought or finishing my my sentence sounds know i do not want to do that here i wanted to show the audience the labor that is of all and this is labor that i often or sometimes will not put in the black framing scholar but it was around this moment that the feeling in the room started to change again there was no more confusion obviously and than he concern or tension was gone too black from i scholar by this point the importance of what become was saying had landed on us and the marriage between the thing he was saying and the way he was saying at a poem elongated it just took us a little longer to catch up somberly crenshaw once rote i gent stopped the recording for a second in just read you the quote you can sit with it during this last part it goes treating different things the same can generate as much an an equality as treating the same things different my did you feel kind of pink rock to be doing that or bad i asked to be ye i mean i i felt i it was an act of resistance and and ism m as a musician my the first music i study be the deeply was was and i remember very distinctly when i was middle school that i would be i would have my my cities at home and oftenthey would be for r tracks because he track would be nine minutes long and that i member looking my frenzies of a unfrock for example as you mention and much shorter tracks i member i member it noticing that that agent thinking about what that meant and they would be just refusal to at here too the length of a posing for example you know an for meter is always a racialize element there too that that there is a black resistance against certain structures of time that now this track is eleven minutes long and i if you do not do not listen to it than to listen to a belike ism we are our but what ting to achieve in this music is different in some ways then than whats a three minutes song the strange once treating treating treating treating treating treating treating treating want as a black prison ism also thinking about the way that time an access to time is racily insect there are there many moments in the world when ha treating a prison of color is just not given as much time to speak treating a different things the same way may generate as much inequality as treating the same things in different ways you h to learn more about come alive and his many projects visit become else got cam that is j e r o m e e l l i s got con you can also follow him on histogram in at episternum coming out a story that perfectly calculates what my father always called the golden rule them that is got the gold makes rules s joke as in one minute from chico public radio when our program continues it is this america life ism show coal sitting in for iroglaphs to days show made to be broke in stories about regulations guardlines proprieties the people up and for some just cause as upmost od just cause act two of our so today it is all about the deffer sentence when he was a kid the comedian cowbell was a rule follower but there was one time he got into really big trouble broke the roles in a serious way and there is a solenoid picture commemorating the moment in his family became one of those iconic photographs sort of family lower they just called it the solenoid he explain the back story to producer elm baker when tone started six cat at a new school he got miss killed as his home room teacher his neighbor who were calling in p told him that is not the teacher you want you want miss jefferson he deffelly let me know the eat the better sea your most i stood in know why ism to a sofas cause she was young and it was mad bat i quickly learner why you wont i miss jeffersn why do you want miss jefferson miss jeferson ran her own bag ye a bank she was a math the tern she gave out fig money to the feds when you did balling your homemaker tasks you would earned what she called jefferson box a ben miss jefferson not homes they came in to nominations of one five and ten and were actually printed the was deafly at jefferson men they were the were bills they were straight up bills smaller than a dot small than to a real dollar beg of the ma nobly money but a cot ahead that feel of madam then money tit was coming into look i me twelve your money loo the look one and i ism going arsis shore her face was on it town not then in miss jefferson's how an ten p who got her home in for or five times o day but he hot her once a day for man he got to earn jefferson bus to he would also make them for toe behavior being quiet or helping

us of all tables i should not us the shoo look of people's books out a blew and then picking him up just si she can see a good deed and then you looking back at e you see tat his didn't at the end of the week you could assure jefferson boson at the jefferson market a little store miss jefferson set up at her desk here you good buy an extra ten minuets at recess an an never fences coming inside in your here is five dollars i in a to playing red errand by myself or you good buy school supplies she plastic toys little green almsman and candy all traits of candy this was obwaysly the top cellar the gid e been ranked it in order of preference the you know the fun dips in the blow pops and then and their heads were deaf we like one said a the tops at cannot mad be skittles i the long jolly ranchers and you can you can tell you could tell special with the effs in books if you only had two dollars you this is this i this is the jor she omens with as best that she cannot yes that she it you do not have enough this you got it you got a kipped from his bullshit and tone movie but then one day a few weeks in to the cover this thing hoping that changed how ton thought about the jefferson be sister and he could not get end out of his head he was sitting with them p when he noticed something i may i remember him having that plastic pencil case that you know you just see no pencils protractor do call it you n a ruler an old had all that you need he in he was he had much money he is much money what that bag was use to turned into a while i man it was just whats of jefferson books i remember him taking that o in twas almost a a seek et to seeing when e by the but lie you notthrough make up a dollars and i saw i how you have that much money that it blood to mi and then hearing my to letter dow to day ism you made o even dollars to day to day it an't even two o'clock yet you got more time town in been working his oof for weeks and only had wit six box which ears a tiny fraction of what an p house tone was earning him in my wage and an p was eff fasts he had they really said with that before he understood how this could ben and pe had miss jefferson for home room and to mat which men pretty saw her for times throughout the mam tone only saw her once for mat of course an e had man more jefferson i on reset in lie and ad being envious and been jealous and wondering how i do that and just let me which my energy et ill study more it'll be politer i will not talk is class an much tone tried all sorts of strategies to make money but now that he saw the saw on the system he could not on see it everything was remind her how much more opportunity the kids in her home room had it was almost the a on for coats sand shed and it and drive a catalogs it most it made him dress better it was they were in in the capital and we were district twelve we are just poor people try to make it and they a the flat and and did that make you mad ow i maybe soft a an made me ma is cause you do not know to rules and you no suppose to work but then it does not work but you see work for others to tone having money also meant something really important to him i pressing girls there was one girl in particular ye had a huge erosion we will call her in tamasha she did not even know tone existed but he thought about her all the time and the tasse her name was on the back of my note book in stuff she was active an just long here rouse can just beautiful and her maturity level was was up thee o me hair was always dos shwas i cool clothes an she just had the attention and you saw to dos would get her attention and of man to be as which yo that just they had money the had jeffson books and what boys by girls things with the jefferson down yet yet we go tat tricking off yes o yo yet a you definitely tone is twelve trying to figure out the whole birthing for the first time and desperate to impress them luckily here were other ways to make money besides miss jefferson's class and way more ways to spend it one of tone's class made explained to me that because miss jefferson's store was only open on fridge the kids came up with an underground economy of their own a black market fueled by jefferson boys that was open every day of the week you could buy anything there if somebody had jello in a chocolate or their desert we i hay mangy three books for to had o you slice of peace on fridge i may somebody might say you a pencil half price when miss jefferson ill see i is jeffson might o is send sell the pencil a graphic pencil for two dolls and you might be begetter for wonder and now i it is it became in a legal tender basically throughout six great the kids did a lot of shady things all under the table la ids o miss jefferson's class would pay kids to miss jellies ten to twenty jefferson books to do their home work that is how the block market worked if you had money if you did not you got a forgot how o leverage but they need that you can get something at your natgetin which is the jefferson book i may never moments way i remember if you not pain a tenter to your books you might have a ten book stolen and you on ne five jeffson books to get your book back her by remember the lopsided nits to miss jefferson's system was clear to everyone an missteller's home ram they complained to each other about it it is this this made that something is in n and i do not and remember who was but i remember a lot of us been like yew what do we need to do did you ever say that to her yet we brought it up o how to how do we do more of your not seen it ism try my begin as i may man now we got it we got have a town all the kid brought it up one day in mouth class and several others in clouding tone immediately jumped on board i was not able to find miss jefferson to get her sit of this but the way tone remembers it miss jeffersons jut this discussion down if they wanton ore money she said they needed to try harder period and of discussion is ti gat man everybody the same opportunity and is no they do not will you got a work harder an you got a troharder and then after ism ism say once of doing that nothing still nothing and i just had this moment zeros i i i got er i got a round the jefferson bank i there is no other way again tone was a run follower his job was really street this most wildly out of character but is big told backsaw in a very different contact who's the brighter criminal the man who robs the bank we the man who founds one tone figure if she can make believe a bank then he could rob that ma choli bank without any consequence and and then sour cottages may i guess i runs cotostarted case in the miss jefferson's actions and i knew we left a window open and knew we had at this foin we had a right before lunch i i knew where she kept on where the store was and with t money was at lunch saw decided complies before ism going to start going to the bath room during lunch i a i will go to the bathroom come back an a low expertise come back you know for a sew days just saw this would not look awkward et hes testing out how long he can be away without people noticing miss jefferson's class room is locked during lunch but she is a window that faces the courtyard his plan is to slipping through the window grabs the money and head out was o case to days a day i you no go i go to the bathroom and i said shes make gan to the than new own o well he goes straight to miss jefferson's window in the courtyard wishes it open and climbs in his heart is racing and then he goes over to the one place every did noesis forbidden his teachers dusk he knows exactly where miss jefferson keeps the money an the bottomry drawer he opens the drawer and sees the metal cash bock in's unlocked and open a box up and a i mean just money i m hinges even in a moment as i all this and this is a scrooge mac duck moment i am swim in jefferson but but you cannot get over allies right as if if you take everything that is dealing o be noticeable she has take enough to feel comfortable but not enough to set off any alarms and door opened up pop the pop of box and grabbed out a nice i mean i may i must say an inch think of jefferson books i must say gan inch a nice a nice probe equivalent to what empty had in his in his an his a and is and his pencilholded and you knows why i i that and happen and i stuff my pockets and i might i got you to forgot e tone is running out of time he does the sweep of the room then he acts its through the class room door and locks at behind i ism good i ism home free i close a door a back out doors locks and ill sort to walk round the corner and have run in ton the ti should blue my mi also ism also why she in the hallway and i mean she she looks to me she knows

and what was the expression on your face the expression pain an defeat tone never got another parking he never went broke again an part of that has to do with the pole rid and he time he started acting up his at would remind him of that photo and tone wit course correct an it i my it was that loden it was i mind that total made me break down tone was ashamed he felt that for robbing the bank that the thing is it actually got a on he wanted not he expected he did not get jefferson bout is but he got justest miss jefferson changed the rolls no matter how many times a day you sire he can only earn money during the hour of math class it became a level playing field i like at do creme people cannot been disappointed there was people in is offer's class ever past ism sure but everybody was not is offer's class was yell about time yet but it is interesting to way our saying rat now is just the kids in miss jefferson's class are going to be pissed to you because they do not have the privilege they used to have it but they also i have no concept of how you have been feeling all school year he not n liken that is exactly you do not know it is different for me woman er class you it take a class en at the same no i know it should be but is tat that is a matter me will's i has to do i felt a fair for tone this was always just a funny story he told about his dads awkward solenoid but he started talking to me about it a few weeks ago during the height of the recent protest and that made him think about the story differently there is a parallel that i that have never notice or or look for i guess between how communities reaction they do not fee their being treat i fairly will it is it is what it makes me think of his a jess always talked in parables writ and i feel your jefferson bucks story is such a perfect parable i the i agree when the rules are the same for every blow an some people throb in some people do not but every one's following them why is not not y why is not not far and in even know if it is can be answer most of the time but the question has to be ask if this is a parable almost everything lines the systematic in equality the unfairness how sometimes you have to break the rules in order for them to change i see what ism to learn from everyone but the one thing either is figure out is water we spoke to learn from tamasha tone never told

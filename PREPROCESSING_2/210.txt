doing the same things over and over sisifist pushing his rock up the slope get in again till the job gets done we have arrived at a to of our programmed in this act we move for people who ware saving us from something very large o people saving us from something tiny act too the other extinguishers the people in this act have been working at a task some of them for years and there is been in the news just the last few weeks they have actually succeeded t looks they got their bolder up to the top of the hill avid castonbam spoke with four scientists who have been working on a coroner of iris far see one the ones that was just shown to be effective avid was the scientist in his early career they worked at firm lab and from the coverage he could not understand what exactly they had done in any detail any one to know that and who these people were and especially how does it field who have help make a thing that could save many lives fix a noble economy get life back to normal again for everybody here is avid i gong to tell you the story of some of the people who made this one tiny thing it is a key thing that is an at least five of the valines that are being tested if you get the

him curious about stuff yet why we to thing why i a rennet eat for yes it amcorias a sols it is finding for me it was when i was in tenth grate i thing i learned about newton's equation for gravity and i learn that that explained to both the orbits of the planets and also what ever haven you dropped a ball and i was i ma that is amazing there is anoquasion that describes both of those perfectly it was the rules behind the thing as the same thing ye what i ready beautiful ta ye hen i first male actual he was superexcited to talk said no one had really interviewed about a that he had done patron got himself a scholarship to one of the top universities and the thing he found himself gravitedin for it is this field called structural biology much i think favors of particular kind of person you are basically trying to figure out what molecules look were all the atoms are you can tell how something works or if it is a virus how to fight it and the thing is people work for years trying to figure out the structure of one tiny molecule the traditional way of doing it is that he get a munch of those molecules and try to get them to lay out in a neat repeating pattern then he hid him with these powerful ex rays which give you just this pattern of dots then you have to apply these mathematical algorithms and sometimes it is just not solvable it really is pushing a bolder to the top of the hill the rolls down over and over cancan was hooded it though first thesis he worked out the structure of part of a corona virus not this crone virus this was years ago it was a coronavirus that was making the news back them the ours corona virus the cause it caused middle's respiratory sitcom after that he needed a job i reached out to got who was also looking into mess mason my clean at dartmouth how would your friends describe you ah i no idea for could they hang out with s likes having a be to is con to save the world it'll think that was not any one's rater annual came over to the states to work with mason in his teem this was two thousand fourteen six years before the pandemic they wanted to make a valine for ours and one of the things they were trying to figure out back them they would not have been key for the vaccine we have to day was how to manufacture copies of the tiny spikes they were all over the surface of the ours corn virus the spikes are why they are called crone virus the viruses have a corona wreath of these little spikes sticking out all over it the spike is the part that sticks to your cells when it gets on your body what's the virus break into your cells and start replicating it is this carry part of the thing in away if they could make just the spikes without a deadly virus attached to them maybe they could train your immune system to recognize the virus and fight it but tit turned out to be damn hard to make the spikes in the lab basically you stick the genetic code for the spike into some cells one of the cells a let two either who cells chines hamster very cells or a c c canine three cells which are what a he human embryo at kitysells i do not know why i wanted to know all this except that this is the kind of knowledge that is can t save our asses the problem was when they got the genetic code for the spikes into this cells they did starts pitting out spikes but the cells were not making a lot of them and the spikes on their own were unstable they kept changing into the wrong shape ancon spent a long time trying to stabilize them ad something tweak the genetic code try again again there is a tedium to it each try takes a while a i ta the six twotherees you would start it march first by the third week in march you would be done with that last and most the time it fails yes and then you start again and then you do not know for another three weeks if that new thing works yes yes but the be had to law e that is the same time as you a mom tree o you do twenty of them at the same time oh yes wit did data try and every time you tried this in your mind are you oh this time it is on to work yes try ops as a tans it it is going to work if we was work i a copies collect the ah you're i got is ape a it is funny that yourself to mystic because most the time it fails right it just keep failing and failing yes the that is call alive as a beget this kind of labor it is find of cooking but for the fussiest restaurant ever lots a little precise steps you makes the stuff up in a flask set it on this little platform which gently squirrels the stuff in it keep the whole thing at thirty seven degrees series leave it over night we your constantly having to be at the lab at a certain time to do the next step his wife told them he ways say tell be five minutes but it is hours they tried many different things scouring the scientific literature for different ideas modifying them the thing that finally work was changing the genetic cod for the spike would swap in two prolinomino acids they help told the spike in it spike for kept it from changing shame also the sells were spitting out wayworn spikes fifty times wore ow the day to work is real excited cause we a the outrank we would been doing all this work it is it is a lot of trial at air you radically just failing and tell at works and filly you got wat like while that thallic fantastic we knew we had something the when the have vaccinated mice gave them a shot containing these ours corona fire spikes the mice is little amuse systems developed antibodies lots of them it looked really promising you might be able to make a really good valine against the mirrors corona virus this was basically the road map for the valine we were all gin to need when the pandemic started but the major scientific journals we are not interested in publishing it the try too try sixty the galas and the was reject ratans wow that is kind of amazing looking back now ye if we look a yes yes ow ow i i was get i ta o the rejected force far section yes he told me he fell into a real depression no one seems to see the value of their work he saw a therapist who pointed out all he had accomplished and suggested that he might feel proud instead of sad it did not really help this was two thousand seventeen the pandemic was three years away the fact that the had trouble getting it published to me it does not mean the scientific journal editors are idiots back then most people thought the next pandemic was can be some new form of influence of not a crone virus which of course is the argument for funding lots of basic research sometimes you do not know what thing is going to be important when the current pandemic began mason my fella had moved his lab from dartmouth to the university of taxes at often the strong had gone with him mason told me one day in canary canary sixth he was in you toss snowboarding and he got a call from the deputy director of the valine research center at the national institutes of health barney graham graham had been working with him on all the ours corn virus stuff he was calling about som pneumonia illness in when china the local health authority was reporting forty one cases plebe now you was talking of the you a d s and the they wanted to quickly make a vain canada and look it was a bat o her on a virus and if he wanted to know a a are we game are webbing a were help out try to rapidly determine the structure of the spike and get the axe made and a you said you said i busy em snowboarding they have is i at yaws ax us getting some boots heat molded si had ten minutes to talk to him a while there heap molding to my fee but i immediately what is tapped make had student dance rap and told hem a you weeping to rase to got to move quickly on this tats get prepared it is worth pointing out they were running full steam at this in canary this is before won went to lock down for that giant hospital got bill the whole thing was barely in the news and life here was totally normal they are all going to the office to work frantically on this thing wall around them people are going to restaurants and church kids are in school the thing they were going to try to help make is called an m arena valine instead of giving people shots filled with coronavirus pikes you inject people with the genetic code from making the spikes the code is wrapped in this little package and once it gets in ejected in your body it goes into yourselves and then yourselves start making the spikes loads of them which on their own a harmless but your man system sees these faring things and learns to fighting which should hopefully protect you if the real virus cons this is the genius of valines we are not that good it making drugs against fuses we know it is really good fighting them arm yuinsistem if you just show it the right piece of the virus it often figures out how to fight it off it is the answer we all have it inside us the ta t the say ta then they an and the big thing they had to work out for the valine was what part with the genetic sequence for the cronavirus were they on to stick in the taxi to make the spikes and how ware they gong to alter that coat that when the spike was created it would be stable and not this it around five days after mason got that phone call chines re searchers posted the genetic code for the new corona virus on line teams around the world could look at it mason and the others started going through it right away how long did it takes you get the sequence and how long until your this is the thing we want in the valine oh an our maybe really there is probably with thitetmen she my says you to the sequent limit you just put them in k that is because the spike on this crone virus that would cause the pandemic it was very very similar to the one on the ours carbon of virus the one they had been studying it is often noted that these valines came together really quickly but it seems the reason they came to gather really quickies because all this work that went on for years beat that is right and ya it definitely us just it is alight just happened in thirty days the get happy and ma no i graphic on lie in showing that if says covet at two had t emerged even ten years ago we would be nowhere this far along to to having a valine they sent the genetic sequence off to a company that they would been communicating with for a while called ma durra mazurka a much of other scientists another companies have been working for years and how to even make in an arena taxi which is a whole other story anyway a few weeks later they had one ready for testing ma it is lay the bar cacti but that eventually be tested a or what pul the a bargain get this is is meek orbit viral an enologist at the anlage who ben working with mason and yanschuang and everyone else she was there when the package arrive from mazurka it just note about kismikya she told me that she was one of these kids who went all the science fairs could not leave a math problem on sold and also when the bell prizes were announced she would write the speeches she would imagine they would deliver and read them out loud pretending to deliver them in a very dramatic way wit tears as if they were the stars r something anyway she was the one who went to get the box of the first famines when they arrived it came and i wake for the was the first time in the people ma gonna were i had t show by idea and i nonmember loading dot people could ne e break the box up to me i had to lake meet that number down tears i do not been baby came on a plan ritually think the they hadn't y riding from bossing but was ta when you got that box what did you think i i remember asking the guide the losing done to take a picture a his a er can you thing about we get i re the me the me et is fa en he la o like a git to that cause he was too busy i even as a m ja i just this party find is the bout to back to ate some widow two hundred two hundred fifty mites with the back ten it ane here an needing was really understood the grabby this was in february his meek remembers at some point going to see her family sitting down on her mama's bed and can of briefing everyone i think things might really changed i think the virus is about to be a big problem i taught to all the researchers about what it was in this period making and testing of valine they hoped to work but not knowing meanwhile more and more of the world was shutting down more people getting sink and dying is meerkat told me she is to look at the daily numbers for the world and then had to stop it was not healthy barbie graham as his media's boss hes that deputy director of the valine research center at the anlage an me guy called mason while he was snowboarding he would worked with them on all the stuff the most seniormember of the group they waited on him though he did now his recognize it he says he is not always in touch both his feelings we talked in the evening he was at home where had been for months sitting in front of a bookcase little bust of benjamin franklin on it he seemed tired making the marine took many steps many decisions most of the time you just you on drink through the ayin trader make this siskin and and she everybody in here's a a sequence in o things have to happen in certain order or you get of u coping things love take for won but sin she most to now may be my wife can say and then his wife who was in the room where we were talking the name canthi jumped in well i she is a pcychiatress and at a couple of points of been chiming in in a very sweet way the sort of explain her husband's calm exterior she said your forgetting the story which she started to tell he came out of his office in he was clearly distracted an upset and of course that you wan a was son o we you have to skim and you have to not we la the he into he sells and i can s is cry in he he said what if i selected the to we quench we had slept e seas and miss but e question was on was it the it one usually we spin we seen months or even years experimenting to the side this is best one o us he was world about the time that would be wasted in the come that we itself how many people would i how many children will be that without stairs yo how many old people wit at i yet ran rainy e was just thinking a that the o we pagan fences it yes at is rot yo race it is it is just i said i i ten to be a little obsession and yo know you just i get certain ideas a thought patterns but of your head till you find e at resolution clinical trials began on march sixteenth which is pretty incredible this is right around the time when businesses were just deciding it would be safer to work from how shouts were eventually given tens of thousands of people and then the weight began to see if it worked meanwhile the kronor iris kept spreading in the es or as the president called it the long flew and the china virus here's ne unshod i for cilia yet a i do house som sotefaty that is yes the present a should the not see that to toll my home country how pretty clary past i things it it makes lo sans it was offensive but it also just struck him as don there was many things the president needed to be doing to tame the pandemic we was he wasting his time with this and then may be remember this there was a story in the news face but how the f b i was looking into whether chines spies working through the consulate anhuston he tried to steal valine research the f b was con questioning people at the university of texts one story included yanchuan's name an someone who worked there from china friends told them to get a lawyer he says he and his wife looked into whether they could leave the country if they needed to in the end no one came to question him but it was unnerving the moment when all these researchers learned that their valine was can a work was a few weeks ago when fever announced tat its waxing was more than ninety percent effective finer had started its face three clinical trials on the same day as them but fever got its results first flier had used i its vain the thing this team had come up with the born of iris take stabilized the way they had figured out finer had licensed it from them if the fever valine worked they figured theirs would to tiny graham got a call before the results went public i been right here in my office for ten not i was in my office and it was in the evening a light evening men erectly there bade in safety monitoring for it mat earlier in the day and they were on on but at press release the next day on one day and i got off the for on i went over an sheepishly to my wife and my son who's visiting an the o no it it looks its can a work and and that just kind of on release a lot of emotion i think that have been holding tat frowns ten months s i retreated back into my office and us can wet all let out for a few minuteman they all a ma consoled me but the that women to at copy by surprise that there as much in there to come out the whole family was in tears it is just a relief to now that you gan to that point and because in face abutment there is a thousand choices to make a thousand decisions and a thousand nice fail and most of these kind of about me projects to to turn out and and to get through all the way to get an answer tit sat it work and even work better than your expect at was what cartermol ye i was not expecting to be emotional at all i was sure was not expecting since c trying any tears for either that you a what kind of a crime was it the lost a different kinds of crime a c the it my a we a if my sibling folder my friends a listening in as i touch a a yo i abri is ire you rial that fie him a you try make and my writer ugly eat the cry you might expect you have if you on e wary i do not even know of my family man to day understand what just happen the with me over the last her if i were to called in about my are the delicacy results that be a we that as is wat still have a communicate with my family about the et to wit all i take them all prim i just talk for my dad bi morning about mixing a dish washer in my rental property talk of the all time but i attic out ye its feels oh got it is its naturally walking tow it is really going to a look people i think ism proud away and e it is great that little thing you made my ye five the global economy it could save millions of lives it could help you now everything it back to normal that little thing yes that is what i hope ye what a your parent say a parents naturally s it do not know o hows to they just now oh you develop a mom in as gat us the think an they do not know how much contribution i did ye i treat it it yet no man got strop several yes ago i ma shiny no on know what is i was what ism doing now ism sorry about your mam a yet ism wetly o sin about that but ye hots the encourage also yes a pass yet i were always remedy those things e it can be hard i think when you are in deep with something complicated to explain that thing to some one on the outside particularly with science there is this version that often makes it out into the world of a single person having a clear dramatic break through dunnock apoleovaxine the novel prize is always given to one or a few people but a lot of science is not that i think most of it is not when i ask mason the clean the other scientist in the

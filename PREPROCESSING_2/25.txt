when it comes to the twenty twenty four election therefore couple of points mad one for republicans and one for democrats we star with the point for democrats celebrities are not going to save you i know the democrats seem to believe that lebriging celebrity in favor of there best political candidates magically raises them to victory they are thinking back to a time when mainland manrope was singing happy birthday mister president to the president the is stopping j f k there thinking back to a time during the nineteen nineties when billing was playing saxophone on on late night t v there thing back to a time when celebrity matter and awful lot more than it does right now and the have tried this perform trying to drag a lack letter candidate over the finish line with celebrity tends not to work but when you're a desperate candidate you have to take desperate measures which is wythethan your times is reporting to day that president bison is trying to pump energy into his reelect bid taking off what is likely to be an ugly dispiriting and historically long slog to nonmember between two unpopular candidates apparently he is now sent two of his most trusted white house operatives to take the helm of his reelect campaign and wellington at delftware other bison aids are drafting wishlists of potential creates including elected officials social mediate influences and the indorsement of their wildest dreams the global super star tailor swift oh yes they are resorting to the sixties this early that is not a god sign for your campaign when you're starting to target tailor swift as if she indorse is all my guess on to change even to first of all we should point out tailor swift did in fact indorsed jobidon for president in twenty twenty it did not really move the needle all that much because she is just a very famous pop star and very famous posters in horsing people does not any move the needle all that much thank god now there are some poles that suggest that actually a fifth of voters ore likely to back the candidate indorsed by the singer there is a pole conducted by red field and wilt stratifies for newsreel and found that eighteen per cento voters say they are more likely or significantly more likely to vote for a candidate indorsed by tailor swift and that sway was most visible voters under the age of thirty five jivey mild proposal a moderate proposal if you base your vote on who tailor swift in horses you should not be allowed to vote the united states this does not hold just true for tailor swift if you base your vote on the that of celebrities who spend two seconds engaging with politics but yo really their sons you should not be voting if your voting republican t based on the endorsement of gonna west if your voting democrat based on the indorsement of tailor swift you should not be voting that is not how politics is so post to work and is worth noting again that backing twenty twenty she literally treated in favor of jobidon she treated quit after stoking the fires supremacy and races of your entire presidency you have the nerve to fain moral superiority before threatening violence when the looting starts the shooting starts we will vote you out nonmember donate trump now it is also true that seventeen per cent said they would be less likely to vote for candidate back by talk wife eighteen per cents and more likely seventeen per cent said less likely how bout this how about we do not care about knowing cares what tailor swift tasosand politics because she is a pops star and she makes songs and then it is in many shots by the and fell quickie note here i i have to say good for lama jacks for preserving his breathing on this planet because of lama bacon had actually put to cant city chiefs in danger of losing the a of s championship came the other day rogerigdollt of him with the drone to prevent from alone there such she drone hovering over the stadium as can moose a baroccoboma drone attack in some folia or something if if march action actually brought to baltimore ravens to the brink of the superbly in any case bison is now early reaching for the celebrity lever when you are reaching for the celebrity button or leave er that quickly your in serious serious trouble according to the work times the campaign is begun to cussing discussions with celebrities and social made stars about promoting mister bidding instrogram and victor because there is nothing that kind better then there favorite celebrities in horsing a vegetable when bison took a fun rasing swing through southern californium in remember the campaign carved out time to meet with in fluenceerse to pitch them on posting probidon content you re member some of the provide cotton from a little bit earlier in his presidency including random heard people with healthy sticks in the white house be in all strangion off putting or gan to get a old of that this year the biggest and most infulenchall indorsement target is swift herself the pop sensation and and i fell enthusiast who can move millions of supporters with an instrugram post or mid t concert aside shindorst bison in twenty twenty last year a single instragram post led to thirty five thousand new not o registrations look et can i just point out here that first oval her histogram how many followers to tailor swifthave on histogram she must have oh i got hundreds millions of followers on i two hundred eighty million followers on histogram and so as able to register thirty five thousand people n those are not amazing numbers if hoiden is counting on tailor swift getting millions people vote good luck to him pavan news apparently all but bad de tailor swift to become more involved in bison's campaign he said quote tailor swift stands tall and unique what she as able to accomplish just in getting young people activated to consider they have a voice another shulhave a choice in the ex election i think is profoundly powerful that of course is gavanusum trying to to message tailor swift into indorsing him for president in twenty twenty eight the chatter around swift and the potential of her two hundred seventy nine million instragram followers being reached reach such intension intensity that the bidonte urged applicants an a job posting for a social media position not to describe they're tailor swift strategy there is an idea that maybe they would send bid in to actually her eras tour which would be the death of her restore by the way and nobody wants to watch that old duet hobble up there an then try to days to tailor swift over produced music at this point instead of actually being good president they are going to try to bring tailor swift on board in all of this i gain input point out here the democratsmen trying play the skim for multiple election cycles in to berackobama did not win in two thousandeight or two thousand twelve because he had celebritiinsdorsements he one because he was the celebrity it is one thing for the candidate himself to be a slept dona trump one in twenty sixteen because he was a we liberty pop cultural relevant dos matter in awful lot but only when the person with the pop cultural relevance is the politician himself it is non transferable credit if you stand next to tailor swift that does not make you tailor swift and it does not give you you a peal of tailor swift again hilriclinn tried to do this back in twenty sixteen here was hilryclintn trotting out every celebrity she could possibly find to sing fight song out of youremember this there is

falling for this line a lot or for the past ten twelve years increasingly every conspiracy theory now must be treated as a real possibility here istle robe with conspiracy theories the problem conspiracy theories is that almost always they are wrong the reason i say almost always there o sometimes the right but almost always there wrong because there require incredible levels of dedication there inquire incredible levels of competent and every time somebody says something but the moonlanding being fate for example yet to thinks yourself how many thousands of people would have to be in on it and competently do theirepart in order to make this happen and than it could be debunked is my friend out wall said by som schmuck when the internet connection in two thousand twenty four and a couple of pictures from guglimages and the answer is no that is not that is not real had the problem with conspiracy that sometimes their fun sometimes there silly but conspiracy theory start did you damage because if you believe that a conspiracy is in control of all the things you see all the things you hear it is enervating it makes you less likely you get active it makes you more likely to believe that nothing you do is going to end with the result that you seek there is no connection bet tween your action and the result because there is an intervening conspiracy to stop that thing from happening anta its particularly true in politics it is the reason i do not and still do not i did not i still do not the whole donate trump had the election actively voter fraud stolen from him in twenty twenty the reason this is bad is not just because it is not true an there is not enough evidence to demonstrate it and dona true has never shown enough evidence to demonstrate that it can say that the election was read i agree with that if by that you mean that all the rules were change that you saw an unprecedented number of voters in that election cycle virtually all of whom were marginal voters who had very little interest in voting i the first place in who are now sending their ballet in by man months in advance of the election in violation of the way that waw is normally suppose to work totally agree at that if you're not argue the de media rigged the election by ignoring all of the relevant issues in twenty twenty in favor you monchragarbag and than actually hid stories about jobidon in the run up again totally agree you are not argue the social media was actively stumping on behalf of jobidon an acting at the beat of actors in the deep state to time starts totally agree at that that is not the same thing as the conspiracy theory that there was a well organized voter fraud effort that deprive donate trump of his reelect the reason that is bad is not again just because untrue it is also because if that is true why bother voting and that in fact is how people reacted if you recall clothe way back to early twenty twenty one when we are in the midst of all of this craziness donate trump literally told people that in georgia and we now have two democratic senators in georgia a heavily red state that if donate trump is the nominate which you will be then he is going to win that state in all likelihood this time round what happened what happen this it would did all the voter f fraud just disappear or is it possible that he just one that popular a candidate in twenty twenty because of all the outfirmention reasons and because you are non a bad campaign in twenty twenty and did not do an amazing job in twenty twenty but he could win in twenty twenty four the problem with conspiracy theories is again it leads you to believe that all the factor's out there that could lead to your success are actually beyond your control well the democrats are busily digging their own graves by saying the who on to ignore the fact tot wore cat yon policy an ore y a data to indorse it if we if we can get the nineteen eighty nine lady the lady whose how old is tailor swift now tailor swift is at each thirty four right yew it how i if we can get the thirty four your old lady who sings songs she seventeen years old and breaking up wit the first boy friend again and she is two years younger than my wife whose a doctrine has for kids if we'd get that lady to indorse us then magically we are going to win the election if republican shustood there why how desperate are you that is a much better tact than what we have seen instead which is a bunch of people hun i the right going it is t it is a si up it a pentagon si up everything's a conspiracy we get to more on this in just one second first if you have not already checked out the good ranchers new year new meet special you need to titch the mystery of the needle get america meat delivered

america meat delivered nelson again i think some this tuff is hilarious i think that it is i think that the entire tailor swift is dating traves else she ken loose the ana fell's ratings and then right break up song fury of life may very well be true because again everything around tailor swift is incredibly produced everything round the anifell is incredibly produce and frankly it is funny and i enjoy the funny of it i enjoy the trolley of it but one of the one of the signal failures of the right these days is to believe that everything is a conspiracies there there is a theory going around a can you not the tailor swift is being promoted by the anafell which she is forratings in the raining have gone up because heilswift is very popular and people are mused and interested in the fact that she is dating the tight en for the capacity chiefs traves kelly and that every often and by every soften i mean literally every twenty seven seconds for the producer gets fired the anna felt swivels to a view of her in the skibob people have speculated on the right that this is actually a pentagon deep state conspiracy that is design to elevate tailor swift that she will endorse jo widen and thus change the election goes not everything is forty chess not everything is forty chess again ism all here for the pop culture people dating each other for the press cannas o because they do that all the time that does happen in howlywut all the time at happens in the music industry all the time ayounfine entire ratings on line of tailor swifts various romances and which are considered legit and which ones are just sort of put together for the pass an that this been a long standing tradition in tailor swift circles from what i understanding and ism no tailor swift expert ism not a swift i do not know her songs very well i know however i do not know pretty much anything about what she does other than some f her songs are catchy but those ten to be the older songs and she is a right any of heron sons any more but the theory that is now going around ad against become popular on the right he is indicative of a deeper rot inside the republican party which that when you despair of the world you start to think tat everything to conspiracy there's a hit the is going around from twenty nineteen of somebody eating the pentagon stop division talking b ow they loved cruetailorseft ism sure they would ism sure they would a man who would not if you are government and you could get tailor swift as a c i a asset why would not you does that mean that what we are watching right now is are a deep state conspiracy to promote tailor swift and travels else and then i guys there is deep state conspiracy say san francisco forty nine or will lose the superable and travels tells you will propose to tailor swift and her first act upon being proposed you will be to accept the ring that immediately our rounds e but there is only one person i love more josh a biding and suddenly bids winning in a landslide again if that first to if that the pentagon's plans the dumbos plan i ever heard tell swift cant wit thirty five thousand motor registrations that is really stupid but anyway here is the theory being laid out here have you ever wondered why or how she blew up this all around four years ago the pentagon psychological operations unit floating turning tailor swift into an asset during a dato meeting we conovasa a stop for combating on line is information listen you came in here wanting to understand how you just go out there and counts her an information operation withe ideas that social influence can help i can help i encourage or i promote behave your chain persensily ask li a peaceful information operation i include tailor swift here because she is on if she is a fairly influential on my unperson i do not know if you herd of her yet that is real the penal psyopthe unit pitch dato on turning tailor swift into an asset for combating this information a lot if i was running bines management perception team i would identify someone who would aline themselves with my agenda such as a tell swift who has close to six hundred million followers i would turgid her i would engage her and i would get her won't get her to do what we use to see is public service announcements that type o enlistment that time sin with the teens liberty is anomalous to the old days of deployment of a stop you tuna celebrity indorsement in a can in it in a bandit is sampan is at onto my her again is this super worth while is this super with what it is it is it the worst thing in the world the people it again it is indicative of they brought mind set guys not everything you do not is it conspiracy not everything i do not is it conspiracy some things are in fact conspiracies but i promise you if this is a conspiracy its the stupidest conspiracy of all time she already endorsed biding she is going to endorse him again tailor swift is a very popular very popular musician probably most popular musician in world history by mattress and youknow whats can o happen if she indorses jobidon not thing cause fetich cause he is o crap press i nothing is going to happen seeing allay the angst and all the kin of heartburn the you see on the right constantly about the sort stuff the left is motivated the left does try to do bad things but when they try to do do the bad things we can all usually see it when they are trying to make sure that small children are exposed to pornography in school libraries they are doing it right out in the open and you can stop it and you can work on it the whole basis of politics that we can make choices to actually impede the progress of a wild left and when you start getting into every single thing that we see over here is some sort of organized sit up it just a i thinks enervating i thin is bad for the republican party i do not think it is good for conserve online god for america i thing the generalized belief that all systems are rigged in america is a very bad belief whether t is on the left or whether i is on the right because the truth is in america very few things are truly truly rigged to the extent that people to believe they are whin politicians tell you that things are ride there is everything is rigs when they say that sort of stuff without any real evidence when then present evidence they just say the things are rigged typicalaks because they want more power to rig them the other way that is what they are doing here and i do not any of it we gets more on that just at one second first

slashed with helmets better sleep starts right now a am meanwhile speaking of jobidon being an absolute crappy president the thing that people are actually in a vote based on we are now finding out that the names of the of the soldiers who ware killed jordan biracial proxy forces what exactly happen morning tote walker journal the united states failed to stop a deadly attack on an america military outpost in jordan when the enemy drone approached its target at the same time as the you estrone was also returning to bases yous official sad to basically an cranial drone came in the same time in america drone as coming in they mixed up the america drone and the ran drone the cranial drone kill t bunch of america soldiers and there is still something forty wounded the return of the estrone let is some confusion over whether the in coming tone was friend or foe they caution the inquiry into the attack was in early stage accoringts officials the enemy drone as once from rock by a militia back by tavern and struck the outpost living at quarters that outpost sits near the borders of rock an serial jordan has requested of course america presents injorden in order to protect there own boarders in jordan is an a us ally in the region why has national security council spokes person john sure told reporters there is a responsibility that needs to be laid at the feet of the leaders in tahrama the problem of course is as we have said the bide administration has boxed this thing six ways from sundae it'll just remind you the right now what we are seen the release this giant conflagration he's all bided in the same way the giant wave at the border is all widen backing softener twenty twenty three take mulligan wisest ferret in the land of most national security such a wise person that he move from the atom ad ministrationary script national security to bide ad inistrationwary prescript national security he's that the aplanatic conference is back in september and here he was bragging abouthow quiet that least was in september you may recall that noctobersom things happened ss now batch as labor to say that i has was quieter to day then in two decades and then here is any blink in the secretary state yesterday look first i the it is very important to note that this is an incredibly wall tall time the middaleast om i would argue that we have not seen the situation as this dangerous is the one were facing now across the region since at least nineteen seventy three and arguably y even not even before that oh well i mean what changed what magically changed now of course october seventh happened but the question is why doctor seventh happened and the answer is because you pursued a pro cranial policy from day on of this administration and in emboldened iron and made her on believe that they could push the united states around and its allies in the region without any sort of serious consequences and of course iron far has been right and when john hurry keeps putting out there all of these sort of week need responses two killing america iron is sitting there thinking ilk can we can get away with is ready much anything we want does therereally hurter if we kill a few of its proxy forces without dismantling the terror networks does her really hurter if we allow the red see to continue to be come a sort of pond on behalf of eonian military proxies what is out there we doing to burton at this point again dona's trump have them contain jobidon has not only in contained them his release them his unleashed the power of on a it is proxy's all over the at least look at a map look at a map iron is all over the dam place if you look at the middle eastern peninsula what you will see is iron at the south you will see iron in the east you will we on in the west that is a deliberate policy decision by the bi an administration to let iron out of the box yesterday john curly said do not work were to looking for a military solution with on not listen no one wants a war with iron but who really really does not wan worth iron iron i keep saying this but people pretend that it is not a reality in a war with thoron iron loses it might not be fun for the united states it will not be fun for the united states it might cost money but no one wants a worth iron in the united states but who wants a war even less in that matters because whenyou are trying to detour some one if you do not want to getngto fight with that ki over there and that cover there is crazy sometimes if he starts getting in your face you might have to punch him and if it turns out that you're stronger than he is he will stop punching you that is the entire policy of the turns you have to kill the guy of theintoi fullscale war but you do have to detour in order to detour to terrace is very simple is the credible threat of military force that is what to terrace is and when you keep saying over and over and over the do not have a credible threat the other side might think it might not have a credible threat here was on hurry natural security spokes person yesterday e the an e a we her e i i we are not looking worth iron a seeking an contact ma de regime tin a otaryway e and as i said in in the opening to nonet looking to escuage here this attack to we we can was excusatory make no mistake about and it requires you response make no mistake about that i will not get ahead the present i make not theater way water i iron in for we are not e can orbit drone none p to the present visions a about this we will make a decision when we make a decision about that now again no one wants worthoron forgone millions time there a few people who might be interested those people have been marginalized in theamerican public tabby no one is interested n a direct worthoron but if you are the white house why are you laying all your cards on the table what exactly is the purpose of that so john hurry was asked guys you have can a been i teasing iron for the past several years an ours are do not see at dis easement will ye know who does iron the tether son to we l win where the e or our w semen we can speak for themselves that we not the way we see this oh well ism sure you do not see that way but agendas the pentagon spokes person subbing sang was also asked if to turns had failed by database and done she did not have a good answer because to turns obviously has failed which is why they are dead america now in looking at this and and more broadly have you is the current policies failed then how all the president's respond being different this time well luck what we saw last night a we saw yesterday was a woeful action that impact at our service members and that something that a ways heavily on this building that was heavily on the secretary our thoughts and prayers are certainly with those service members and their families a but when you look at the wider region when you look at what is happening in the region we know tensions are his but the conflict that is happening between israel and gaze has been contained to gaze and we have tee multipolatacks a on our service members any rock and serial ah that have been largely unsuccessful miner our injurious minor damage and for structure but unfortunately yesterday we saw an an a legal action we actually we have had five dead america over the course of the past couple of welsh if two navy seals who are also lost as they attempted to defend a military shipment from iron to the soothes in daman s we actuallyave five dead america we have some america many america apparently with significant brain damage because r on in attacks when she says is been contained understand that it is not that this thing started in gaze and the spread out that its not what happened here what happened is that on had a well to ordinate plan in which hisbela would attack is real from the north commons would attack israel from the south the whooshes would attack the red sea baronial proffer forces in serial would attack america proxy forces in syria and arch en this all part of a bigger plan by iron to store up as much trouble as possible milling again

zero things yet a couples of camels in the ass in common you blew up a couple of empty buildings you gave twenty four hours warning for people to get out the waste non kill any of the terrors pirates and then you said do not lot oo you when you are do not o o ism sure the molls are freaking out over you saying do not all the time here as a compilation o various bin officials saying do not tor on and then they did he was the message torn do not it was very important to sent a very clearness anyone who mi seek a take advantage of the coffle can gas but to threaten our personal i hear anywheres the reagent do not do it what is your message to hesbolo an dish backer your on do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do not ism approximately two weeks ago here is jorbidin explaining do not avenge they know not to do anything do they we that is where d cause ism they are much that america there is that and this is what happens when you are weak and it why is combine rings a week and the answer is is joins afrasigan allusarelic that is why youbdnis week and r on knows it yesterday and a'lgizeraporter grilled the the spokes person for the white house about all this and said are you following the poles are you gest following the post now algizera is of course an outlet base it is a trachomas outlet algebra it is run by the canaries the canaries are very much in league with heron they play this sort of fake middle man position the canaries very often in which because they host terror groups in their country they act a sort of the stain ground for negotiations between those terror groups and terresponsers and western states when there is negotiations have to take place or most of the negotiations between say comas and the asrailies over the hostages ire taking place in car algizera is funded by costar and it is a a pro terror outlet is a procomas outlet algebra algebra is asking the widen administration are not you following the puls why the asking that because they understand that the media you must hie out in actual conspiracy the media do not the west they do not they think that the west is bad they think less is colonialist imperialist and they believe in the equity bel of the the equity structure that is been built up by the political left that suggests that lack of success in the world must be due to exploitation by the west in any case the media do have an intend their a agenda is shape america public opinion as to pressure guiding into giving into the bad guides all juror knows that which is my the pushing it to here is report for all zero pressing the white house this is a lection is the president looking at i pulling when hes lay o i tin is the president looking waning that is an ecumocis not loin mom m let me just stop yer commander chief is not looking at pulling or considering turn counter when he is depending or sonata now can i answer the question is not looking at political calculations pulling the elect too counter as he works to protect our troops a sure in our ships at see and any suggestion to the contrary is not ens a but he is well is clear he is that is the reason why wrong things he can get away with all this and who knows thirties members of the media will get to that in just one second first valentines say it is coming up very fast you have not got n o gift yet have you i know your plan you

oxime meanwhile why exactly a the media focussing in on the pulling numbers because this is the thing that they kin shapes the media our very anti israel their very untie america that they do not the presence of the west in the middle east because they somehow believe that the lack of success in the middle east is due to western intervention ism as supposed to the gigantic history of failure in the middle east but in any case you can see that the media there iran amazing clip that emerge couple of days ago there is a host from sky news who is interviewing a a spokes person for israel and compared the gaze strip to the to the holiest it is just this is the kind of craft at the media ore doing on a regular basis she colds for a voluntary migration of politicians from gas in the verbal cold the dance that dapatd in the will street final you suggested the ethnic cleansing of some galls as population to wat and you a that would extra a rates the the a i from tat on lot one idea is the

she literally just comparing the quit the the question of whether a palistinian who wants to leave the gossistrips is not to live the gossip tret once to live in egypt or bored in or somewhere else she compared that to news being shipped the a train to concentration camps this is the this is what these people are talking bat i mean this what the media are this is why there hoping that join is looking it pulse and unfortunately toy is in fact looking at the pulse particularly on his left which is what he is afraid of meanwhile again because the bodeministration has a central foreign policy fallacy which is that the israel palsinian issue is central to all middle eastern politics and it is a lie they continued but pressure on israel despite the fact that comes continues to deny every hostage deal offered to them according to the jerusalem post commas leader is malhonea is turning down an offer of a two month sense fire in which israel would release more palistinian terrorist in exchange for the innocent hostages they are being held by commas he turned to downbeats his israel has to stop the war whose anti sees fire now meanwhile the bid administration continues to foment support for the you and a duly way you an refuge g an works agency which again is a garbage of the relief an works agency is a garbage agency as been garbage for decades is run by compass a recent whalstry journal investigation found one thousand two hundred people out of the partible was total twelve thousand employes had direct long the embosser f pain an is lonely hod one tenth of them and way hire in that you those are people with direct length and the united states temporarily pause to aid to the inaudibly way because a compass front group because that is what it is but because the bi administration refuses to acknowledge the reality which the dealing an population in goa is incredibly radical that they they do support terrorism an ideological basis by the way palstinians in wetback by e every available pulling metric every single one there is no data to support the idea that there is a moderate painting in population that does not seek vast terror attacks on yes and the murder of many dues there is no dated a support that not i wish their wore it would make a lot easier but wish casting is not in fact a foreign policy and yet that is what the to demonstration continues to do john curly he is been tried out the by the by de ministration to defend the you on our be a in the face of this investigation the ours has ascended aid momentarily to the uganda relief agency on ora an grafter occur actions that members i the in an agent see were connected to hamate and in one case pretesipated in the october seven attack on israel what is the proper response if these allegations are verified and and what does that mean in terms that the humanitarian crisis and got as well as this has the mean agency administrating aid there the the found releasing works agency unrest its cut call cold clear they have been doing a lot of amazing work on the ground in got a literally helping my thousands of lives another taken the seriously o they they brought the information to us by the way they let us know that they had this report of but a dozen employs who were somehow involved then october severe taken this very very seriously they have called for an investigation and they have made it clear that there on to hold anybody appropriately accountable to include criminal prosecutions total whitewash total whitewash there from the bison white houseman appeasement of the bad guys leads to badguisting you advantage of you shocker shock or that that again is the story of the biding ad ministration meanwhile on the migration issue jobidon continues to be a disaster area the giant wave of emigration i legal migration has has that it crested unclear at this point she latest stats that we have from the southern border in remember which are just release recently three hundred seventy thousand there in seventy thousand bordering counters which means those people the don't call on border or rests because the vasccentrory to those people are not sent back to their home countries those people are let into the united states is they losing issue for hoiden by every available pulling metric jobidon is getting his but kicked in terms of pulling data on emigration it is a very damaging issue for him naturally leave its republicans to out tried to steal defeat from the draws of victory what is not useful what is not useful is the take our border back convoy to the border not a useful thing not useful thing the reason is not useful thing is because the state of texts has the sunder control the state of texts is using it is actual state power as it should to protect its citizenry the state of techs has not been ordered by the supreme quart to get rid of razor wire or not build any more racer wire we are notes put any more border wall in place the have not been order do any of that by the supreme court they are taking care of the issue what is going tore a problem is if anybody in that border convoy decides to get frisky with a federal officer guess what the media's on doe with that tune first rule politics to not get in the way of your opponent when youreoppon is making mistake very first roll politics just do not do it and that holds true of donate trump as well dona trump should simply stand aside and he should let job bison sizzle in the sun that that is what he should do here dona trump seems to be shading his message in a better ways yesterday who was put the failure of the border bill on me which is exactly what your bide wants to day he put out a statement that is much better and much more explanatory which i man i when a wiener i read a donate from statement on cant tell what he is writing in what he is not was done the sin to con have a sentences a structured he needs the let other people rite his truth social twits his one very good a border bill is not necessary to stop the millions o people many from jails mental institutions located all over the world that are pouring into our country it is an invasion the likes which no country's ever had to indoor it is not sustainable or affordable and will under crooked jobidon only get work i had the safest and most secure border in you es sister i did not need a bill they are using the terrific sennit bill is way of being able but the border dicast r round to the shoulders of the r publicans the democrats broke the border they should fix it no legislation is needed it is already there cay that happens to be true and dona trump saying is good don trump saying is good at guy's trumps got this grab bit is got this in texts border convoy to bring it do not it do not it it raised ha lot of risks that are absolutely unnecessary again when your when your political opponents are taking mistake alright were suppose to believe that even carol who was a gossip columnists to rote a lot about sacs in the nineteen nineties was raped by dona trump and as have pointed out before egg calls claims they do not bear even an a mild scrutiny she does not now what season it was when she was raped she cannot describe the physical lay out of the store she can been check the time line on whether she is telling the truth or not she cannot tell you hat day of the week she cannot telly anything about any of these things she just knows that she metdonal trump in a bergdorf and then he took her upstairs to a dressing room and proceeded to rape her this is what she said and jurors in new york decide decided that she was telling the truth which means that trump denying it and then calling her cortical crazy person was a was an act of defamation according to you essay to day jurors originally said that head not quote quote raped her because they were not convinced that true penetrated her with his to with his member but they were convinced that he sexually abused her again she had claim more than that egg carol claimed that he actively raped her with his member the jury found that donate trump had used his digits but not his member that is what the jury actually found base on what i you no the that demo make any sense as a jury heroic get mind sense you have a witness who claims she was raped then she describes in detail the rape including what was used rape her and the jury says none no i we do not believe you unlike this apple we believe you on this half if no details on li we where it happened when t have any that cons a but we believe that he did not rape you but e kind of kind of raped you he actually assaulted you'll be in rapid is a bazargery verdict basically new york jury that hatestonnels from finding that the hate dona trump dona trump then ripped on the verdict and he said that he did not believe it and he thought that she is liar in a crazy person all thereat of the she suit him again for defamation and this time sheen at e three million dollar judgment now the thing about en carrell as we have discussed before on the program is that she is not a good witness she is not a reliable witness in her own cause here is a club from a twenty nineteen interview with send and i superduperweird it just weird you do not feel a victim i was not throwing on a ground a lathis whit the word rape carry many factual connotation this was not this was not sexual per i just it it hurt it just wat in just i think rob field think rain as men it is a violent assault tit is not i think o think will think of rapes thing fixing wit sixshel brink at the fantasies u a start off wit that now the judge by the way in trumps defamation case refuse to allow the admission of that tape into evidence why because that might actually win trump the case he cannot allow that yo can all out the accuser being a weirdo strange person to to come up here none this case makes ayes an yesterday en carrell appears the rather major and rather major asks her what she is going do with all this money that she's now taken from dona trump and she presumably expects her to say some stuff about how she is going to use the money in order to stand up for women in how she is going to fight rape everywhere in the sexual soul culture and all this and instead begin carrell being a complete weirdo and a incredible witness says that n you can see rather major wanting to jump over the desk and duck tap her mouth i meant it is wild here we go you have talked about using some of trumps money that you are about to get i to help show up woman's its do what that might be what that might look la rather yes i had a t saturate idea for all the good ism going to do i this money first thing rather you and i go shopping gin to lie cargo that nests lover din wo row knew not hi on for body rather what penthouse a e know rather pious an france you wan france you were to go thinking in france no hat's jo alas jo meting in france could is something for woman's rights i would take tout is fa t i got late i my we carry o mouths watch as if as if you ne per a oh oh my goodness that is some awkward laughter that is me really awkward laughter and that is the person who are supposed to believe was rape by dona trump did not fix about it is not doing is tripersonal gain he is doing this because she just up sat with what happened to her led should my thirty years ago that swart supposed to believe we are supposed to believe that she dot do this for money when she literally swan rather adown see she direct she little one rather mat out and she said what she is going to use the money for is not mean she was lying maybe she was not lying although again i have varied significant how's base on her lack of any sort of supporting evidence that i can find anywhere that would support her story but that clip is insane tracheal matzot is feeding her the biggest of on the world which is how are toucan help women in she is in a going a shopping trip shopping spree you ain't going shopping though the rather n reaches all my god get me the get me out of you are right now tracheal matters i i if if it

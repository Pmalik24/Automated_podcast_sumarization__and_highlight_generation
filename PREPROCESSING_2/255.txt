a quick warning there are curse words that are beeped today's episode of the so if you prefer a beep version you can find that at our website this america life door from w b easy chico it is this america life ism show call in for glass the first punch landed on sort of the lower back right side of my skull behind my ear that was the one that knocked me down this was a couple summers ago it'd been walking down the sort of abandoned industrial block in my neighborhood in brooking it was after midnight there was a big group of kids tea angers boys maybe nine or ten of them coming the other way i was on the sidewalk they were walking in the middle of the street where the cars got also was on the phone with my friend say talking to him with my ear buds in i just kept walking in talking glancing over at the kids a couple times and then i saw them see me and they sort of stopped and said something to each other and then a few of them casually i would not notice started walking in my direction i do not know if taking off in a sprint was the best decision or if you could even call it a decision a couple of the kids said yet there are a few things i remember about the next thirty seconds or and a few things i done i remember looking down at my shoes and thinking why cannot i run any faster than this say said what is happening i said ism being chase who is chasing you he said they are chasing me i apparently said which i do not remember i do not remember how i got off the ground after the first punch i just know that a second later i was running again and still getting punched in the head being punched in the head while running becomes with scannable remarkably quickly after the second head my skull was if this is all that is going to happen you can manage one kid way in the back there near me yelled give me your wallet but laughing it was a joke they never tried to take anything the easily could have have tried to come up with something to compare the experience of it too but have never felt anything else that intensely have never felt as good in my life as how bad that was i rounded the corner and saw a semi try coming as the only moving vehicle around i ran toward it with my arms straight up over my head and when i looked back the kids had managed gauge just they would never been there in the first place i slowed to a walk which is when i noticed my barbuda were neatly spooled around my left angle id done it on purpose one of them was smashed and when i lifted the other one up toward my face o oi oo o o me say was still on the phone t o y you o i t o i o o o a a at er this recording is the whole reason ism telling you about those when he realized that something was wrong say had taken the phone away from his ear and opened up this recording a in case i needed some kind of evidence or something later he is extreme my organized that way and ism really glad he did it for one thing i have this bizarrely candid portrait of myself now in the moment exactly after one of the worst things that is ever happened in my yell it took a while for me to my to listen to it i and you to to g ism used to hearing my voice recorded and controlling the way i sound the way ism talking to you right now but this was some unbidden child creature bubbling up from my throat when i listen to it is have finally taken some mask off and i did not know i was wearing in ti cut pitting on the head an that i ell in a i are mi up up o bi but i i o a titi it isn't get anything we the i ti a her can o a very ye fuck cry carry but your i yo could know i mine i a pay ye a an we brow over in i mi exactly in i and this is another thing this kind of incantation i keep repeating when and fine am fine instead of telling say what did happen i spend most of the call focussing on how bad it could have been on the word it is ism clinging to a body in the ocean after a ship ran i could have been lot word he i could have been a lot word a to my wat o we but i mean i mi mine i a pay i o a u e could have been away for only mine a e an i never say things could be worse almost every other time in my life has been better than this one and yet most of the time i just bored about what is going wrong or what i wish it'd done differently but here i was clearly just paving over all the broken glass of what happen to me immediately counting my blessings and a way ism never usually able to and of course it could have been way worse truly catastrophic things happen to people all over the world every day i remember talking o say for forty five minutes it was actually about twelve minutes which i could not believe s where's the rest of it by minute six six minutes after the attack we are already starting to laugh about stuff i told hem that i had been heading down to my car to get a pack of cigarettes he says you while i guess lo killing it is good to know we were able to talk about it that quickly it makes a lot of bad things seem more survivable we spend much time trying to control how were seen by other people but sometimes we can catch an unexpected glimpse of ourselves that we have not mana cured and that has anymore information in it about how we actually are mi not be the funnest thing to witness but at least we know and to day show we got two stories in which that happens two different people seeing themselves in the wild and what it confirms or does not bout who they think they are stay with us he o i to away ye on e n act one you do not have to be a star to be in my show i want to tell youabout my friend mac's first big break zap mac dermal we are pretty different people acts from which o ta and he has this kind of macho cousin self certainty about him on the surface i do an impression of him that i finally broke out when we were hanging with each other a couple of months ago ism ism a writer i i in able to get gusted up for yo i was not expecting you a bit to looking a fire lark e git pretty good the flutters be agreed you why i you do not think you do impressions of people less you kind of really them or do not them at all or if be super not height and i feel you more supervise me i superbly you zap is this singular combination of things i really have not encountered before as well as being swagger he can also be awkward and vulnerable he is conspicuously caring for the people he care about after myself he made me promise it'd call him in the middle of the night if i needed to hes seen about seven years working as a public tofemder for the legalize society's new york sometimes juggling more than sixty cases righteously indigent about the court system he is always giving advice but he also needs to be reassured lot and he really likes other people's attention he is always watching himself in ways both literal and not which anyway brings me to the story of the big brakes see about ten years ago when he was still a public defender zap was also trying to make it as a comedian grinding away sometimes doing four or five open mikes a night his a was pretty in tense back then he had a hawk and frank zap o moustache and dispatch one time he came out on stage just shouting lyric from the rapper which he make i usually record his set just with the little video camera or one and he also had this friend who was always egging him on sort of ripping him in a way zap always refers to him just as the producer he does not want me to say who the gay is but he is famous adjacent ran with a really heavy crowd and apparently he had big dreams for mac's future it was oh yet no worry i know nova do not worry i know you be found do not worry i know that easy yet needn't all these people with him and him telling you you are my broad men ism put in everything behind you n going to futon my money behind you an going to futon my connect bind you your you are next trust me when i push the button it is going to go fast they worked on a pilot for a levy show together held a casting call for the roll of mac's roll friend collected headsets did screen tests the whole thing and then in the fall of two thousand nine zap found himself walking out of his apartment building and on to the set of a levy pilot in which he was the star everything just looked perfect a coat commercial it was a gorgeous day fall day new york sonny there was a realistic amount of people on the street but not many that the scene is going to look rushhour cause it was not it was the middle of the day should look the middle of the day and every one as also just a little too attractive actors everyone i do not have radio of this because it was never actually recorded because it was not a levy pilot those people on the street were not actors this was not mac's first big break in to show business it was his first big chaotic break the part of his brain that wanted to be in the spotlight all the time had suddenly exploded zap was experiencing a type of delusion that we talked about a little bit on the show before it is called the human show delusion not incredibly common but not as rare as you might think either zaffer is of present show delusion basically think there being filmed all the time by hidden cameras just the him carry character in the woke the train show in the weeks leading up to the break zap had been showing signs of this on coming split with reality little hardeners and bigger ones he would been growing more and more manna sleeping less and less i had some friends in family start to be concerned about me and i kind it has brush it all off you do not understand what is going on my brand you do not understand r i come you do not stand out to do come you do not understand u you comedy after your lawyer all that you do not understand out to wrist a joke look its a mathematical clachan let me show you this is a premise this why this is funny this why that is not funny a that is your inner monolog you do not understand and out of monolog even the producer was concerned told zap he had to go see a doctor if they are when to keep working together and yet when zap walked out of his apartment building on to the street that day he was sure the producer had staged everything just for him in zap was ready to perform thinking of himself as some high brad of ally g and johnny knock will ism thinking my friend the brilliant producer had the did end what mac's not really an actor he is not going to know how to act ism just going a throw hi men somewhere he will eventually get what he supposed to be doing and heels his kind of basely method act himself he could probably do that i go to toffkan square park soon as ism in there ah i spit generic old man on park bench that's what it would say if if he was in the credits yes and he had a bike ah and he was too old to have a bike another tell at the entire neighborhood had been cordoned off to showcase mac's cosmetic talent zap thought it would be funny if he grabbed generic old man's pike and did a couple laps around the park with it generic old man did not take kindly to zap trying to grab his bite away zap relented was surely assigned from the producer keep thanks moving a zap takes off in a spring toward the middle of the park and falls over the wall of this big doggy playpen i get down on all fours myself on my gal with the pact running toward the end of the fence i jump out the other side and mi are cool whatever that was worth i i did it now money maybe yet hat was money maybe you knows and i also was thinking that the pedestrians were extras doubling is production assistance and ism posed to follow them follow the foot traffic that will take you where you need to go yo anyone's coming up to me with a clipboard an a shot sister anything so there then phoning ahead to the producer whatever production young saying get he is on first avenue is almost to house and a you known ski will make him go make him go west then whenever zap tells this story he has a whole menu of deranged things he did that day to talk about ours running around a socrafield with his short s pulled down while the game is going on ordering champagne on a hotel patio and proceeding to yell at the camera in the trees as zap remembers it and mac's memory is all we have to go on this tell vision noonday new lasted for about ten hours a ten hour narcasisan variety show arranged for him to give the performance of his lives i i sprinted across the intersection of then he was hasten and first avenue ah was cars were maxi o yet that is in credibly dangerous not if its professional drivers on a closed course at its height everything he did was the right thing to be doing he was a master of improvisation following all the cues perfectly and then he started getting tired and then exhausted everything was still a clue but he was not sure what any of it meant any more somewhere along the way he lost his shirt and also his sheers and the next thing he knew he was standing on a brooklet subway platform hands behind his head a captured soldier crying hard he flushed his contacts out of his lives all he wanted was for some one to yell cut thinking to himself coke find you have got your shots cannot you see the ism bawling cannot you see that ism here suffering cannot you see that ism done come out come out wherever you are mister producer ism crying and i just scream wick what you walk from me two cops come up there uniforms look real surreal the next thing i recall with any clarity is being in the back of an ambulance ah and eventually i hear radio crack on it like sh and take a vabableet be you sync wart zap was eventually signs with by polar disordered type one which can invalpsycosis sometimes in mac's case lack of sleep and daily pot smoking might have trigger the episode at bel l view he says they dosed him up with anticycotics at times he could barely lift his chino of his chest he duelled lot he could not go outside mac's only experience with psych wards before this was as a public defender representing e de peas or emotionally disturbed people and now he was one the delusion that he was on t v lasted in one form er another for the next ten days he saw his mother windy coming down the hall on a too he was not sure at first if it was her or an actor an prosthetics he calls her bird because the way she snaps her head back and forth sometimes the bird is here she told him the bird camp be here he said bird lives in witching she said the bird got on a plain it took more than a year and a couple more episodes this before he got stable along the way he figured out a few things had to be good about taking his gets and sleep was key he could not burn the candle at all ends he had been going on stage all the times he stopped for the most part hated working his drop as a lawyer they say you have to be at least a little crazy to be a comedian but it is also possible to be crazy that you cannot be a comedian zap has told the story of this psychotic break countless times at this point it is a good romp and he is got it down all the different parts tells it entertainingly but while it is one thing to recount something that for memory it is another thing if some one catches it on visit you can actually see yourself in psychoses i say this because after zap got better and thought he was totally out of the woods sanity was he did have another psychotic break and it was captured on visit and for the first time in his life can zap would be able to see himself in the midst of rumen show delusion into thesiram an a stop that and explained what happened after a while zap quit layering and decided to try to make it as a writer he wrote a book about that first psychotic break and his disorder called gorilla and the bird gorilla is scenic name cause he is really harry in barrel chested gan the bird is his mom e adaption for a ten series before it even came out h be is planning to run it the director john mark valet who did big little lies on sharp objects is on pure a an i have had entire conversations about who might play him on the teashop about the time he thought he was on a teach and was not in zap his therapist said to him sort of joking but sort of not you might end up playing yourself on that so to which zap basically responded yet think they might want to go with one of these less celebrities their considering and then zap was trying to figure out ways to promote his book and of course these days a lot of authors make victims when their books come out and zap hired a production crew to shoot footage for he was not sure what a promotional visit but if it was any good may be they would do a bigger documemory feu wanted to take them back home with him to witchitot to interview some of the people that he would written about in his memoir meaning his family have the crew follow him around his home town for a wee just rolling on everything documentary style the crew consisted of two professional cameramen and a very season t v producer that zap happen o be friends went he would been around cameras a munch before this by the way and did not trigger his disorder the morning the delusion really hit zap had not met up with the film crew yet they were actually wondering where he was he was posed to call instead he was driving around whitchito by himself in his grandfather's pickup he was fighting serious back pain and he had barely slept in three days again she haplessness is a huge trigger for his episodes an the book he writes the solution to mania is simple yet hard to come by just sleep and the thing his therapist said came back to him that john mark valet might want him to play himself on the try so i came to believe that oh my god maybe my therapist was contacted by whoever it maybe i really i addition in for myself right now i i am conditioning to play the role of my self ism in the process of an addition yes and i was his testing hat slowly because was i be careful you have had this delusion before and you have been wrong and not only that i know how the world works a little bit e i know each be is not just yet let him play himself a great idea i no but s i do not know you director's kind of crazy i he takes a lot of risks and sitting in the truck he started to have the feeling that in addition to the people he knew would be filming him later that day there were also other cameras that he could not see and maybe oudiorecorders too possibly right there in the truck with him i was listening to a song and his truck and i was kind of dance a little bit notes at this is kind of funny and it's maybe ore not being taper now i that is quite possible that makes gets was i but maybe you are maybe just give them a little some in to thank about leave them with something o a he is he is bottle something that he is grand he need's a training but we got something we can possibly work with you once again the powers that bee had spotted mac's late in talent and sett it up he could just do his thing in the wild wow the crowd wo two much of it you if we must hit is what's the video this gunned hurt really i think ho to we i think ism in a feel bed for the ottoman watch who is me to of video it starts with the production crew in their car without zap it is just one cameraman and mac's levy producer friend jay there heading to a talk shop to me zap they pull up to a standalone building surrounded by a big parking lie and they arrive at the same time as mac's family friend rob and olderguy with a white beard and a pinball cap e cameraman's walking around the side of the ta o place and there you are n a man ye basin a spider man crouch with his hands on the ground staring down is wearing in a dentist teacher and sweat pan no glasses he dropped them somewhere which means he cannot see anything hes clearly in a lot of physical pain it is his back in it spamming ism on my hands in need now ism trying to stand up i cannot be designs are asking a furor gay my friend day saying here o gays o gay it was not one hundred per cent clear what was going on with zap that tint and jane the others were trying to help him to get him into a car he could get back to his hotel and sleep tut they also kept filming because that was the entire gold of the weep and they thought zap might want this footage this is exactly what his book was about and here it was happening zap meanwhile was now pretty convinced he was auditioning to play the roll of himself on the levy show that again he is actually being produced about the ti i he thought he was on a tiny so some blurry calculus told him that his producer friend jay and john mark valet must be in communication somehow in the video sacs on his knees swaying back and forth in front of the taco stand he closes his eyes then opens them and looks toward the camera the one that is not there and ism saying too much too much it was freely to see my friend this it seem people in the park were on the subway acting zap was that day they are just literally lost and do not know it but it it is the right beside you on the sidewalk and also in a forest that they cannot be guided out of not easily but in this case zap was sitting next to me watching with me and he remembers everything that was going through his head at that moment i came to believe that through some combination of john mark and my friend hear we producer that we had may be a yoga instructor who was watching my movements and could tell by the way i was moving how much pain i was in and where i was and pain oh how i i think i thought there even shocking my spine somehow this back spasms he thought they were electrical shocks being triggered by this magical imaginary yoga instructor he moves in and out of different yogoposes on the ground and i think it there thinking that if we shocked him this way he would not my move his body to correct his posture that well love his pain but it can also point him toward whatever camera was capturing the particular footage though was going to be sent to john mark valet the real director of the real series grill in the bird o i see it was both to help you and also for production value right and when not you see me waving my hand and waving them off at means ism not good a now i do not really want to be shot but you are not saying stop filming too the person who filming this no you are saying that too the larger production the that does not exist which when you think about it takes a certain type of genius because mac's original delusion that he was being followed around by cameras had come true his brain had to come up with a second level illusion that again involved real people the way he explained it to me it is not he forgets reality ore hallucinates at the camera's really the dragon or something he is able to take in all the data in front of him it is just that he comes to the wrong conclusions about it o you the at that finally zap makes it to his feet and then walks off to the middle of the parking on sticks his hand in the air and again says to much too much too much wait too much and then he is back down on his knees and finally on his back lying in the parking lot as cars passim zap was right about what he said before that it was going a hurt to watch this i think ism find of just who i think ism just bracing myself for it the whole time and m kind of rumen for the guy and feeling bad for him in put oh please stop oh please stop but in the same way i would feel bad for some one i saw on the street was yelling at pigeon skin or whatever the differences i know that guy a little better the guy that we saw in he video little vetted i do illfinally they managed to get zap back to his hotel an this is when we learn about a whole other side of psychotic zap when that is even harder for saying zap to watch bobstay behind and the cast is now ja the tiny producer friend and now two cameramen trover and taler the wen got all of lilacs stuff from his mom's house where he would been staying earlier his medication in his clothes in everything and they roll up hi mac's hotel room door with one of those standard issue luggage carts sacs in the room talking to his mom on speaker found jam one is to get an out of an into zap to put him to sleep they also keep shooting he opens the door and they are two hammers pointing at him o i oh o is her an ere inn sun glasses and a towel i ta is cone west has answered the door here zap was about to take a shower and he needed to see the sun glasses or prescription j had his regular minders i i i i me just o yer i t a ism and of hammered it up there let me go here anon let you turn that corner an you doing a voice i copalite will last is o its i i of mac's pretty disobedience at at this point his mom the bird chimes in on speaker from sometimes trying to talk him down and even those sacs discombobulated about almost everything he still thinks he is playing a roll even if that roll is himself the blinking red light in his head is still on all the while ja is being really carrying toward him i i o wo shock i let easy an figuratively i of splay o o ja was about to say something by all of this display of generosity and carrying s but of course zap means he was being shocked by a magical yoga instructor and his also amazed at all f the planting that went into the arisen a us i o n o i a i did you say let us quit acting i can cocoanut oil my hand whit is i get if you think you are acting an some one storming you in you are acting cocoanut oil not ask now are you are literally cocoanut oiling your es yes i thought i thought there was a euphemism no i do ja were my to glass is gain i i oar on orders li a re ask hole and take it off take it off speaker ism kind of be in an over a beet here it is true with the cocoanut oil zap comes out of the bat from at one point with the jar and asks if some one can put some on its back re this is probably the clingiest moment of the whole visit for back to watch mostly because each in the visit does not have any problem bossing i e one around trover puts his hammer down and complies just ten a little s yes wat ere yer do not don't rob it o her then o is is all right which is moisturize a i o o n a no o a no s i i got to on ye lar e o i can hear you no i just i o just oilman o i say ism i tats at i stop not foin you weeks tops tot now my good you are not putting coconut oil on my back right ye us to us now is doing hit not li a us lie a bolas i i i but us rolishon that is really being to watch its just ism been such a big tit to everybody well your yer in o florid i cost a up is it that is true but ism still not been nice and no one then knows me all that well i mean ja knows me best at this point here but this is the first he is seen me be in any sort of bad mental this and he is got kids at om hos got a new born and he e he took time out of his scandal to come to this to free and h is taking care of me he is baby said a new kind ye and he is hiding his exasperation while he deals with me but then you can see when he is looking at the camera i will not call it irony buts is the guys obviously frustrated being pushed to the limits of his fashions he is doing everything perfect here i it is amazing what he is doing and when i see that video it makes me want o call we my friend in the it y do not say hay man ism sorry i spoke to you that and ism sorry that i brought that stress into your life but then on the other side of my mouth it'll preach to the general public are not your fault when he does speaking events at book stores and other places talking about his disorder he says people shouldn't be ashamed of their own mental aimless and their behavior during episodes this one his mantra is always this happens and it is hokey because i do believe this happens and it is o ka as relates to everyone else but when i see have can do myself an that is not o say man you got a get your said together a the adman starting to take a fact act's getting drowsy he has to fly back to allay the next day that it is not clear y understands that the bird in sbekerpound has been steadily beating an around trying to coax him away from the carats the real ones and the imaginary ones and just get him to go to bed sleep of course is the opposite of performing r i e y you it looks his getting ready to go to sleep he hangs up with his mam but then after everyone leaves he calls her back says to work what the hell just happened she says what do you think happened he says ism take gillinhall no she says there is going to be a levy shoe made out of your book but you are back you are not messing with me he says nothing happened just now nothing she says you need to sleep your manic ism just crush that that just happened o me i in this moment ism cent of realizing that my mind has betrayed me again yet and ism just feel talking stupid and embarrassed i i mean this is this is humiliating and it cassis chaos falter no fault it is i i wish it was easier to be my friend i wish i took up less space and the people that love meet wives i watch the i i a several more times on my own and i realize that maybe there is this one other thing that is unsettling for fact when he sees the scene in the hotel rim zap told me he does not one o be yon levy any more he used to but it is clear his delusion still does the back in the h all tell room still has this naked unfettered ambition of wanting to perform wanting all the cameras on him it is almost a little kids dream of start up the tell around his waist could just as easily be tied around his neck superhero stile and the zap watching the video is bashful about that in a way that the zap in the visit is not i and thing to ask him about this when we were watching it together i called him later and set it on the phone ya i o y o o it homo why i hawk re now heal in my normal bi ay i make it r you me ordo a yet you an mi it you on no you you would not o anybody we a your own a a you want a e our performer y er cabo my a what the the e big but it is sort of same zap set the stage for delusional zap to get what he wants to be the star and now that there is visit of it same zap has to confront what that show actually looks the zap then and he is not a fan the full title of mac's book is gorilla and the bird a memoir of madness an a mother's love i could talk about how great an hilarious an important i think it is but have already annoyed a lot of people doing that see for yourself coming ut that one mistake that wants you you just cant get over it and then you watch the samesgrow up happen all over again four decades later that is in a minute from chico public radio when our programmed continues it is this america life ism show call in for i were glass to days show seeing yourself in the wild stories of people who get too get to reluctantly decide to come face to face with an needed version of who they are and what they do with that information and i am now delighted to bring you it two of our show at too distant replay the stories about a man who is been reliving this one moment from his life over and over again he remembers every last detail of how it felt how it changed his life and then forty years later some one shows up with a recording of that thing e manual berry explains the man is my at and the thing he can not let go of is a high school baseball game from nineteen seventy eight i found out about the game when i was a kid my mom had save this old newspaper clipping or maybe it was a year buck but either way there is this picture of my dad on a baskabalt court and when i brought it to her she told me not to ask my dad about it and i never brought it up but it bugged me because baseball is the one thing my dad a i share of my for siblings ism the only one who fell for the game my dad i loved being on the court the sound of squeaking shoes creaking floors the way the envious space of the him would vibrate the way my body would twist and turn i pilot to the basket i loved baseball but i also loved the attention my dad gave me because of it in the carter games we would annoy hell out of the rest tor my family by dissecting my every move fingering out what i could improve on what i did well it was we were speaking our own language together we laid out big dreams for my future club teams high school star college the w en b a the when i got to high school i cared less about the game i post game talk stopped feeling conversations and started sounding lectures i started to dread the carbide's home and there is one ride for my junior year of high school that i still think about all the time as walking to my dad's car after the game and as soon as i closed the door it started why did not you do this you need to do this how could you do this as i listened to the study norther of my dad's critique i realize these lectures were about me or what i wanted they were about him i did something i had never done before shut the fuck up i shouted he was taken aback for a moment and then stony silence waiting for an apology but it was an apology i would not give i told him that i did not want to talk about basketball with him any more if that is all he want talk about we did not need to talk we did not for over a year we barely spoke to each other ta lot of time has passed iavee'n picked up a ball for ever either has my dad the silence has long gone but there is something that has not been repaired nowadays we just exchange baseball pleasantries did you watch that game how does a team look this year we born we born we born baskewll gives us the illusion that we know each other but ism not sure we do and have been wanting to know my dad better to talk to him about something real something that matters to hin that high school basketball game from nineteen seventy eight seems a good place to start i visited my parents in much again and when i walk into the living room of course is a college basketball game on in the background my dads in his usual position sunken into his refiner even sitting down he still big long arms his hands make the remote look teeny i ask him to talk upstairs o you here very result wat who o he we ism nervous my dad is intimidating we cloud chat for a long time before i bring up the game and that old food my mam had kept and i member her saying that it was sad and that i should not mention it an that picture was us the time a game when we lost om is my him i la my shelf for losing ma game why there is a lot in that side my dad get at poor in mississippi the youngest of eleven and for him basketball was away to college but in the ninth grade he suffered a serious knee injury his knee would swell when he ran he had to stop playing but he got an unlikely second chance before his senior year of high school his family moved to much again there a surgeon found bone cards under my dad's knee cap he removed them and the swelling stopped my dad could play basketball again that dream to get a basketwalskolarship to go to college was back on my dad joined his high school baseball tame hey were called the evert findings and they were good they would won the state championship the previous year the star of that team was a sky named even but most people to call a magic johns even in high school they call him that the coach as thrilled when my dad joined because he was tall and the team had lost magic johns and all of their height as the season progressed my dad flourish he was a strong rebounded he could dunk even got a nickname they wanted to treat i for dot o make full me i make manfully they already had wont for even i ere buy know to shot make mane even magic johns one of hi sportscaster for atishoo mi sip turn a game you i doctor on he said missy hippy slammer that is when he gat to name a missing slammer his team was cruising through the season to the state play offs which brings us to the game i was never supposed to ask about it was a mummy finals the team was pop to where suits to the game but my dad did not have one i had to get one at the last minute he missed the neurally and he got to the him late my dad remembers going to the locked room the starting line ups being announced and when the game started he says he just felt off he remembers is one play in particular where he says everything fell apart i serve see you off to bag wort about the rail and i go up about the man to where basically it'll i had to do to strip ball in a bask it its stay at through it across to be and now well forget it as just it was hard on me because i was a turn in point in a game that it may he seel that i lost a game how long do you think you carried around that one little moment it still carried r lavishly upset up ait what do you think would make you not carry it around with you i don i cannot go but in time and we do it they lost the game by just a few points did it feel opportunities for closing for you worth that game yes it we have at a play better we would one a game we would a been in a finest and the would a been more did is on us and ut thing was is at ill was only opt there for one yer because a came up here in my seeing a year no bet really knew who i was for me to get the more exposure we need to coaching it to on an won we didn't wan at thing its just lot at opportunities for me to be seen when to to endow i have a lot of its tit an about they opportunity that i feel that it could a change my and some way we are now when my dad says where we are now he means no college degree a career managing restaurants raising five kids and making ends me where we are now is missing part of a lung and slipped us where we are now is no kidneys and dialysis while still working sixty our weeks it is been over forty years since he miss that shot maybe that is how long it takes to mourn in alternative universe that pardon me also wonders is not that long enough to let it go to see that it is just a game that where we are now is also forty years of marriage and kids he went to college when even to male not me and it is not my dad hates his job have never thought of our life is anything other than a good one i got it in my head that if he could watch the game he would see things differently maybe he did not play badly maybe he is just being hard on himself and i wanted to see it have never seen him play i looked for the tape everywhere his high school teeny stations the michigan high school lentic association and then a few meets later my dad reconnected with one of his high school teammates and he said i have a copy of the game and not only that but he in the other guises on the team had a different take of how my dad plate they said they remembered him playing great that he is a reason that even stayed in the game he gave the tape to my dad my do tried to watch at once but did not get too far a few weeks ago we sat down in the living room to watch the game together i ready i think yon think are you worry see now news why it want nervous about watch in myself foreseers yo go play assume we busting knows moment but my tea make said that i play very a bear or beast whatever oh will to see that partan a bid yo firs is what i perceive that i did that play very well from mat respective will i to see that person the beast the beast the mississippi slammer now i take anything here you go a grainy black in white court comes into cocks player is some towards the basket and lay a blinds lots of them have from an yet watch wanted me am not yet well it is all over the place then i see him it is his body language my little brothers that it gives him away missus masshoning is that yer yes as me he is sporting a white derby and teeny tight white shorts that are very shy of his knees teapsocks and high top sneakers the shoes make me cringe ankles support apparently was not a thing and he is ways skinnier than have ever known him it is team all hungry i coundme wits you were under eighty a an is you it the teams line up at the big ass at half court for the jump ball my dad loses the jump he other team picks the but on the court fires off a quick jumper that bounces off the rim my dad'steam takes the ball down and throws up a shot and also misses my dad grass the rebound bobby berry that is my dad the funny thing is that as he watches he seems to forget that he knows how the game ends and he is watching it any other game on the come of my dad's teams scores the first two baskets it is for nothing but the lea does not seem to matter to him he is already down on himself what do you saying right now me standing yet no what do you mean i i do not go to the ball i gold wat from a ball watch to ball come to this now watch were a go its asadenable i start to say things it is just started it is all that bad and pointing out every good thing he does look he just got an off and to rebound and ism busy talking i almost miss the play that is haunted my at he goes thaayet a was the shot you ant no you stall the best not always suited me wants us enough the play is over quick it is just the second on the screen and the thing is after that shot his tea mate rebounds the ball and puts it in in other words the miss it did not matter they still score but it did matter to my dad he never really recovers and for the rest of the game he miss e shot after shot tough it is not all bad he makes the monster block on the next play though watching he barely seems to notice next play down he is fall on the shot he gets too free dress yen re do that's when me you made h your three tho ism mad mister shot to to feet away i keep trying to get him to see what his teammate saw he well you gets ere up by quite a bit a know that is ta point we tell at had time it is twenty two twenty one my dad steam is up by one but by the second half it is as if my dad remembers what he is watching and how it ends no more yelling he just sort of sits hand over mouth quiet and this is where i start to think wait it seem mad at me i start to worry that this was a terrible idea this is not in o make him feel better rather than think about one mistake in a game from forty years ago he can now watch forty minutes of mistakes oath game remains class and i con see what his the mates are saying about him being a beast he is pulling down lots of see bounds he is the reason there stop in the game but he is not scoring much then in the forth quarter their opponent pulls ahead by just a few an my dad seem cannot catch up it is over the came shows one final moment of my dad it seems in on him before he heads into the workroom he leans down wrapping his arms around his coach consoling him my father at the kitchen table has far less compassion for himself how are you feeling you to rest but i cannot do anything about it is u said is a sad to see that game over again miss for sure and i did not still i feel the same way i felt then i did not play very well the way i felt that i should my dad finally got to see how this moment actually looked from the outside and it did not change anything for him you cannot imagine that things were different the tapes proves the way i felt that i play is what the take show when we were watching i worried that it'd upset my dad i had what you reopen in a was me yes why making me watch is game of it make you that upset ism not ahead it is reopens it and we making me visit it is notes she i teeth my hope was that by watching it it would make you feel better you could let go of it o on the way i proper can never let go oat t is go back in a time and reversarything is that not your letter would take i think that is rather what it would take i think it it makes me upset that you feel upset or that you feel depressed about this cause it just i knows just a gan it just as to as other just a game it is just that it long ago and that oh yet i me it is that in my life i am very ism very bless in happy ma well that is it though that is exactly it just feels this is such an insignificant thing to all of the great shit that you have going on in your life each to language say my dad did point out one positive thing in the visit that i could not have noticed what i sit in my coach when you sat on says hat were you sorry for those in a gave no i go i dirt have an ever told me bat what i sit in my coach what did he say back now you play run at this point we have been talking for close to an hour and i realize what ism doing isn't working ism been keeping things positive p and to make my dad see something else sugar coating it and you know what i hate i hate when people sugar coat things the truth was he was right he did not play well that dunk he really did pass the ball over the ram instead of just dropping it in after that he only scored three points he played exactly the way he told me not to play for most of my basketball career ha you around theabasketd hands down he mist easy put backs he did re bound well but without him is an that off ansivly to teem suffered i think he is absolutely rights if he would played better they would have won maybe what he needed was not to see himself differently what he needed was for someone to see him just the way he is i mean to be frank it was not a great came for you wat n got was a ward but i wanted you to so see your self a bassoon i think i was hoping that it would be different then you imagined i would you think cause i always imagine that i played lick shit do not tat ta you see we chatted a little longer i at looking drained i think a little sad it was late in the rafters were about to play the box i left my dad to watch his game i spent the evening pretending to read but really i was worried about what i just did the next morning my dad told me he had something he wanted to say i actually felt the sin really rat her watching a game would you i do not think i would watch it she sure did not true that wit some one that you cure and for them to si there and watching to be truly ones yo sit u but you ship i she is my language but those things are important and that is what i wanted to talked to my dad about the important things and sounds i started this conversation we have been doing that more and more we talked about his childhood and mississippi bout his

one thing have consistently emphasize on this podcast is the incredible roll that light can have on our biology of course ism always telling people that they should get sunlight in their eyes as soon as possible after waking on as many days of their life as possible forsake of setting circling rhythm daytime moodfocus an alertness and improve sleep now in addition to sunlight red light and nerinfred light has been shown to have passive effects on improving numerous aspects of cellar and organ health including faster muscle recovery improved skin health and wound healing even improvements in acne or that is removal of acne reducing pan an inflammation improving myth conjugal function and even improving vision itself what set juveapart and why it is my preferred red light there device is that it has clinically proven ravelings meaning it uses specific wavelengths of red light and term free like combination that trigger the optimal cellar adaptations personally i use the hand held jive every day the hansel jumps about the size of a thick piece of toast and i also own a jive panel that allows for full body exposure and i use that one a proximately five times per

a much better way to make coffee i first learned about aeropress well over ten years ago and have been using one ever since aero press was developed by allay adder who was an engineer at stamford and i knew of allay because he had also built the called a rob frisky he was sort of famous in our community for developing these different feats of engineering that turned into commercial products now i love coffee ism somebody that drinks coffee nearly every day usually about ninety to a hundred d twenty minutes after i wake up in the morning although not always sometimes if i am going to exercise it'll drink coffee first thing in the morning but i love love love coffee and what have personally found is that by using the aero press i can make the best possible taste in cup of coffee i do not know what exactly it is in the aero press that allows the same beings to be prepared into a cup of coffee that tastes that much better as compared to any other form of sewing that coffee even the traditional french press the aero press is extremely easy to use and its extremely compact in fact i take it with me whenever i travel and i use it on the road in hotels even on plains it'll disease for some hot water and all brew my coffee tea write there on the plain with over fifty five thousand five star reviews aeropress is the best reviewed coffee press in the world if you would to try aero press you can go to aero press doctor slash superman that is a e r o p r e s s doctor slash superman to get twenty per cent off any aeropress coffee maker aero pressships in the u say canada and over sixty other countries in the world again that is aero press doctor slash superman to get twenty per cent off and now for my discussion with doctor beck kenned doctor beck kenned welcome thankless to than to be have a old questions for you and as i mentioned in my introduction much of what we are going to discuss to day relates to parent child relating but pertains to relationships generally people with children without children who do not want children holly there aren't people that hate children but for all people a out there with children or not planning them or not relationships are really just fundamental to who we are in i actually place relationships including relationship to self in we now think of is the six pillars of mental health physical health and performance ah sleep patrician nights decided relationships clearly vital to all aspects of life to start off by just asking for all of us are there some simple perhaps not simple questions that ow we can reflect on they give us a sense of how good apparent we are or would be based on i do not know a our previous parent child relationships are relationship to sell you know they what kind of things come to bear when we think about really healthy relationships i can you now start rattling off a list to what i imagine that could be but what a your thoughts i what are the what is the perimeter space as as we say sh we think about relationships besides just o ow my either this person or down dor i you good around anger i do not or separation how i feel about them verses how they make me feel you we can drop lie deeper below the the and o a more superficial stuff that we often see robbed the first thing tat comes to mine when you say that is this word sturdiness and to me when someone says what is good inside as an approach and that is always the first word that comes to mind and i know tit is an odd words not a word we use a lot although i do think most people when you say that persons a really sturdy person we all of some connotation ore feeling at least of what that means and i use it a lot being a sturdy parent being a sturdy leader i talk a lot about the similarities to parenting and can it being a pilot of a plan and in that word sturdy always comes up and i member a while go some one push me though what is your definition of what that means and at that point i thought why i so pry have a definition given i i use it a lot but what i think it really means is in ability to be connected to yourself and to some one else at the same time wand i think that is really the definition of sturdy leadership and that is the anything that is present in a healthy relationship that at once i kind of no my values what i want what i need i feel i can be true to that and at the same time i can and o connect to some one else who probably has different wants and needs and may been slightly different values at the same time and the think that that leads me to next is what i think what is family jobs and a parent job in almost any other place you could assume if ism getting a new job at this company like there just no way i could do my job well if i do not know what my job is and if you go o your desk an you are bowllike have a good day do a good jo and there is no job description you be i think that is impossible but over an over with parents if i say to them what is your job with your kit or when your kits having a tantrum or they her they are ruder they lo to your face or anything what is your job in that moment most people very well intention educated people would never ever take a job if they did not have a job description they look me i have i have no idea how can we do it well how can we then perform in to a place to get to the out comes we want if you do not of the foundation of what your job is and to me i i thought a lot about i think parents actual of two jobs and it relates to sturdiness e you will connect it ere one of our jobs is boundaries and to me boundaries are things we tell people we will do they require the other person to do nothing that dislike really important was a lot of times we think were setting a boundary when actualize are making a request and boundaries keep us connected to ourselves they represent our values and our wants and our needs and in a pare child relationship they also keep our kids safe if i just know in a simple way my can watching often to day and they really to get to bed and i know that i do not want them to stay a lad i kind of know what my family needs have just sat a boundary but the other part of my job is i empathy in validation which is a way of connecting to some one else where you see some one else as feelings and experience as real you do not agree with that probably you do not necessarily condone the behavior that is the representation of the feelings but the feelings himself you need to connect to and i feeling those there are two jobs as parents and notsreally the way to be a sturdy leader and to be in a sturdy healthy relationship with their gets wall much there a and i love it a and here is one of the reasons i love it this notion of sturdiness something that do not think we hear enough about if we hear about resilient grit also important terms but sturdiness as as you described it in the job of parenting really seems to it include a lot of verbs not just sounds and adjectives and and ism a huge fan of verbs because the biology and to some piston psychology yes also psychology is all about verbs i and the labels often are mysterious but sturdiness just sends a a clear message of of something that i does not budge easily i but then as you describe the job of being apparent having boundaries id to drill into that obit more fathom you view boundaries i but also empathy a it is not a walled off picture it is one that that is semi permeable also and i confess om of it obsessed with old school psychoanalytic theory not as the the the be all end all of psychology but but it also suggests this other other relationship ism a person i have a self rope person you have a self this is the opposite of codependency where obviously dependency and two people being conicocodependent can be healthy in the contacts of relying on one another but a as i understand it when one person has a self in another person does not have a self for this notion emerging not just in romantic relationships but child parent relationships ism best friends with my marmoreal is that a good thing i do not know but this notion of other other relationships yet i myself you are a self and we each other as an other anyway i i think there is much to explore here valuable you mention that boundaries are something that we do and that the requires at the other do nothing i we will o it further into that because i it is a beautiful concept and this notion of boundaries but a gasliting narcissism and all the other thingsthat we hear about nowadays i think is like often badly misunderstood tell us more about boundaries and how that looks in moos in the action said and this is all connected to what you are saying that other other relationship ism a person you are a person and my times that is actually is what get merged and my kid get's upset that i say they cannot watch another show an in apparent really that moment there whose feelings are who la they were upset was i was upset a second ago i thought i should set the boundary and it'll the sudden of changing my mind there is this complete roll kind of confusion and merger which is one of the main reasons that kid's get actually really scared n escalate their behavior ex thy do not have a sturdy leader when they really need one right boundaries or what we tell some on we will do and they require the other person to do nothing i this definition for a lot of reasons ism to stray practical it allows me after i set a boundary till a less was tat a boundary or not right because let us take on let us take the t v example it is whatever time at night my kid has just watch to show and they know there sos to watch one show and then turn off the t v i here from parents a lot my kid is not listen or my kit is not respect my boundaries and it'll say what i like that sounds hard let us get into that thenelse i i told my kit to shut off the t v it is kept watching it is kept on i told my kid to stop jumping on the couch and they hat jumping they do not respect my boundaries they do not listen me this is a beautiful example e this is a problem my try but this is not a boundary problem you made a request of your child and frankly if you have your o making us up seven fourfold watching t v ism not good at putting away t v and apron at night it is just hard for me to do you are seven fourfold hobbies just addicted to what sever happening andwhat kind of asking our kid to do our job for us because we do not want our kit to be mad at us or whatever it is a boundary in that situation would be saying oh he do not put off the t v look by the time i get over there if you have not turned off the t v and do not want to do this but i will i will take the remote out of your hand and shut it off a boundary saying o after my request does not work can you get off the couch you can jump on the floor look if by the time i get over there you have not cotton off the couch i will pick you up that is i was ism not going to put the success of my intervention in my seven year old's hand i care too much about my own needs an my own roll is i as a leader in my home to do that right same thing with let us ay inlays on my mother and law does not respect my boundary show we ho shows up without calling now who soft want to get to this point there is a lot of things in a relationship we can do before we get to this point but if that is really a boundary and have a very an of intrusive mother in law a boundary would be saying look this is going to be awkward and i know you mean well but the next time you come unannounced i well come to your car and si off this time does not work for us you cannot come in and i will go back into my house and close the door like now there can be lots of feelings around that but you are now setting a true boundary and when we say our kids do not listen those are often situations not all them but there is a big percentage where ism actually not setting a boundary early enough and in a sturdy enough way which is what my kid needs because at that point they simply do not have the skills to inhibit in urge and they need me to be the boundary for them we here sometimes it a kids are craving rules their craving boundaries a as out of a wile that a lessen tea major a the girl more than wild i do not recall ever craving rules i but i do recall paying attention to they are lack of presents what of that am is this notion that kids really want and crave rules and boundaries is that is that sort of a a ion's projection that we put on to them a and and me not exploring this just just for fun ism exploring it because i think t something that is very helpful and setting boundaries especially with kids is the idea that push even if it is a bit painful to see them in discomfort there is that empathy piece e talking for that impact attunement can i get in the way of boundaries right these are and they are not mutually exclusive but these are somewhat competing forces set at times if we if we know if we can knowledge at least explore this idea that rules are deep down what they really want not just what they need yes a maybe it would help yes and i think by the way in my taking the remote away a taking my kit off the couch is to be clear if i do that to my kid they are not going to say of mom you are the best mob in the world bank you they are going to cry and scream and that is where boundaries and empathy those two parts of our job actually do always go together i think they are actually partners they are not actually at odds because as soon as my kid is upset what i would say to them is itch you wanted to jump on the couch it is not as much fun on the floor o you really wanted to watch another show you did not even want this big you wanted to watch it this big it sounds crazy cause youlicly why my empathizing with that feeling they just kind of disobeyed know their two different things ism doing my job and setting a boundary they are actually doing their job and feeling their feelings that is actually their job the only way you can ever learn to regulate a feeling is through feeling the feeling they are doing their job now am going a baldy and this is how kids learn emotion regulation boundaries they feel i validly i hold the boundary over and over and over do kids crave rules and i i think one of the issues is that most parenting approaches have one or the other and i think they are both very in complete strategies if you just lead with rules rig in who set it of hey was not melic but is it rules without relationship lead to rebellion yet that is what happens right that is not good but i see the stanarge we have swung the other direction it is also not a complete parenting strategy when your kids jumping on the couch to do nothing if you think that is dangerous into they oh you really want to jump jump jump and such big feelings this not what kids need i think kids crave boundaries and they crave feeling seen and understood because as kids are growing up i think the questions they are always asking parents even though of course they never say this is just am i real and am i safe every interaction that feuhthe're asking us the reason we have de validate their feelings when they are upset even though they are upset just that their string cheese broke whatever it is is feelings do not have markers blood or they do not know and when we say ah you wanted your string cheese to be together what were really saying is the things you experience inside of you are real but is are also desperate to know how far do things go no one likes to feel boundary less as a kid that is terrifying right and when we set of boundary we actually say to a kid i will not always protect you i will not let things get far out of control i do think i know fits rules but kids rave connection and i think boundaries and kind of validation and empathy they are the two forms of connection that kids yo are really desperate for what about rewarding kids and here rather than i start off by asking yet one of the best ways to reward kids in healthy ways it i will ask that in a moment how can we u evaluate the notion of of rewards or incentives through this lends of sturdiness boundaries an empathy ye because i can imagine of reward that is outsized in comparison to what a kid did all get great youyou took your plate to the kitchen sink after dinner you get ten thousand dollars obviously out of scale extreme example but just by way of example you it scrub the reward mechanisms for for for life if you ask me everything i know but reward in roplascicy says that that that would occur but but this idea that u can sentibmis kids if if you turn off the levy now then you definitely can watch to morrow night whereas if you do not you cannot tali see you submerging reward in potential punishment u it how do we bound rewards and how do we take into account that when we start adding rewards to scenarios that that were were mixing in matching life experience for them a is ton now doing what ism told do i always expect a reward if the reward does not come next time we know bottom reward prediction are we tend be worse off emotionally than had we never received your ward in the first place again pretty pretty vast perimeter space but what your thoughts on best ways to reward kids for standard good behavior ye verses achievement verses a elimination of bad behavior they tho i thin rerouted i thinks you are asking a much bigger question fer mina i think you are which is what what why do parents think we need to reward kids i think that is why do we think we need to punish kids and this is actually where everything i work on started from because the way i was trained to work with parents i went to the best gold standard evidence back program and know is all about time outs and punishments and rewards and stickers and ignoring and praise and and honestly we during the training for the years after i can of practice this way my i fee that this better than i am si son even say this but that left part of my brain logic and linearity i just this amazing o milk jinnis work i get more of the good behavior and work and not get the bad behavior and and it'd start teaching this parents my private practice and there is this little thing in me i do not even it house and get louder and louder to the point that in a session i bitterly said to parent in front of me i was just telling them how to do a time out is that ism sorry i i do not believe anything give been telling you aglitter i said cause i just it was loud and there it was obviously super awkward but it led me to i feel it from this first principles way be there are a million assumptions that we have about raising kids and i think about relationships and if i striped them back what would i be left with and what would be a new building from there and rewards and punishments to me are these assumptions that we have somehow converted from the fiction shelf of the library and my mind to the non fiction shelf as truths and i the kind of rail against all of them i think i think the question if that cat ton on that direction to me as a why do we think we need to reward kids and is there actually a better system both short german long term ism incredibly long term greedy in my parenting approach as at the end of the day eighteen enough is where things really matter not really matter i meant all matter but it'd rather you i want to help my kids become surly resilient adults but ism short from greedy toke some a realists i cannot deal with all these difficult moments you get both for sure without rewards and punishments i do not know what might some one tell me they give re reward for do wan to use the clearing the table or example let us art that there a kind of goes back to believing kids are inherently good inside i really think it goes back to that you really belief kids are inherently good inside which by the way when i strip back every assumption the only thing i was left was that literally the only thing and then i start to think oka if they are good inside why do they do many annoying thanks all the time but that gave me a gap and i feel that is very exciting to have a gap why do people who are goodncide do such bad things i adult for kids and to me write kids are born with all the feelings and none of the skills to manage those feelings period and we have often thought therefore when feelings feelings without skills come out an behaviors i think that is what bad behaviors are feelings or urges or something without a skill to manage them or without access to the skill may be in that moment either way and the we end o punishing behavior but the behavior was just a sign of the lack of skill i cannot imagine any one think in i could teach my kid to swim by punishing them for not swimming i think some one would say that was crazy i and but that is kind of how we raise kids and then we think rewarding them is in be effective but it actually leads overran over what you set have seen these parents over over my private practice my fourteen raid literally will not pick up there clothes from the floor unless i give them five dollars i count i get here and ye that is that is the problem but i saw how they got there let us take clearing that their plate i i know this is on to sound cheesy but kids do have something in them where they want to feel a purposeful meaning full part of society they do impact drives adults and it drives kids it is not the same type of rewarding as playing fortnight it is totally different sister but i think the question is not why do we think we have to bribe kids up kind of the trick them into doing things that are kind of basic parts of human life and if we take that and my kid chronically is not clearing their plate i could say them look every time you clear placemen give you sticker after five stickers you arguing to get i don't know whatever it is to me a much more deseffective ways it'd say to my kid h i know clearing a plate is just one way of being part of this family and taking cares if i know that were on the same team i say the for it ere on the same t right we are i something is getting in your way of remembering ism not assume i to this the most generous interpretation that to me a allows you to separate some ones bad behavior from their good identity than my say what would help you remember we literally did this hen mi son who always had his tow on the floor and i was just i but he just does not remember he literally does not see it we talked about it n he we out to him putting a post it literally something simple a posit on my door that just as pick up my towel he wrote it in his own handwriting right in a facilitate him solving his own problems and now he has a much higher rat of picking up his towel i guys i could have said every time you pick up your towel you will i do not know get a dollar whatever it is but again it makes me think ism not building the generalizable skill that way ism just kind of offering something at the end which sets me on this kind of awful cycle that i think i is is a point i light to think a brief moment and think one of our sponsors and that is a g one any one is a vitamenmineral robotic drink that also contains adaptations i sort to taking ago one away back into thousand and twelve the reason i started taking it in the reason i still take it every day is that it insures that i meet all my quotas for vitamins and minerals and it insures that i get enough erotic and prosodic to support got health now god health is something that over the last ten years we realize is not just important for the health of our god but also for our man system and for the production of negro transmitters and euromodulators things opening and ceratonent in other words god health is critical for proper brain functioning now of course i strive to consume healthy whole foods for the majority of my nutritional intake every single day but there are number of things in a g one including specific micro nutrients that are hard to get from whole foods ore at least in sufficient quantities a g one allows me to get the vitamins and minerals that i need robotics robotics the adaptations and critical micronutrient any time somebody asks me if they were to take just one supplement what that supplement should be i tell them a g one because a one support many different systems within the body that are involved in mental health physical health and performance to try a g one go to drink a g one dot calm slash supermen and you will get a year supply of vitamin d three k two and five free travel packs of a one again that is a drink a g one dot calm slash supermen i love the idea that kids want purpose and it mi correct in wondering if that goes back to this an mi real component of the am i real am i say yes thine one way that we know we are real is our ability to in part change on the world around us in do not get too abstract here but as a our scientists have often sat bach reflected all the emotions we feel ta no one sees that er knows that u must we say something we write something we sing something we shout something in all the forms of expression just none of our a our dreams are creative a inside sort or wishes am exist except inside us unless we transmute them into something in the real world there dos seen to be something about having this nervous system from a time we really on it it seem our effect on the world that that really makes us real and on others and a i love the idea that well and i must say i absolutely believe in my heart and i just feel it as a feeling that kids are inherently good inside i just i cannot imagine any other version of that but does i mean that there are people out there who believe that kids are inherently bad or were at least not good i do not mean that at how could that be but then again make make ism just naive i do not no if any one consciously believes that but when i go back to that system at is first trained and rewards and punishment sike it feels i a system of behavior of control and to mean they e fly side about control and trust is opposites i only control what i do not trust nobody said to me that program bi the way back i being a learning here we believe kids are bad inside an we do this thing but well if i do not trust my kid and if i do not trust they inherently have the things in them to do good by the way that is not can a happen naturally that is why we have a big job is apparent to coach our kids to bring that out is at boundaries when they cannot do it and som me other things but i do not believe anyone would say gods cause their badinside but there is a nature were you are constantly interacting with your kid from that their system looking at them do not trust you i do not trust you an when you do bad things i can not hold on to the fact that you have a good identity that is why ism giving you a punishment that is why am sending you away to your room and if ism reflecting back to you constantly that you are just your sadist behavior that i do not trust you that i kind of have to bribe you to do very basic human things well our kids form there identity from our reflection of them and then work this is what really compelled all this mike we are raising generation after generation of kid kind of sending to them your kind of a bad untrustworthy kid and then we wonder why we have such pirates one massif went all problems will not i i there is some linearity there a curious about this notion of impingement have heard about this you do not this idea that know when we are young we are foraging life deciding you to i the way this tastes or not take by the way i still hate anchovies i do not need to be ask again to know the answer but when you are young we are encourage to do things eat your richly taste the anchovy and some parents it seems are very comfortable with the idea of allowing their children to have their feelings and their wishes her they are as i was say the nervous systems seems to be divided into young yams an met mes i less the per will be me a you yacsan is i mint's more complicate in that bet with people were i really them ere now something is off they are am is not that much more new ants than that the brains got to make decisions afterward after all excuse me kids have their young yuks an m and then we have got a our ideas about but they need to do in order to progress through life often inherited from our parents and hopefully modified by the wonderful work that you are doing and writing about in in your your program am then we are talking bout here but how much space should we allow for kids to be impinged you do not ant eat you do not want y whet were for dinner o get ism not on to ocean entire y you dinner but then i guess you might go to bed hungry sounds harsh right but the other version is o hate what would you for dinner well i prefer let say they pick a healthy option they prefer post not chicken and we will not do the ice cream chicken an a thing am do we do it i how much in parchment i do not want ta watch a move with the family i wasn't playing my room at some level you give heard it both ways that i linemen is needed for safety an life progression but there is times when it it is it is more settle than that it is not about safety in life progression's not about going to school or not going to school homework in a home for gets about you want to come with us to the part you will not play at home rum how often should we in pine am how we know i his it this kind of that the tricky the tricky arris parenting that i think am because it does not all into the extremes ye i love this question that is a word i do not often here actually what in linemen can you aptly what i dancing on eyes i impinging on the child in a they inherent natural desires or aversion to thinks got i i likely say we are going over into is house and they say i do not their kids do not listen you learn to play with other kids in no i on their kids you see has something happen and were not saying about a dangerous situation weighing now i do not i just really wanted to stay home ye this is an area that are we get impinge on there because we are teaching them either way we are teaching them something yoveyou got a do stuff you do not want to do even if you do not it an wee here again we are ruling out the possibly that there something unsafe about the advisement yet psychology there physically unsafe or but at the same time we are teaching them a pay your i see you i hear you but your desires might not be right there there is ashy it a kind of an a tacit message of the way you feel might not be the best gage of what is best for you which sends a complicated message to a kid totally this is again where i think i could inside family jobs are useful family jobs to me when i used to me with parents and they describe a situation and i feel ninety decent the time that is were i start because then that flows from there sike a trademark real what is my job ism the one who sets boundaries i am the one who makes key family decisions be we as our kids good older they they should be making some decisions to no one likes to feel controlled but key decisions and my job is to validate my kid's experience this is actually complicated because again over and over we think that validating my kid's experience meansthey are going to dictated decision my boundaries do not dictate my kid's feelings and my kid's feelings should not dirty my boundaries there just two equal things this is a great example my kitchen i do not playing with those kids and i can i to stay home with lest yo say grandma was home can i to stay home how mi got to think it some particle as a family but my kit does not want to go there is something dangerous to me this is that exact way putting family jobs into action sweet e and to me this phrase i wish every parent could say the stair kid i believe you you want to make a kid feel real and confident for life confidence comes from the experience of being believed cause that is how you i from me confidences self trust snow feeling good about yourself it is self trust i really do know the way i feel that say i say to my son and the situation and it is i believe feel i si to i believe feel look i i know you want no playable all day and the kid around your age hates football that ut privy lowest on your list of types of kids you would want to hang out with for the afternoon i totally believe you and an this family we know that sometimes we have to do things we do not love to do we do that for a family experience i was to my killtim you don also just to end up being a good adult you just have to end a practicing as a kid doing things you do not want to do things that are boring things that are not your preference you know you notch in your belt for that you don't to thank me and and also i know you have it in you to do your best to be polite and engage i just i know you are a good kid and this is not what you wan and i know we're going to get through it now if it is really hard may be young hey let us create a sign can you look at me and go m when you feel your kind of at this and an me and you ore going to go to the bathroom i men to give you a hug and vinaminto sight i know this is not what you wan and when we get home we can watch that football game whatever it was right because what we often do as we leave ourselves with two choices with kids we either say fine to stay home they feelings actually just dictated the decision that is not hopeful for them i do not want my kid to learn in life when i do not want to do something people twist and turn to make that thing not happen that is disturbing for adulthood expectations but then we do the other thing which is you are selfish just because you are o a friend you are age does it mean that you cannot come with us we either let their feelings dictate or we think our boundaries kind of give us the right to be mad at our kid right to do both is important and that is what it think to me when i hear him pigment i actually think that is that is the exact space where you have the most bang for your box apparent it is not enjoyable and again if i have my beautiful intervention with my son do not think my kid well look at me and say i love how you explain that that's beautiful no he is been to roll his eyes my job is not to take the bat use cumin dump and to also hold hope i think that is really important this commons of o invalidating my kid's feelings where they are to day but i need to be the one to hold hope that they can cope with it if i cannot name to make it i know you are going to get through it they are not going to be able to see that kind of next more mature version of themselves en i actually gits the same as your best pass you knows i know you do not want to go on this trip i and whatever it does i know this presentation topic is not the one you would have chosen and there were ten things and this was literally number ten i totally get that and it stankson ism not taking anything away from that and this is the thing and yod do and i know something about you when you put your mind to something house's to a great job and it is probably not sing to be enjoyable but i do know you are gong to do a great job on this that is the boss you want amazing are you a doctor children bathe i she f i finish college as she so i li canzetter and dry gala do shall dry a what ism hearing is do not dictate their behavior with an ism can underline in bold dictate do not dictate their behavior you are going to do this because i said that is dictatorship but at the same time do not quash the emotion behind the resistance can acknowledge it make them feel real u i believe you hill i love this phrase amazing and i love your definition of confidence if people did not hear that we are defiling in repeated again and wine widen watch it in your nerd circuitry cause i love that it is it is it is a self trust yes and this notion of giving hope you are giving them and incentive that is based on a reward that is actually good for them that they can translate to other situations as well ah was n there and reward because you do not made me think i don't think till you said bout i think it a situation me be tempted to say and if you go in your polite it'll give you twenty extra minutes of fa blocks fright that is and at first of allow me to say something whatever i say to you for listeners lie us i li could do the stuff all they actual kids ism the first one sometimes if you here is your thing have to dangle an od a little section in the common section on you two where your kids can and ism just gan exactly your kids are forbidden know who a that is wait that is dictating understand why i believe that you would want to comment began a trust we cut let why it is a it is good for you if you do not n exactly all practices on some one else it is a reward the re when your kid and unseeing himself capable of doing something they did not previously think they can do better than ye li i feeling that is one of the the is rewards even if its gettingthrough a social situation or i think about the salt within non my little kid is i do not know struggling with a puzzle or something and i could just do it for them or if i help them kind of regular office is a hard puzzle and you can take a break i i just know you are in a figure know to day i just know it and then because of that they get there that feels in your body that is the best kind of reward and its the type of reward that works for kids in added when there are not a job we want them to be motivated by the feeling there gan a half of ride not be saying hay give finished my thing early do i get agonist to their boss that that is nothing to play out as well wellie i ism just pausing and shaking my head don't because i love it much am and i just one to make sure that i do not quickly move to the next question without drilling down even deeper intosamity's concepts i believe you as the feed back a will response that can in still real confidence over time not to get to new ants here but how is it different because i i since it is different then i hear you i hear you but and dies any yet what i hear you but listen in this family that it is ye i believe you atheword believe is powerful and i believe is real power in specific words as is you for instance sturdiness again at such such a powerful under used word i believe you mum would you your psychologist what what what you think we are hearing when somebody says i believe you that is different then i hear you have en listened these out but i think we all of these li corners is humans and i think being believed is one of them because it is it is some one else kind of saying u you are real that is what i i might not feel what your feeling but that thing that feels strong to you that nobody can see or measure is real and when i think about the most confident people i think about this girl if i went to done with and she was just brilliant smart were in this seminar ire was one these small class of i this professor was talking about stuff and i for ones it ism no i don's persons talk madam but i was no one ease's stopping and this airways yer hand and she is said ism sorry if everyone else is annoying have no idea what you are talking about austere any cause i usually do an likes or any way you could say that in different way that is to me the utmost version of confidence that she believed her own experience of confusion was real confusion she didn't think it was a sign she was stupid she she believed it she believed herself that is confident and i think one someone says i hear you they are there they this aversion of listening there is many worse phrases no damage is done when we follow anything but but we tend to invalidates that is not that anyway i believe you but is also nocking but there is a million examples of this to me that build confidence and i actually think there is many situations with kids were they say situations and we were h they have low confidence and then we intervene to quote make them feel better which actually is the thing that lowers there confidence cause it is we say to them i do not believe you you are not really feeling yo real where i believe you is the exact opposite i gouge example cause it makes it concrete my kid will come home and say i i do not know ism i was pick last for you now for dodge ball to ta i was pick last in something and and there there clearly very very sad right and we want o say to them i it is big deal or everyone is pickles some times or remember yesterday you told me you were pick first for basket ball and we think annexed to build up my kid's confidence those are confidence i wolf say destroying us to reducing intervention cause a kid is kind of coming to a aren't basely saying ism a very very upset that i was picked last and we are saying to a kid know you were not and they are but i am an what they learn is this is really terrifying to me is other people ore better feelers of my feelings can i am as a million really scariest personal i think relationship you now kind of consequences later down let em later down in life but when a kid says i you not pick last n now what even wants me and they all think on the words happy whatever it kid say to sit and say some person of em god we are talking about this and i tell those a really hard him class and sweet alien i i believe you you will watch your kid it is crazy to me what parents tell me happen when they say those words their kids they are it also just bitterly diffused everything apathy were ready to move on they are just trying to tell you probably i was feeling something it was a lot it was confusing y are feelings r always hardest when we are alone in them i was alone in it and bring it to you hen some one says i believe you not only are they giving you that corn need they are also just i they are sitting down with you in it and that that makes everything better and then meanwhile what a kid feels when we say i believe you to a hard experience or hard feeling is tho a the feelings that overwhelm me do not overwhelm my parents they can tolerate it they are not scared of me kind of being a loser in him class one day and if my parent likes me when i have that feeling i got i can start to myself when i have that feeling it grave because it sounds it accomplishes both things it mikes kids feel real and safe yes real and safe and you i can't hep but ask say because it how we started off to day was at this is in just about parent child relationships but in friendships in romantic relationships and to work er relationships that the words i believe you a to presume base on everything ism hearing now and feeling inside about i that it is equally effective huge y know years a got on a podcast early on and to me there's these three lines a kind of all go together when ids are anyone's upsadin ass kind of you start and tome is i beautiful in citation to have that con vernation just to say to some one ism guide you are talking to me about this right and then kind of i believe you tell me more and my husband that went y heard it was now you could sayer those words to me sometimes i would that because and i think about the work place too you have someone come in there upset about i do not know i got staff done this sir ism not getting a promotion and i i thought i was just diffuse it which is ism glad you are talking to m about this see i been working non stop for and just if you say to thermic i i believe you cause we usually do not say to some one i do not believe you what will say as we we defend ourselves in that moment and the way the other person receives it is as if were saying i do not believe the intensity of the experience yare having and when you do lead with i believe yet something in a partnership everything mi ask you to do something you get really hot and bother and does not even mean you gree o kind of disbelieving i i bully i believe you tell me more ray i believe you that that really upset you and a moist the who another trying my head but i i hear what you are saying and and i know there is something there and i believe it enough to be open to hearing more about it oh is what is best that is what uts what we all want i and out partnerships and ism wide i man what a beautiful acknowledgment that as you pointed out is not agreeing to accept someone ease's reality to the extent that you are going to dismantle that the the order of the world as not have heard but it is such an opening as suppose to a closing and as you said it is non defended but it is also boundaries in there is just many things about it that feel good seem good and and clearly are good no i do not want to go down that the tragic habit whole of drama but previous gestomis podcast you know is defend we tried to find drama just because it gets thrown around a lot drama an event tore set of circumstances that fundamentally changed the way that the brain and nervous system work that there is a maladaptive response going forward it is not every bad thing that happens but there are micrograms sometimes called salty rumor macrotraas a big again could be mufti event or single event but years ago a different psychology psychiatric is an adolescent i psychatros at stamford said something in a seminar that just really struck me which was that at at it is core drama is really about confusion over whose responsible and and you were noxious talking bout that the more salient examples of sexual fault that those two us of course but if if we get scrip not or we observe something third person tram the the logical stances won a that was them not me but when this happens especially when we are young the nervous system the brain some somehow interprets this was i was there i had a roll in it just by being there what was my roll and somehow the emotional response becomes one of responsibility even if lie there clearly the one that initiated this and the reason bringing this up in this contact is that it is almost that lack of belief in self somehow gets rooted in and then it all feels confusing and the we do not feel safe that is re because it is a confusion about responsibility again going back to this we go down that habit r as who ways do i think that the what your i wo in macramé is actually not events it is the way an event gets process and nit i love gobormate's definition of prom it is not what happens to you its what happens inside of you right to me there is an in gerent rationality there where events that get pros not an event events with high emotionality let us say that get process in aloneness become dramatic and i think that is where it gets link to responsibility this is act to it my tedtolk was about and why repairs important who said this road fair burn years ago that for kids it is better to be a sinner in a world ruled by god then to live in a world ruled by the devil i think it explains almost everything my child filament wright there going back to goodness also your parent just creamed at you and by the way you are parent i scream it my kids give one con scream their ids is can a happen ay that is just the event the events not can have the impact what is happening for a kid well we know kids are granted by attachment they literally need us to survive they could not survive on their own and what o you do when the person your dependent on for safety becomes the source of danger and threat that is very confusing for a child in that moment there superliner aroused there in the state of terror and then usually after in my house to i to yell of my kid they are kind of alone in their room ism alone in the kitchen or wherever meanwhile spinning mi con such a bad parent ism pot but meanwhile because ism lost in my own guilt i might not be going to my kid and what happens for my kid if i do not repair after i scream at them ore one of these events ray well a kid cannot say to themselves my parent just had a that day then the badness is in my parent my leader ism some young now right i do not understand nu one's my leader cannot be bad i must take on the badness at least then i have control kids after they are kind of yell that in the absence of repair they they really only if two options for hot regular and feel safe again they can self blame it is all my fault which is why killick most adults when they have a hard time they tell themselves it is my fall ism not good enough it is the legacy of that story from childhood or they use self doubt maybe that did not happen maybe i over reacted maybe i cannot trust myself again it leads to a adults who basically say did i a reactor i may call five friends let me see if they think what my boyfriend did was a big deal cause they cannot trust themselves and them aroma hat i want every parent to know sells i i left my kit alone an i did not pick them up at the socrafield as i con ta aromatize them tell they what that just the event did you say to them he that probably felt scary what was that oh you are right you were along now of a hidden next to the event that was scary is my story and my can action it got process in a safe connection it did not get process in a oneness and that is that is a massive massive difference the sharia you're describing the parent who yelled goes to the child shaving been that child e press also having been that parent a how do we do with the fact that sometimes we do not want to be around the person that yelled us it hurt it hurts to receive the care the there it there is a he's a a textured landscape as a o a shoot lands kip there o say now you are ready for everything to be peaceful ism still with my feelings i guess that is where the i believe you comes in and that is where the sorting it through process begins i think it is what version of a parent comes back to me them the firstling give to do in a repair process is actually repair with ourselves is a parent really because if you have not repaired with yourself which to me is kind of separating you are identity again from your behavior a pay beck ill hearse myself an example ism a good parent who just scream at her son i do nomism up forever and you see when you try to prepared yourself those two things get collapsed i must him up for ever ism a monster weight ism a good parent who did something ism not proud of you cannot repair with some one until you have prepared with yourself they feel it from you they actually it usually is then you are asking for them it'll be it is o say rid you forgive me right it is not a repair that is using your child to try to do something we just have to do on our own or with to their results but if have repaired with myself ism going to show up in a different way might i have a fifty kid i might i do not care it is not better that is o kid ism not preparing to get something for my child and preparing to give in experience to them we can also get creative your kid is older you tax them you sip a door under the no you say okay i just have to say this one thing to me the line really matters till like snatch that self blame out of a kid's body is to like ism sorry i yelled it is never your fault when i yet and it is not and people who argue our ability to regulate our emotions related our child's existence that they had not they had something they did something and we felt frustrated but that is very different thin yelling right and saying that to your kid is important meanwhile the next day you might say by the way let us really figure out had i get out the door in a smoother way you could work on whatever they need to work on but the reason i think most kids and a projecting parents apologies is it is not really repair we are asking our kid for permission to be oke again fora repair sounds hey ism sorry i yelled but if you just got ready in time hat one's a hinder we say ism sorry you felt that way ism sorry you felt that way those are not none of those are actually repairs and if that is what a kid's been used to they are going to keep a parent more a bay is it safe to a y that we can always come back to making the kid feel real and say i believe you is a great place to start and the reason i keep coming back to the the simple things is that simple but very very potent by the way is that in the real world landscape parenting family in life things are happening really fast and it is very dynamic and it is mufti fastened and my we have not you've talked yet about how when there is two parents the one that did not yell when there is multiple siblings when a m there is the human dynamics on at one in and other other landscape is is hard enough and then we start introducing the real world landscape things happen fast having something that people can reach to really quickly what i call in the landscape of stress modulation which is something that am more familiar with from my lab's work is in a real time tools ye real time tools like we are all at our best after meditation vacation massage and a good night's sleep but what about real time tools when everything everything's hectic what does a really good apology look in the real world ye because a really good apology in the ideal world of a instrogram is ye i believe you ism sorry with no buts nor this that but a real apology sometimes is as you are boarding a plain or when there is a bunch of other things that are going on and you have not even deal with those yet or when you are on your way to an event or ye yet of you get it what does a really good internal landscape for apology look li how can we touching to where we need to be and then what are the words that even if we have to try again later and again and again later with that person in this case kid but person were generally what is the go to solid apology ye i think you are never going to go wrong saying i believe you d your kit i was the of you say it randomly but if there really upset you yelled at me i believe you that is all you can remember you are crushing it i think a realistic repair you have to do something for yourself and to me can be a very simple mantra to me ism a good parent who is having a hard time is the one i is honestly over and over just and after a yell at my kid before it'll go to the bath from sometimes and it'll say that myself back you ism a good parent having a hard time and it'll kind of say it as many times as i need until i really do feel something shift a little in my body just cause again i think that phrase separates what i did from who i am right and then to me the realistic apology count be supersimple you remember nothing else gut spic ism sorry i yelled that is that is great if you want if you are ism feeling a beck give me that next stop ism re ism sorry i yelled just you ism working on managing my emotions and no next time even when ism frustrated a minute try to stay come something about and next time if you long a throw in that it is not your fault kid it seems an odd thing because parents why do kids assume its their fault it is their default position and it is never a that thing to throw in but honestly just simply hey ism sorry i yelled that actually gives the tat realness because without saying anything more your saying that thing you think happened did happen that is powerful i to take a quick break and thank

how do you suggest parents deal with retorts and rudeness and again let us ism extend this to all relationship you get in your best mind said an by the way aloft this i am thing two of the most important words any language when translate the other languages i am blank i am a good this or am whatever role identity is key to the brain we know this you go in and you say ism really sorry i struggle to regulate my emotions i believe that you are really upset and the kid says i hate you now earlier you said that good boundaries are about not expecting a change in behavior from someone else there about our own boundaries or maybe the i hate you comes from listen what we are not get ago to son's house for payday today great i are not you yet i hate you yum is there ever a case for no response i mean to me the most under utilized parenting strategy is doing nothing literally it is one of my most you strategies cause and there is there is there is ha really good reason for especially in the situation i ala is to me i would save if to understand before we intervene i know every parent i what you do in that situation but it is trying it is trying to fix some one's tenniswing before you look at their tennis wing right what there be a lot of problems and why is a kid saying i hate you and i would ask every parent to just keep this in mind it is a tool and you cannot use it in real time eventually you can but we have to say it out the end of a night when my kid said i hate you what is my most generous interpretation of why he would say that to me and if you are any human me included by the way your least generous interpretation is immediate your like because he is a sociaebat that is what we say all the time well are because he is a horrible kid because he is spoiled cause he is nasty it comes easily that is fine but what is my most generous interpretation and when i do not know it'll push myself to say o say well i was in a situation with my husband what would lead me to say and what would lead you to say that is some one that i ha the i they say something you hey drew or not an i be a but a you know do this dinner it would have to be some sort of deep betrayal of trust and and what i and i have to acknowledge that if i said that to somebody that i really care about her love it as ism saying i hate you what ism really saying is i love you much in that hurts unbelievably such an unbelievable intensity that what is coming out of my math as i hate you because of you because we did not love them that is right would have know effect i wan ye a met it'll be it'll be it'd be mad but instead it is oh it hurts we we somehow there is an earl certain in the it is i whatever in sorta it is hate you that is right but we really saying is i love you much and it's a consequence that thing you did or said hurts much that is right and i think that is exactly what is going on for a kid or to me my most generous interpretation a simple way is make kid when i said we could not go to this friend's house that he thought we we going to his friend he is gin to sleep over he quilted up in his mind he probably kids do they have this whole image own there r to this and this and the let down was intense an again i go back to kids have all the feelings we have and they are born with none of the skills it takes a lot if it takes a pretty well developed skill to be really disappointed by the way and surprised right in a moment and manage it in a mature way ism sure we both know adults who are not really cable of doing that rigs o the fix con my seven year old is doing that if i think about it that way we latch on to our kids words as if they are the truth they are not the truth it is not to say they do not matter but they are not the truth the truth is whatever world is under the words ism disappointed and i do not know how to manage that if i think about the outcome what undo i want to be what i would love in that sit nation cause the truth is when i say to my kid sorry we cannot go to bobby's house i wouldn't even want is not normal for my kid t b oh no problem because i i would ism just picture y twenty five year old trying to get a job and being mom oh i did not get it and then he is no problem i that is kind of weir really that is were it'd want you to be disappointed and what i want my kid to bible to do is to be and now what is the best to gets all a man i was really looking forward to that is ultimate maturity how do i get from mi hate you to all man i was really looking forward to that thrall the tings we want to do just do not even make sense sending my kid to their room saying you are such a nasty kid give never seen any of your friends say thank to their parents and ism go to acting things things out it of course i say these things too but all ism doing is easily telling my kid the version of themselves i do not want them to be now ism further away from that outcome just not effective my kid obviously literally needs to learn some of those kills and practise them we do not think about simulations with kids nearly enough we know that in sports people practice all the time we do not do that with emotion regulation what do i do in the moment i think the best question here is what do i do outside the moment to help i did build the skills they actually have more of a skill the next time that moment comes still ism a fragments what i do in the moment i hate you i probably would do nothing first when some one is rude to you d they say something nasty i do not i is this is one this is my son miss is mad my son just hurled i hate you it is sitting between us when we say back to them i hate you er go to your room we take all the energy from what they said and we just throw it and then we have this ping pi met when you do nothing i ways picture if this is that hate you it just sits between us my kid has a much higher chance of kind of re owning what they just said because ism just kind of sturdy in that moment because i did not just take it from them and say something to them which just gives them the opportunity to take what i said and have no responsibility for the first thing they said it is always trueing adults when someone says to you something nasty if you actually just stay there they are shoot prison v said that because i it is it is right there i probably say nothing now a couple i do not if it'd really do that but it'd want to do that on you be clear something else you can say in that moment which takes a lot of presents it is not can happen right away is just something i wo clearly you are disappointed i get that i believe you and i know there is another way you can say that to me that is actually right back to family jobs ism validating and ism setting kind of a boundary in some ways i know maybe there is all hope they are too i know there is another way f my kid keeps saying i hate you i hate you you the worst to the worse them it the listen i love you you are a good kid you are having a hard time i i really will not stay in your room while you keep saying this me an part of that is cause not con for you either this is not a good dynamic ominous step outside item not come back and we can talk about it when we are both in a place where we can be alone our sackful or something that right don't to be a punching bag but at least now ism helping my can see that he is having a feeling under these words if i cannot differentiate the feeling from the behavior how can i expect my kid to ever learn to differentiate those tail which is how my kid can actually get to a more regulated place have sometimes wondered whether or not parents are either afraid of or not afraid enough of their kids a give known some parents that are afraid of their kids because t and perhaps as a consequence who knows what the chicken egg a is there only knows the parent was a live first the kids learn to control their parents through notnecessarily emotional outburst but the threat of emotional outburst have seen us again and again and it is it is a pretty wild thing to observe a and of course as an observer it is far easier than when you are in it but this idea o the a porter boil over a a their going a pop and have seen this in teachers in the class room have seen this in many venues where whether not the child understands that they are somehow controlling the situation or not that there is just an inherent fear of what could happen and then i think kids feel a certain power but they do not feel safe right i man how could they their children yes a for the parents out there that are afraid of their kids potential responses and or how bad their kid quit in up might turn out if they were to really lay down the law your amusing an old schoolboy c i is it err upon o ya forty eight years old and i you having my parents did not physically bus at but there migthave been a spank and ever once in a while and i i don't no what the rule is nowadays or the for the the a standard out there i think i will not say which y mighthave taken a smack here or there but not many a an it there was also a lot o love a but clearly am and hear ism not am nut supporting the use of corporal punishment i won m be very clear am but yo kids can be tough and then also it was not longing to my high scorers when i was physically larger than both my parents i never use that to intimidate them but i have to imagine when your kid is larger than you you were already psychologically afraid of them now you it is clear to both of you that the a the tables a turn that is right right of thing about that the unconscious see conscious aspects of this ism not talking about who can obviously physical fights there is not something i ever want a sheer displace household this this is an amazing topic walking on eggshells missus ray and this is terrifying to a kid because again if a kid is than a figure out am i real and am i safe kids do experience feelings in such an intense way be cause they do not have any those skills another are surprising n there visceral that it is carry to them and there are kind of especiallythse groups of kids this a them deeply feeling kids that do feel things more intensely and they do have more of these big massive tantrums even look anomalistic often during they try to scratch you they will hiss stirring them they will grows real yes there is a i gropes of riders at kids it by yes that is because again those are just feelings literally in contain that are exploding out where do they explode out there your extremities they that is really what it is and what will happen and this is the really unfortunate dance on one of the my favor things to help people turn around is then kids kind of sense from a parent i really am as toxic as i worried i was ray and an't we go back to that pilot thing i think about a pilot of sike ism we have ton make an emergency landing we are not gong to be able to go to wellie and we are all gin a land and cleveland whatever it is i picture are the passenger who you are going to take us to all and the pili oh k how c can you imagine you are it does not matter that this person is pissed you are the pilot you do not have to keep us happy please keep us safe and if you rein that plain in you are terrified because o were to make an emergency landing i promise you you are way more terrified when you here this person change the decision because of the three that a passenger is going to be very very upset and that is actually what we do when we are waking around on egg shells now the alternative to this again we live in this world in parenting where there is a binary where we say and you set yourself to whining laid on the law i do not recommend that either especialywith a kid that that is not in o be the best solution these kids have to be seen as good kids they are good kids and when i wait meet with parents of these kids i hear about them and i always say i hear about them and have a kid this i get aim i really your kid we're what i think i do and they are and then they usually start crying and tho your literally the first person an eleven years who ever said that including the parents i you our kid why i make they are tenacious there they know what they want they seem they zero percent people pleasing in them these kids will change the world but not if they are boundaryless then they'll become tyrants and that is that is really terrifying and ism n to teach you how to be the sturdy leader which is e coolly firm as it is warm and that is onto start to day and here is an example of these deeply feeling kids i think you say s invalid watching a ten show where these kids it feels they hold the family emotional hostage right and because if you do not pick the am the move that they want to watch and family moving night they will scream they will cry and they will do that for three hours they will other kids after yore their they do not peter out these kids these kids interesting enough getting an awful cycle with their parents because they have such intense emotions more often which more escalations which tend to get met with invalidation you are dramatic you ruin everything they are that much more desperate to be believed they escalate further you can understand how that will be to more distance and invalidation and were off to the races in a bad direction and told say the prince you are an turn family moving night to morrow night this is what foregoing to do and you are in a by the way i would say this is how concrete i you are in a right this down and yore gin to say in to a voice recorder with you are own voice and i want you to play a back and see how sturdy you sound the will often do it the'lbylig will i did not even believe myself when i said that ism scared of my child right you are n do it again then you gan do it again and this is this is just any other silly practice and you are gin to say you are kid look i know in this family you now bobby usually we let him pick the move he sensually upset if not we all to night's gan to be different bobby it is your sister's term to pick the move and i know your going to be upset and is one time exactly what is can happen an ominous in this example of say there is a two family household which is an assumption but even if there is one if you are super upset and agreement ism going to bring you to your room this is important ism gin to sit with you ism an stay there and this is a line that i know if for our deeply failing kid workshop has really you've to believe it to say it i am not scared of your feelings and i know parensill say to me make yet you are in a fakir to you make it they they need to hear that because if y think about the image of these kids there feelings feel overpowering to them they feel more but they are actually more corpus to the world they both have more coming in they are actually always terrified of how much of them can flow out and they feel their feelings that way it is almost my tantrum in the house takes up the entire living room that is why mic sure to bring them to a smaller room and you actually have to contain them in that way as a way if kind of saying it only goes this far literally i will not let you dictate family move and always sitting in the front see and your favorite chair at dinner it only goes this far and that is truly in act of love and protection and safety for those kids how often you observe tit these d deeply feeling kids as another yet i den i made up the terms o but great deeply feeling i a your your cliff to qualified to deeply feeling kids also express these i deep feelings in the positive sense i i because i can think of some kids i grew up with and i can look at my own experience of it is hard to know we do not have a calibration point is not body temperature o how much i feel for is how much you feel we loo the an external expression of these things o the the lachrymal glance sat greet some tears are not you not as you are talking about this this thing before i knows i welled up a little bit and something epic i can remember being things and feeling kissed what is a really big in tats i do not remember screaming at my parents telling them i hate them i probably did at some point but but i have observed other mother kids peers that grew up that clearly fell into this category and have gone on to remarkable things yet remarkable extraordinary bags because it is it is a capacity it that does not always skew towards negative expression it can also immense expressions of love and and now i think these says that there is a tendency to for unqualified or truly unqualified people a because they're not trying to do to slap labels border line writ splitting good object that objects splitting an and that is that exists in the as at ignoisist in in symptoms of borderline but that we punish rather than i believe in observe that these things exist this range and nervous system tuning an affect and put simply i do deeply feeling kids also tend to express love enjoy and am positive emotions with it with the same intensity or your same intensity o is they depends on them it depends on and a kind of their stage of development and the nature of the interactions they have kind of received back i think deeply feeling kids i was the are supersensors a view of on these kids and have on these ids with a an ear city she will not go into near city coach i where we park car and she is the smell and i the rest of us would you talking about meanwhile have another friend who lives to e we an airy of men at and and she is a deeply feeling catches when i just my daughter the same thing i actually believe that my daughter smells something that i do not smell they are supercensurs in that way right and she notices the little detail of something now in terms of the intense love i think for these kids their vulnerability sits close to their shame this is why they get explosive they almost experience their feelings as attackers which is again my parents can get scare to them and they do because again they feel that feeling intensely that they have the steep fear of a abandoned man a been too much and they that shame tries to shut it down although it obvocy does not work in an explodes what have notice with deeply feeling kids and this to me is actually truly make proudest body of work and u mention border lines it'll go there people of said these sound almost kids who are but have some predilection to to border line and give u see having gone to a page de programmed were told a lot about invalidating and fironmens and things that ism not really one for labels either but i job not much insight from my honesty my own kid where as a garlic she is different and how the processes things and what she needs and how she responds to my very same interactions as my other kids their very different and not fear of abandonment and being too much it was it was they are from the starry really feels like it was there what is interesting as i feel through working with her by the way in a very different wife at these kids reject almost every typical parenting strategy you go to validate these kids feelings it is your trying to intrude on them in steal er heart because if you think about their porousness they are terrified of being taken over that when you are seeing a feeling they feel your seems into them and they reject you i is say capo in the front door with these kids you have got a find these side door approaches but now of all my kids she is by far the costliest the most loving the most emphatic about our relatship up this trip not oman amiss you much the idea which the is ford that any of that i would say to some one you are crazy you are talking about a different kids i think that yes that deep love is there and it we just have to kind of make it a little safer for those kids to access t is there any and general statements that one can still make accurately about differences in the expression were perhaps even the experience of deeply feeling kids in boysfirsest carrels great question i actually have not noticed a tine be there might be i love to look more into that but in terms of one of the accurate i have not notice that yet i think one of the things you have one of these kids is if the moments when you are apparent we are kid needs you there and in those moments your kids push you away they push you away when they need you the most if that is i think it'd really common quality for the for those kids ow o uncommon is em i suddenly such a a it'll just this that deeply feeling kid a fend tied i i do not w i do not want it i do not want it i lessen the importance of of what you are saying by not saying it that way because i shall what i think your ting is incredibly important resinates with me on a lot o different levels in fact i but but as far as i know it is not a dead dispose is not and thank goodness it is not i y i would pathology that is right right you but of that you known in a classroom foot let us an i an a big class from a hundred k ids ye how many those kids or and ism guessing it a continuum but would fall into this category of deeply feeling i think you are right its a continuo and connecting topics i know yous spoken about have been doing a lot of looking into this overlap with deeply feeling kids and your divergence and eighty h d and what i thinks interesting about that is we we have these workshops see deeply feeling can workshops and allow than we do live there is this whole chap and it'll say these things you that you now n they are defiling ideas he have not heard but what i think it is more heeling is thousands of people in the chap and saying i i thought when i say the hissing thing the chat is a waterfall i thought i was the only one i thought like there are many of these kids why i think there is more and more or something i need to look more into but i think it does life you think about these kids as more chorus and you think about how insanely stimulating the world is that we bring up kids what comes into them it would make sense that i think this is a growing type ism guessing it is similar with eighty h t too are many more kids diagnose than the past the world we bring up kids in the sensory overload if you are how of that much more porous that is going to overload your system and it is and i think that i think that is also why more in more kids are what is the percentage i do not i do not know a maybe twenty that that t do not ell san early high precise i think it is a fairly haiercenage that feels right t that just for feels right baste on my observation of adults also ye feels right might also explain a lot of the m apparent conflicts and and misunderstandings and a don't relationships that is ex and we i mean many people i we'll say me i was on my goodness that was that was years if there for me watching hat i thought i would took that for my kid this was me and i finally talk ma i believe you that is o in deeply feeling kids are esprit to be believed and they are desperate for our tempts to connect with them because they are deep fear is there lovability and they do reject typical and wit is the stamps get out of my room fine you are difficult and then see i really am as unlovable and that as i worried i was unless we can of reverse that cycle i be willing about my life that most of the ultra successful performing artists that we observe your notion names but just think of ultra successful the the people whose words music poetry writing acting a presents evokes immense emotion in other people much that people will pay money to see these people express their emotions and one's inside them fall into the steeply feeling cat of rhuntrippers i just cannot be any other way yet that the muted a performer unless that is the the stick to speak is is just not compelling ye ye and ism i love e were talking to days about ism the kind of ism tuning fork nature of emotions a a i what what a tricky balance speaking of that it'd to just return o some the i raised earlier and then i made the mistake it was my father of shutting the hatch on it and to reopen that hatch which is i when there is two parents maybe there under the same roof maybe there not for this is a to caretakers i kids are pretty darn good at figuring out who to go to for what and how to balance out negative experiences by seeking out the positive reinforcement of the other sometimes even pitting parents and caretakers against one another i mean makes children some diabolical but adults do it to it is called gossip what can to parents to caretakers i do to trying a line stratagems or if necessary to offset ism somewise bad stuff that the other parent my be doing in in to day's landscape were it is about fifty per cent of of marriages and a divorced seen you ask you will have the the situation were then t the is new significant others come in and now you have extended the landscape to sometimes five or six different parents m my families my bi loge of man my saying to look the you en we got many countries an religions an saying it is run nice on the one hand but i lots of divergence of opinion and emotional stands and background how in the world do e do we wrap our efforts around this ye i one of the most common questions i get from a parent at good inside is ligan you convince my partner why the way they do things is wrong and to things more i good inside and is tent i always say gam not firmly mes then ism not to interesting taking o ma but i do not et in virgin cup of ti an an that i you do not but but again assuming in you say this a couple times which i love ism assuming the way or a kind of partner or you to parent does things is not really damaging your child obviously not your really time for an inperevent yo hitting no emotional abuse exactly but even the ism not a believer of saying for a time you i i do not believe in time outs and punishments i i do not think they feel tot to kids or parents and i all to think they are effective not only the time outs not effective i do not think and i am we i should close the hatch on i have to imagine that the going a word in the profession of psychology and raising kits properly is you never spank om you never him senior the record sow maybe ill get back there but just to go on the hacker and i think you con sent from my style not punishing or time outs the does not mean you are permissive at all there's zero present permissive or even softness i think you known wit the softnessthere zero present permissive in those moments but we n get back there but let us ay your partner does do that or the parent right i i would be the first to say to some one do i think t that is i messing up your kid i i do not i really do not especially if for example n that situation let us say ism divorce and my now acts you know i just know the they do time outs or this and have tried to talk to them but whatever they are not getting on board with the style and to me what happens is you have a kid they come back to you and i papa gave me a time now and we do not do that in my house and my first thing it is i call my acts it's usury what i do or the school to this an i calls i call the acts in my why did you do that we do not do that what i think it is really importance and i act you find it very relieving to as apparent what's actually most important is helping my kid understand their experience we center the other person and what they are doing wrong wrong instead of centering or kid we might need to call apparent the otherpparent and say hey be really great to get on the same page could wed we do this course together o just be great you do not to agree with anything i think that would be great but in that moment what my kid needs actually is wait that is kind of hard confusing in our house when you do something you scream i hate you i intervene in one way and when you go to your dad's house the intervenes in a very different ways a lot of it is a lot of switching to make sense of or maybe my kid says am ma'am never apologizes to me after she yells i would call or maybe it is my own wife and o my hey no the importance offer pair have not you listen to oh this literature i would to have some influence on that but what i feel like my kid needs in the moment is he i tell me what happened oh oh she yelled at you and you la coming i know i know mamas i know head a rustle day at work and look this is not your responsibility but you can just know this mam has a really her time apologizing her has a really her time apologizing and actually when people hard time apologizing they seem cold and they do not care i actually usually feel ashamed of what they did and the reason ism telling you that is not because you have to take care of her but just the was not you and any time something happens with mam that does not feel good and you think you cannot resolve it you can talk to me and in to get out of roll play for see but they can see ism not throwing my wife underage buss at all but ism centering what my kid needs what my kid needs going back as they need to process that experience with in a dull they feel safe wit rather than been aloneness and i i often picture this kid on the couch who tells me a problem at their dad's house are at school and i like go off to make a call and i picture them alone being oh now alone i where is ski did not really want you to g do that i wen you to to listen to me there might then be a step to t a kind of get on the same page or when parents say get on the same page i think the problem is there we are not looking at the same page forget getting on the same page r not even speaking the same language my people say to me my partner will not even watch of video with me that i just want even even if they disagree that is the problem and frankly that is not a parenting problem that is also what it'll say to some one if you say to your partner look have been a member a inside and as been really helpful and it resist at and you love do agree with it but i would love to watch this four minute to you if your partner says no that is nothing to do with parenting that is a core relationship problem that they just do not hare to do something that you say is important to you that is that is a marriage problem that is awe right and i think it is really important and we talk of the symbolic if that was some one it'd coach them to say hey and you love to agree but if you do not come into watching a forming video with me an just talking about a little abet mi promise it'll try not to be judge your prove it'll just listen i really think we are ton my parking i think you are telling me you do not really respect me enough to do the things ism asking you to do and that will that will stick with me k that that is o ad handle it yes is very helpful ism curious about these guy h t dignity slash kids salt i loose diagnosis is stay these days am the years ago a can't counts for to kids back packing in a learn an important concept of ah when working with police and and tennis boys which is be a channel not a dam when there super energetic there not sitting still weds not nail you ow there is just no way am this notion of getting it out allowing some place for physical or emotional catharsis that say obviously am and that kid's a a lot of energy i mean dam it the the dull populations seems to be trying to progress themselves to have that energy how can we blame them for having much energy and a of course the our children have adults with clinically diagnosadiatie that really struggle but we are the kid that is more energetic a maybe even has a hard time sitting still to the point of discomfort and when the rest of the world that we cannot control is telling them what hay your kid is why ten to be regulated on the subway on the buss in the class room what are some things that we can do in terms of communication with those kids and propose some of those kids are listening as well amend to just be a channel not a damn to low their best expression to come forward ye i man i love this idea in general we it is much more effective to tell any one what they can do rather than telling them what they cannot do right across the board with kids because there is usually a can that is possible and the n you kin work with the urge instead of honor's what trying to suppress it or have it not act itself out its sour urges and feelings are forces the can i could not come out and yes i think this idea me and my kit are on the same team ere i think that is important to start with and ye get defflyenoug you locate o some attentional struggles like we are on the same teamed you can easily get into me against you and the you look to shut down anything everything about them but y i were on the same team it say it is hard to do homework right now i see you of they let us let us taken a mount of time and it seems you have a lot of energy let us do some heavy work or lets run outside and maybe mark always has to start after a period that may be they need a break but this idea of yet me working with my kid as supposed to against my kid is always can t be more successful do you think that some of the new emerging tool some of which have talked to lot about but many many people of talk to l about things meditation kids doing some long exhale breathing in addition to that the way i girl fills petite a recess tong run around crazy an do you think that these tools are helping kids gets some self regulation or is whatever self regulation their gaining offset by the fact that om the shut much more i put we hear much about the challenges of social media for adults but certainly for kids bullying only being one o the more sail one but also just aback you when they go home at night and there in bed their potentially still in interactions with their friends rest i a phone landmine that sometimes call one another on but i was not really much of a phone kid h with my friends you're home you're home you were separated from all that mean how bad is it and what are somethings it parkin tan kids might consider yet me meditation things that always icing on the are think that is always helpful and certainly like teaching kids real tools those are literally something i can do have learned this meditation i have a montressn that thee huge fan any have to be able touching some way but to me i think what was coming up as you bring up this larger point and it a she goes back to very started is the cost to children of parents not being able to set boundaries has never been higher and and at the same time has never been harder for parents to set boundaries and i think the stuff starts away before shall media to me can i think about the earliest years of a kid's live you get much bang for your buck in life from helping kids to learn to tolerate frustration and much of kids early life right now in the world to be living is all about the immediate escape from frustration and not only escaped from frustration but from frustration to gratification and an instant such fast how to that just happen it did not use to be that there was not even an option me an you i now you wanted o move on know maybe your parent could drive you to block buster if you had an account and then maybe anti i remember going b are the can have it i take can to have it and then you see the thing there is nothing behind him do not have it that whole o venter by the way was a video r just i just a a told gin butts to the i sometimes do this to inside ye absolutely i used to love going a pick out movies at that the we aces store what i you think about that is one tiny things i ma see tiny anything about i remember that my child had ants bout that tiny moment compared to some parallel in a kid the there is no frustration the want and the gratification there is zero space there is zero space and and also have to say our generation of parents and me to one honteperesent me to our tolerance for frustration has got away down because of the gratification world we live and which means our tolerance of our kids tantrums is tat a all time low because we are hay my life is pretty easy in a lot of ways this is a mass of inconvenience kids have more gratification than ever we have lower tolerances for frustration every one does which means the way we interact with kids over and over and over pushes the natural things there sprat their exposed to or not naplikters is block luster just means the circuitry around expectations and what feels good tie to me that is what really it scares me it does and figuring out how to tolerate or even in search we do inside frustration into your kids life as early as possible to me is is is is of critical importance i could not agree more and and i say that with the understanding that i hive also shorten the latency in my reward predictionerers which is nerved speak for i when i want watch him move going to tat fix in tat it is nor infinite and i can get right then the inner nets also slow than i start barking about u slow in an as worse than knowing an at and you now you start observing yourself he togo i caress what is going on ye me there is the ability to tolerate differing wait times between anticipation reward is critical that is wat getting in degree is about that is what doing anything challenging is about i have got on record saying that too much dopamine without effort exerted in order to get that dopamine is very detrimental well that to me in all the screen time kind of discussion there is much greentime and dial media and all the things that screen him em due to for kids and again my kids watchtevy and their young they have have had ism not a purist am a pragmatist and where's listening to this no one mess up their kids for ever i we can just wear time it before use thus information to make slightly different decisions on the margin that is t he best a gets but i the about is when our kits our special young and they are building the circuitry around what does it mean to get success what what are my expectations there how much effort drive to put in and i think about i young kid plains o mindless just dopa mean giving gain the circuit they learn is mindlessness zero effort dope and then i think and i find this my interesting how many people say their kid is six now having a really hard time learning how to read and all they'd learning asessimens and learning assessments are coming back no dyslexia i it and i know some me time hey say s that love is using i literally think this is the first time in this kid's life that this kind of have to put concerted effort with out in the moment success and you that that looks a lot of things it can can even present eighty h t right because it can present that it might be but it might also just be that these dopa mean circuits have developed in a way that is that is not conducive with something learning how to read ray and when parents ask me now now reading in demit skills what can i do when mi there younger i got them flashcard no flash carts ism young et flashcards that is fines not detrimental but to me it is li we what does my kids relationship with frustration because thy about the think a the learning space i gan i visual there is not knowing how to do something and then there is successfully doing something and the space in between this the learning space that is what learning is and learning the learning space inherently is frustrating that is the right feeling to be feeling and when kids have learned to collapse those two things then they do not have a lot of space to learn versus i do not know even something about my kid i wants til draw a rainbow or sun when they are young and that does not look a sun it would be easy for me to be lemme is do that for you and by the way yes i give myself permission to do that sometimes sometimes i cannot do wit this live got other things to do but sometimes i think long in that long turn greedy this sis can to be the same circuit for learning how to read it is enter learning ow to do that project and what if my only goal forget them drawing a sun and have got to tolerate the wining my only goal was just to lengthen the amount of time they let themselves be in that learning space that is it because i think we know is adults it is not about getting to success that comes when it comes the longer amount of time you let yourself be in that learning space the more successful you can be with hard things was it just as where you's got a traverse thrill and to me that is honestly on the things the most passion about teaching parents is literally what you do during that time then how do i change what my goal as if my goals snot make its tantrum man a collapse it but if my goal is just to lengthen that i might do nothing very different all drawing a set that is not your right you din want a draw that drawing a circle is hard make it can you do it for me can you do at of course sometimes i will but i might say like i not can i do it sweet ism not why because i know you can do this a little more i feeling you and i think this is powerful to say because this is frustrating and that is the exact way you should be feeling you do not want a wins to be you that is the right feeling it'll even draw that learning space visual this is where you're in o this is where you ware your doing in amazing job and it is actually interesting when is or young like they actually do a dope that some one said to me have been doing for a while my did literally says to me i to do hard things ma'am but this they believe it that is an amazing self belief to develop melon tori yes i think the stuff especially compared to how easy it is to get that gratification is just it is more point than ever to have an offset y ism a doing my best to get the word out into the world that the only reason the brain changes at all is if am there is these her modulators epaneferand a adrenalin in the body in brain because that is what signals that the nervous system needs to change if something can be accomplished there is no reason for the nervous system to change by definition there is also i don want to seen off into a and ism no science of resilience in will power lessen your be there is some amazing literature that am shows that there is this are of the brain that entered singular quartan which as activated when people do things they do not want to do and it generalizes to other things but this is not that i love to work out si in a work out this is the i hate to work out and i do it anyway and it translates to success in academic never is successor all sorts of environments and i think i the beauty of it is that this brain structure is highly plastic and can be built up through one thing in that translates to others doing hard things experiencing a what i call limbic friction just as as a gate way to learning just understanding that it it always feels hard yet that is what learning is in fact i can remember in graduate school even as a young adult i'mtwenty as i was struggling with an analysis am am my graduate adviser i she was wonderful this way in i at she clearly knew how to do it an i said am can you explain how to do this and she goes no no was i visit donate is no it is called learning i walked out she is also great parent am to her children a man all try to get adopted by her and that failed there are time that chart exactly my poor parents they they did their best anti's grateful to them for many things but i think that ism including the the encouragement to do hard things do things it such am that are beneficial for us since it it is it is a life edge rig know ism reflecting it is do things it suck i believe you it such and then what what o my comes to say a lot hate me now love me later now i loved her then an and a lover now but yet there were moment has i that your making me do this am i not know what the hate me now love me o school ah but i think what she is trying to say is i have your best interest in mind definitely let's it right definitely ye no definitely ah can i say one thing is consort in my head e one of the things and is i think it is easy and ism hearing myself we hear this and it it is easy to listen o man i never thought about of that way ere i don't know that or again we spiral is apparent fast i as to make it for ever nobody must up their conferer it does not matter how that is is not true and this is what i think we conspire a until yet what is wrong with me and i kind of assparents in the situation till come with me to a different location which is kind of anger and have starred to feel angry and i think angry and girlie tells us what we need what is that anger telling me it is it is messed up the system is act against us that when you become apparent it is literally the hardest most confusing most triggering most important job we have and we are given zero resources red nobody i know would tell a surgeon who never went to me school and was struggling at surgery that they were a bad surgeon they would e o you probably you probably deserve to go to me school and residency by the way that is an important job you have and i think its easy to listen to all this in spiral until oh no but it'd ask you almost feel a little protective helpful anger next to it which is i oh yes this is an important job i have this is complicated and maybe their resources out there that i deserve and i think that that is the perspective out ask parents tollisen from really you describe the job of parenting as boundaries i imparting boundaries as well as empathy and validation as don't remind people that your bit very basic but very practical ah job description for parenting is something that i think we can return to over and over again it also makes me wonder ah you thinking about the am generalizeability of these concepts to other forms of relationship bout the relationship to self i i something we do not often talk about yes a relationship to self we we want to have boundaries and we also want to be able to empathize and validate ourselves ye and i think greatly i do not know my friend and vote me and i found shout she had five friends for a dinner and hush ah you know her i would i would say to me thou i believe myself ism about to feel that way i think our feelings love when we tell them they make sense i to think the sing magical about that phrase t makes sene them upset i mean my friends are all there and i was not that that makes sense and and there is a boundary cause when my feeling tells me ism about to plan a dinner party for two hundred people and if i every one i know but her i feel there is important k feeling a not a not ton let you go that far and the image i always think about is om the driver of my car and all the different feelings and urges their passengers and we cannot get them out of the car you just camp there in your body but you do not want to let them take over the driver seat that is really what it is and as long aether passenger the referee will not cause you that many problemsthey will be annoying g and to me that is hey i see you i see you and i will often say high on my feelings for that reason high anxiety that wile me up before in the morning yes there is a lot of my mind high and then there's a boundary you are not your part of me and not all of me i think that phrase for regulating our own feelings you are part of me and not all of me is the essence of validating and having a boundary what about our need i think healthy need to know whether or not the lesson stock not have observe this before a kid is catastrophizing about and up coming event may be a concern tor a test or homeward thing or a social thing and go you would using all our best tools to try and help them and i believe you i hear you that and i go through the experience and they do pretty well they have even great and then we say did you notice you were concern before and you did it it really did it is there something that we canner should you to try and stamp down that that recognition because one thing that beautiful about childhood is the short term horizon nature of childhood which helignet try not we talk about you will adults trying to get one day at a time or even half a day at i a kids are navigating on the basis of first period class ye secondary class ah they there their horizon is often very close in and i do wonder if they are internalizing these these more global lessons on their own or whether not we should a try help them internalizes what they just did you get it you were superconcerned you welly almost dissolving to a puddle of your own tears and i believe you that was the complete response then and now you did it think about that is it good that we reenforce this those those winds ye i mean i think that i think our kids do internalize can the patterns right but but i hear your there these moments most we went ncapsilatid for that mike hate i was a thing right i think kid's pick up and wether a inter actions were doing something for them or for us if it is from a hey that thing i talk you is really helpful right it would just be if my husband was hey your pesentationment well because i told you to do that thing and it'd be stop talking to me right but if he said to me heroic what was it that led to that is proxy that is helpful to talk out have be much more open i love the phrase going back to just real tools ism noticing i think actually often we want praise our kids or tell something just saying ism noticing as again we want to be seen we do not want to feel controlled ism noticing does that hey ism noticing you are worried about this test we kind of talked about this way of talking to your anxiety and and then ism just noticing you felt really good about how it warlike even that i think as that is the biggest thing now and are crazy fast world real revenge just pausing to notice that is already i captivating or said your kid and and i think i got questions only a question when you do not know the answer i sometimes we ask quest that they are just they have question marks but s a statement or criticism of we say to our kid that that thing i taught you was really helpful right you think that that what was helpful that is not really a question we already have an answer if i say hey i dues not o be good for us to talk through for a second what was it you think that led you to really feel good that day in the test then if i really do not know what my kid could say i think tell receive it and then they might say oh as that thing we talked about that is great to know ism even thinking about punish coming up and i wondered you think that would think i wonder is also a great phrase for parents just wondering i wonder if the would be helpful there again they just lower defensiveness cause there is here there is movement with wondering does not feel controlling i ye i think i think there is tike t those are nice moments if it comes from a place of connection not from control i make sens we to guess on this podcast we so headman permit his a world expert in emotions and ism she explain that in cultures were there is more new ants language for different emotions rather than the what i call the notification of emotions there is better emotion tolerance understand that is not just sad happy depressed i thrilled but there is a lot on new aunts it is or context dependent ism can be very useful do you think there's something begin for from letting kids explore the range of emotions not just how do you feel good or bad i mean most adults me to learn the good or baker valuations that is not actually in emotion ye had is not aching expression how you feel but that is what we do for short hand uni do you think that what is to say in the united states but elsewhere perhaps as well that there is some value to teaching kids to pay attention what is going on inside ye what is this feel in of what i call anxiety is it excitement and anxiety what being able to better pin point what one is coping with but also the positive aspects of emotion yes i mean i as many i in the conical psychologist the question how do you feel i always find like a very a lot of fresher i do not know i think that i i tent not o ask my kid that but i get also never to have ask patients that i think what we are getting at as we want and i thinks relates brazilin grazilians is durability in my mind to tolerate the widest range of emotions as possible cause as humanswere in a feel that will range the more of them you have learned tolerate the better off you will be and says what i want for my kids i do not know if the has to explicitly come from naming although think that point is deftly true the more things we can name he more things we can understand to me just showing up for your kid in a way that is with believing may be with boundaries is probably the best way to help your kid tolerate the widest strange of emotions cause they learn every emotion can be held in connection with some one else verses held in aloneness than is bad s i guess that is what i think thought we could talk about adolescence and teenagers a specifically teenagers are wild i we say that the single most dramatic aging event and the most rapid rate of aging that we ever experience is puberty i may just fundamentally brain circuits that were for one thing or that were torment change and come alive in ways that the world forever will look different to us if feel different to us and our self perception changes period that something that bill just still understand it a level of hormones and an hypothalamic circuitry but that u has really not been matched to a psychological understanding in miss verse nothing is quite the music you listen to when your teanagerit brings you back the memories you form plosive negative stamp down boom now and for ever the emotional sailings can change but those are wild years what are some of the more critical needs of at adolescence and means that nor actionable ye and meme just my seniors were were crazy but even if their less crazy they are always crazy yes yes and one of the reasons i think they least in america that adolescent seen as such a huge shift my kid is at a control they are always you they are always rejecting me i actually do not think is unrelated to the behavior control approaches that are inherent in america parenting cause you referred to your kid becomes fourteen and they kind of realize we om bigger than one of my parents we do not care about their stick or charts any more and we might of miss fourteen years of building a relationship and what that kids adolescence is going to look is markedly different then if for those past fourteen years you ware not giving in everything no but you are leading in a sturdier more connected way i really think this whole idea that america adolescence reject everything i actually think not all of it a part of is completely developmentally normal but a big part of it relates to this tradition of behavior of control that kids cannot rejected till there at the age that they kind of could survive on their own which is adolescence i think that is rally important the things i would tell parents to really keep in mind that are critical number one is related that a team's job is to separate and to start to form their own identity and i think there is a couple things about that parents need to know number one i do not think we prepare parents enough for the true sense of loss they feel when their kids are adolescence because that is very real you just spent all these years and you have driven them t every soccer and they kind of talk to in the back sea it maybe you a family moving nights and then all of a sudden they do not want any of that and it just important perentionalli ism ism going to feel sad ism going to feel loss an if we do not know to expect it we often kind of infuse that into a lot of anger toward or kid and i u think that is normal and we so talk about that more parents about olecentyu to be talking out that with each other of course you miss that that is totally normal number too related to that separation you thing about identity formation the cure's a kid an us in when kind of close and the now are at the stage we are developmentally their job at that stages figure who they are they have to over correct let you have to kind of over correct in the amount of space you take because it smelly the only way you can figure out was my i do want to take parts of that that parts oke and i think that is a powerful image to think about they are moving far away that distance they take from you is not their final point they will move closer now going ma loss not as close as they used to be and that it is different but that is not that is this is their way of then to figure who they are mi then the last thing it'd say that kind of relates that image is even as they move away i think parents massively under estimate how much they still need us there making efforts to connect and i way think the difference titmice and explorer in a nomad is whether or not you have a homemade and fourteens feel nomads is not a good situation they are explorers they try a million different things but they they really do need us they they need to know that they have a home and ism it'll never forget my private practice i i used to work with tens not the long just tan sometimes the parents too and this team came to me in this is extreme head been really in a in a in a bad place with her parents intense intense conflict an they got in this huge fight and she is really really upset she is describing this ma i n in s i get we c you out wan i was u sit sit er less anangan and that she like i i cs no i flam the door it was an couple minutes later open the door made rain can you believe they were not there can you believe they were not there and to me it was just the light and again it is not about being a punching bag but i under an this her seeming anger an her intense pain we are close together in her own story that is just over and over the same thing their gunner reject you they are going to say get out of my room and yes it socks but they want you to slip a note under their door after you have taken a couple minutes a says that was really tough her well that o out of control you are a good titan i love you and i in just tall parents of means you are going to do that there is teen o be a pass and then you will hear them rip up the note you will not and i wear to any parent that that still resinated and your kit is again trying to fix ore how to i stake close with my parents and figuring out my own partway i am sly they rip up the note because they they almost have to do it till i cut take in how much they are still desperate for those bits for connection sounds a lot yum the dynamics of adult relationships although hopefully hopefully with a little bit less dramatic i a accentuation yo u but even even if it does o inside these these circuits that are laid down in childhood early childhood they persist right i mean i think if anything has become clear to me an underlying brain development and brain function its that we do not discard circuitry for attachment and go that was for mam and this one was for dad and that was much for the dog and u and then the romantic relationship is different w purpose the circuits men all the beautiful work on child hood attachment that is robbing translate to adult attachment a may i realize theirs new wants to it but no i was reflecting a bit on this again incredibly potent u phrase or mention of explorers verses no mats of having a home based thinking about these psychology experiments were children are observed in the present of their caretakers sometimes the strange situation task when idler set kids are separated from the moms then mom in child typically on nowadays there it is also been on with other caretakers and days reunite one does not even have to know about those experiments all you have to do is go to a park were be out in public an see a little toddler venturing away from parent and then what o they do every once in a while they look back they are just trying a check to make sure thee there even the kids that taking off on the tricycle crazy yes we will eventually stop and look back it is this fundamental circuit we are looking back and how far they feel they can go is in direct relationship to presently the number of times that they recharge that they read that they recharge and were able to see that ah that verification that the parent was still there i think this notion of explorers vows is nomads and being an explorer obviously being a good thing a healthy thing within reason an no mads just feeling a drift untethered yes no one of t one of the carious words at least to me in in the english language the note under the door ye it included the words i love you i do not want to get to a detailed here but those words sometimes are never spoken in our home sadly a sometimes are spoken often and under many circumstances that one wonders do they lose their potency uh but i know it in that note they it finished i love you it is ore standing at the end of the day no matter what u a probably even what you do venom have on been in the presence of parents of kids that were criminals that did horrible things they still love their kids reminding kids that under any in all circumstances yen again and i think what is critical was our brain collapses that does not mean you think their behaviors o say and i get the fear i would never one to send my to the message that it is o say o quote do certain things i that hit is o gator to screen at your parents of course it is not o kakis just think we miss that habit thine that happened already if i drop my phone in a broke and i was trying to understand i broke try to understand that does not mean it say that i dropped it it just that doesn't it it just dropped they could already happen now at he know and ye our kids need to know they need to know that they are loved and that again there is kind of liking that message i think i still see you are a good kid under that moment and i actualythey get's a powerful strategy for every parent to kind of conjuror a a good kid image what is it was tat that last time we were playing this game and it was just finger is it a memory of my kid when they were three and i do not know they did this really keep thing and a kind of really crystallizes that and even under this bad behavior that kid that instill there and the kids the kids who behave the worst are in the deepest paint and the adults t o and that is not the say it is o say but if again what ho mut relationships we want to be in if you've a relatsihip with your than that is not one you are this is toxic this is my kid and to be in a relationship with them remembering that they are in painters are in a lot of pain there exploring a new world frankly right now means have world we do not understand it that is helpful for parents to approach your than just as a tangible tools i you not there is many things in your world that i do not understand and frankly probably i might like criticize or judge can you take out your phone this whatever it is this a your on this video came we just even time boxes five minutes i just when it end this conversation saying i understand it better i promise you that is probably an do more for your relationship wit your kid than anything else because yes they do and they might project you and if you do again do not take the bat but ask again next week again they they do they need us too return if one things fore sure none of us except those that our means know what it is to be a tea major and twenty twenty four just it in know what is to be a tea major for me in the lady's early nites ah how could the i i ah what what your thoughts on i family meetings once a week we sit down we checking y i hear the people do this may protustipate in these before ah bit you feel those can be useful it es it more window dressing i mean i guys it depends was happening in there cumin the idea hay there is lock going on in our life and we have a ritual of coming together and talking things through working through problems if that is what s that is a beautiful thing i hear that my first thought as i should do that am but you are right life gets messy but if it is done in a way where it feels we end and everyone feels a little bit more understood and a little bit more purpose and making things me forward in a positive direction that is amazing i think family meetings it is an ant the way i think bout them coffin which is just different is it is actual a great stray especially wen your kids are older and on there is somewhat of an on going conflict ho maybe there is an on going conflict o much video gave time or how much they how late they can stay out and to say to a kid and again these just comes from again some point for means we have to approach your k kid we on the same team i me and my kid against a problem not me against my kid where they are the problem and to say hay you have been late or we have to fig out your cur feel and look you are a smart kid you are a good kid my number one job is to keep you safe but you are old now and if i just tell you a time since same thing the happen last year who can get in fights all year what not we sit down and we we will do what i do o my office there is two people the each have ideas ism to bring a pat of paper and that's ectuly superimportant and am a wright down all of your ideas and my ideas and the were just con to con to go through and cross out the ones you don't feel completely in reasonable and have a feeling when we do that we are in to come to a good place again you can see there is that hope ism giving i hold the positive outcome same team ism giving my kid credit in advance is uctnlic really success usually the opposite of what tens feel which is just my parents do not even listen to me our care and think they have all the answers have heard this notion of you o couple parents come fired and kids comes second a tat and some people pi what ell clearly never parented a well no actually it is an interesting idea perhaps not corrector in correct but may be dynamic across time where the real question is if kids know that they are running the family in terms of what they do or their inability to not be attended to et camera is driving the whole relationship that the parents are in ye verses you know recognizing and her imaging to parent home but we tuckered out divorce for people with significs another or single parent homes n then all of those get a wonder or kids really paying attention to how much they are being prioritize to the point where if they observe their parents tending to their own needs that they feel deprivation or it make them feel safer hey mum and or dad are taking care of themselves and can show it better yes i think that is critically important and a kind of goes again to boundaries of apparent like my relationship with my kid is important and ism not in o let that take over me tike that is not all of me i am not only a care giver to my am to my kid i i would stand by that all day long as that important part of me and it still a part of me and i think this is really important to own as a parent cause again we tend to get aptly we get apologists for it are we look for our kids permission will say look i need to go out with dad without you hey we have a relationship to and we again there is that job confusion and my kid feels that and again it is that kind of giving them too much power have said this to my kids a lot as that why do you out would dad without me it is a great question you do not first of all dad and i were married before we had kids our relationship is really important to us and we of being with you and being with you is different then just being the two of us and that really really matters to us and you enough to be happy about it you can you and let the have a baby that i know they are safe with you can cry when i leave and the babies thetteral hold you and organ got to dinner and organ a come back and you will see one morning yet i think that is important i actually think his anther topic i this toxic of rage an parent it is a big topic the way why i why do i get to these moments of rage often that my screaming its not just screaming in my kids it is really rainfall and i think the parents often who are the most vulnerable to that are the ones where they are not make there not meeting any of there non care giving needs which make sense that a part of them is screaming now what about me i use to what a dance class i used to see friends i used to go out with my partner and talk about things other than our kids and again if i think a kids need a sturdy leader right more than anything else and sturdiness is not allowing yourself to be taken over by any one thing including your relationship with your kid is it truly better for their to be two sturdy leaders than one sturdy leader i realize this is a controversial question i mean i know and i know there is research back this up at having one and of sturdy leader in your life is massively protective i really believe that and when parents will say my partner is not my we have research is true is two better than one i do not know their research probably i don't know but what i think is important in their too is it what is not great for kids is having all the caregivers be somewhat perfectly a tuned caregiver right that actually does not set up your kid for life at all right because i soft know anyone who thinks the partner omen to be with one days can be perfectly a tune to all my needs let me go find that person you have one sturdy leader you have to but be sturdy part of that is you are on you are gin a rupture you are in a rupture your can a mess you are gonna hopefully repair after but sturdiness as when make there is not the same as perfection perfection is creepy it is not a thing i now ye withal to that we presume to noon the pot canopy that yet the notion of profession is is kind of creepy but sturdiness is anything but creepy that their istististi beautiful word for all the right reasons what about behavioral examples in parents for instance if children observe parents om ben affectionate to one another in appropriate ways right you attending to one another in in boundary but empathically tune ways do you think that projects forward into their notion of of what a do not relationships are and should be conversely if parents are yelling at one another do you think that projects forward into it is locate a yelling ado not relationships you am in i yet think kids are their expert notices they notice everything where it is part of how they have learn to survive as such helpless human they defy notice they definitely act sponges yes of your you no kind of privilege enough in that way to go up in home or you've parents to in general are affair affectionate they take responsibility for there stuff they communicate and out the way i think that is a true privilege you go into a tolthood with yes the other extreme right you grow up with parents wo they yell or they can even yell scary voices again what i thinks really important is the witnessing of that is not going to be as in sackful to a kid as the witnessing of it and nobody naming it an talking then about it this a bi often kidswell be in difficult stages and tense tan drums major she is at scholar and as i woo do i do what do i do at this well i give you all the strategies in the world but if that is just your kid's wave kind of manifesting all f their struggles with this huge maid of conflict hats happening it is not can work it is all part of the same system and saying to your kit after you fight with your partner hey i think you are adding n i screaming and ism sure that fell scared cause it does fell scared because they know you are their base if their basis of a house is feel an earthquake if feel scared and another line i is i you were right to notice that we were using lot voices again i think that is massively confidence you knot building maybe what was that for you or you have a little kid just that is enough you known they might look at you and say time i snack now but it is still really sunken if there is a lot of conflict again and they is really important the we talk about that with our beats d do not leave them along what about teens that are really wayward and this could be behavioral outbursts there is also the whole underside of this thing where it is also about withdrawal we i kits are withdranomy we were tying about outbursts and yelling there is also the example in parents or the instances in kids that it is really withdrawn yes that there just disengaged depressed depressed maybe even dissect of who knows but not good and this can show up on one end is violence on the u other end is isolation and it can shop as eating disorders at nonstop as all sorts of things intervention before age eighteen is conical easier in the sense that one has legal control but oftentimes it is hard for parents to know how bad is this and you know i did not entire episode about anabas and nights to spoke to some of the medical benefits of anabas for adults who are not antics but i also talk a lot about some of the risks but let us take an example that thing is pretty common kits fifteen sixteen starts smoking some t h a with their friends and yocoever and does that coco not a a call which i think is lame argument as this is lame does not many sense get you cannot kit by a you carry in was going hit by train but o ka but the point is most all parents o k the clearly there self medicating cannot they think they cannot stop them but you cannot stop them what what point do you then take you put them into a residential treatment program if you could even afford that i mean it is really tough for people to know how much to intervene in what is clearly not good behavior in and sometimes can be bad behavior and it the kids are using its o self medicate and there is a pier system that sometimes reinforces that and this a huge landscape y may we have you back to talk just about this but but om maybe we can oppresses that discussion but by m what you tell people in your you are practise i get in the now to the emergency could and get this manifold word you say listen you just got a work with the work with the sister in tall problem on throwing at you you ha i think the first thing is like kowtow is a parent kind of even a less is this is this normal is it not morel is hat a problem is it not i think there is a couple things we could think about there number one just seeing impact on over all functioning is always a one barometer right okay can my child perform the kind of tasks of their developmental stage ski this is not the only thing but are they still going to school while i noticeince they smoking they are smoking lot of weeds they're greedy went from bees todies okay they do not care about school any more they used to actually go out with friends now unless they are with this one crew where they smoke in the park they are not even seeing these kids they used to be friends what they soft want go to family functions any more they used to place soccer if i answer is i while ism not really talking just about a marawana problem ism talking out my kid not engaging and kind of the developmental tasks that i would say is just it is time to seek additional support right another sign is just kind of how how limited their world has become because of this right again is this kind of taking over everything they do my kid is depressed let us say or and all the sudden their world has got in really really small and it is not just that that is the way they have always live there is a big there is a big change the amount of conflict in the home again is there conflict when you have means of course there is but well is it really hard to talk to my than for more than four minutes walking on egg shells to me is also a sign that we need additional help and mi scared to intervene in a way that would actually be in line with my values that is not a good sign right then the other thing i one i may share my noses o me seeking additional help is a sign of every single thing that is right with a family and i think we think it is a sign of something that is wrong and it is also a sign of what is right to your in terms a messaging that to your kid again i think about a kid who i used to saw we my practice who's proved sixteen to came to me she was cutting serious i a lot right i remember saying just and take haling of been doing this he's two years o i did you see another therapist before you saw man us now shows very kind of kind of puppy and quick and have just why and just well i told my parents that if they took me to a therapist i would go and i would just place all their money i be quiet and the when they left me there i would thieve and who is in a stop a fourteen year old from walking away and they might as well save their money because they cannot meet me i and again i just kind of sense to stay quiet and shes seriously one of the next thing she said is can you believe they let me make that decision literal said that well validates everything you tat of gentleman it is this is why this is where i like i it my best ideas that is right a fourteen year old can convince her parent that she will not go to therapy when she is cutting that that is not of and again then we go to okas on mi say to m can you are going i might know there is much between that where in these binary states your kid's feelings about therapy cannot dictate your boundary i but we cannot just then come down harshly and i coach parents in this all the time what you say to kid i love you here me i love you we are in a tough stage i see this problem and i do think evenwhen our kids get older we can say this my number one job is to keep you safe it is not to keep you happy with me and i actually love you much that ism willing to do things that make you unhappy with me that is actually how much i care about you and i am on to be driving you and if you won curse et me the whole time it'll sit in that waiting room and yo men do the next week an i tell you i love you eminent do the same thing and i think a holds hearing that on some level there is some internal truth probably need that feels oddly good because there is ism not messing around but there is is way where is parent you si the way to show my kid ism not messing around is to be mean to them there is nothing mean about what i said i think it was more loving then saying to a kid o say let me know when you want to go that is not loving and i think fourteen sometimes in those moments they need us to do our job and be the pilot they it is the small amountimewhere there still a passenger when they are eighteen they are the pilot and we have this window s nothing a won pro moreen to that i think youyou captured it beautifully an i get's back this is her safety why yes an letting them make their own decision when there clearly in trouble if anything to make a kid feel unsafe a teen or or younger or dust it is that yes yes si glaring the passage on we instead of a rerouting how but you just come up here and fly that is eke that is exactly that is literally what it is and they are i cannot believe you believed my little protest now ism in the cockpit the they do not thy don't want that that is why they are words teen's words it is not that we do not believe them like the santuscan be in believing they are words often are a representation of their fears all of us in are worst moments get out i feel sometimes that is their fear we're there kind of talking to their emotion they are sit likethey are normally talking to you and that moment they are deregulated and just learning till kc not take it literally and be what am i really believing my kit isn't pain they are cutting my kit isn't pain there smoking weed thirty times a day and do not to to classic ism the i know that they that they need help and again any parent who can say that to me is the star wrong guest parent and that is such a sign of health i do not think it'd still a be alive to day if it was not for anonparent mentors and just examples in the world these are not always people that w ha i ma take you under my way pure went tor ashes rarely the case but people in my real live for in my reading or other was not you two back then but sometimes now young people give i ma each fan forincest of that these a you we in psychologist names hollies who has these beautiful lectures on om making a life and ism learning much i a consider moment sir names you did not have a choice you are your mentor but these people that we can internalize certain healthy aspects that are parents just just apparently cannot seem to arrange for themselves and that we wish they had but i think that we am as children of all ages we want perfect parents we do not get them but it seems appropriate to me at of your thoughts it seems appropriate to me to have v a foraging for examples of were we can get certain things that we can internalize for ourselves that we can benefit that may be our parents just are not interested in capable of or even alive to provide us any more ye yet i mean that being everything to some one i do not want my kids to ever say that about me mi ma was everything she fulfilled my every need again i i do find that creepy whenever or now and and just setting them up for much relationship disappointment am my mam gave some things and you now we now that i a work a at as on is my kids there is this mam when kids have a sleep over her house i mean it is the asleep over experience icy pictures on my out that was thoughtful that was amazing she is she puts it she is creative and me my kids chilled like nearly get mom you dear bottom of the list and not stuff and i am i am and i know ism toward the top of the list and other things i do not i do not want to be toward t torso i want all myself to that standard that is a great way to employed ye being able to say to my kid oh you has one of us keep over you would rather go to her house cause that is oh i that some indictment of me and may be this is some quit men to are figure of fir someone you can put these details and make people fail really takin care of in that way that is great and i think guest give me your kid permission an encouragement again i think of such a gift to them later on ye our relationship with our kids becomes not only the foundation they are expectations fur their relationship with other belts men i also think is bitterly what they are attracted to think when they are attracted to someone later on is just the activation of that earliest attachment and if they can get active ate round some one who seems to be pretty attuned and respectful and validating and boundary because they also of other things in their life and not everything that is a privilege to say that is what ism expecting i think those other relationships and as a parent to hear your kids and my coach taught me this thing and someways they say it in a caddy way much better then what you said to do at la cross just a take a deep breath and again this is were you can say ism still a good parent even outside this moment that is ism glad you are talking to me about this i believe you tell me more about this such a beautiful example for kid some being able to validate and embrace the fact that there other sources of healthy up bringing am is ye unjust perhaps is is clearly a good thing to at right i think that is right and i think if that is hard for a parent but it'd say is they git is a question without an exact answer abligward where did i learn that ism supposed to be everything to some one and is that and i think a lot of women we learn that in our families of origin to be good girls which really just means have no wants and needs my own and i just kind of gaze out and see how i can do things for you and i can be everything for you another we have kids we do not realize we put that on to them the tike you said those patterns travel with us and i find it very believing maybe i if i do not we i just gave me a good percentage of energy back i can mi can do many other things now it is very it is empowering of it something that it is an unpleasant topic just by as soon as people hear the word but it is something the think it comes up on that child side the seaside in the parenting side and do not relationships of all kind which is the dreaded entitlement dirty word and parenting and entitlement ah then we can put some definition on entitlement and talk about am when it is bad is it always been a when it is neutral and when it is em no is it every good it is title it does not stow like bison do but yet i health there is a healthy entitlement rand i think that is kind of the entitlement till ism allowed to want things and ism a lea allowed to a moment's my life even act on that to turn that want into a fulfilment of my want i think that actually goes back to who we are just saying first is how can i please you maybe i want to do something i think that healthy entitlement that is a good thing when i think i when i hear parent say please its do not want an entitle kid they're not talking about that right and they are talking bow and to me this story for my practice is just the key thing that makes us parents cringe was this family of seeing your city and they they were there very wealthy and they ad the sixteen year old son and they're flying back from ho or two who they are just getting ready to board and first class is boarding and the sun goes up and there its we were not they can first glass we have to wait an a basically a full tantrum in the apart every parents for at nightmare literally and it came to me after it is being a cow did we how did we get here right now this is a family in generals sure they they flew first class they private play ans had a lot of you know money but entitlement to me does not always have to be about body ism t give you my definition of entitlement i thing is very different but to me the definition boundaries is useful because it gives you a pathway of what to do i think in riflemen is the fear of frustration beautiful because i we go back okay that thing did not start at sixteen and if we we started on i started concollecting stories and right this is a kid who the and again they had a driver the nothing root having a driver but ism just thinking about waiting for a subway frustrating just miss the subway for on o beat now right this was a kid who did not make is sad i see not i remember the make the location do not writ we have someone who in to take you to the near by town new jersey and get on that socratine right ism and i think about what this kid started to learn about being frustrated and it was kind of frustration comes up and what gets layered next to it is someone else bringing you an exit frustration exit from frustration maybe even exist to success right another i turn to think that what would it be if there is sixteen years of kind of exist is habit of that pattern and not circuit reinforcing cause what you are really learning as a kid ism frustrated and that is very overwhelming for me but the adult surround me must be scared of my frustration because they will not let me sit in it they will not let me feel it they will actually kind of run in circles to to not have me feel i actually in code my frustration next to fear now ism sixteen and ism expecting first class and i get you n a lowly cod it is not people are it oh what a spoiled kiddie i actually i i feel this kid was the insanely vulnerable in that moment this kid was ism frustrated and what i expect to happen and what i know to happen is not here and it is explosive it appears as entitlement on the surface but is a deep intolerance and almost fear of frustration which is in your body your terrified of a feeling that is living in your body and it looks demanding because it kind of is desperate you cannot let this happen fear frustration as the definition of entitle wen a fence wake square in the bulls eye for me and yes i thing we all default to the count of stiritypical example of the the ultra wealthy family kid others that will be the toy n the ties is really dreadful concept ishaoun a kid that was just given everything and then wanted a person is really talk about foul i muse to say it just bad at every level an then they try to you create this narrative were then there is a deeper understanding about humans and of get calls from it but but the starting point was and i have observe this in certainly not my family but other families were kids are given everything they want it never feels enough this surprise don pe me it is a real thing the circuits recalibrate to a higher threshold they want more and more and more s that more wall street what is your number more o i i am nothing wrong with wanting things an but with without it a sealing on any of that and without a a sealing on in pleasure bounds on experience it crushes everybody that is also without move you as about it just crushes people to build that into a child's neurology just seems the worst possible thing and because it is not about the world being a place of immense possibility it is about the world being a place of of snakes in broken glass everywhere except this narrow life edge path that you follow that is all about infinite resources and ease that is fright and it when i think as fear is cause if you are in fear you are in a threat state which is wait when kids are in the say or adults it seems la nasty an it is men when your and there's just narrowing of your eyes fright i think that is really what is happening and it is not it is not always tied to money but the truth is an money can easily buy a kid's way out of frustration and by the way it buys the parent out of having to tolerate their frustration while the kid is frustrated and it is tricky i think have have now you do not talk to a bunch of parents who grew up an a very different way were very successful and i get it there i feeling give have ear i literally have earned the right to have certain part of my life feel lie easier right and how to i though not how to i raise a kid who isn't entitled right and it is a conundrum right ink i not think we raise our you raise our kids in a candy store it is hard to expect them to appreciate candy right and how to we how to we bound gratitude the entitlement and i do think though that ideas we just have to sometimes other people hearing this to be gallic my life is frustrating all the time and some peoples are right they will not end up with entitlement but for other families they do not have o be i i have to dost i have to make sure my kids literally have experiences and i prat we have to go through it too were we are lost purposefully making sure they get enough of that they can build different circuits yes much unpack there i i think it is clear that some of this is tied to financial means i think it is a it is a pretty scary thing when some one looks out on the landscape the world as infinite possibility without any frustration as we tach but early r the ability to lean into hard things as as a skill that can extend other things is is valuable do you think that some of the smaller practices that any kid any parent any family regardless of means can lean into can really other some people say grace or prayer before meal others simply express gratitude but you a stopping thinking about mean being breathing bring being ambulatory being any number of good things that allow us agency in life about to food i mean those those moments i i think i think i i know that our a nervous system reflects almost yet how could they not and just recognizing that it least something went into the creation of the meal i think for the entitlements up on the frustration there is all these small moments that we monster to make at difference and i think it is sane yourself just as i can does not mean i will my kids young and i pick them up from a play and i that they have a babies at out home or my husband at home and in have to go to a store in some errands may it can you drop me off first mig be i i no you are on to come with me on ism not can say this i on boring errands because you just have to tolerate that sometimes you have to do things you do not want to do on your not in a learn nap by me telling me that you begin a learn tat by experiencing that it something with my heads on o the other day we are at an air part ism there you know in the report a kind of wines around to get and there is no one there they starts duck under all the things and just made me think as a small woman entitlement also is the rules do not apply to me an some ma ones and i dismember it e goes when we are an air port to that the the lines it leading up to security ye you cant down tat you mass them up and it was not for ever but ills you as i these things some one put these here for a reason and we are just con a it is like these things are tore sot such it is a small amount of frustration but just i do not always get to duck the line sometimes i have to walk a little longer or i remember my kid saying and ism not a mine to this i am in a financial position were i have some one come sometimes help me be my housekeeper right and colorful the laundry i remember on a sundae my sun said to me in is young i why do we have to fold the laundry kind of i a that ye said it meters kind of do not we have some one who could do that and i remember being this is a mailman i we are in a fold the laundry on sundaes who loves folding laundry may be some people i do not i do not love on doing the water it is inherently not that enjoyable but an sun frustrating as just not great and i know i need to make my kids do that it they just have to go through that mundane thing and i think there is all of these moments taking yo kid with you on errands doing the longer right before you say to your kid let us go to try out on another socratym like oh you do not make the team maybe ma be let ut go two days that is at least two more days of feeling upset and frustrated right they do not to be these big grand things that all of those little moments can at up and really positive way what is your stands on household chores and should kids be paid for household chores yes i have a whole guide to chores and allowance and i actually i think there is a lot of all hour they be separate know i think it could be done either way but to me the question for parent is what is the point for me what is my goal for chorus what is my goal for allowance right and i think that has to then structure how we do it my guesses for chores part of it is i want my kid to number one may be held around the house one them o have that purpose also i know for me for chores like sometimes your life involves doing firing things that is just true and i want my kids to know that which means have to experience that that is one of the reasons we do chores for me if that is one of the reasons ism not in a pay my kid because for me in my family what i think my kids me to get out of it is just knowing that sometimes you do boring things as part of being good human for some one else that might be totally different i they you just ask ourselves as parents one of my trying to accomplish and then let me structure it around that across the course of today discussion a in feeling both immense gratitude a and relief for certain a quitting or hardships that i experience am and things that my parents made me do or ways that they were negligent and i was force to figure things out also am something i is a whish they ad done this i think every one listening to this will feel that way am and if you are lucky enough to still be in the panting shell we were being a child process than a there still time i guess there is always still time am my introduction of this episode i i touched on a few of these but am tell us what you are going these days to help parents and kids yam indirectly or directly to be more effective in their relationships and and i know you you written about this in books and you have but wonderful social media account on instergam and elsewhere i follow it am and it is there is ow much learning there but am how you translating this knowledge into a actionable programs ye that is my that is what gets me you about every morning is trains in always i deep thoughts actionable practical can do it to day strategies yes it that thinly way i can work me coming out to do to put that idea into action wat we don a couple years ago one of the things it really struck me i just i really did feel gig this is desktop we parents have the hardest rob and it one that pacts the world the most and i nil thine any of us think the world is not a great place strain man not not right and this is and i remember some one coming up to me in saying parenting is also the only job you care about on your death bet and i think that is probably true if you have kids for every reason this should be the place that there that we invest the most or that the system is set up to help us right and most people i know they do not want apparent the exact same way as they were parent at may be take parts and that is the way will parents just kind of the language we use and learning a new language we know is totally possible i dwelling go ha show is that you can learn a new language it is hard some times you never to your language of origin especially in stressful moments same thing parenting and then you go back and i remember saying to me people around me i want a create that conduelling go for parents it is learning a new language and we should have a product where we have resources in one place we should beagle to connect other parents or on the globe we were kind of doing this with us we should have access to experts we truss not because they always know better but they might just help us have a different mind set and some ideas to help us again an me my mind jot act more in line with your own values that is what it is about and that is what we created ad that what ism working on and that is our good inside member ship and excited about all the ways that is already impacting pens and tens of thousands a parents and that is where the resources are it is bite size it is actionable were really known for our scrips it is what do i say to my kid when literlyago we have a script for that om and i think in a small way people think alike i come for the scraps and then i stay for the revolution this is actually a journey of my own sturdiness and honestly becoming a sturdier more confident leader is the only way we can raise sturdy more confident kits give said this again and again throughout today's discussion but i love it i love a the gathering of a of information the organizing it and dispersing in factional

and homes norm lives in saint pal but he is one of these doctors and nurses who food in new york to help with flood of loved patients who filled new hospitals he is actually the hospital combe university where he went to medical school a quarter century ago an night after is twelve hour shifts he sleeps in his old dormitory literally in the down room he had when he was twenty three the hospital scratched out all kinds of extra space for covered patients courting twenty four operating rooms into intensive carry units but the strangest thing to him normally there be family all over the place but the families are not able to come close to the hospital we a even come in to the lobby that object to see the people they love very other figures is to reality that most of these people can die a in these places alone most of them re unconscious en medically induce comas cause hes you to survive on a venter that way because they're unconscious it means that the gap between these covered patients in the families is even more profound as did don't talk on the phone or face time or anything stranger suggested to the nurses that maybe they should take notes each day little things they knows about each patient to share with the families of the patient dies i asked him to eterfeel sure am this one me a nurse name sandy and she rode a miss is once o the name ah the patient is mostly sleeping she looks peaceful also i really her dark reed fingernail polish i would love to know the name of the color a here is another one a give been parting ah the patients hare to the side i do not know if that is how he wears it but i think it looks good that way also yesterday he got a shave and now he looks yon u here is one more the patient looks peaceful hes sleeping and calm every one is jealous of his salt and pepper hair he looks gorge clueing right now a doctor few of the nurses who are writing these notes and they said that cause the patients are unconscious the we her actions a pretty basic figuring out what to write can be tricky teacher homages at for sure yes people and at folks sing on what you can see which is embellishments hearings and hairstyles and fingernail polish and all is trying to emphasize that the people are are comfortable that the the sleeping there not in they are not in pain that is something we really want to that almost every all the nurses comment on that it seems on almost every one and and what your hypabout about how the families would take this my hope is that the families will know that there loved one were being seen as people entreated as people and that they were in alone a as the happen they gather details about the people laying in front of them knowing that the something an eighty per cent chance the of the run of ventilator with loved they will not live those are the numbers in new york those two things are different in size writing down a few tiny observations measured against the enormity of death what that means but sometimes i think that is all you can do and to day in our programmed we have two stories were ordinary people rise to this exact task they look a death standing there i antic hairline and they say something and an these stories truly amazing things happen nbebeasy chico says america life a mark glass they with us treat one really on distance s remember that tsunami the japan march twenty eleven giant black waves were than thirty feet tall it japan can a little town called ouch shot this video he a near knowing a inn all the houses or was wanna a had you'd been there for a hundred years thirty minutes it was gone most wholly flatten tsunami and the earthquake the won with it killed six times more people than died nine eleven over nineteen thousand people another twenty five hundred are still missing and the after mass of course family struggled for you at how they when move forward without the people they love and in that town of otzuci it led to this new non a rich is not exactly get word for this but it something close to that the thing that people invented to stay connected to the dead one of our producers making me has family in japan and she grew up going back and forth between there and here it who watches documentary but this thing people were doing in o much on the japan's newschannel and oh k and got permission for us to play you some experts here is me of all the areas in japan effected by the tsunami ut yucca has one of the highest numbers of missing people four hundred and twenty one to day it still partly in ruins and partly a construction side as they tried to rebuild the town on higher grounds but a year before that tsunami happened this sky name eat safari he was already dealing with a loss his cousin had just died and e tatters was having a hard time figuring out how to talk about it he did something pretty in genius he went out and bought an old fashioned phone booth and stock it in his garden it looks an old english style one its square and painted white and has his glass window panes inside is a black order phone resting on a wood shelf this phone connected to nowhere it did not work at all that that did not matter to e taco he just needed a place for he felt he could talk to his cousin a places where he could air out its green and putting an old phone booth in his garden which sits on this little windy hill overlooking the pacific ocean it felt a perfect solucean through no more the to coeval because my thoughts could not be related over a regular phone line i wanted them to be carried on the wind through the throw i named it the wind telephone case no wanna the idea of keeping up a relationship with the dead is not such a strange one in japan the line between our world and the world is thin lots of families keep a boodhist altar for their dad relatives in the living room my uncle has one for our family there are photos on a little platform and every day he leaves fresh fruit and rice for them lights in cense and rings he ball the way to stand touch to let them know that there still a big part of our family after that zunamin earthquake happen word got out about states special wind telephone that he was using it as another way to stay connected to the dead soon people started showing a candidly on his property and walking right into the phone booth this has ben going on for five years now he taco estimates that thousands of people from all over japan have come to use his phone a ted station ass tad and the people who come to use his phone if they could videotape their calls from a distance and put an audio reporter in the phone booth they wanted to get a sense of how people are still grieving i watch their documentary after the fifth anniversary of the tsunami back in march that whole week all the newsprograms in japan were airing memorial programs but i found the calls in this particular program remarkable and moving for just how simple they were one woman from ouch name sicko o can showed up one afternoon she seventy one years old and lost her husband in the tsunami she regularly brings her two young grandsons to the phone booth and you can tell by how casually they talk to him on the phone they squirt into the one booth with heir grandma wearing matching blue in black strike shirts sicko starts the call by picking up the receiver and saying hallo i a w ye hurl his grandson quickly jumps a high grandpa o how are you a it'll be in hoorah grave next master was not that fast in y dinar my younger brother he will be in second grave next year then chid chino corrects him she says no dinar will be in second grade this year o w not next of yet y at this shear a lot of calls were just this straightforward up dates about life the kind of quick highlight thrill you might give to any family number you ere catching up with on the phone the boy he then tells his grandpa a grandmas fine too ism giving the phone to dining dine a his little brother grabs the those a a grandpa i finished all my homework sicko urges him to keep talking a u a hes as a every one is doing fine then he hangs up they all a i cash as the walking out of toe boot a dine was many handle will say he heard us o in another call a woman in a puffy winter jacket with a fur line hood shows up the booth by herself her name is auklet hiding and she sixty six she is to live a note such but she moved away after she lost her house and her husband in the tsunami her husband was a deep sea fisherman his name was moi and he used to talk and drink socks together at night now keek away lives alone about fifty miles away but sometimes keek away finds herself driving back to at such and to the booth i wast her do this things that a lot of color seem to do you hear keek away actually dining the rosary f sames the numbers to herself for too five seven for for she is calling the phone number for her old house in at such the last place she knew to reach her husband then see away just stands in the booth in silence holding the phone to her ear sometimes she fidgets around and tilts her hat up and concentrate for the selling the same way i do when i want a cry but ism trying hard not to it does not work keikaway brushes in tears off her face eventually she hangs up she lingers in the booth a little longer hands clasped together in front of her the staring at the phone booth floor she walks out one pattern that the owner of the phone booth into has noticed over the ears is that more men than women come to use it not surprisingly this is not a demographic that is known for sharing their feelings e specially the older farmers thereby have a reputation for not talking much in one of the phone calls recorded in winter a man with gray hair and a little town hanging around his neck walks into the garden the kind of towels part of the uniform of japan's farmers the use then a wipe away set and clean their hands the man opens the telephone booth door and under his breath you hear him say ha this is the wind telephone this appears that he his very first visit to the phone booth he lost his loathe son in the tsunami his son's name was nob ski he also lost his house and had to move in the temporary housing with his wive and recently she got sick and also passed away he calls her boson it means mam and japan's it is what everyone in the family calls a female head of the house even the husband it is a very intimate loving term w a you hello wiki nubyuki a o wen is mam with you c a a a a o it sorry to ask thus but take care of her and your grandma grandpa are a a mam e o it'll come again out a a mam a e o it'll be back a a by uses the tall around his back to wipe his lives one of the things that makes these call poignant to me is all the understated ways that people are actually saying i love you and i miss you i never say something direct that in japan's it is just not done have only seen people say on the operas i schizo even saying that way now feels weird have never say that to my mam or my grand parents take this call it is winter the phone doth the surrounded by snow o you yin hello a cam e o where are you he is an older man wearing a baseball cap he also calls his wife mam his wife daughter and mother they all went missing in the tsunami to a e o e a it is cold but you are not getting cold are you o on o m con we yo a our grandma and our daughter make with you too a you t to you come back soon ma a you we can o i i be found soon every one is waiting for you ma o get a yo a yo a you we a e a c call we found soon hurry home o get ma o o o o come to it'll build the house in the same place a on on e to e e gin beet something anything got o e a to you o just be alive somewhere anywhere i you yo ism lonely he never says i love you directly real feelings are communicated through small gestures especially one of con corn they when he asked his wife are you staying warm are you eating and then promising it'll build a house for us these are total heartfelt declarations of love a i for other men the phone booth is a place for they can finely say their complicated feelings out loud they can voice their regrets anyone has had some one close to them die now his feeling big have kept having the same one way conversation with my d had in my head ever since he passed away last year i just keep telling him all the situations where i wish i had been kinder more patient one call watched was from a young father with red tangle glasses and a long black jacket he lost his family both parents his wife and he was mine and one year old son named you say dad coo on a o mine ye say of it is ready been five years since the disaster o go so if the voice reaches you please listen eon goggler sometimes i do

but i cannot hear anything hangs o on takes off is glasses and covers his eyes with his hands sorry an sorry i could not save you there is a couple phrases i heard callers tell the dead again and again she's by she i do not worry about us and got bathe do which basically means ism doing my very best ism enduring in japan combat de do it is a catch all slogan for slogging through life's many challenges no matter how tiny your bay from trying to pass a testis school to grieving you hearedall the time for everything in the phone booth come bated and she by she nice these are key phrases to reassure the dead ut the living he people left behind they are doing no say even if they are not people do not want to worry or wording their loved ones even dead loved ones because most japan's a booths and generally believe that when some one dies they are not suddenly relieved of all their earthly concerns they are not automatically in heaven happy and care free many people believe that if the dead see a family member suffering they cannot let go of their earthly like they hesitate to cross to the other side in end up stock in a no man's land i heard these reassurances and a call from a fifteen year old kid name men cossacks to his dad he arrived at the phone booth after spending four hours on public transportation by himself men lives in a city much farther north that was not affected as much by the synod but his dad was a track driver who drove all over japan and in the last minute schedule change he got son on a rout that took him along the coast when the pseunamihan he is been missing never since men went into the phone booth wearing a red back pay and what he does in his cad you hear him signalling to his dad that it is out he should keep moving on into the afterworld dad i you o o the four of us are doing fine o where gone back to so to you you do not be a worry about us she by she big dad are you doing o get or i do have one question i one ask you why

everyone with me to day by when men walks out his family was they say that was fast men shoots back you at to the people go it yous just a quick report to dad hat i brought everyone with me to day

heads we were all about to fall apart we were broken we did not think we could make it through it maybe that is why we never talked about dad until now the talking to him on the those to day it changed something me me is one of the producers of our program the she to ma hero you koala and in each case and die you recited all this and charity with us i shows must we we run we check this week an t windphone is still in operation though not many prisoners my dow because of coped the rabbits movement is asking people to stay home coming up two brothers in their ladies have a last chance to talk to each other before they die and neither wants to take it that is in a minute chicagobub a gratin when our program continues ti smart in life for glass hays programmed one last thing before i go stories there about whether about what power do words have in the face of death we have rived at act of our programmed act too uncle's keeper in the first act of our programmed people kind of defy death by making small talk had those talk that was not small with their dead relatives in this act somebody once to something very similar make a connection that seemed to possible between people except in this story all the relatives are alive which you think would make it superheavy the story comes from jonathan coldstan hello he at i johnny hey ha down good you good good a good yumptiv john to ox me after ma what cat ism not sher had this is my father buzz ism calling him at his home in munchreall and the reason were talking crazy talk is because its young kipper the jewfish day of atonement which seems as good a day as any to talk with him about forgiveness ism i wanted to i wanted to ask you something and i just wanted to gage your intrust yet how how would you feel about paying your brother seldom a visit i have no yen beam i realyinyoure not no my father buzz is eighty and his brother shelter his only sibling is eighty five and for the past forty years they have pretty much been on the outs my father lives in montreall and sedan lives in florid and the last time they saw each other over twenty years ago was that their mother's funeral when they had a fight over the details of the arrangements since then they have hardly spoken it worries me because there is not a lot of time left and i do not want my father to have regrets and my father has a profound capacity for regret my mother gave up trying to reunite them years ago after many attempts i know that if i do not push him no one else will ism not surprising not jumping at the idea but ism a little surprise at yours against the idea ye have time a yer to mu e i i repeating not i eve along what he did do was he he called you on your aidieth birthday e not nohow long ago and you to i by at him on he diet bray this kind of tit for tat at counting as what always gets in the way what r point with him i bayou pul i do not think o i candy caracara a serin o ban am you car ant your an er ye that act sonny do not find we want or on ere moon a your not ye you know what johnny at e child even when i pul cad when i would i at i i a traded not we had a great not i love to beau the old brother up lo yea an listening i d look of no on an eat old in no i are along with him and you up i comeminy crib a coming to kind to equal we her been e year the most complicated question the one i keep coming back to is how did the bad blood begin and there were many versions and ill fated trip to munctreall were seldom felt slighted about having to stay in my father's basement and ill fated trip to new york where my father felt slighted about having to stay in sedan's attic rude words spoken to each others wives in one version of the story sheldon's refusal to bring a table to my brit almost resulted in my being circumcised on an ironing board but in the first a been told to day my father was asked by shelter to pay more than his fair share for their mother's funeral and i can you on working me kind of an angle not a you got fury you got you yo got dreaming at to o on go to hell drop did be a a would tat that pul to at id but i i you you cut kind minded got yank angle that yore i

okay quickie bar any time have ever raised the prospect of visiting shelter no matter how hypothetical the scenario my father always makes a point of insisting how no matter what he would not stay in shelter's house even if he was invited to which i should point out he never is i would not at it out how come you i would not bat er a en i i m think how come you always bring that up i mean warmly in vain on o h visit some one that they have not seen in decades yes they had a hotel i would cat a on allow om when yer a a mute ye know we ad a place with an ice machine and why you want a youren' o a

father's all dressed up wearing to sway sport jacket that have never seen him in the grabber airport retell and prepare for the two hour drive to shelter in the ninety degree he its immediately made clear that to shade might not have been the best fashion choice honest a marry on the road to shelter's my father will experience a spectra my feelings as we first set out there is excitement yet my brother was funny into i could laugh wat can a left to not me new a very funny man half an hour in and this bitterness we invited him to your omens and he returning to very cold cad sorry we will not

if hes get nerves may me course he is waiting for us right ye shelter lives in the corner house on a quiet suburban street re the i get i o to double check we be verbs hi a to cold a i an i tether you a to thank you we the become among we us g an o away after all the years in the worry in the dread things seemed to be going swimmingly we sit down a shelter's kitchen table and my father gets right into it t nowt this things i want and we you said that rant any do ye he did the dead are a good place to begin as ta subject there easily agreed upon and not likely to spark a fight we uncle did uncle d he was the longest father o d lo he died we o dint who a adman the to yen i didn't i tat will in yer wish what a sh peevish f he was fat red rede i es rememii join johnny was a taxman o he would e do my the street if ye a the login try ten i i you is old me an i i e abri one r idea know there in their eighties shelter and buzz still possess voices and temperament suited to shouting out broken tenement windows while my voice be to her is best sue to tasking the waitress if there will be a sharing charge i i a i casein point this is shelter accidentally swiping a portable microphone receiver off the kitchen table and me trying to smooth things over i ten o i it is annoying an it is put it in the end in your pocket there just tike e o wit the lac a ye over the next two days my testes will flee frighten cock roaches upward a sending to heights not scene since the barmitzva that shelter was not attending while it is fun watching the reminisce it'd say that about eighty per cent of my uncle shelter stories about the good old days are filthy enough to make them virtually brought tastable but here is one specially selected and beeped for your delicate years while he rose wonder what i will became o him he was a on men we rob an wen joying way the thing ye see hawk be test to ruth e i member put his hand i tie left and i i ribs f her over the years have seen my father in the role of husband uncle and grandfather but have never really seen him in the role of younger brother how odd to see it now at eighty he sits beside shelter with this expression i have never seen on his face it is wide eyed sweet and deferential but as the day wears on shelter and buzz begin to squabble over their memories fighting over every little detail remember howling we had with be e the i head l that heavy sad girl a ma years she was ahead on man zeros no she was a head o his what haven't she went over er even argue over the death of their grandmother give found om both i oi it do not know i o my mother was a chosen grin bi gamble i an in on arm and i knew she was dead was li never saw dead body in ai by wishes her or sold to you founder you found i remember looking in on a s li i was o to who found the to team the non the e sung rain the whole afternoon is this every subject even their dead grandmother somehow becomes father for another pissing match there burning up all this time with small talk when what they need is some big talk in particular they need to address a story that i know world's a great deal of meaning for my father it took place in nineteen thirty nine on the day their mother left them have only ever heard the story from my father never from shelter ani as i you remember when your perspective i a i remember at time was won was slack an around an she ran out the hole and a slop fighting in a w he he was slackmackna yet she ran ut yet what happen h next morning the tax for er e in a closet a cloths got she left a what happened after this in my father's telling is that his mother returned soon after she death with a policeman an toe and he they came back to try to get yet they wanted you to come back with them and when were you i was the but you was they were trying to drink you at out and a e in try in men o they w my father ram this is the point of the story for my father it proves once and for all how his mother loved shelter more than she loved to him shelter did not move out with her and after a year their mother returned and together lean shelter grew up under the same roof and the same bedroom often sleeping under the same blankets each knowing who the mother had chosen and each having to do their best to carry on and lived life with the burden of that knowledge a couple times during the day i asked them why they have not spoken in long and they both insist maybe out of embarrassment that they do talk just not often but it is not true in fact my father learned of shelter's wife's death many years after the fact and then only from me shelter's father got en touch through face book and we made a phone date where she caught me up on her life and shelter's and a few nights later while over at my parents for dinner i told my father of his sister in law's death there was a terrible look that fell across his face one of sadness but something else too maybe shock over just how far he and shelter had drifted i i found out about jury about her death who your or wife i did not nobody other to her call me yes i did i ti you you no to n we did not know we did not know you was sick obit to ye you we wen she go the bi most she was a ready stage for was i no by chance i o e sermon he said was well a tho the surgery on on very well wat the chances an a willed spread i within now will i said what an o e i me o an o ma o o to i a ti o a i in n a text can for dinner shelter takes us to a local outback stake house as people walked by he provides a running commentary of an elderly couple on we li that lo watts i execution of an overweight couple o a e a a a it is as though he sharpening his wad readying it is the remain of end teasing my dad about canada a i you the ta capital an an a i that mi sand what a a a aka a a the fa an he a a for my father i know this is a touchy subject believing as he always has that sedan looks down on him for the dinginess of his canada life and home it is a constant reminder of just who is second best later my father will repeat shelter's words you still living in that same place he will sight for how many years but just then i watch my father clench and unclench his jaw as he does when he is brooding i noways trying to take the high road trying not to room the evening tone was i tea a shelter invites his back to his place for cookies but my father says he is enough for it as was we walked through the restaurant parking lot to the car my father is silent i find myself feeling protective of him maybe encouraging this trip had been a bad idea only making things worse after midnight lying awake in our hotel my father insisted we stay at one i lay in bed thinking about that day and nineteen thirty nine when my grandmother came back for shelter not my father for my father not only did it push him away from shelter making him feel jealous and resentful but it also cast a shadow over the rest of his life causing him to always feel passed over he is mellowed with age but as a kid i saw it come out in all kinds of ways always sensitive to slights ready for a fight at the smallest perceived defense i wonder if there is a different way from my father to see things if there is the only living person in this world who can help is shelter when their mam left shelter was nine my father five shelter would have understood a lot more than my father yesterday bus in shelter talk a couple of kids he used to play kickball in the old neighborhood to day if me in my big fat meddling yap have any sway he'll have a chance to talk his man as brothers even because if not now when day too this a dam good cigar he sat me dominica repulse than make a gamble cigar despite the difficulties of last night the coin is flip back to the good side shelter offers my father a cigar and with the cigar some cigar talk some pretty foul cigar talk weird to queens bellows warming in the backs with the who he is got is make we o o mean oman the firing thing we had a stop for a an a a ambo i look a mega did you guys missed each other wat you miss each other an i yes e we due o the wood waits he abroad now i man aninoits eager to prove to my uncle shelter that in spite of the fact ism wearing my wife's travellteoder and i am indeed not abroad i allowed them to return to more pressing matters there prostates ta e is as your a prana feels the moral is in thermals ta you no and get to complimenting if i could steer this away from the prostate it my father said that it significant it to him to have come what do you say i agree wit whatever he si but what about you you i said i agree i what at you an o written not i know it feels him getting a taste an what growing up with shelter might have been if you again i make my move i have some questions a just about because it distorts that i know from my father but ism curious what your take is because you were older do you remember an what what was going on when your on when your mother last originally what what why

tempera tantrums for buzz it was their mother who was the manipulator the woman who played the brothers off each other but hearing shelter's take it sounds maybe their mother did not come to take shelter because she loved him best but simply because he needed more protecting from their father for the first time during our tried i can see my father considering shelter's point of view actually taking it in i know it is intense fried because he cannot even been shelter's eyes instead he looks at me addresses his comments to me you not said that my father a such a negative impact on him is hurtful because he had much going from with a wonderful son he worked hard is a good boy you to went to si o a i a faster an lo you are not a said tat l an san yo wasn't a fay but wall saying that

last time my father saw my grandfather in full hell my dad was visiting from canada my grandfather asked my father to drive him to the cemetery to visit his parents grave and once there my grandfather wept inconsolably later that day he would so come to a stroke and shortly after be moved to a nursing home with sedan being more local the burden of my grandfather's care fell mainly to shelter it seems a lot of the family's burdens fell to shelter they put a later to a lot of the responsibility on him that my dad should have been thinking that responsibility and he shoulder that who s con ti

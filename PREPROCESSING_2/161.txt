a quick warning there are curse words that are beeped in today's episode of the show if you are fer a beep version you can find that at our weight this america life down o work the be be as chico is this america life america bacon the won her twenty twenty two in the days and weeks before russia invaded you crane there is one thing that most ucranians and most ruffians had common he both insisted the war was impossible we was in believable one reason it was unbelievable is it many families possibly most families on either side of the border a family members in the other country many ruffians have some yucranian routes many cranial have spent time living in russia it even pressor elensky many or cranial you're up speaking russia et a career in russia starred russia movies form comedy for russia audiences even prudence seen hin perform caught om a good actor years ago en ruffians did start the war won just on the battle feel when they a space over yucranian cities it was within families this is not thing i had no idea about the way a conflict this might take normal disagreements between people and bow them up when you think about it of course right it was the rater cassia guess in o explain this jimmy cassia was born in mascot moving in red states as a teenager with their family then i back to russia as an adult to work is journalist they written several books now colonel a staff writer at the new yorker and what mass per together to day is a very unusual story by the try to capture what this is by looking at one family and the fights say get into re lated to the war we you are back to here is one family and ait fights here is cassia in normal times we keep the peace in families by letting things go by the commenting by for getting things were pretending not to notice things but when t e war starts even the quietest most conflict avoiding people start fighting just before the work again on february twenty first twenty twenty two two people sat at a long dining table in e mascot apartmentthese are my friends titan carat there the center of this constellation of people in going to tell you about have known bison the longer since she was a college student in mascot about twenty five years ago she was tall blond which very cool u still is soon after graduating and two thousand three she move to kid then there is cutting e layman a friend have

growing up in ka but regularly visited his at in mascot and on this night all three of them wore in cabana apartment in mascot luck had gone to them they adults for watching i speech ut late e futon but i see of e probably mi tat the erascucin is ops boletus futon was declaring war carat nasal to to fight fight number one where does look a the even before used speech nasal was read should not thing the word would happen but head made a plan for luck if warbrokat a plans she had not told catenabout until now by that time i will ready new that we do not going back chicane we were you had tiki o berlin and who said what what was the argument well before he was say nothings going to happen an you exaggerating and things this but then he was a kat may be somethings can t happy in you crane but he definitely should not on take kid ta way to some over country i was if there going to be a for it is safer it to stay in mascot this was caftan because nobody's goon to attack mascot i leave to menus walk from trembling i cannot imagine e the for can come in to town he was saying no i want hem to stay in mascot is the safest place in the world i do not want him to go to berlin and we actually we did not succeed too each and persuading him and she did not push too hard because that was not her way i do not know i just hate fighting i just hay when it gets ugly whatever i even sense that this might be the situation i just you not go on no bee direction it would never actually get too far as to have a fight as someone and i think ism used to this is is been for years this we jussive gent go there for two weeks we as a niter look an nicest gofrenc and only on two weeks he agreed and everybody too weeks course w but then i called sofiatin witness had take including the momma cloth including the summer es no slice to berlin with as much self as she can carry plan nicer an look mete am my understanding this correctly that i talking him into two weeks because you are not going to have a fight with tithe abbot it is just the soy our relationship we just avoiding the complex all√©e tin well shes the show she is it everyone in love carenstays and russia invades you crane care is going to preach us but he is lost crying every day after a few days he goes to good by party at a friend's apartment and there there were a lot of our a common friends i do not know fifteen people and everybody were discussing tenets when and where everybody's going i can tell you when this was because i was there march forth and it is true that this was all our friends were talking that there were rumors that usual would closed ta border impose martial law conscript all the men and just ta general sense that she had to get out now wore it will be too late at the party eaten started to get upset wait you were all just going to leave me here and that was the moment i realized that if everybody's leaving then ism going to is well caftan his boy from by tickets to give you a sense of just how difficult it was to get out by them then applying to on but tear the capital of mongo from there after a few days i light of soul south career then to do by then to yet van the capital of media where they say freight number two who is russet and who is you craniitto understand the routs of the next fight we have to go back a long time to years eve twenty ten when cabana nipa met my friend there she introduced me to nigh saying this i carat and he on have a child and this is nide as she wants it to please is in lit me when everything is done and you gan a editor kid and thill be he is a her godmother that was it they were a ka let us talk and we several times we talked about it e and we decided yes wat stood they were thirty one and twenty eight they were both queer they were both buds they had that in common than that they did not discuss any of the biggish of how to rate child what school he would cud to what languages he would speaking how they would explain the world to him name knew she wanted to raise him an eucranent she would move there from mascot years before this carat wanted to stay in mascot but he visit there won't exactly friends the won't straight to been clarence they figured that working at e few ears later it was time to choose a school for luck nasal had to make a commitment to the next ten years or of her son's schooling and the language and which he was going to study at the time eve had schools with instruction an eucranian russia english german french as it was struggling to make a choice but carat had a definite opinion of course i i was hoping that he will study russia and he will read and it in russia i mean all his family including he is cranial part of the family eh speaks on the russia and he is thinking in russia he never reads an in cranial what is the potent to tried artificially implement the language that he does not his and will not use when he crows up carat's cannot a funny one to be company russia culture he grew up and outside his heritages armenia to green and yes i russia he has dark curly hair a trimmed beard a white chiselled face and a long prominent nans his beautiful he also does not look russia at all s not easy to grow up on russia when you do not look ethically ruin i know i grew up on russia looking in russia and i get teased chaste and beaten up a lot carat's name marks him as an armenia he had to fight for the right to be russianneither on other hand with her blow hair and blue gray eyes growing up in mascot she certainly never had to defend her right to be there she moved a we as a kind of experiment and found she lifted there became her home cargo lot of nether friends though kept assuming she was an crane temporarily on this particular night carat was a little drunk and that is when we started for this fight he was we started over schools and then it went to that eucranian culture is not culture and the language is not language and all that and he went on in on and at first i was shocked and he was his suds many things and then i was wat what what do i suspect to do because i cannot fight with mi do not because i have to keep good relationship because he is lucks father i was a cate please do not say these things because we eucranians he was now eucranians you ruffians you from mascot and he is russia another a yet of course i was byistan i am still by us an but by as tile by we toward russia heritage this is important part of my didn't he and i was convinced that that a this is an important part of his identity also in fact an had always hoped that neither would move back to mascot neither had zero intention of doing that is thing is i always hated the idea that he has to go to mascot even of her they a vacation i never liked the influence was on him not that she said the stockmen why starting because all the time luck was going to russia for one months a year his father was insistently feeding him that he will russia you not eucranian e got nothing to do with youcrane there is no such thing as eucranian cultic the eucranian languages no good and there is this cramandes russia cult oushuld hiding towards that and then luck would be coming back in saying young i do not to a want some eucranian holidays o where we chain can owe why would yo do that of a chavanka is a traditional eucranian embroidered shirt ran told me he in havingthing against eucranian tradition in particular we all know that a traditional costumes a just likely that taste for everybody into matter if this is vichavanka or traditional russia costume we look down to that in general because silly because it has something to do with the nationals we all hated always at least we thought we hated there is ha big difference between russia and crania national costumes the vachavanka long before the war was a symbol of the renascence of eucranian culture and identity after the fall of the soli union yeucrane was a former colony of russia karat most ruffians was oblivious to this this is another not a russia recreates this is about senseless style kind of to neither it was about karat's attitudes toward all things youcranian he thought give was a backwater i hate to mention it but i he was visiting museums or theatres or concerts only when i was a coming to yes and i took him to same to a three museums and not to mention theatres there are almost none in yes how much a theater an than the museums did you get when you nereid unfortunately not a to much not to man because i was born and rased in a liberia in us and this is not the culture center every parent wants to give their children what they did not have growing up neither unlike harem grew up in the center of mascot in the very heart of the empire in a privileged family karat could not believe she was willing to give up what he had longed for as a kid neither for her part one e to avoid conflict in the end luck did not go to e cranial school or russia school he enrolled in a german school go when the worst started all those things that luck had heard his father say that he and his mother really russia these ideas hid to luck hard his father's country was jamming his motherland like was crying and saying its my fault i russia i called his father and a said look what have you done luck now i things that is his fault because he is russia he felt that he is half this and half that and now there is huge in their conflict inside of him because to him to hes kid's mind there was one half of him hes attacking the other half of himself talking to luck did not help much maybe he could be convinced that the for was not his fault but he was still stuck with this problem of being both eucramian and russia the war was tearing him apart it maybe did not help that he and his mams were still in the move they finally landed in listen i was thinking may be suggesting maybe you think you an be portuguesa since we leaving portugal and he was like none now ism german ism definitely german wine and then the psycalloges explain to me that it this age they just pick the saves environment luck had cone to german scolintu he was going to start a tending a german so and listen choosing germany was away to avoid choosing you crane were choosing russia a way to avoid choosing between his parents i think germany felt neutral fight's number three in number for creme and the globe if has back i don't surprise either for his part of summer vacation his suggested taking luck to came come had been under russia occupation for several years once upon a time it had been a vacation destination for both ruffians and eucramians but after the occupation creme was off limits re cremains and a i was in a now we we do not go to creme and a they were one now come on a because er the whole family or his father he is to spend somewhere in cameras they all continued doing that and they were calling us and thin can luck come they oui the kids cannot spend time together was y i do not mind but we do not go to came we youcramias because hit is no our land and as the whole thing about it imagine you live in a house and one day someone comes in with a gun and just takes over the second floor and i was not a bench of empty rooms your cousin was living there now your cousin isn't allowed to talk to you and suddenly your find goes hey that's go visit the guy who living on the second floor of your house have always liked the view from there i never shared this point of view that you can not a visit and next territories well i guess for oucramians it is completely different for them if you go there it means you support of the idea cremes for russia or there was we gone he really could not see what the ideal was the go there support the local economy after all the people of creme were not to blame for being occupied there is no way i can explain what i feel the only way i could say i say does not matter wat i feel probably you right but at non the first of septantamber the ki would have to go too cranial school and when when they ask him how he spend the somewhere if he says he goes i creme his getting been big table that work the creme invocation was a verdict but then came the globe when russia occupied crime it printed up new maps and made new globes that labelled crime as part of russia and as name recalls caftan and his boron were coming for a visit and bringing a globe as a present for luck and on the plain they realized that this is a russia globe it showed crime as a part of russia this would be a problem when they gland and crane and have to go through customs and they got they got really scared that the somebody would decide to check it and they will be in a big trouble they would be stopped to know allowed to en her the crane because they brought the globe with the crania be marked as part of russia they would really scan it but it is but they could not throw it away because it was a big thing to get red of it is really or is and the toil it its it is not mere even many places we could leave it they kind of had the poker face and they cross the customs and nobody even checked they left they port i took atasito sizes house they gave the globe to luce and they told the story of how they had this realization on the plan and were stuck to the globe and the we was a biggest joke they would keep telling it everyone as oh how fine imagine house topic and i was an wo this thing in my house the glove was lucks this anti ha let stuck with it i i do not want a and father's feelings it is really nice that is it in its you present and i know if i throw any we be huge candle was kind of saying ism really really sorry and i told told understand but again it might be some other people visiting a the crane an people visiting we house and get a fan that ism real sorry but ism getting get lo this ow it always been this i couldn't really say what a fucking stupid idea why they'll brought this glob you know to my house give it to o son was e i always have to bee the long way after other people my get the fable o people remember lindanes the we i in carinversion of the story there is no globe on the airplane no fretting about customs but there was a globe until there was not it is not there when i visited him next time in have and i was and there is your globe and she was well there is a tiny mistaken that is globe mama i hided it from me and i realized what an a mistaken but i never i cannot recall that there was any fight about it did she tell you that we at fit about the globe she said that some she said that she fell compelled to tell you that she had to get at out of the house because you cranial friends would see it i know nobody a it there was no problem and the did look i actually say tiny mistake yes there was it was some i much yo now's sweet of him she was shins well there was a tiny mistaken the the glory i never told him what i what ha i did not make drama an anilin as hat about y within it was clear the that is problem five number five douche when the first call invasion began it began with then imaginable almost immediately russia tanks were right

comitia this is difficult not lotto what neither remember from this argument r for us i this were simply theoretical conversations about history anti little this is turns out as o there are thinks that that me and others were talking about to in this way is theoretical feathers they are no use as official reasons to justified the catestropers westerly the trusses i to put a son my presidia soon cop with moment and these are atvorsse that you spoke that came out of your mouth and no it makes o want to rings it out wit leech i tharluklynesson that and closer for ever no could in asked himself

that you were never accepted as russia by ruffians you live in exile the russia government has declared for an agent yes and you consider yourself freshen ah was it sound yer sort of scarce o fringe gain is a journalist and olbitcikiactist two things the russia government hates most that is why he is been designated or for an ancient neither cold an both felt better after that need fight the clear there news a felt heard adman felt it understood something for one thing he understood by neither said that she in look were you cranium and how shorten that was their relationship approves and also the new visa had emerged one who told people but she really thought except when she did not number eight the fight that was not neither comes from a long line of diplomats her grandparents were diplomats and her mother really hope neither would be diplomat too which brings me to night u step father the man who was present for most of neither childhood i did bored him she calls him dad she never called ales that long after he ad lies his mother divorce they stated in touch as neither became an adult they spoke less often but every time he called it was they would seen each other just yesterday and he was also a diplomat in fact hes still is a diplomat a russia diplomat who's still working in a high post and after the worst started and they fled to listen and she got ale out of you crane neither was starting to dread her dad's bunco the call she would always looked forward to him her birth is at the end of ma and he always called this time she would have to assume that their

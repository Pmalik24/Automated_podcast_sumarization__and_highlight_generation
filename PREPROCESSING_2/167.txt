tat we have and it'll just go e let us go for it the have to say after three accidents i have learned not to rid this particular by in the ran n you very much to day on our program we have stories for things go very very badly for people they are on the way down and in that moment of crisis but to thinking re veal much about who they are some people we would some new insights somebody no insists at all an some r with a taking boat of inspiration figure at how to save themselves db b ichicago america life america asked say er wat one pirates of the carbine town won som mere a while back group er friends got in trouble got in over their heads almost literally in the middle of boson harbor i producer streets contrast tells the tale though for the purposes of today's story call i wish mail have been friends with you this whole time and i did not know that this is your most told story well i would not tell it to you you were there i was there it was over ten years ago and i was a new resident in the boson area my good friend soppy century introduce me to some people she knew well we would the same kinds of jokes and could only afford the same kind of rent we moved into a big house together soon we got to the stage in any relationship where some one suggests taking things to the next level si do not know exactly how it came out but may be eight friends or decided to go in collectively and by a sabot and to my understanding none of them new the thing thing that boats true but did the word catamaran comes from tame cot tho morgue would tied together those are my guides that is one thing i know about boats may be more ancestral knowledge was just waiting to surface if i owned a boat here is how it happened our friend man brought us the opportunity he knew a person who knew a person who needed to get rid of their boat for four hundred dollars each man could make us massachusetts boat people having double that in my bank account i signed a check sight unseen and when i finally got to meet our boat down at the harbor it felt we had gotten away with harmony i wish you could have seen a nineteen fifties high liner a glamorous little wooden motor boat with an engine hanging off the bat polished wood two rows of white final seats crone finishes think italic a cation the talented mister rip but right here on the boson riviera also button's own sacrament in the talented mister ripply a new high society life was waiting for us the first time i got on the boat really felt matter we haunted just the bright number of times in a bridge opened up for us a bouncer clipping of red velvet road to the via section we entered the charges river it stopped to admire the sail but swirling around us a small motor boat pulled up to us the man asked if we were strain no sir just in going this beautiful day thanks for asking for your park in the middle of a brigade oh he looked us over do you guise work for gruel the plan to case play our way to high society was already were man near the next step we had to announce our old boat as the newest member of button's watery glittery which meant a christening party man had been practising for this moment his whole life the man loves extravagant gestures he invited friends from near and far to the charges river esplanade and asked every one to wear white he showed up in black a rented black tuxedo man stood on the front of the boat named it marry after his own mother and smashed a purple bottle of undead sparkling wine on the nose in i do not know of you believe in curses and we did not know it right away but man in boat roughly three curses in that moment wearing a black teeth to a white party of your own design that is more of a boat not a curse but number one renaming a boat that is a curse number two news man do not name children after living relatives now the prohibition does not specified boats it is call that a half curse number three smashing champagne on a used boat i heard that is a curse but only if you consider antre sparkling wine to be champagne o it is impossible to say which curse attached itself to the marry but moments later the sky darkened and we all scattered as sheets of rain fell upon i s boa the next day the clouds cleared our friends were still in town we tried to take them out again now this is where the story really begins it was a beautiful day i think it is early summer and really sunny and gorgeous and there were maybe twelve twelve of us on the boat does that right nine in a boat that was maybe made for six but our captain man had just completed a boat safety course and he told us the only limit for boat capacity is having enough life jackets for every one which is not true but we did not know that and martin eyes ever saying it squish together two in the front see for in the back three others perched on the sides we had it out people i ain't contriving and us y fine i got to take the feel for a little be ans a i was cutting across the waves in a way where we would catch little air and on and catch the mar inspan down which i though it was very fun and then it don't point somebody mean insist me soppy this is a lake a wood in lake boat the marry was not bill for his octane thrills some one says we should get back since what soppy overs and then just the america munitions that repelled he brutish ships and these very waters cannon bad i jump off the boat because it is beautiful day and i swim and in kina messing around and looking at the boat from water and when i climbed back into the boat i was i clamped in on the back and i just hoisted myself up over the edge of the boat and at the point where the most force was being pushed down on the boat a whole grip of water just flit well away the back of the boat dipped below the water line and boson harbor began to enter and then almost instantaneously the boat was fine even one this is ben you and camping a moral pillar of our group the kind of friend your ma might ask is been going to be at the party we would lived together and coon this boat my memory is that it was really really vast just it went from regular life you are having fun to all of a sudden emergency oat it is still a lovely summer day were still on our beautiful boat but suddenly ism tearing in the aluminum cannon hap the bail us out turns out half a to can only scoops as much water as your own copped hands i look over it soppy the most mac ivory of us to see if she has a better idea i saw a empty gallon clastic water gallon and as i ow if i and tear the top off at es then i can scoop water very was b a in wondering my o say i do not have anything to cut it with that is fine of can i with my teeth it'll just crack little hole and once i get a little hole going the will be purchase and i can tear the holding open and i try to bite it with my teeth an my teeth are just we my hands or week and i can i cannot do anything i do not think ism feeling experiencing anxiety but suddenly it is one of those nightmares were none of your limbswork maybe the weight of nine passengers was too much or maybe copy's full throttle aerials had split the seams for maybe it was a curse here is what we know we are alone we are in a small boat we are far from shore the nearest land to us is logan airport and that is when of be ins to dawn on me if we have to jump off this boat and swim to the closest land we would be army crawling off the bank of a government controlled airspace look it is close we can to wittol again n a very quickly and quietly but quite definitively he said ism not going to do that ism picturing my white friends being rapped in tinfoil blankets and fed coco and me being perwalked off the tarmac by homeland security not to day government black side our options are shrinking our bales are not bailing the engines not turning there is water water everywhere i think we are going to sing we were sinking we were in a sinking boat toy avid is visiting from filly a gifted speech maker he helped christen the marry just the day before now he reminds us e is not a good swimmer axiomatic and does not cold water the boat is going down and its ti ting and we them in all the water we have no idea what to do and ism drinking out ism really fully freaking out am not hearing much that through thine the bends voice comes through and says is anybody else noticing that occasionally one of us will ask a question and nobody will respond a silent panic falls over us it is a moment that demand's leadership decisive action we turn our heads to our captain man he found this boat named it after his mother sold us on the dream and now a monomaniacal a had in a red socks cap man denies there is any problem at all when we are all wondering what to do one element stir was everyone saying should we call for help and marrying no man hat is really strong instant do not call for help do not can't i know what ism doing i think man was trying to cover up for her this massive fuck up and he he was sort of devil that there was a problem even up to the point where the entire back and of the boat was fully under water the entire motor was under water man was still saying it is fine there is no problem but there are too one were stranded in the water and too our captain has gone mad we only know how to deal with the last one everyone shouts at man admitted we are in trouble you need to call for he but man is sitting in the captain sea one hand clenched around the steering wheel and the other turning the key in the mission the engine was not under water the expression hope floats not true and very dangerous on one end of the spectrum a willingness to acknowledge this situation there is man who is just face nowhere pretending he was still driving about and then at the other end of the spent from the other extreme was there is there is this one wild card cat oh my god i do not know anything about her she just a sort of appeared in a beam of clarity can spangled when to college with man she is the ninth passenger and the one outsider when man invited her on a ride he ad not mention there would be many of us for most of the trip she was shy and off to the side but now the strangers surrounding her our screaming at the one person she knows and he has lost control i remember just really clearly looking over at man sitting there in the captain see with his eyes kind of down cast frozen and something there was a switch that flipped in me if the boat sinks and all of us are in the harbor we are no longer visible to anyone we are just little head so one can see us we can tread water for a while what if we get a cramp get tired swallow water how long can we do that for what if the current takes us out further i did not want to let myself go there but i remember thinking that people were going a die if we do not do something people r in a die to day and in that moment captain cat is born my mind went really blank and calm and is a calculator filled my brain and i was just very logical and i started focussing on actions where are the life fast how many do you have i took on this voice that was very bossy and direct button's own mandarin in good will hunting she begins solving the unsolvable problem namely if nine passengers getting a boat which turns out to only have eight life jackets not one per person as we had been led to believe man and now some of those life jackets are unreachable in the under water part of the boat how many passengers are totally screwed i remember looking over and there was a sky who looked really pale he just did not look he was doing very well and i asked him i said can you swim well and he said no i cannot and i just gave him the life fest i took it off my back put it on his and said while i can cat hands out the remaining life jackets based on me the water is rising we are coming apart and preparing to abandoned ship and that is when i got on top of the bow of the boat she climbs to the front of the boat and starts waving her arms to the pilots and airplanes over our heads to near by boats in the water any one who might be able to come to our rescue she was the one person who was sort of way what the fuck is wrong you people of course we not and she stood up on the boat and started waving her arms and trying to get the attention of a boat that i did not realize was also quite close that was es and actual rescue boat just within waving distance it was much taller than u off the water line and there was guys on deck can a looking down and almost chuckling to u i for making light of the situation and i remember feeling they have no idea what we have been there they must have radio for a towboat because one arrives within minutes the captain calls down do i have permission to perform a life rescue who says no to that i have to confess one thing really fast toy is admirably honest about what happened next i just to say ism sure that when the rescue boat arrived that i i may have been the first person off of those sinking ship i fucking levitated to that latter to get off that boat that is not right for me we climbed off the boat to safety and just cardamon and saving private yon we were going home cat sat she looks back at this moment lot that it is become pivotal to her understanding of herself she is proud that she jumped in and say it was a tragic ending for our captain from the safety of our tow boat i can still picturehim down there alone on the marry refusing to abandon ship and that was the last time i ever saw him he died that day yet the only honorable thing i could have done i wen out this o captain man dived my friend man survived little bruised is ego and his reputation for big schemes with little consequences and while the boat became the story she likes to tell more than any other not man this is e story i have told the least i cannot overstate you how big a failure this was one of the most embarrassing failures of my entire life it is a thing i look back at and shutter man spent more than a decade feeling terrible the rest of us spent that same amount of time wondering why our friend man was trying to gas light us and sink us but we would never talked about it none of us have and when man and i catch up for this story it becomes clear that he as a completely different memory of how it all went down he says he actually did the one thing we were begging him to do i remember a lot of things i remember calling sea to and telling them where we were i remember that a t i us back up once i did you just say you called sea to see to is boat triple ay the boat that performed the life restmax says he called them on his one way back when the engine first stalled out that is the reason we got saved that day yet i do not think i made a big deal about calling sea toe no i did not believe him i just interviewed five of our friends who had no memory of this at all i followed up with sea tow turns out the keep meticulous records and there it was a call for a toe jury seventeenth twenty ten charged to our membership under max's name it cost fifty dollars help was on the way i guess in the chaos man just forgot to tell everybody on the boat look i i mean it clearly i owe them an explanation but a lot of our passive aggressive ass friends have never brought up this day with me our story had hardened over a decade but was built on a live man it kind of done the right thing and catch was not the one who saved us the sadistic editors at this america life made me invite catch back to share our findings man called for help and apparently he was the one who got help to arrive not you waving that just feels impossible but i think it is true and ism sorry that is the way that it happened ism just completely confused this whole time he has been the hear of this story but no one has known it it is perfect that this is the finding it is unlike man tea not kine claim that like claim the credit of it and say no i to that the final curse on the artery ad the longest fuse and a devastating palm it added an aster's to a heroic deed and turned ate a in two i who kind of did the right thing but was really confusing about it please he this precautionary tale beware of curses do not try to be amassachousetts not person for just four hundred dollars and if you already called sit tell your reds at e oo e o oo e can e a e to the e e a o ever e t e we a a e e o e a e a o area e o a a a e e a the a ahead a a ow t a a a a a e are cha a sea also that story was by like shreds canderaza the sea shandy was written for us by say teller who was there that faithful day he has captain max's brother he performs as sampling the truest other writers in the song trio east chances with wolves and glasses good mandate played the cordial coming up ship gets a new captain who immediately throws half the crew overboard he says to save the ship from sinking we here an insiders true real life account that is in a minute in chico bob radio when our program continues is mar on lie fro my glass to days programmed what i was thinking as we were sinking if story today about what's though your head in the middle of calamities big and small and what there thoughts tell us we have arrived at at two of our programmed at two going down with the censor ship the as ass marry cost our producer like and his friends about four hundred bus age the ship bregantotalk about next is significantly more expensive by forty four billion dollars that is what he gone must paid for twitter baganoctober the company his ben sort of famously foundering in the water since then and some of the most revealing details about what it has been on the inside at that company among the people who work there have come from reporter case newton and his collegueszoi shifter make the newsletter platformed they have had many scoops gas he also coosapotcas called hard fork that the new or times puts out about the tekindustry that a kannasay i love highest recommendation but to it back to a story there is been one person in particular at twitter the case he has been owning talk to a very senior impose at the company who while just doing his job and did up having to take on to of the most powerful people on the onernette and in the world the sure people eon musk and the former person in the united state s down on trump was y want her all about that and also what i was for the guy what he was thinking what he was doing once he on took over and the place veto taking on water his was he you well both did a lot of jobs at twitter over the years but he was always the same kind of job he was in the content moderation business whereof those people who besides which of your post can stay up on the other net and which as need to come down and he got his first glimpse at what life as a content moderator would be while he was in college on a date he is gay mi i went out for drinks with somebody without knowing where he worked and he volunteered that he actually worked for the parent company of the website manhunt am which was one of the kind of early gay web sites there was very specifically sexually focus and even in these early days of the web there was already a team people who were deciding what you could and could not post there they had a set of kind of convoluted rules about what types of nudity were allowed to show in which places needed he fine but not all oddities there were there were specifics and he described to me a system of color coming images of red yellow green m and then a team o people who were responsible for making those designations and it'll never forget he said the people doing these reviews are almost entirely straight women and i was just flowed in that moment of thinking there is the team of heterosexual women who have to look at the depraved things they game at er sting on the in or not ism sorry and it the senior whole pick specialist of man was me poor woman that is not an exaggeration ya ah otters doing are you out there o into the america life ism sorry a ah i fact yo after the day you will had one thought i was a ha that is my dissertation topic you well was in grad school he of och de and soon after a job at twitter they gave him a small desk this was twenty fifteen the offices most striking feature was probably a giant life size cardboard cut out of just bearer sat directly behind my ask just in bearer obviously being a major figure in early twittered maybe it maybe the most popular user at least for some peed of time yes there were rumors that twitter had entire servers just dedicated to serving just bearer related traffic besides bearer what twitter was really known for back then was its trolls the sight was plagued by users harassing other users particularly women that year i to reported the story about how the sits then see yo dick costal rutamembo saying quote we suck at dealing with abuse controls on the platform and we sucked at it for years that was the back job for you'll new job as an internatwitter f the previous year he spent part of his time moderating content he would seen this video of a dog getting abused he removed it from the sight but for years at hunted him et was never even the specific image i could not i could not tell you what the dog looked or what the video was i just remember its existence i remember that feeling of seeing it and then of clicking think the button said no more than any one ever talks about it is this mostly invisible job of content moderation that makes twitter usable for the average person this what makes every for him on the inter net usable at all and you well was good at the job he got promotion after promotion in his department what twit don't a lot of other ten companies now call trust safety it is a hard job an just kept getting more complicated the way you all tells a there was a wild new case to examined almost every day foreign governed i personating their enemy see real people organizing horassmy campaigns it possible debates over what should countess hatespeech and regular meetings over whether to put labels on tweets that did not quite vitally the company's rules would benefit for more context about covet in twenty twenty the biggest case yet landed on yell's desk it was a case about a user who kept causing problems and this guys plans were even more rabid than just in beavers it was the president of the united states the true this is a couple buds into the pandemic trumpet tweeted that land ballast and that year's election were going to lead a widespread fraud and just tally my own crew on the table i thought that was really bat because they will not lead the weds red fraud anyway twitter's policies prohibited misleading people about the voting process the way true was down but the company ad never take an action against the president's tweets before you ell had to decide what to do i did not see a basis for changing the policy modifying it winking at it squinting and finding a violet there there was no way around it it was clearly a violation of our policy truthfully there was a lot of nervousness about crossing this line for the first time taking action on a tweet from the president of the united states the company decided that instead of removing the president's post it would put a label under it a label that just said get the facts about mailman ballast with long to a page that pushed back on rubs cleaves at a certain point when it became clear that yes this was going to happen am it became a question of who could push the button on some level we probably understand that in a moment this someone has to take a physical action to time the words get the back about mainland ballast and click the button to attach the label to the post i talked a dozens o count at moderators over the years but i never talk to somewhere toed moderator the president of the united states when it came time to take action only a handful of people at twitter had the power to do it the company a locked down access after an incident where a former contractor on his last day working there briefly deactivated trips account shouted to body or doeseck who says it was an accident also twitter just introduced this idea of putting labels on misinformation a couple weeks before and was this perfect storm where i it required elevated access and knowledge of this incredibly convoluted system for applying these labels and i was the only one who knew how to do it and i got an instruction from my boss that said are i were going to do this also because this is how life goes you'll in his husband were moving houses the day a this happened i excused myself from wrangling the dog and the movers and the relocation of stuff and sat in the front seat of the car with mi sulphone gathered to my your clop top i was on a video can with some of the other an leaders at the company who were making this decision and i remember a count down where i was going to pushed the button that would apply the label to this tweet at that same moment twitter's communication staff was going to announce the decision and it felt very important in that moment for the timing to be exactly joined up for some rest we counted down i clicked the button and then i refreshed the public view of the tweet and saw the label and the communications team said we have got it from here and i said of i have to go back and deal with the movers now and i hung up the call and i closed my lap top and i crossed the street back into my apartment it they made a move about trumped twitter you can imagine how they shoot this scene with the twitter employes hunched over a consul an a control room high living but in reality of course is the opposite most conto moderators try really hard not to bring their in political beliefs into the job in a way the legitimacy of thewhole company they work for depends on it shortly before that trump treat twitter had explained tit is reasoning for adding labels to misleading information with a block post in importantly the post was signed with yell's me it soon after that first label showed up on trips tweet his name was everywhere i wake up one morning the third day that my husband and i a in our new home to mig phone exploding because calla convey has just talked about me on fox news and is said that ism responsible for the censorship of the president's account and am responsible for censorship at twitter more generally and in that moment everything exploded thank you a mu the totem to defend free speech o one of the grarsdangers the president held out a copy of the new york post with me on it in the oral office as he announced an executive order restricting censorship by pelican valley companies his name is youellro and he is the one that said that e malar balling you look mailing no proud no from rid and for weeks discussion of me and my political opinions and my beliefs became a simba of everything that was allegedly wrong with pelican valley with decisions than companies have made twitter had tho higher security to project yell in his husband it had all taken by surprise he would expected the criticism but not that he would be the target in cases this people would usually come of tor the sea yo or the company itself but soon you well realized that what his harassers were doing was much more effective if you may companysbelieve that their employs could be hurt for enforcing the rules the might be more related to enforce than twittered an stop the they kept putting labels on his treat a trump of course lost the election tho that is probably not out he would describe what happened and after the canary six attacks of the capital he lost his twitter account too you ell did not press the button on that one but here is a detail about that day that i love the other was there is a technical question about whether it would work or whether twitter would crash c can you actually banal trust counter i the easynonoaty with that many followers his actually technically very complicated i that when you suspend somebody a twitter systems have to figure out what to do with all of the people who followed them and in other words if you fall a trump twitter has to remove him from your list to follows which sounds very straightforward when we have to do that tens of millions of times immediately we had to think about if we pushed this button is the sight in it go down is it turned out the slightstat up an group was band for a while anyway it was such a strange moment with the click of a mouse twitter had manage should do something that congress attempted twice and failed to punish gotta trump in a way that had real immediate consequences for him trump headed off to marolaga you ell got promoted he was running the whole department and that is what another mouthy rich guy started to complain about all the rules on twitter the guy was plan musk in aril twenty twenty two must announce he acquired a big stake in the company a we is after that he announce is intention to by outright as soon as the newsbroke towels employs started asking what a men for them melon had been tweeting a lot about free speech and his feeling that twitter did not have enough of it he pushed a photo of six people in dark robes with the caption shadow ban council reviewing treat and truth social exists because twitter censored free speech also stuff next temwhen to by cococola and put the cocaine back in and let us make twitter maximum fun some employes working in trust in safety worried that maximum fun might mean melon would dismantle their whole operation you all was willing to give him a chance though what i told them and what i sincerely believed was it is too soon to tell people are frequently caricature and vulcanized in the media certainly i was and that is not a reflection of who they actually are and do not prejudge at the same time you well knew that is more concerned em ploys might be right that he was abort a ship that might be about to sink he knew he needed to be alert for the sides his solution was to make a list to write down the red lines that he would not cross no matter what most ass's job was to enforce other people's rules but with la coming in he wanted to write down some rules for himself you have to have written policies and procedures that when the moment comes to make that decision you just follow the procedure that you had laid out before your whole job was about trying to not make decisions out of impulse an emotion but serve by following a playbook and that meant that before plan took over you actually had to give yourself a playbook that is right it wanted nomad by his desk at his house he wrote down his red lines i will not break the law i will not lie for him i will not undermine the integrity of an election by the way if you ever find yourself making a list this your job is insane then you well wrote down one more this was a big one i will not take arbitrarily you lateral content moderation action on and if coolant came up you just at landless person you were to do that i was a limit every one your tameshoryou the miss of they were making to or talked you about them we did you well listens got its first test pretty quickly on the date youlont officially took over twitter it was the end of october lawyers were finalizing paper work and twitter staff was attempting to enjoy the and you'll company hollowing party the scene was serial were you there for the blowing party i was were you dressed up i was not lots of people did dress up though employs brought their kids there were balloons and face painting have talked to many people who went to this party every one of them has added some bazaar new detail people saw a guy a dressed as a scarecrow walking around with what appeared to be a handler they wondered if it was musk it turned out to be a hired performer as the hollowing party had started i was sitting in a conference room doing some work and we star hearing rumors that not only has the deal closed but also the company's executives have been fired and at first it is unconfirmed i got texts from a couple of reporters who asked me is it true that vigil has been fired i said no i just saw her she is still on lying and the companies like slack and email she is of course not your sources are lying to you and then it was true such an important lesson always trust the reporters pretty soon afterward you all get summoned over to the part of headquarters where melon in his team had set up shop he was nervous and i thought oke ism about to be fired i walk past a number of my employee and i do not let on that any of this as happening because do not want a panic them because they are there with their kids find i smile and make jokes about hollowing costumes and walk over to this other part of the office where somebody who i gather works for elanmask in some capacity but they do not introduce themselves they just say how do i get access to twitter's internal content moderation systems i can pass and and blank an say you do not that is not going to happen i explain that twitter is operating under an fish consent decree that access to internal systems is regarded is highly sensitive and that there are both legal and policy reasons why we simply could not grant access to somebody courlans aid explains that there worried about an insider threat some one who might try to sabatash the sight on their way out you all tells him sure i can help with that he explain some steps they can take to protect the company and to you all surprise the aid says o k you are onto tell that to melon and that he leaves and comes back with yulan musk who at this point have seen on the inner not but i i had not met in person and melon sits down and asks well let me see our tools our tools he owns the company at this point and i show him his own account in twitters set of enforcement tools and i explained to him what the basic capabilities are and then i make a recommendation to him of what i think twitter should do to prevent insider misuse of tools during the corpora transition you ell also had recommendations about the mid terms and the up coming presidential election in brazil and as i start to explain some of the rational related to the brazilin election yellow interrupts me and says yes brazil bolsonaro and hula very dangerous we need to protect that and was floored i came into that conversation expecting him to fire me and instead he jumps ahead of me to say that he is sensitive to the risks of offline violence in the context of the brazilin election and wants to make sure that we do not interrupt twitter's content moderation capabilities it was a dream come true you are thinking maybe ism actually lived with this person yes and you all stayed he was surprised in a good way an twitter you lot talked about the company as if it should barely have any rules at all but in that moment one on one you ell thought he might turn out to be more reasonable maybe spending some time inside the company would show melon the real value of those rules which is that without the you lose your users and you lose your advertisers and you all felt you like could be sensible one of his first requests was to restore the account of the baboon b a righting stir sit but you well explained how it had broken twitters rules and plan backed off i found him to be funny i found him to be reasonable i found that he responded well to having evidence back recommendations be put in front of him and i for a moment felt that it might be possible fur twitters trust in safety work to notjust continue but also to get better after that things began to move really quickly about a week later you can laid off half the staff suddenly you well was one of the highest raking employes from the old twitter who was still working at the new one and it seems eulunliked him after some trolls went after yell for some of his old tweeds youletweated that he supported him the you at mittermelections took place mostly without incident same for the election in brazil yulan kept pushing his teams to move faster even as he was laying them off at first you also that twitter still had enough content moderators to keep the sight safe but the cuts kept commit and the work got harder and harder soon plan andvaile his first big idea for making lots of money and recooking the forty four billion dollars he had spent to by the company yell an his team thought it was insane the plan to let any on get a blue verified badge for their profile for eight dollars a month the company called it twitter blue the risks seemed obvious people would just make new accounts to impersonate brands and politicians and other celebrities yell an his team rot to seven paged document outlining the risks but the bad is went on sail anyway and almost immediately and impersonator started buying them and rein habit it may be the most famous case some one in personated the drugmaker elf lily and said that insolent would now be free the real la lily's stock price drop more than five per cent i was a vivid illustration of whit companies twitter make rules in the first place impersonators were suddenly all over the site and o ka we have to band them but somebody has to review them we cannot just ban every one and you do that with content moderators and we had instructions to fire more of our contract content moderation staff to cot costs all this same as really self evident to me and i think it would have see himself evident even before you lodged this what what was plan to take on this account do you respond to you raising these concerns do it anyway and that was a breaking point for me we reached out to twitter for comment but did not herbal reporters have sometimes got and automated pupimoges but i did not even get that yell had spent a long time gaming out cesarean for what might make him leave twitter he made that whole list he would not break the law for plan he would not undermine an election but ultimately what got to him was something he did not foresee it was not on the list it was something more personal he knew this bazaar plan would not just make people whose trust in twitter they would loose trust in him behind plan musk i was the most prominent representative of the company period and i became aware that when twitter blue turned into the predictable hot mess that it was that people would ask why did not the trust in safety team see this coming yell wire you bad at your job the day after the launch yell an melon got on the phone plan thought the problem could be fixed if apple would just hand over all the credit card information of the people doing the impersonations yell had to explain the apple would never do that he also asked plan to slow down the roll out of blue that they would have time to hire and train more content moderators to look for in impersonators plan did not understand why that would take longer than a day i got off that home call and thought i cannot solve this problem i will spend the rest of my time at this company trying to bail out a ship that might sink more slowly because ism there bailing it out but i do not want o spend the rest of my life bailing out a sinking ship yell had made up his mind to leave he called a couple of his employers to let them know i knew that that day i did not want to be walked out of twitter after almost eight years by corporate security i wanted to leave on my own terms and there was an all hands going on at the time plan's first time a dressing the company in person and during that all hands meeting i hid send on my resignation e mow put my laptop in my bag and walked out of the bending for the last time did you purposefully send it when you k was on stage yes absolutely i knew that it would take some time fur the oh a team to see it and process it for that to get to him for him to react to it and in that time i knew i wanted to be back at home and not be in the office was was one sentence as i am no longer able to perform the responsibilities of my job and resign it as of to day and five p m open i remember feeling two things on one hand i felt relieved and then i also just felt deeply sand i just wanted to get home i left twitter is grudge and was driving and i was bout half way across the bay bridge hand o i think he broke the news that i left tier and my phone exploded and i get you didn't he did not get across the fridge before though we broke leaders god i love her he is my conger an immensely proud of her even if she did kind of mess yell's plants the car you well was driving that day was a tesla by the way he was leasing it he would been trying to return it but could not get any one to respond him maybe that all been doubted to work to twitter you ell la low for a few days he spent some time writing and publish an open and the e york times it explained the very dry and principled way wide left that is when some random account reshaped something yell had tested from twenty ten about relationships between adults and miners around that time he would been working on his dissertation which called for neck companies to do more to protect miners that a hook uprights grinder but ye on replied with a treat quote this explains a lot then he link to yo ell's dissertation quote looks you ell is arguing in favor of children being able to access agile internet services and his peace thesis not true but you ell's phone exploded with abuse of messages it made the back lash to labelling a true treat look miner by comparison hundreds of messages per our homophobic anti symbiotic and also violent just deeply endlessly violent and he only had to treat once he did not even have to say directly quell as a padifial he just had to wink and nod in that direction and people took his lead ere when you well had first u see internet it the a small self contained spot separate from what we used to call real life but by the time you well quit twitter the distinction between online and off ad collapsed and i had collapsed and large part because of the company he worked at twitter the sight brought together many of the world's most influential people and then pitted them against each other these all consuming daily battles and the anger coming out of that to drive people to do things violent things pretty soon quell and his husband were overwhelmed with deathreats my husband turned to me one day and said have seen you through a lot of being targeted and being harassed have never seen you look scared before and that was the moment that we decided to leave our home and once again they moved i met with you'll at the temporary house that he and his husband are staying at while they looked for a new place after all this i thought you well might want a different kind of job i would have wanted a different kind of job the internet had almost killed it threaten to anyway but still somehow he is to to mystic about what the internet could be in a way you almost never her any more i love the internet i really do i think it the internet power to bring people together and help folks all over the world find connections that matter to them is magical and is one of humanity's greatest achievements i also think the internet can be incredibly dangerous and carry and the work of trust in safety is trying to push that back a little bit and to make the inner net more of what it can be and less of the danger is of what it could turn in to you was a idealism about the internet feels radical given how to stabilizing its bend how to stabilizing twitter has been but i know what he means back when he was a denature the internet gave you'll a place to discover other gay people the chance the talk to everyone in the world instantaneously it gave him a career it gave me all those things too i remember life before the internet it was a less frantic time it was also a lonelier one here is how titter's doing since you ell left hate speech is on the rise advertisers have fled banks that funded must take over has marked their investments down by more than half musk himself as word repeatedly that the sight might go bankrupt i kind of hope it does because what is happening a twitter right now its teaching us a lesson it is taking us away too long the word the people you well the not the enemies of free speech on line the the ones who make it possible if you get any value out of social media at all it is him part because of them they clean the place up they could feel good to be there they pull us back wen we go too far and they do censor us unlike of course we hate them fore it we convince ourselves we do a much better job if it were us was what plan thought look what happens nobody likes the guy informing the rules but watching twitter sink into the ocean you cannot help at notice how much yo miss thatguy when he is gone continued he is the cops of the pot was hard fork from the new york times who were our collaborators on

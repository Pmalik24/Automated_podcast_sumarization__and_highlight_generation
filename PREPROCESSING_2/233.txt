out any time you but you can never leave si shoterdayis about people who are stuck and years ago one of our to workers on the baker thought herself trapped in a hotel room with her siblings held her by a stranger ut at was the family is all staying at this married but there such a big family for the kids were in one room with thealdis kinin the parents next door how i was fourteen years old at the time in the room with ten year old dulia a year old triton and five year old jail on i was sharing a bed with hell now the fourteen year old the eighth greater was more or less in charge then one night through all asleep it is a middle o the night my memory is that it is i i saw a sliver of light which is what woke me up and the sound of the door closing in there was the feeling that there was someone standing at the foot of the bed i reached over i turned the lamp on and there was this woman y and i she look startled to see us and the first thing she sad was your just children i did not expect you to be cheder that is pretty creaming it what did you make of the saying that i instantly felt this is an on sat for tuition hen describe her remember she was my man's age she was probably in her forties and i a brown hair w it kind of frumpy looking somebody sit next too the boy or something did she seem menacing she seemed really distressed she was crying to she is crying she was crying yet she cried the whole time she was there she is crying as she said your children i did not expect you to be children yet and do the other could get up everyone is widowing i distinctly remember my little brother's sisters faces cause their eyes were just huge but no one said anything and a they sitting up to or they just what there still laying flat nobody m is what absent she is talking it this is not how it spas to be and then she is also crying and she tugging t herself i remember being very hard to follow what what she was saying and a eventually i said am ism sorry i think you have the wrong room and she started to cry and she said i know i know i din do this i do this i do not know why do this and then she is i pacing back and forth i and and and of crying and she sits down on the bed at the foot of the bed did she seem crazier to she seem upset i mean it is interesting i was i think it'd i was too young and unfamiliar to identify what a crazy person seems but what i could identify in that moment was that this person was unpredictable yes i go have got to be really careful how i do this i remember feeling that pressure and in that moment very very very aware of my brothers and sisters a they were little and that something back could happen to them and that the way that it was not going to happen to them was me there were no adults there i think it was the first situation i was ever in where there was you could not defer to some one else to to keep you safe or tell you what to do and what do i do and it had that quality of time slows down and your kind of your there but you are also watching and the then i did the mass in my head and i was okay i have a couple options they are i cry for help scream but i do not think any one will here am remember looking how far away the phone was from me and i realize i can reach and grab the phone and i could call for help or an even like if i could knock on the door where my sister was sister in the connecting room next door i could at least they would know something was happening in here and they could get to us in time ye but all of that felt like dam an escalation i would provoke her and what can i do to not provoke her kind of play up the fact that were children and what i felt i needed to do was i needed to calm her down and become her friend and if i could become her friend she would leave and she would not hurt us li get her to see you was a person lie make her think i was on her side as then it did not feel she did not see us as people it just felt i it felt dangerous and i did not understand why and i felt the key to being safe was slowing everything down and i remember saying ism really sorry ism sorry ism sorry ism here ism sorryi'm doing this ism sorry and i do notremember this but my brother remembers that what she said was ism sorry girls ism sorry girls and that his whole memory of this night was just being ism a boy o mad i i ask her i said ism are you coquet is everything coquet and that is she kept me no going on about how her night was hard and was ism sorry that sounds rely really difficult i as your trying to pretend her ye a this me trying to befriend her but it is right i feel i was hyper alert till i if i can understand what is going on with her i can help all tat but i could not understand cause it did not make any sense did you feel sorry for i felt concerned for her an m and then she took out her purse and as she reached into her person then she gripped on to something and i remember thinking oh no what the way a that it is a on ears all i on or a night for something i murdering my heart just dropping and then she pulled out a hair brush and then she just started brushing her hair at the foot of my bed well and at and at that point i was this is really weird incus late at and i do not think she is on to lea and then ism she sat on the vanity in front of the mirror at the desk and she took her earrings off and at oho and she started take shook her shoes off she took her cot off she was just belly a making herself comfortable till i be here now and i let her do all that ism an was sort of listening to her go on about what was wrong and then eventually after i felt enough time had passed i said ism we i we have a wake up early to go to school to morrow and we are really tired i think we we should probably go back to bed now and she's i know i ow ism sorry ism sorry ism sorry ism here ism here ism sorrier here and i said i no it is is tolly find they are here almost like can to think you ring here but ism do you mind a leaving now and i very slowly stood up and walked over to the door and every moment was making sure safe and then i open the door and she said out coquet and she put her shoes on and then she started to leave and just as she was about to leave i said oh you forgot your earrings and then she was started crying all over again gits this huge thing walked over o get the earring and then sat back down on the bed and i remember thinking why it i bringing up the earn a wear close to being safe then i then the whole thing it was glue holding started all over again we a head to lake listen to her cry calm her down and then i and ism am we have to wake up early to to school do you mind leaving and i walked her to the door and i she walked out of the door and as soon as she was out of the door i just like push the door as hard as i could to close it and when i push day li easily slammed it shat she screamed at the top of her lungs and is sere a bolt or something on the door i think i did bolted after i slammed at shall and then i heard her screaming in the hallway and then she ran down the hallway screaming and she ran back towards the door screaming and a that must women other or i was scary and the then got was quiet and then i heard this loud lake she is banging on the door gigs hard as she can write and then i hear a voice since my dad am i at open the door open the door and i rallies is not hurting on the door i an when the door and my dad standing there in was did you hear some one screaming the hallway sand then i tell is whole story an mi there is this woman she was in a room i tell shall the details and he is fury's yours mad a and then he told us to stay there shut the door done open the door and then he went down stairs and talk to the hotel

evidence of one that tiny tiny mistake that is in a minute jicagabob a radio when our program continues to samaritan life from or glass to day show stuck for these long lock down days and weeks and months stories of people trapped in one situation or another flong stretches stuck i say this recording these words in a coset at home here on oo a tap that is the sound of we tapping hangers and a shirt ism this writer name demand linker red this calm for the magazine and website the week about how right now the schools an job shut down we have all become on mood from the future wee stuck in the present and it is meter when wee gunning forward to graduation or you job or whatever else we are building for ourselves in our lives and a normal time e will be looking forward to and he tries to make the case at this is a big big do human beings live their lives in time he writes our sense of ourselves is partly who were trying to be come quote a life without forward momentum is to a considerable extent a life without purpose re's the kind of purpose that lifts our spirits and livens our steps without the amendment purpose we founder a as am without a future is a life that feels less worth living because it the life haunted by a shadow of futility and quit have to say have thought about that much these last few weeks because many people that um come to i just see how they are stretched out by how weird we formless the days have become the normal routine is all on and all us have only the cloudy a sense of what the futures going to be at three of our progatodays about a family that is in that mental hunger down trying in it by when you stuck doors for long stretches of time weird things can happen let us get to this a this is factory cold case see know i those locked room detective stories were there is a crime in some room in it is under how the culprit even got into the room this extort is a kind of about that sort of situation what of our producers not ramen explains this thing happened resold that made no sense to me at all my families been isolating and suburban crocheter new york where my parents live and i mean hard core isolating we see no one we go nowhere we haven't been inside i store or ban around other humans in two months for food we do curbside pick up our delivery which privilege i know then we do this insane disinfection crosses where we wipe everything down with a nighty per cent rubbing alcohol ten per cent water solution we made our selves when we are done the room smelts a sterilized doctors office when we go for walks if we see any one we cross the street a block ahead we pick up all mail with disposable gloves leaven in the garage for twenty for hours we used to spray with cell first we angry that was overkill but to be honest i still doit behind my families back in my mind there is noway any term could break through our impenetrable disinfect and fortress but somehow after doing this day after day for seven street weeks i work up fairly early in the morning an felt it an the oof a cold that is my husband jerry i was run down a running owns a sorthrod and a couple of days he was fine but i was how the helped that even happened how could he possibly have gotten a cold we been supercareful because he has an immune deficiency when that affects his respiratory system it keeps me up at night sometimes because if the cold virus made into our house then the coroner iris could to and then there was a crack in our armor i needed to know where we had failed jerry and i consulted an expert and a very safe social distance where are you ism in cot if will you nip o kingdom can i on the cost is on looking out over the see him really well isolated this is roneckels who really knows about colds study them for fifty years he ran a place called the common cold center at cardifuniversity almost immediately i told this all the precautions we were taking i do not understand how this is physically possible an just really one to know how did this how did this happen how could he have gotten this w it is a bit of a mystery let me see if i can ask you some questions to what mig other li a detect a you say you have not actually went anybody si a son you have no simply much anybody shaken hands or dying that no oo a what about the dormant out side as anybody else much a handle have to open to ten to of i o leery man well here is that have done on every time we go out the houses started to spray the door handle with lineal and on and now i made the paint commons there is a bags street going down the tittle an to because if s hated much i can personally guaranty the door nob was safe at the next way you call pick up a cold from some one he is by what we called an hard sol the a just tiny particles am i is there any way that some one could have been out side on coffin an sneezing m may be small particles of coming is that a possibility that seem the only possible way because we will see people jogging walking towards us in the cross the street and if there is any potential for them to have sneeze tor cat in the trail ya as possibaliiv you caught down wind from them i mean sure but pretty down on likely exhales most on to a different line of questioning i mim homing in now on two possibilities for game did germy experience any itching o told with this a at be that he had itching in the throat or now because if you had any itching i would tend to think that it could be some sort of align no no not that i can recall and he is been tested twice no haulargis which leaves one last possibility when i did not even imagine not in my wildest dreams the thing that made him sick it was inside him all along we are carrying a lot of bacteria around throat and now normal now if we get street and you did mention the geramanity to have a bit of ha slight me in deficiency but stress course he says to get even more immune deficient that it is possible that some of the bacteria that a normally hanging around in the throat or not of germy of takin that opportunity of low immunity to make a bit of an infection si think on tuning that it is probably a bacterial infection because i cannot see how an earth you would have got a cold with all the precautions tit your taking we e o insight of him already not fires but he bacterium but it is masquerading as a common colt that is his best guess basically the call was coming from inside the house t o not apter how long would army have been how on would have been just hanging out there with him could it be runs could be something

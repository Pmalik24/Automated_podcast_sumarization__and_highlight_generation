answering your questions and as always i will drive to be as clear as possible as succinct as possible and as thorough as possible while still answering as many questions our a m a episode as i can without these sessions becoming unreasonably long i should also point out that if you asked a question and it was not answered this a m a it may very well be answered in the next a m a the first question which had a lot of up boats meaning many people wanted the answer to this question came from jacks lip fort and the question was about called altradian rhythms for those of you that are not familiar with altradiang rhythms altradian rhythms are any rhythms that are shorter than twenty four hours and typically when people ask about or talk about alltradin rhythms they are referring to ninety minute rhythms have talked about these on the podcast before and jackpot's question was how do you use ultradian rhythms in your daily work there's more to the question but first off i do use altradian rhythms that is i leverage the fact that these do exist in all of us as a way to engage in focused bouts of mental work once or twice or sometimes three times per day however i use them in a way that is grounded in the research on altradiang rhythms for learning and memory in a way that might not be obvious just from their name that they are ninety minute rhythms sell get into the details of how to use altradin rhythms to best capture euro plasticity that is the brainsability to change in response to experience and in a way that should allow you to get one or to or maybeven three focus bouts of learning per day which can greatly accelerate learning of cognac material languages mathematics history for sake of school or work or maybe just a hobby or personal interests of some sort and for skill learning in the physical domain as well jacks then went on to ask you have mention before that you try to include at least one ninety minute focus block per day as part of your work an over all mission and indeed that is true i try to get at least one of these focused ultradian rhythm blocks per day that is a period of about ninety minutes where ism focused on learning something are doing something that is cognitively hard although typically i aim for two of these sessions per day he then goes on to ask what is the maximum number of blocks you can perform sustainably the answer to that is probably for and i say probably because some people have schedules life styles in which for ninety minute blocks of focus learning is possible per day but that is highly unusual for most people it is going to be one or two maybe three for i would place in the really extraordinary end of things maybe if your cramming for exams or you have manage to go on a writing retreat or a learning retreat of some sort where you can devote essentially all of your non sleeping non eating time to learning but most people simply cannot organize their life that way the short answer is for me it is one or two per day is the target and three would be the maximum he then went on to ask do you take vacations or extended brakes from these ultradian rhythm sessions and the short answer is no typically i try and do this every day and yes even on the week ends but on the week end the eltradian rhythm focus learning bout might just be reading a book for about ninety minutes or which might not be as cognitively difficult as it is for other sorts of work that i perform during the week i occasionally miss a day entirely for whatever reason travel obligations relate tho family camera but in generalize try an do this every day i do think that the circuits for focus are i guess the non biological way to put it would be kept warm but essentially that accessing the circuits for focus is made easier by arising them regularly and that is because the circuits for focus are indeed themselves amenable to neural plasticity in other words the more you force yourself to focus the easier focusing gets it'll now answer the last part of the question and then i will go through and emphasize some tools that any one can use in order to leverage ultradian rhythms toward learning bouts either connive learning or physical skill learning or a commination of the two the last part of the question jacks asked was if you knew you needed to drastically increase the amount of focus you do daily how would you schedule that focus and recover from it that is an excellent aspect to this question and i will now give you the details of how i would use and schedule trading rhythms it'll offer you a tool have never take about this too human labpodcast and i will dispel a common myth about ultradian rhythms that points to a leaver not an easier way to leverage them for maximum benefit o lasso as i mention before ultra dean rhythms are these ninety minute cycles that we go through from the time that we are born in til the time we die indeed even during sleep we are experiencing and more less governed by these altradein rhythms this question and this answer is not much about sleep but just know that when you go to sleep at night until you wake up in the morning every ninety minutes or your patterns of sleep that is the percentage or ratio rather of slow wave sleep to light sleep to rapid give movement sleep changes in a way such that each ninety minute cycle gates the next cycles her flips the on switch for the next ninety minute cycle than that ninetymute cycle ends flips the on switch for the next one and on and forth i mention all that because during the daytime the same thing is true but most people do not know when the ninety minute altradean cycles begin because if you think about it you could wake up on the basis of an alarm clock or noise in the room or simply because you naturally wake up in the middle of an altradean ninety minute cycle does that mean for instance that if you wake up sixty minutes into an ultradean cycle that the next thirty minutes of your waking right because that sixty minutes needs to continue to ninety to complete o ultradean cycle that the next thirty minutes after waking are related to the ultradean cycle that you were still in during sleep or does it start a new altradean cycle and the answer is the former that ultradan cycle continues even if you wake up in the middle of it and a lot of people who want to leveragaltradean cycles for learning say hell how do i know when to start one does it start when i hit my stop watch can i just set a clock and work for ninety minutes another short answer is now and tat might seem unfortunate but the good news is that you can figure out when your first proper ultradean cycle of the day begins simply by asking your self when are you most alert after waking that is if you were say to wake up at seven a m and let say that is the end of an ultradean cycle or perhaps your in the middle of an altradean cycle does not matter what you need to watch for or pay attention to for a day or is when you start to experience your greatest state of mental alertness in the morning and here we can discard with all the issues and variables around caffeine or no coffin hydrating or no hydrating exercise is one variable that will consider in a moment but here is the deal these ultrared cycles are actually triggered by fluctuations in the call glucocorticoid system the system that regulates carts all release and as some of you probably heard me say before coatis all even though it is often discussed as a terrible thing its unochronic stress cortical cortical et camera coatis all is essential for health and every day we get a rising carts all in the morning that is associate with enhanced de man function an handed alertness an hancetability to focus on and forth in fact the protocol that ism always beating the drum about that people should get sunlight in their eyes as close to waking as possible that actually enhances ere increases the peak level of coatis all that is experienced early in the day and that sets in motion a number of these alltradein cycles for instance if you wake up at seven a m and you find that for the first hour after waking you ten to be a little bit groggy or you happen to be groggy on a given day but then you notice that your attention alertness starts to peak somewhere around nine thirty a m or ten a m you can be pretty sure that that first all radian cycle for learning is going to be optimal to start at about nine thirty or ten a m how can i say about if it is indeed a ninety minute cycle well this is really where the underlying neurobiology in these altradian cycles converge to give you a specific protocol the changes in carts all that occur throughout the day involve yes a big peak early in the day if you are getting your sunlight and coffin and maybe even some exercise early in the day but typically that peak comes early and then across the day the base line gutters alibi it comes down but bounces ghost a limit it is not a flat line if we were to measure your lucucorticoid levels each one of those little bumps corresponds to a shift in these all train cycles if you find that you are most alert at nine thirty or starting to become alert at nine thirty and then typically you have a peak of focus and concentration around ten a m that is really valuable to know because the way that the molecules that control euro plasticity that is the changes in neurons and other sellotapes in the brain that allow your nervous system to learn and literally for new connections to form between turns which is basically the basis of learning those fluctuate according to these up train cycles what does this mean this means if your peak in alertness and focus and energy could even be experiences physical energy occurs at about nine thirty a m i would start your first altradan cycle for learning somewhere around there certainly nine thirty m would be ideal but ten a m would be fine as well and then you have about one hour to get the maximum amount of learning and even within that all train cycle this is where there is a lotic confusion out there people think shall radian cycles are ninety minutes therefore we should be in our peak level of focus throughout that ninety minutes in reality most people take about ten or fifteen minutes to break in to a really deep trench of focus and then periodically throughout the next hour they will pop out of that focus have to deliberately refocus this is why if possible you want to turn off why i connections and put your phone in the other room or turn it off if you do need your phone or why just be aware of how distracting those things can be to getting into a deep trench of focus but the point is this these nineymenute cycles occur periodically throughout the day but there is going to be one period early in the day and here ism referring to this periods starting at about nine thirty or ten a m and then likely another one in the mid toluate afternoon that are going to be ideal for focus learning and that focus learning bout should ideally have you set your clock a stop watch or something to measure ninety minutes but do assume that there is going to be some bitter at the front end where you are not going to be able to focus as deeply as you would then you will get about an hour of deep focus and then you really start a transition out of these a radian cycles how do when the afternoon it'll radian cycle ours well just as in the morning it occurs because there is ay brief but significant increase in the glucucorticoid system in the mid to late afternoon i e wish i could tell you it is going to be two p m or its going to be it is going to be three p m that is really going to depend on the individual when you an jest caffeine some of the other demands of your day but you can learn to recognize when these two periods for optimize learning will occur and here the key principles watch for a day or two meaning pay attention to when you have your peak levels of physical and mental energy in the morning that is between waking and noon and then again between noon and about six or seven p m although ism sure that there are some late shifted focus that will experience their peak an focus somewhere around mixer seven p m especial if they are waking up around ten or eleven a m as i know some people out there are once where those peaks in focus occur on your schedule set a stop watch for one altradian cycle in the early part of the day this example i was saying nine thirty but if you cannot hop on it until ten that is fine set it for ninety minutes consider that block wholly meaning rule out all other distractions but assume that within that ninety minute block you are only going to be able to focus intends for about one hour and just know that the molecules that control narroplastisy and these things have names and yes brain traveler trophic factor obedient was of the most famous of those but there are others as well in fact the very receptors that control synaptic strength the connections between neurons some of the narrow transmitters and modulators involved in synaptic plasticity they undergo regulation by these old radian r changes in glucucorticoid and then trying capture a second all radian learning block in the afternoon again just knowing that the first ten or fifteen minutes consider it mental warm up and the you get about an hour it is not exactly sixty minutes but about an hour to maximize learning you're trying to learn something really capture it during that phase as well now is there a third opportunity or a fourth opportunity this relates to jackpot's question directly and the short answer is not really you unless you are somebody who requires very little sleep within the twelve or sixteen hours that one tends to be awake during the day or eighteen hours that one tens to be awake they're really only two of these major peaks in the glucucorticoid system that trigger the onset of these circadian cycles again there is there is serve a camping up in a camping down of glucucorticods throughout the day but the real key heres to learn when you tend to be most focus based on your regular sleep wake cycle cabin an take exercise et camera and again that is going to vary from person to person and you really only have two opportunities ore two a trade cycle ls to capture in order to get the maximum focus challenging work done ah a learning for somebody that wants to learn an immense amount of material or who has the opportunity to capture another altradean cycle the other time where that tends to occur is also early day some people by waking up early and using stimulants caftan and hydration or some brief higintensity exercises can trigger that quarts all pulse to shift a little a earlier that they can capture a morning work block that occurs somewhere let say between six and seven thirty a m solitzink about our typical person at least in my example that is waking up around seven a m and then i said has their first alltradian work cycle really flip on cause that bumping parts all round nine thirty or ten a m if that person were say to set their alarm clock for five thirty a m then get up get some artificial light if the sun is not out you turn on bright of artificial lights or if the sun happens to be up that time of year get some sunlight in your eyes but irrespective of sunlight were to get a little bit of brief high intensity exercise may be ten or fifteen minutes of skipping robe or even job jumping jacks are go out for brief jog what happens then is the parts all pul starts to shift earlier and then next day in the following day and on and forth provided there still doing that exercise first thing and ideally getting some light in their eyes as well well then they have an opportunity to capture and increase in quarts all that is now shifted from about seven a m to about eight thirty a m they can capture an hour of work there and then they will also still be within that rising phase of quarts all in the nine thirty to ten a m block that lasts until about i eleven thirty or it might have lunch perhaps after lunch they do a non sleep deep least may be they do not may be our napper may be or not does not really matter and then in the afternoon and i would suspect it would now be in the earlier afternoon some time around two or two thirty would be typical although again that that exact time will very person a person then they would want a schedule another ninety senate work blocks that is how you can capture three now you can start to see also why capturing four altradean work blocks would be exceedingly rare is just not typical that people are awake for that much of the day yo eft to sleep at some point and i should mention that if you are going to force yourself to wake up earlier on a consistent basis you probably should be trying to get to sleep a little bit earlier as well because it is not just the quality but the duration of quality sleep that really matters for learning and i should also remind everybody that the actual rewiring of anurans does not occur during any focus work block at actual occurs during deep sleep the following night and the following night enduring non sleep deep least is why non sleep deep least can accelerate learning because it is in states of rest that the actual connections between her on strengthen or welkin or new means are added in a way that allows for what we call learning o case o one or two altradan work k blocks per day is typical three would be really exceptional and for would be extraordinary look for them meaning look to see when you are feeling most focus and alert typically in the period before waking and noon and typically in the period between noon and bedtime given your standard in take of caffeine and exercise and other life events please also remember that even though it is an all radian ninety minute work block the curl plasticity is going to be best trigger within a sixty minute portion of that and there is no way to know exactly when that sixty minutes begins and ends until you actually begin the work block this is really design to be empirical you neat actually go do this what you will notice again is that it is hard to focus at first than you will drop into a state of focus you may get distracted that is perfectly normal you refocus get back into triggering learning that is really what your doing your triggering learning and then they will be some taper and thanyou will be out of the all trade work block now it is also key to understand that myself another people should not expect that they are only working during these ninety minute work blocks it is just that a lot of the sorts of demands of our day including cooking and chopping vegocery is and email and texmessaging and chat media lot of those things do not require intense focus of the sort that i believe jacks is asking about maximizing and that ism referring to when i talk about these all train workbooks and then as a final point have bee tell go about these all radian work blocks and focus et camera in a context that brings to mine ideas about cognitive work learning a language learning math a writing or creating doing something relate to music et camera but these ninety minute all trading work blocks also directly relate to physical skill learning as well and to physical exercise as well if you are somebody whose really interested in improving your fitness and your fitness requires lot of focus et mention for instance when i go out for a long run on sundaes which is part of my fitness routine i deliberately not thinking about much ism just trying to cruise along i might focus the obit on my pace and stride may be an audio book of listening to or a podcast but typically ism just count of cruising along it is it is low cognitive demand work these all treating work blocks can really be maximized for pure connive work a book type work et camera music et camera or they can also be leverage toward skill learning if you're trying to learn how to dance or how to perform o particular athletic move or you are trying to get better at some skill that requires a lot of focus and a linemen of muscular movement and cognitive demands et camera well then these are also going to be ideal for triggering narrow plastic to get better in the motor skill base domain as it is called et camera if you to learn more about up radian shifts in burro plasticity and all treating workouts will certainly do more on this in the standard superman lad podcast b ut the keywords to look up if you want to explore this further on line its not something that a lot of people know about is called iterative metaplasticity it is a vast literature and one that be happy to teach you in a standard podcast episode but in the interest of getting to more questions from you all hopefully the answer give given you now has been complete enough yet clear enough and yet precinct enough that you can start to leverage these really powerful aspects of iterative it o plasticity and all radian rhythms for learning and i just to point out that these opportunities for focus learning that occur in these ninety minute ultraism cycles are really terrific opportunities they are offered to you at least twice every day and you can really learn to detect when they occur and when they are likely to occur you can certainly learn at other times in the twenty four hour cycle but for anyone who tried to stay up late at night cramming for an exam or for somebody who tried to learn during the sleepiest time of their afternoon we can be very familiar with the fact that there are times of day in which we are best at learning and as have just described there are ways to capture those moments and they are valuable moments even though it is just about three hours per day are really only two hours pray cause of the sixty ninety minute thing that i talked about a few minutes ago learn to know when these occur and really treat them as valuable maybe even wholly in the sense that they are really the times that are offered up to you each day by your own biology in ways that will allow you to get better pretty much at anything thank you or joining for the beginning of this ask me

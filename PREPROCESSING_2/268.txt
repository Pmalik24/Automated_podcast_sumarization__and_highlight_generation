beginner i was a real beginner i be given one of this magic kits you give a little kid that they sell i toy stories and then i went to the bottomed counting public library an liberty road and found some books on magic in the library and it blew my mind these books hes incredible secrets were just sitting there right there in the shelves and the open anybody could look at them i could not understand why any body was in any the other isles a sell o they do not know they do not know these are here before long i was up advertising in the bottomry newish times i was booking shows that paid five dollars i believe the price was in the add these we kidsbirt take parties i dad would drive me the kid's parents would drive me home after a few months of this i got i call from a real magician like and a dolt who actually knew he was doing who it notice somebody under cutting is prices who are you he asked it was not hostile the magic world o bottom more was small and lav been knew wet everybody to have some any new show up he was just curious and generous you let me know there was magic store down town on charges street where guys got together loose magic hard on saturdays the place would be crowded with any magicians who did not have gigs that day and they would smoke and show each other moves i old guy name canteen with the huge white beard used to go there youould give you one of his special coins it was stamped with the words canteen he knew who deny n you bought a trick they to you to the special table in the back from and a you down i taught it to you one o on is a re member it this was done with kindness with helpful tips how to till your hand how to turn your body when to pause for effect is exciting to be taken seriously by these man chasing these secrets peri did my act from seventh grade through myself ma year of high school and many times it got kind of carved into me i could probably perform it word for word and move from move up through my thirds but now it'd have a hard time i shall regularly have dreams i am supposed to be the act had one two weeks ago wedesidtod do this weeks radio show about magic a few months back when i wand that avid castinboun when my cot workers here was also a kid magician it also my birthday parties for years starting me was in fourth grade anthem moment we set down in the studio to talk about this it only took about a minute to be comparing card moves with the four ass yet one of hem his face upright but you can sell go on two or three for all i know is that you are doing a double lift on that first days tripling a triple wife then he god her nelmsley count the hen very quickly we just started comparing gear appearing came also disappearing came oh i had the disappearing came didn't have the

magician would be more amazing if they walked up to your and handed you record that said certified pommel o lo did did i would talking about this stuff and he said this thing that honestly had never crosse my mind ever in my life until he brought it up we are talking about whether we were any good i always thought i was fine and then it occurred to me that may be the reason i got hired w isn't that i was any good it was is ten years old and it was probably adorable to have this little magician come over and is three piece but and do tricks for your kit is birthday i feel this is obviously true and on finding it upsetting cause what i realize is i thought i was the one who was in charge of the situation during the magic show and i was controlling everybody's minds with my mind and my magic free and out your saying is actually that kind of the joke was on me i was the entertainment but not in a way that i understood hit is got to be true right that is clearly to me isn't adult if you are hay there is just little still me over and do magic for your party in tat few t is when i usually thing about my years during magic shows the biggest feeling i have about it as i feel embarrassment there is a cloud of embarrassment that keeps me from staring at it too closely bike i know i was doing these storeabout tricks and beginner's level slide hand and it toxic and to hie and a keep with a great great finding and what a member the act some of the dis pi corny but at the same time i can say for sure audiences work engaged they were engage from beginning to end people were not restless and i know i got laughs and i thought i was good cost seemed i was good wasn't efforts i can de tat i realize i i do not have a clear picture of this at all and there is thingsabott our past that will never fully get into proper perspective but this this is a completely answerable question i called outing melter who was a good friend o my miss when my mamas alive who laved around the

avid and i real it our common conjuring careers as magical misterfire and master magician he are talking we realized that much of our pleasure in magic was just knowing how the tricks were done the quicken itself was kind of mesmerizing with its false chambers and flaps and secrets of the audience did know every trick had a principle behind it and was cool to think about the principle the magician o tricky jay one said this thing in an interview he said there are many effects in magic were woulds going on behind the scenes is actually much more interesting thanwhith the audience sees and his magician who sort one to say if only you could know what is really happening here never the last ye once avid and i dove into a bunch of stories with actual master magicians and i have to say the most exciting moments in all those stories are about that about how intrigued and psychological and ingenious what they do is ad even as wave been writing in editing the stories like over and over have gotten that feeling of excitement about it that i used to get handling the traps or practicing the cups and balls and that to day show from eve easy chico its this america life on our glass stay with us con the old is trick in the book it can take years to come up with the magic trick several magicians told me this which many wonder what are they doing all that time what takes years to make something that just a couple minutes long and isn't the part magic i really knew nothing about for my time is a kid magician i can never invented a trick then even occur to me s i wanted to see it feu don't ow on emptily cribs when they would do the house stores and get to the bedroom guys would always say this is where the magic happens an looked very different contacts but the act of inventing a magic trick that actually where the magic happens and i wanted to finally witness the dark beating heart of where magic comes from i wanted a magician to explain step by step what takes years ut the one magician who seemed notes interested but actual kind eager to come forward and do that was teller to pen and teller tellers the smaller one the one he never speaks in the act but corse in real life he talks and he the idea of explaining how a trick is made he went said in elecshure because if yet understand the good magic trick and i m really understood that write o to the ma calico the core of its psychology the magic trick gets better not worse the tricked agreed to explain here on the radio as one that he loves to perform it performs a lot an h started working on it years ago looking to invent something new open an teller's live stage show here was his old effect that he was intrigued by we might there right be something in it that he cult adapt for himself it is not unusual for a magician teller to take some secret from a very old trick it were purpose it into something original his particular one came from a magic book written in the nineteen twenties and thirties by a guy in nabraska named avid p about and i mat your magician who made his living is alone shark hit was famous among magicians back then he invent these incredible effects and perform them but only in his living room he thought that was the best place for magic who de the thirst good teller all the big naves of magic would come to this guy's little house in lion the brass to see these great shows and towards the end of his life when people would come to his house he would show he would show you the book that he had the it was all f his magic explain didn't detail he died the book was not published his wife said she would published she died two years later the house was sold the book ad vanished it was a legend in a certain corner of the magic world this lost book wit the incredible secrets when publisher went on a decades long quest to locate the book found pieces of it and thin finally a full manuscript and four legal sizes lucky finders forty years later a nineteen seventy four in put it into print for the first time and the trick that attracted taller was this golden ball six enter across a small cannon ball that bit could float around his living room that wasuppost to be one of the most beautiful routines in magic that is exactly teller's taste tell e love is doing silent beautiful tricks alone on stage an sola bits this are in every pen an teller stage so is most famous tread is a pantomime with a rows shadow on a carving knife ill stripping things down to the absolute simplicity and it seems a ball and a hoop and a person is about as simple as you can get he got to work oh and i started by taking the original avid part book this long lost book and i set this book on a music stand my library at home and i learned this let me just pause on this page this a page which has seven photographs and is that abbot that is avid habit yes he looks a bit a white haired fire plug and he is in a black suit and he is moving a hoop over a ball and his little arrows indicating which way you turn it this way and that yes the level of the tail that he provided was astounding i me i i feel he is he is speaking directly to me he tells you how to make the paper mashie that you make a ball to strips of newspaper ex wide anklet me let me show you some of the some of the the beautiful beautiful floating moves that he created ah the cay was standing up and walk across the stage i may be is ho ti mention this earlier tell er an my coworker avid castebam and ire doing this interview on the stage were pen an teller do their magic so five nights a week in my spa guys and big theatre at the red hotel and we left t go quite a distance to of thisork tell her picks up the ball and the thread he ask us not to stay anything here on the radio about the details of where the thread goes or how exactly it attracts with the ball but i still light i can say s a picture a guy and a whoop and a ball and a very long thread on a stage the early days of this ism learning moves to make the ball float and ow a say i the ball is floating up the string towards you and then from your left hand to your right hand you areactually catching the sound of it which is which is not normally audible to to anordience raise can i just rest do it tell a gastric a he summoning it with his hand and it glides along the thread to him that is a sound your her i wit is mind mending is that avid i can actually see that he is tilting the thread downwards and that is why it sides towards him but we can see the balls on a thread we can see how it is dyne we hear it sliding alarm ait is critic and at the same time it totally looks he is this sorcerer who enchanted this an animate object into obeying him that is beautiful actually when you see the thread yes it is here's her's one of avid jabots moves that the event the ball is floating from hand to hand without really any movement on the part of either of the either of the hands just by an intricate whether the thread is interlaced in the thinkers then takes the hoop and speeded around the ball in various ways which makes it look there cannot possibly be a thread there but of course we can see the thread can i say that is crazy that is convincing your brain really cannot set that your brain can not sort this out it is visual double talk it is amazing ism sitting here ism doing it and it still fooling my brain which i totally remember from being a kid magician and practicing the thumb palm in the french drop and all the other sledge hand in front of a mirror if you do it right it fools you it feels amazing to you and that is how the tricks word this is teller's first step to inventing his own version in the tread spend mints mastering avid jabots moves from a hundred years ago i started to figure at what else he can make the ball on his own hour practice every day it the bollanthread on vacation with him and videotape himself see how the moves li oh no i stray us with i here i am in a cabin in you talk my pajamas i just i was just obsessed with it he took a trip to pronto were a magician grand thought him the version of the floating ball routine that he did and the ma tower was there he tried this thing just con it messing around he put the ball on a bench and lifted one end of the bench and then made the ball roll up the bench and then later he had the that that the footing ball as actually more interesting to watch when it is not floating hen it is just this ball that somehow alive and rowing round it is weirder and it is more mysterious is less clear what is propelling it it began to cross my mind that no and had ever done a floating ball that did float and i was i was jubilant i thought oh why i got an i i finally got an idea i finally got in o original idea to go with this with this with this method the next step was to put something together into routine and actual trick as it might be performed this about a tremendous amount of invention making up all kinds of new moves on his own for the floating ball that does not float here is here is a move were i kick it across the stage in the land softly i come man just discover you doing say kicking the ball on its going may be twelve feet out there and then suddenly coming to a stop and just sitting on the floor what you would think in real life if you kick a ball the ball does not stop until it runs out a momentum this is suddenly that ball stops stops dead unbelievably difficult it is it is me using leverage and slack and all sorts of things i ai hes end minds inventing these moves an nine alone in the theatre after they finished the shows and all this was preparation to show his partner pan and this point had not seen anything it was a lot of preparation all sorts of things i can been practising with ha silver ball i gave it habit is mysterious floating gold or and now e er placed it with a kid'sbal the bound the size of a kick bad his magic is more magical if you do with real stop people know an he but a sat it is changing fancy cause he thought ready see kids bad at playground but he says when he put the changing fence up on stage it suddenly felt the set of god spot and he did did avid i asked teller why dreg to show pan something rob to something with the moves you would been inventing he said now no that is he thing bout magic you you cannot look at a half finished piece of magic and know whether it is good or not it has to be perfect before you can ivaluewate whether it is good the magic is a fantastically meticulous form you you forgive other forms a musician misses a note moves on fie the will come to the conclusion of the piece magic is s an on off switch either it looks s a miracle or it is stupid i spent up i i would guess it was it was probably eleven months or putting together a routine of moves that i invented with the non floating floating ball and i showed it the pen described the act that he saw what was it i believe that what he saw was very very artist it was very lonely it was very sweetly melancholy it was trying to recreate that sense of solitude in i in in a theatre later night he sat way back in the theatre wait towards the back i that he could get a wide stage view of it i finished it and he quietly got up and left the theatre and i thought that is probably not a good sign i went back to his dressing room and we talked for a while i never being in the dress from being really really really wicked uncomfortablethis of course this teller stage partner pendular ere was nothing about it the game i thought it was tactically good as a juggling bit i thought it was ora juggling he means the mechanics of moving the ball around i was the first time wed really had something that outside of outside of the overlap to get into the penal teller show it has to be an idea that appeals to both pen and me and he said and to his credit he said that he thought it was way to circa display it was wag to sort of arts pretentious i remember teller giving a good it mat of me cause i said what is the idea behind and he was a very offended hit was like it the ideas the trick and i think it had not clicked with him because it laced and a central dramatic idea of course to me i i i was i was all wrapped up in the idea that it was a floating wile was not floating which is not a very good idea an it is that is not an idea that communicates to an audience he ex say startups they talked about what idea might work with the trick pen sun gest it presenting it this a kind of history piece and od cossack the period music a kind of thing the would do in a magic history conference tell i it excited about that he met him later adding to the idea they tell the science he was using a method from a hundred years ago that electronic acnolegy and know help from off stage imagining that virgin in the trick pen on i back quote from reading this a loss little faith in the idea i guess we can tried this but it dis not been to bring another level in and which it's do it the wat he wanted and not look for more here ism sure pe bill could find i now it seems to make a lot of what i did not may be worse i in it of to every bet in the show that is for sure toll tin y that seem wrong for pen to settle he got back to word sole the problem and his you are making this trick turn from just the mechanics moving a ball around on the thread actually thinking through what tells a story what's engaging wit's fun to watch what satisfying tell i realized one of the things that was missing from the trick he says any magic trick is better if there is a reason the magic happens for instance if you put let us say a coin into your hand close your hand snap your fingers open it and the coin is gone there is not much of an impact to that and the reason for that is that the action seems arbitrary that there does not seem to be a cause the make that of the happen foot why would a coin disappear yes if you put the same coin in your hand close your hand and even do just this even just say take out as a a match the match pass it around your hand an act with a sudden jolt as though something has happened inside your hand with a coin melted away and you have been burnt and you open your hand and there is no coin now that level of acting that level of causality that suggests that somehow the fire of a match could make a coin melt away suddenly adds a dimension to it that i think is pretty crucial butts o he gives it story it's that a little bit of a story it gives it it gives it emotion and i realize that i was doing all of this stuff with nothing causing it there was no cause why is the ball moving around i the ball is just moving around it was just arbitrary movement when i tell us collaborators he bettering makes name johnny commend we men suggestion that changed everything now he sad you got a treat the bad a train dog he will give a reason for its movement women cause to tell it tried it i i thought what you what is a typically a train dog to i jumps through a hoop a train dog is not always going to do what it once what you wanted to do it'd hold it the hoop the dog would not respond it'd call the dog and instead of jumpingthrough the hoop it would come over and land on the room of the hoop i sit down and ignore it what is the dog do when you ignore it while i very often comes to you and what we here is what is happened what is happening as ism realizing that the plot of this is the dog trainer is getting the dog to jump through hoop that becomes the plot that becomes a little bit of a story now i can't a plot and a story tell it id something else at this stages it is essential and bases it to the kind of drama that particularly happens in a magic shell one of the things that you do as a magician is you try to you you try to put yourself in the position of the audience at every moment you say what would i be thinking as this moment and you try to manipulate that one of the ways you do that is my giving the science a little chance to figure something out isn't take it away from and he does that with this routine re imagines it the ball starts on the bench always in contact with the bench the audience willthink the ball is controlled by the bench andtht he lifts the ball off the bench it sticks to his finger and floats in the air they might conclude that it is his finger that controls the bad d then he drops to the for away from his finger each time you think of something i give you the chance to think of that and that i take it away from you one one thing after the other i takes a lot of work he finishes the new routine shows it to his partner pen who hates it true true he hates it just he makes it further away my take at least it was an abstractly gid thing it is closest my taste what is becomes something a dog it is moved very far ziti because you hate and animated so wite to i hate i hate om i hate actable amorphism i do not relationships with animals for a and of objects at all which is basically with the si e but we the thing is who where is my argument where is his argument what is he supposed to say this a delicate conversation in here these two men ho respect each other bit do not socialize or hang out together ho been arguing they say constantly and fiercely but productively for ever forty years and pan knows how much work teller is put into this trick and how mice use enjoy performing it every night and ti's not saying this out right but it is it is implicit this is beautiful this is mister going this is entertaining people will love it it is really important to me all those five things are true sit is very very uncomfortable ad contour because pen agrees it is a great trick totally works he does does not it it does not eel their show to him is red ball that is also a disobedient poppy that is the kind of idea you might see in a cartoon and the tried about the show around the principle that there would be nothing in the show that feels even vaguely familiar to the audience nothing you can imagine seeing in anybody ease's work pen does not say yes whens they know either he does a teller to be in the show it still needs one more idea to really make it ours now have respect for each other it try to come up with that idea and i do not know which one who is brought it up i think ism the one who said what if we actually said i said the when mike close and johnny tompion came and watch me do this trick test do other magicians they admire they knew there was a thread there and because they knew there was a thread there they were more baffled then an audience that could imagine that there was that's was being done with a little gyroscope inside the inside the ball i said what if we say right out at the top here is he trick that is dug with a piece of thread in a special back drop then sad i think all you need is now here is ha trick that is done with a piece of thread that gives them much it brings them over on t our side and suddenly this now had an idea and the idea was bigger than the little plot with the little ball it was bigger than all the little magic tricks it was that you can state the actual method of a magic trick clearly at the beginning of it and it can still full the hell out it can ti that that what by knowing this extra piece of information the trick becomes better another ids if the audience in the theatre the same feeling that avid i had standing on stage seeing the thread and still feeling a maze not the audience can see the thread but they know it is there somewhere pended lobby a little for sudden change in lighting the boom would reveal the thread to the audience fully visible in the end this solution just telling them about the thread was enough for him an eighteen months after teller picked up avid p bit is book to practice for the first time he an pen added the ball to their shell is not the longest they've ever worked on a trick not even close he told me about one that took him six years making anything good takes time this a there is a quit that a your partner a forty years pencil hat said about you it is kind of mean there is no better partner than teller the he is not the smartest or most creative person of ever been around but he is the partied working he would not give up you can put him on a single task in the middle of it hid him with a baseball that square in a face and he goes right back to the task with sure he is talking directly about this best and and that is true it is true i i have a certainly the dog with a slipper quality about me especially i doll trust my got this trick that we do in the show his not the trick that i thought we were going to do but it is the trick it was call we out topics o teller steered up as he said this i told his partner pen yer he does e does get choked up about tithes stuff i get choked up about o it is not it they are very different people pen and teller even the way they tell this story in teller's telling the stray has a happy end they added the extra idea f compromises reach the partnership worked when pen tells the story the compromise is little deeper i think that a teller dos a beautiful job and the audience loves it and a kind of on out it does not feel that the whole bit just snaps into what it should be it does not feel among now even now or even now you are not into that trick no the tell men i know that but a me tell her may have noticed that every show order we come up with at some point i suggest we have a show o through it he i notice that i often not headed it is a pattern that shows up but can i say again really good trick he is a beautiful job he worked really hard and the audience loves teller told me of course he knew the pen still at his tout it do not work to gather long he said without knowing something that interestingly after five years performing this trick they change the ending that more of what pen on it which is in behind the fact that it is done with the thread little more he de this version on the trick on line is video from pen an tellers tenecio folks man will link at our inside here is at they added to finally finished the try for get over six years after tell our first started practicing with habits book ant the end the retain pen walks out on stage grads the thread from tower and then dangles the ball from the three pen takes an oversize sensors cuts the thread thrall dropped to the ground and pen kicks the ball cross the stage it as mad what is acting of course we ways into that ball r cotton lining out making a very very big object and object too big to fit in a building making a disappear that is in a minute from chico bob radio when our program continues sis america lie for my glass to days programmed the magic show my coworker avid castenbaum and i both of us former kid magicians returned to magic as adults not all looks very different we have arrived it at two of our programmed too the lady vanishes conning tote this showed avid became obsessed with this one trick that he had seen back when he was a teenager the ginnispoke of word records listed as the largest illusion ever staged avid wanted to know what t was to be on the other side of that one what it was to be the magician eyes this is a trick i loved when i was a kid it'd kind of forgotten about it and then one night i was home recently watching the levy show the america the shows about this family living in the you ask in the nineteen eighties the parents are under cove russia spies because it set in the nineteen eighties these big historic moments papa president pagan getting shot ere on contra but then this one episode it opens with this to this is the status liberty avid copper fields making snatch to liberty to spear on levy everything old person i knows watching this i si remember this exact non a happening in my house i was thirteen years old about the same age as those kids and as the kid magician i think it'd circled the time and channel in the tea v guy that was our family system for reserving eleven here have tried to relive this amazing moment in america history with other people though i get mostly blank stairs but i figured some one involved it the america must have been a nerved me cause there is two minutes of the show where the family is just watching the trick on tell i reached out and ye one of the producers of the america job fields was just me i was in my parents wood panels den in pronto canada on there brown cordon a couch it is extremely possible i brought some friends just me in one other way too i was a magician as a kid the whole thing hanging out at local magic shop his collie job waistburg was there also the creator of the america job kept ribbing us through the interview where were you when you watch the avid copperfield special not watching the avid copperfield special we even aware that it happened ah i would have to say no for those of you who were not following the national magic seen in the nineteen eighties and i realize now there are many of view avid copperfield was one of two truly big name illusionists at the time it fell he was in a kind of battle with the other one dug penning both had levy specials on separate networks copperfield was handsome clear cut penning was the hippy whoring tide long hair and teeth that had poteen brains i was squarely team copperfiew my boss i re a glass i learned what we were ending the story one thousand present tea hanging love tanning's goofy sense of wonder which i heed copperfield my man seemed driven intent on proving that he was the best in the world going bigger every time in his previous tedious special he made an airplane this appear job was somehow unaware of this too was the r plane on the ground or in the sky nose on the ground o well that is not it was actually people stood around this airplane in a ring holding hands and it just vanished the statue of liberty even more amazing i watched it again with job and roll and here all just married for you imagine it is nineteen eighty three you in the family living room on some cash i the illusion of the circhtevie special opens with helicopter footing to the statue illusion happens at night it is all live up we fly up by the crown the torch and then cut to the man himself avid copper looking a teen hart cop big dark eyes some sort of silvery rockstar jacket and this of course did not register with me as a little school kit what he is young to be taking on something ambitions twenty six years old he gives this little side er i cops iioai a at ready or to weeks ago and i was on to a young sights here about seven years old a look a a a sad he son cars an he said he solid case i than i watched i e look e toad back to the stay actually he o wily my say a you tiki what i ut it i was thinking or i somehow doubt it happened exactly that but whatever i tit finally it is time i can it is man won e sold no ataeillusion you all watching at hole is exactly the ways tilling a macopperfield has an audience sitting right there on liberty island at the foot of the statueevery one is sitting on the stage s out doors looking up at the huge statue of liberty which is about two hundred feet awaythere are spotlights on it and a helicopter circling overhead our view is the same as the audience were just behind them looking up at the statue the on either side of the stage are two big scaffolding towers kind of framing the shot you have a view it the statue between what happens next is one continuous camershot no visible attic a gift curtain is hoisted up suspended between those two scaffolding tower he cannot see the statue now but it has to be there right behind the curtain then copperfield puts his left hand to his temple closes his eyes this is a signature copperfield move familiar to methane now it is as if he is doing it with his mind a few seconds passed the curtain drawn and pricing gone tat the is gespotlike the helicopter o sir but now circling nothing just empty space the came cuts to reactions from the audience everyone seems astonished there is one guy wearing a priest's cops i was amaze yo e her fatherly do nobody i dead were wore a no i lode for you and then an older woman a see tan a a copperfield i think i an attempt to land some larger meaning makes a speech about emigration how he should take our liberty for granted then he makes the statue reappear even job weiseburg the non magic fan when he finally watched it as in a dull he was moved fore hole an me as gid magicians we tried to figure at how he did it did you've my theories i had i did not have a good theory and as somebody who knew a lot of magic mimics always pretty do not found it did did your friend say tell me how he did i ism sure they did and i think i would have i would to believe that i told him i did not know ism not proud of this but when kids asked me how copperfield did it have a pretty clear memory of saying something sorry i cannot tell you which was true i could not sometimes it is not fund to learn how a trick is done it is all double lifts and hidden compartments and when you learn the secret it can be kind of let down but there are those times when the secret to the trick is cooler than the trick it sell the sheer ingenuity and genius of it and i am going to talk now but how this trick might have been done we thought a lot about whether to put this on the radio but the truth is you are all a simple googly search away from what i am about to tell you that is one of the weird things about magic to day over thirty years later the inner net exists it is a whole world of explanations and pretty good instructional videos for a spring magicians but if you would rather not go down this road with me you can skip ahead or stop listening for about ten minutes i totally respect that i should also say we did reach out to avid copper few and we made a pitch which was basically this may be your greatest hit it is been thirty four years now every one is going to be fooled by this trick is and been fool you will never perform it again nobody's going to perform it again we are not hurting the livelihood of any magician by revealing the secret why not come on the show and talk about what it was to be on the other side copperfield was completely gracious but he said it was not his job to talk about how the tricks are done and he said something else he said to protect the secrets of his tricks he is hired people to put fake explanations on mine to throw the curious off the track which of course makes the whole thing even more interesting here is the explanation that is on the inner net and also in one book written by a non magician instead of moving the statue copperfield moved the audience the entire audience rotated them actually there were sitting unknowingly on a giant rotating platform think a huge lazy sudan here is how it would a worked the curtain gets hoisted up between the two towers blocking the statue from view and while it is up the platform with the entire audience on it and the giant scaffolding towers and the curtain the whole thing rotates until it is facing away from the statue that when the curtain falls the audience is looking out at nothing or i think to be precise they're looking out at part of the new jersey cost line it is such a beautiful secret smart and simple big there is another part of the secret which is even crueler when i first hard there might have been a rotating platform and wondered what was to stop the audience members from just turning their heads and seem the statue after all it should have bee just off to one side the answer it is hidden in what in retrospect is the only possible place behind one of the scaffolding towers used to hold the curtain up he scaffolding tower's tiny come pared to the statue but it is close enough to the audience that with the platform rotated to just the right position the tower blocks the statue from view watching the levy special again knowing this made it even more impressive i kept thinking how exciting and nerve racking it must have been to be copperfield in that moment to pull this off the rotation would have had to been fast enough that it did not seem to take too long but not fast that some one would notice and super smooth here is roll fields former ked magician first all how could the people there not have noticed suck high stakes r it is ballsy but these people on the thing and hope that really no ones can notice it is wildly got strick what could it t not work what could have gone wrong ah one or more people could have said axis platform's rotated some one could hae a compass the more i thought about this the more questions i had was this really how it was done could you get away with something that maybe this was a fake explanation planted by avid copperfiel a scaffolding tower to hide some deeper secret i figure the best thing would be to tract down some of the audience members who were there at the foot of the statue of liberty but remember it this happened in nineteen eighty three and it any case none of the audience members er name i did not see any easy way to tract of down but as i was watching in rematching the tidy of the trick i found one shot where some one's name was reveal some one i could tried at contact it comes in the lead up where copperfield is in the office of the park service official for the statue of liberty it is just a quick cutaway where he is explaining that he had to get permission to make the statue disappear but if you freeze frame on that part you can just make out on the man's desk a name plate avid l mafia i had no idea if the sky was still live this was after all thirty for years ago but i started searching for a avid l mafia and i found one in virgin but with a previous residence of liberty island i i got on a plain to fly down through red a at a at wit my rat a care for ten years if you wanted to do anything with the statue of liberty you had to go through avid l mafia he lived on the little island with the family the park service has a house there try the statue was right outside his window he felt it was his job to protect or is almost member of the family when a deodorant maker tried to use her in and add maybe because she has her arm up avid maffick fought back when a furniture company wanted to hang a couch from her and have some one sit in the couch he tod it and when avid copperfield requested permission to make her disappear he said no i personally felt that was a anaprolpriet use of such a sacred i gone and i wrote that ta rejection to the request and i thought that probably was the end of it but the copper weeks later mafia gets a letter in the mail from the director of the national park service giving copperfield permission copperfield had gone over his head he had connections i the white house copperfield's teem did confirm this they said he got permission directly from road taken put it madly i was a little bit taken back a few days later a walked and office and there avid copperfield he standing up there very grandson mix looking i well dressed copperfield apologized for getting him over rule moat says copperfield seems sincere a nice got ma sin to permit and tan he says i would for you to sin waiver that she will not disclosed how i make to statue justappear as is no i will not do that that a i would never do anything that would remind my freedom of speech hard to argue with that water at the foot of the statue of liberty mafia was there during the film and he saw how the trick was don't he says he kept his mouth shut for the last three decades only told family in a few friends but he confirm for me the explanation on the internet that is the real explanation he even demonstrated for me we got the lacy us an did i use for pottery that than could you get that or it'll get it he had a miniature statue of liberty of course it dare chance turning he an it goes maybe twenty fave or thirty degrees to the right during the filming mafia was standing just off to the side of the platform i found another guy who was there and who confirmed the basic mechanics of how the trick was done but talking to him made me wonder if there might be a whole other level of the steptune to the trick his name is a ferula his name was in the credits for the show he flew a helicopter in the eat non more and now for than movies many the avengers spider man must is take manual the one i wane to ask you about was in the nineteen eighties t would be probably cirkqueny to one of as we we it was in nineteen eighty three at night work it involve the statue of liberty a working girl no when avid copperfield made the statue o tavern copper you yer yet i was a are great deal act he told me the helicopter's job was to fly from position a to position b while the curtain was blocking the view fiscally from above the statue to above a designated empty spot which was rigged with duplicate spot lights if you think about it the helicopter and the lights are the fixed points in the trick the things that make the audience think there looking at the same spot i did think he was ere to beagle o how con w whether you worried about happening bee to you we a page more whatever they trek a wot wat yo ran cat a barring and take n i on e bottom that pul oi hey got away to couple of time ye could for o work right and could not get it to work at when he wanted which put this in pleasant thought in my head was the audience really fool by this we were they may be in on the whole time ah yet betray yet ago yes i shower the people on the radiance for stage the new work dinner happen oh not everybody not pain our do no i do not know bout that party u know we deer i did to that i never action he never mason i asked avid elmafat the park service sky was the audience in on it he answered with a story this happened just after the finished shooting thereby a slapping eery on the on the back in every a hacpyat all and i stay some to one of the called audience a haw did you and up here and she i was paid for this and i was paid to come here ye and that was count of the end of the conversation i was i did not that is not i was not investigating i was just curious worthy people came from a specially when the actual amaze at it was disathat it had disappeared because they felt the stage moon they they could not help but feel the stage moving do you think they were all actors i do not not they were actors i i wanted the at i do not know i know that one of them was paid to be there soffit went back over this in his memory because he wanted to be accurate he later told us he thinks it was one of his employes who talked o the woman to be fair its been over thirty years but this thought that the audience might have been in on id it made me incredibly sad it felt cheating if all those people going wow they were paid to go well they were not fooled that is not magic that is we are watching a play about magic i told the america producers job and told about this job the former cad magician did not see it the way i did at all it means he bought off the whole audience no no no it does not it might mean that it does not e let us say he no the audience was of the talivisian audience is the audience he promised to make the statue of liberty disappear with no hammer tricks he made the statue liberty dive with no camertrics it is free to magic and it was moving i think it is little troubling if true if true i honestly did not know wan to believe i watch the teeny special again and a an and some of the audience members started to look actors at least in moments like just after the curtain drops an the statue was gone the s one guy leans over to the woman next to him on points and this kind of holy ray then there is the fact that one of the audience members is in a priest color really he append to get a priest in the audience and to priest dressed that way when they go out at night finally i got it to i was at this magic show talking to these two people one of them it'll call a former high ranking official in the magic establishment they knew some one who had been there on liberty island during the filming of the show and would know the truth i called the person up and he agreed to talk my name as etalon ism known as the misfit of magic and may be remember me as man the owner of the dine room say by the bell end was also the guy who made that curtain go up and down in front of the statue of liberty actually there were two guys was a big curt end was eighteen years old the time ha young magician say he stayed overnight at avid copperfield's parents house in new jersey before the suede i told him had heard the audience might have been in on it i told him what the park serving had told me that an audience member had said she had been paid to be there really ism totally surprised hit is possible that may be some of the people were paid to be there only because they could not get enough regular people with the amount of tickets that they gave out sometimes you do use paid extras in an audience he says they show up one time and he can tell him the dress nicely but even if they were paid people they would have not of known how the trick was done it was no reason for for any one to know had a time copperfield's team by the way says no audience members were paid they said the woman who claim she was paid to be there must have been on the production staff and end says an enormous amount of work was done to make sure the trick would fool people end did not want to talk about or confirm the mechanics of the trick but he said they did a whole dry run beforehand out in lost angels the idea to make the statue of liberty disappear came from an illusion designer named him stein beer copperfield's team with the help of a guy name don wane tat all kinds of improvements and built the stage as a test they used it to make the moon disappear they said the stage a basically in his parking lot the you we were in a parkin because the the stage was enormous avid thought that we have to do kind of a demonstration to work out the bugs before we hall this thing to new york a butch of top magicians in all sat on the stage copperfield made the moon disappear and everyone gave notes weeks to make it better s the could fool a real audience end says the night of the filming at the statue of liberty it was clear to him that the people in the audience were a fool i asked him why in a couple shots the audience seemed a little fake to me he had a pretty good explanation which is that they filmed the trick multiple times copperfield's team officially denies this end says it though i think that may be after we didst about the third or fourth time some of the people that were sitting on this platform may have had an idea as to what was going i grilled end for an hour awol and for what it is worth i believe in when he says the audience was not inborn hough i do have this tiny sliver of dow which i have to say i kind of enjoy the fallout avid copperfield told us he was disappointed that we wanted do our story on a trick that's over thirty years old he said he had better stuff now stuffy just invented that hes totally layabout you need to see it he said ire and i went to a show in lost vagus copperfield this sixty years old now and doing two or three shows a day that is just how he rolls the other year he did over six hundred performances the show was not all to my taste but it was amazing the work of an obsessive person driven to keep creating new things at one point the lights went out just for a brief moment and when they came back on an enormous flying saucer had appeared right over our heads i mean huge it took up a good part of the theater and it moves the illinium falcon or something hovering and banking the we you imagine flying saucers moving when you were kid it is this moment of just sheer surprise and delight and joy i do not care how he did her teston down in bel bertha is produced to day by

how speaker even my earthy announce is an impeachment inquiry into jobidon storehouse re publicans at threaten my party's speakership and we review the video music awards i benthpure of this is benchvarro so to day shows ponder baxpressbe plan thousands f my listers of already secured their near they tod join them express pinta cam freshmen well it is now official yesterday the house speaker can mac carte announce that there would in fact being impeachment inquiry into join surrounding all his activities with his son hunter as well as presumably the cover up that is been attempted by the do ja of any investigation into a hunter's activities including jo and here is a thing we already know a lot about this particular topic in fact there is a ton of evidence that is already out in public view thanks to the called lap top from hell you know the one that was supposed o be russia dis in formation that was dismissed by the entire media in the month leading up to the last election cycle and here many of the things we know we know that hunter bison has seen the last decade jet setting around to random countries as a druidic drug attic prostitute abuser and he is been picking up backs of cash on foreign boards well calling his cabin on the phone to prove his connection to his daddy we know that tens of millions of dollars have flooded into hunter bison connected business is or directly to hunter bison we know that hunter bison tested his own daughter suggesting that he paid his dads bills we know all of these things none of that is in disputes when people say there is no evidence everything i just said there is hons of evidence for all of that literally the only thing missing would be the con quote smoking gone namely some sort of transaction between one of hunter bison's business is banjo bison's direct bank account but it does not require that to prove bribery or corruption and by the way jobidon is not being criminally charged bribery or eruption here is the thing the democrats broke the mole and when they decide they are going to impeach dona trump without actually alleging a crime not once but twice when they said we are not going to attempt to push even a proctorial motion of what crime was committed know statute was actually sited in either of the impeachment papers the were filed instead they're general accusations of corruption general accusations of pressure and they can do that because that is when preachment is to political process but once you say the you do not actually have to a ledge o crime in order to push i preachment and then you do it twice why would you think it is nocking to come around and clock again you broke the glass the glass is still broken and here is the reality f re publicans did not do the same thing in reverse well then democrats who just continue to do this willing silly these they are two possibilities here in terms of going back to status to any or people dingranimally just impeach the president of the opposing party there they're to possbillis one everybody goes weapons down unless there is an actual full sale crime committed that could theoretically be prosecuted but could not be because the president of the united states is immune to federal prosecution while he is the president of the united states right that thou's be the the betterstatus glance's tat we do not prosecute every president or ex president unless they actually commit a federal crime t and in is to be completely even handed and how we actually pursue justice that be the better version and then there is the second version which is we just willy silly impeach petty much everybody and from here until the end of time we impeach everybody an not i suppose we can live with that to i suppose we can do that in cleats the best thing for the country person but sure i suppose we c and that is where we now are yesterday can my earthy announce that house somites would open a formal impeachment inquiry into impression o widen rapping up top pe efforts to on earth any evidence of wrong doing ahead of the twenty twenty four election here was speaker my earthy announcing this yesterday these are allegations of abuse power obstruction instruction they ware further investigation by the house of representatives that lot day i am directing our house committee to open a formal and coachman inquiry into president join the logical new step will give our committee is the full power to gather all the facts an answers for the medical public what sort of powers attached to an impeachment inquiry for she non i peachentincgry the answer is not all that much all these committed already had sepia power now presumably they will just have a better excuse to use that sepia power theoretically if you are spinal and your member of the executive branch you can say ism not on show by not con testify because this is not within the normal purview of a congressional in investigation typically congressional in investigations have one of two purposes one is oversight of an of a function that the executive is supposed to be performing i pass a piece of legislation at piece of legislation says the executive branch is supposed to disperse moneys in a particular way and now ism sepia in the executive branch told make sure that you did the thing that we legislated that you are supposed to do that is possibility number one possibly number too when a comes to congress and and legitimate purpose of a hoping would be legislative purpose is we are doing an in investigation into this problems we can then craft legislation in order to pursue in end to this particular problem in impeachment inquiry provide to defense to he possibility are doing neither of these two reggyur you are not artily crafting piece o legislation on the one hand and your also not doing an oversight function of a of an executive job that delegated by the legislature you doing something else another constitutionally performed duty which is in impeachment inquiry and if somebody says on one trump for thisoppenot theoretically go to courting you say well you have to and andyou have to more than u normally would because even though it is not legislation an is not quite oversight it is not impeachment inquiry in that is a natural function of of the house now what is this really what it really is just the republican saying that we are kicking this impeachment stuff in to high gear now that there are few problems with this particular strategy from my earthy problem number one is that my earthy is doing this without a vote nansuppolose you did do this and nansiplocy did not take a vote of the house before she actually pursued impeachment of president true and that alow the trump de okay to claim that the impeachment inquiry actually did not have the authority to proceed properly now you assume that the by administrations can o do the same thing they in say you new take a vote in the house to open in impeachment inquiries why should we respect the notion the season is legally impeachment inquiry were not con t even acknowledge is an impeachment inquiry ye you cannot justartan m peaches inquiry was drums case actually when it was democrats in charge of congress trumps case was this is not michael scout shouting bankruptcy just walk into a building shout have open an impeachment inquiry this does not attach any new powers to you was the case that trumpsteojay made that can now be used that away case can be used by the biding delta against key my earthy and and the house re publicans that is the point politico is making to day in canary twenty twenty the donate trumplood justice department formally declared that i preachment inquiries by the house are in valid unless the camber takes formal votes to authorize them that opinion was issued by the justice departments oh ell see the office of legal council and it came in response to speaker nancy ploy doing just that seven angel was then the head of the do jays office of legal council on said we conclude the house must expressly authorize committee to conduct in impeachment investigation and use compulsory process in that investigation before the committee they compel the production of documents or testimony to presumably the by administrations going to do the same thing now my earthy was asked why he flipped on the because my earthy had suggested not all that long ago that eleven days ago than if yous can to move on an impeachment inquiry than who is coin to do with the house vote then he did not do wit the house vote just declared have open an impeachment inquiry and do and yuks asked about this an hes o will what is good for the goosicgor for the gander nancy ploy did that and now we can we can do the same thing which again is true but it does under score a bit of weakness in this impeachment inquiry this will get to in just one second first let us talk about the weakness of the america aim mar now got new economic numbers coming in will talk about in a little while i got tell you they are not good it it people are having a hard time figuring out we to put their money i am and thin prey much everybody as you put it in reals that will sike the reals they market is cruising for a bruises you put it in the stock market looks the stock market is overvalued when you lookatly price to earnings ratios where t you put the money one thing could do it is take at least some of your money and put in precious metals as a hedge hay that that is just a smart thing the people do they diversify their ass at base thin vectors and savors are looking to harness the power of physical gold held an attar sheltered era i gold from birch gold i trust them to help me diversify my savings you can protect or array or for one cad bi diversifying with gold from birch gold as the stroller continues to receive pressure from foreign countries ti rural currencies central banks it is good to arm yourself wit the

thousands of have customers countless five tour views i trustberch got to help you diverse find gull ask all your questions and then when he feel secure then start diversifying we me list have some gold to depend on in tough times again text ben to ninety eight ninety eight ninety eight to get start o a the the failure to watch the i preachment inquiry with vote there there is something happening that one things that is happening there is that my earthy may not actually have in majority in the house to open the impeachment inquiry in other words he does not actually have all of his re publicans on board remember he and in drably slim majority in the house of representatives right now and all it would require is just a few of these people to drop off and and you do not have a majority at all in support of something like in impeachment inquiry again wright now the constituency is two under twenty to republicans in to hundred twelve democrats and you require two hundred and seventeen two hundred eighteen for the majority all he has to do is lose five republicans and he does not have a majority in support of an impeached inquiry instead he is doing it without the vote he the problem is an if you do not have support to open i impeachment inquiry hiring achy vote for m preachment is he writing a check that he then cannot cash because an impeachment inquiry that ends with not impeachment looks an exoneration if the opposing party opens an impeachment inquiry and then says hell you now what forget it it turns out which it have the goods thole's terrible for re publicans my earthy is opening in investigation and it is unclear in which direction this is going to go which raises the question as to we exactly he is doing that one piece of speculation there there is for the principal reason there is the non principal reason both are possibilities the principles reason to open in impeachment inquiries because there is actually as i say runs of evidence that jo bison an under bid ere involved in corrupt bargaining together that that evidence is widespread it exists it is out there she do not even need all that many additional facts and i wonder what they think they are going to discover here that can a change the mat the only thing i can think that an impeachment inquiry might discover that we do not already is just the level to which the do ja was pressuring people avid wises took a sweetheart to go it hunter bison to kill any investigation in to under dons relationship with his dad financially at that is the part that is the other shoe to drop that presumably is why eve my earthy is talking about notjust corruption or abusive power but also obstruction of justice at the idea that the do was caponized on behalf of the began family in order protect job from his corrupt relationship of hunter and that we might find out the impeachment the principled reason to open the impeachment inquiry is cause you think your actually going to get more in formation via the impeachment inquiry than you would otherwise and then there is the sort of in principal reason and that is my earthy is under sever fire right now from the radiates wing of the party and again that wing is really small just by by actual members it is a vast majority of the re publican parity mandates is putting a tremendous amount or pressure on kep my earthy with regard to spending and hes threatening his speakership right now and one way if your coven my earthy to avoid that is fort pressure is to go back to the basin ay listen i do not you want for me ism giving o whatnot want and given you theimpeacment inquiry ism going after jobidon ism ism one is pride concessions out of jobidon who is your alternative maybe in response to the pressure he opens the impeachment inquiry and thus avoid to speakership fight that is the that is the more cynical reason tat youwould open in impeachment inquiry without of a turns mandates yesterday trying to presshmc earthy i rise to day to serve notice mister speaker you are out of compliance with the agreement that allowed you to assume this roll the path forward for the house of representatives is to either bring you into immediate to talk compliance or remove you pursuant to emotion to vacate the chair mister speaker you boasted in canary that we would use the power of the china and the power of the purse but here we are eight months later and we have not even sent the first opine to hunter bine that is how that the rush and you are somewhat rattle performance you just saw from the speaker is it real at this point during democrat control over the house of representatives they are he brought in don junior three times and we have not even set the first depend to hunter bod nay to again the cynical reason here is the my earthy his basically saying that oka and now ism doing it am bringing in everybody were can do the coping power canto all those sorts of things here is the reality when the sort of quixotic guess to get rid of speaker mac earthy i said this at the time i do not understand what concession a trying to pry from him if you can name me the concessions that you think are going to make governance in the house better and more conserve we them all for it chip robbed and we had chipryoun the program at the time when they were having the speaker fighter new said what you want from mac carting you listen a bunch of things i didn't mac earthy gives you those things will ye support him news i guess if the is a position the make senseyou must not a position the make sense i do not speak o my earthman he should go and i have an alternatives ism just going to yell about things got that is not a strategy and it is not a plan what exactly is it that you are seeking to achieve at this point it's my earthy is now opened the impeachment inquiry severe having crater of north to coda call the in squiring to appropriate step for the republicans send it minority liar mix macconnal said m earthy did not need his advice on how to run the house which is a god way from mac cornball to avoid that fight it's a matter a mac call has to say anyway since he is not the majority leader he has no power to actually preside over any sort of senate process for full scale removal from office even if bid were to be impeached over the sorts of charges represent om kenbuck of colorado head argued an inquiry be in necessary because of existing committeeinvestigations he said the my earthy made a good decision to not hold the vote he said it would have distracted from the work were trying to get done which would have been the a tempt to fund the government to again the powers that have been extended to the house are relatively miner here all it really does is in very public terms it says we know that you are corrupt and we are going to come after you with whatever powers we have at our disposal and that is not a bad thing i thing that is very worth while thing for as i said two purposes one is mutually sure destruction if you get t keep impeaching republican presidents over and over and over just because you do not them when then we are going to do the same thing to your guise and we will we ow you it mutually sure destruction is one way of getting a ridyback down and the second is at do not bid actually is deeply corrupt and has been deeply corrupt for decades on end when just one side will gets the democratic response to the to the impeachment inquiry first let us talk abut on charge isn't holistic wellness brand with a huge range of evident base

preside over all of this apparently my earthy says that hes can to have names comer of century take the lead on the impeachment in where he is in a work alongside jordan of oho and mason smith of bistoury again it its it did not require majority vote to do this the fact that e did not have a majority vote makes this is somewhat risky move because the question is going to be where the get enough republicans to vote in the ends tom peach join on whatever they uncover none the less democrats our fighting mad about it as you would imagine chucksumer the senate majority leader i he is now using language that we remember from om from the trump days member when when trump would say that it is that is a which hunt which hunts remember that in pretty much everyqweat and ism it kind of was hell now chucksumeris adopting that language i think the impeachment inquiry is absurd the america people want us to do something that will make their lives better not go off on these shares and which hunts oh in what that i notice the you dedicated tens of millions of dollars to chasten which hunts when it was presented trump again turn about is fair play when at comes to poetic senator did urban i thought had sort of the quote of the day here he said sure i mean his behaviors were and kana corrobut there is nothing here i me come on i not thing be broke the waw or the thirsty been pub e bola oo to e about the situation wo works o the son doters cap is an on public o the chapmen o er cares ts so losers portions o on fast forward on this if this house inquiry turns into a forlorn in watchman and i have to say it is hard to imagine a dozen tana an i can a doing i peaches inquiry in then clear present bid it i mean is the bottom line looking forward that this no way in preachment supporters are going to get two thirds of the send bid will be quit this is just he diversion on the part of cart he cannot cove he cannot can is majority in hehouserers that as to do the basics to keep governments light to and is to sure for a diversion lets talk about something else tho the might agree an i peaches what a waste of time an money i love the did turbans gat he might be supercorrupt and it is it is really ugly but to waste of time and money first of all when have democrats in legislature ever cared about wasting time and money very carnally who is involved in the impeachment of present from bible both times congressman from virgin he he he also says is is a distraction it is is distraction for our vital work o a wasting your money why now we are in the this strict eyes right yow lo this ones parleys id i too ever get to peach to at commonplace i think is a to distract us for fact that i don cook is tone tin for tot tope times there sing one counts pending against him he is akin onus legal carol i and they do want us to cop us o that letstraten to connate and our ow that is to have line to payment i mean that works in reverse as well as a possible you get a filed four different indictments against present in trump in themidle of an elections reason because you wish the headline to be that as opposed to join being crap at his job and also corrupt john fetterman has emerged frommum from frankinstine's laboratory i to to he is a different look john fetterman he used to be that he was sort of a tracks suited never do well and now he apparently has graduated into a into a low level muscle and former for the suppronos here is john fetterman's response while walking through the hallways of the congressional basement on his way to a to bounds outside bar i w were he explains a how how upset he is about this impeachment ha formally much a think lie only o li us o its levis to to the ton to oo o similarly his reaction to learning that scout do had been moved in his timeslot on cartoon network n the john fedderman your senator from pennsylvania well done america sere doing in amazing amazing job is there going to evidence to impeachyour by began the answer is there is already evidence to impeach your widen if you want to all get to that momentarily first every knows i love my helices mattress right again i got home really

evidence at all re publicans open i peaches inquiry now as i say the evidence is superload am there is a lot of evidence the jobidon not only new but was involved in hunterbidon's business ranging from the tabs from hunter biding to chines magnates talking about ten per cent for the big guy to acts directly to people he was working with talking bout how his father was sitting directly next to him in would make life for them incredibly uncomfortable this appoint made by a representing scout parry of pennsyllane enthusiast about what do as you have evidence to do theses of yes at i evident the have of the pe the atigatito sent eat a o coining that we merit an a when e en in quirky all to it an inpruveint to day just teach for the void know ma company to the sat of an acting penis sic revenge this is not about the notable revenge we have the bank accounts we can see man you can see that the homes that the bines own cannot be afforded on a and a congressional or seats salary you also understand that it is not normal for family members to receive millions of dollars from oversees interest those things are normal that is not normal have twenty self she country companies these things are not normal and it alludes to not only just widespread corruption but money wandering if not influence peddling itself and we also have the president ought of the vice president at the time on record sing that the prosecutor was for well son of a the prosecutor was fired right because the prosecutor with going after the the company that his son was working out that is what we have if you cannot see that if you are of you are a that blond he happens to be crying where marry tall agreeing correctly points out that it is not just that it is also the possibility the jobidons do jay was shutting down investigation we would do already have wistablowers who said as much ism very excited to see a happen i think a mark cans to serve truth that this our chance fancy and we nan the investigation regalia long as that nan sin to an cover all the corruption that its then involved an covering at chabidans crams et again not wrong on any of this now democrats are already trying to spend this into will what about jerk and gonna and all all the rest of that sort of thing his first will jeurnovonca were actual employes of the federal government hunter was never in employ you the federal government while join was vice president hunter was just going around as a bag man for his family for milt to milt the ton millions dollars and calling his daddy in to meetings in order to demonstrate that he had fleets with the federal government that is not the same thing as you are a federal employee whose worked on things that abrahamicords which by the way the most successful middy's pease initiative of the last two generations which is what jerked and avouch we are doing during that time and then after you leave office then you rend up doing a business deal that is publicly disclosed in all its details publicly disclose howdy we know about jerks investments with the sorties in viceverssa because it is all publicly disclosed as most a hunter bison who hid this crap fore years and there some pretty significant differences right here obviously but what we are going to conflate all the things at the same time of course in the end how much is the impeachment stuff going to damage join it it is only i a damage jobidonif i just means there is additional attention brought to his corruption see could a done that theoretical without in peaches milkman be a beach i dontknow and you can have to get four five republicans in purple districts on board in order to do that but one thing is being under scortfor democrats and that is jobidon continues to be an extraordinarily weak candidate the economy is not doing well under job it is just that simple according to axis a measure of poverty track by the cents his bureau rode in twenty twenty two as covet year benefits expired n average in come fell according to a twosair port chow poverty a a sharp increase in twenty twenty two following a record loathe year prior now the reason saw record low is because jobidon spent a be filial dollars just pouring money on the raging flame of inflation and turning it into a huge gas firer that is engulf the entire america economy and then that was not renewed and the is it will your increasing child poverty becauswere not signing giant checks to people well ya i turns out that when you sign enormous amount o money over to people that temporarily relieves their poverty but does not permanently relieve their poverty the only way to truly reduce child poverty in the long term in the united states is have a growing a economy were mom and dad our marriedand have jobs that is that is the way the are sod reduce child poverty long turn not by simply signing checks join in courses blaming his political opposition but the reality is that the democrats use bovid as an excuse to blow money out the waw to for three street years and that was not maintainable as we can see from the inflation rate as we can see from the stagnating economy median household income at fell by two point three per cent from twenty twenty one to twenty twenty two adjusting a four inflation incomes decreased in white and not his panic white household that remain similar in black alien and his tannic households and inflation rose seven point eight per cents in twenty twenty two on annualized basis by the way we've new inflation stats out to day and it turns out that the weepie that contumprycennec climbed three point seven per cent in the year through august that was faster than the three per cent three going two per central rating and even faster then the three point six per cent that economic had expected of cops there blaming this on high gas prices which means that hoiden as going to try to cut some sort of sweet hart the old sorties in order to get them to pump gain gan as to artificially boost his reelect chances but these are bad numbers can remember wear's post be seeking two per cent the diversion two per cent in three point seven percent we are almost double the expected in elation rate in this country right now and even a lot of democrats are starting to look cross died to jobidon say i do not know why we are running this one why now the real reason the running this one is because there trying prevent in internal fire fight over comely garrison side the democratic party this the problem whenyou pick in a formative action candidate four v p as a pose d the best qualified candor the jobidon couldn't chosen any one for b p come hairs did not bring out the blackout show ad not bring out any one comely arris is one most alienating politicians of our lifetime if job ad want to pick a qualified v p get a bunch of people to choose from mean even on that stage with him when hots running in twenty twenty there bunch of people he easily could have chosen as his v p candidate most obviously some to lice main clobichar from not he did he decided not to do that instead he went with comely arris who is off putting and widely despised and there trying prevent of fire fight from breaking out inside the democratic party over comely as they got leave the old man in place but democrats are staring to take of his pullmumber sock wo dividignacios democrat writing for the washington posed has an entire piece iodate that president biding should not run again in twenty twenty four he says what i admire most about preside a witness that in a pulverized nation he has governed from the center out which of course is a joke he is governed from the left the hard left but i do not think the began in votes president arris should run for reelection i love that es sneaking in the vice president arris ray there this as president arris comely arris she is not eighty comely arris is in the prime if her political life an there all ready can we dumper off the side of this ship debris right now all push the old man and if she goes that would also b great i do not think began and vices preside in arris would run for reelection says dividing nails it is painful to say that give my admiration for much of what they have accomplished but if he and arris campaign together in twenty twenty four i think bison risks undoing his greatest achievement which was stopping true bide would carry two big live abilities since whet twenty twenty four campaign he be eighty two en he began a second term that is liability number one and libeling umber to his arris just a thirty time point five per sent approval rating according to five a thirty eight arris says dividing nails has many laudable qualities but the simple fact his has failed to gain traction in the country or even within her own party bison could en courage a more open v p selection process that could produce a stronger running mate and the i low this he says we should start with the mayor of lot angels carman bass look out look out that the interjectional democratic party they cannot arid of coma hairs cause they do not have a black woman backer up his first move is what about carbon bass who barely b rick crush who is a republican in all or comer secretary gene ray condo at that there would be a charmer gene ray condo the comer secretary that woithot'd be amazing gaga but there there's the desperation is starting to set in among the democrats which of course is why the democratic party rigged the primaries in the first place as a if a junior is now pointing out in the waster journal he says his become clear the d n c does not wanted rail primary and is willing to risen franchises democratic voters from choosing their nominate the d n we has refuse to host debates though vast ma majority of democratic voters want and expect them they can judge which candidate has the popular appeal and vigor challenge the republican nominal the dance has revoked new vampires century old status's first primary state in there place with south caroling gave widen one south caroling but lost both new samphire and ion the dance as rafted rules that if candidates run and sanction primary new samphire the dance chairman has the power to punish them regardless of the marching of victory such a candidate would receive zero delegates further the georgia democratic party has a rule allowing it to ban from the ballet any candidate who does not follow dance rules say kgunor's pointing out a verity ring this thing bison stepped in and he rigged this thing democrats are stuck with jobiton which is the reason presumably why the impeachment inquiry is really bad for gabion again if you are talking about your bine that is goodthng for republicans and if fou hung bout dona trump that is soothing for democrats that is the simple simple man an just one second we can get to jo bisons foibles over sees because we are seem new in formation about the six billion dollar gimme that bison just signed over to the aronians which is the prelude to a braider iron deal that presumably we will give them much much much more access to

make nice with the aronians the m the democrats have decided in the white house that it be good to ham the eonian apparently on the anniversary of nine eleven six billion dollars in salmon sort of hostage exchange but the reality is that the the thing this happening right here is in open invite to the aronians to make some sort of deal that looks the on nuclear deal that iron newcleardeal fellowpart because the onions were breaking the neuclerdial and dona tramples i not interested in doing this this nonsensence he pulled out of it jobidon has been later focused on trying to put that back together even including in the negotiations people sober valley who is originally in mama envoy robot valley entered up being basically band from the state department he was leading the diplomatic afford on around nuclear program and then congress learned that the statespartmn had suspended his security clearance because of an investigation into possible is handling of classfight

the six million dollars coat wherever we at it well that is not true a the system is set up such that a this money a these fun a can only be parcelled out for demanditarian purposes food medicine a till the construction of a medical facilities or even educational purposes a but that e could every through withdraw is on to go through a series of checks and balances checks by the treasury department checks by the murder national back oh the the canary nationality yes very trustworthy the that is cone be and and then once detectually in the baronial pocket they are nock it it is here diclinous but this administration is ridiculous what one of one of the key ways that that the left his wrong foot it is when they u start lying about what it is they are doing you point out there doing it this no were not doing that then your know you you actually are yes of course we are but it is not bad that we are doing it which of course also applies to what they have been attempting to do in america public schools the entire fight that is now happening across the country over removing wildly inappropriate material from school libraries books gender queer with are basically distpronography removing these from school libraries democrats men saying this form of censorship well this turn into a very weird hearing yesterday when senator john kenned of louisiana he was listen wont reduction's room ism to read into the congressional record one of these books that you suggest must be in a school library unless e if you get uncomfortable is if you are in comfortable then maybe it should not be in a school library ware seventh graters can read it the first one is called all boys arbor and i will quote from i put sloop on and got him on dismays and i began to sad in to him from behind i pulled out of him and kiss him willy mastered he ash me to turn over while he slip the condemn on himself this was my all and i was struggling to imagine som one timid me the entire me does like what a weirdo why would john kenned read that outlet when if your if you think it is weird then adults is reading that why do you want a sixth or seventh grater to read that i notice that it is you ware promoting this material and when john kenned says the thing out loud then you get all up tight wee some sort of prude e hell is long withthese people honesty got they live my favor part of this was dicturban enter from illinois suggesting that nobody's advocating for sexual material to be available to elementary school kids right i mean technically you wanted to be available in fifth grade not forth grade middle school is what your saying no one is everocating for sutuexcluso to to to be available then entry school library or children section library that is ta distraction from the real challenge i what it is a distraction from the real challenge u than have question why shouldthat even be available in a celebrate for high schooners why should tax pars be running the sortograp if a local school district sides then's want that there what business is it of did urban to decide that that it must be there what's what is the reason why that must be is that a piece of great literature that is required for you pasture english come class i i think i think not get they have to deny their doing the thing they are doing no where not doing it but it is good that we are esteem seems to be the argument at at all times from this true at can meanwhile on the republican side of the lie some movement in the poles in ion now the the front runner in the republican party remains by leaps and bounds donate trump but he has been a significant drop in the swat republican caucus according to emersion college just a few months ago he was it well over sixty per cent in that pole i in that emersion college molly's none to forty nine per cent which the drop of thirteen per cent meanwhile governor rondosantis and my penis is numbers also drop from made de wants his numbers were at twenty per cent in may there non fourteen pence decree from five per cent to three per cent you've seen some gains for timscott and nickel hale and the take roman mammy all of them still running well behind donate trump obviously rondosantis who remains the national the national second place can have runner up right now by all available pull metric he appeared with north ofdonald last night and hours talking bout the age presidential candidates obviously this does not justify joint obviously also applies to donate trump age has become an issue in this presidential contest should voter is worry about the ages of present on on formal president dona trophic i absolutely legitimate concern the presents he is not a job per some one that is eighty years old than there is nothing and a wrong with being the office the om the governor florid i know a lot of people who were elderly their get people but you are talking about a job were you need to give it a under per cent you see we need not energetic president and i think that if the founders could could kind of look at this again i do think they probably would a put in age limit ah on some of these offices get that that all made very well be true here is the reality inside the republican party there is only one way that some one is going to beat donate trump i cant thermal to have to make the following case donate trump lost in twenty twenty and i will not that is the only case that you can make that is the only case the come be made is on he about age is in him gat temperament because republicans very much want of dona drums combat of temperament and some the wild stuff on true social the do not mind it that the and of enjoy it the think it is fun it is not him done on the bases of record because most republicans think the dona trumps reckon the first three years of his present as he was good even if he did not really know what he was doing with the bureaucracy in fact that silly chalk up to his benefit side the fact that he did not know what was going on toe burgh ready because then they say that bureaucracy tried to thwart him and look at all the things that he got done in the face of that puracrasy he will definitely to a better next time the only way any republican is going to be don trump in the republican primaries is by making a very simple case you lost in twenty twenty two dead man you are going to lose again in twenty twenty four to a dead man you are going to spendthe entire year locked up in sort you've going t be whining on truth socially no can spend a dollar on actual electioneering you're not to spend five minutes outside of marlogo or off a truth social and those are all obstacles to you winning the presidency somebody is going o have to make that case the problem is i think all the republicans in the race are afraid to make that case because they are afraid that if they say that trump lost in twenty twenty they entire audience isgingto disappear but here is a thing if tons from one n twenty twenty of course we should nominate hm an twenty twenty four either were was for there is no third possibility if you lost in twenty twenty we should probably run somebody else is he lost and if ye won and twenty twenty we should for sure run him because he will win again right this is the entire debate and if no republican is willing to save the obvious which is trump lost in twenty twenty cause we did not keep be in the white house right now not signing crap you unduly well then who the helmsman overtake him in primary o meanwhile i have learned according to reports for my producers that does something all the visual musical words happened last night the times is empty vs times and due it is starred such vaunted names as daddy an chicory us apparently we have time travel back to my high school days which is exciting news teammates have not really been superjuperelevant for a long time but ever often they just try another shock tactic it is according to my reporters on the ground say was responsible for this bagmen have been told that basic it was pretty class it had the usual keeping helping of queasy undid and and all the rest this was led off by a bran new song from those artists of the spoken word the shakespears of our time pagan the stallion t h e because you are the stallion pagan the stallion and carry b och two of the great artists n in the pantheon of the cannon it is gin a goa baton brooms gurshwin on cage carry b as that is haw that is how's going to go it is can be amazing they have a new song ah that they are

and bongoes is about the booty taking e a taking a page from sexy red an now they to be fair my understanding is the bongoes does not directly talk about the anis in the same way that sexy read does ah which is of benefit to us all but bongoes is about the a the but cheeks apparently we we have we are we are a we are a nation with deep spiritual value an connection to undying beauty that that is

generations felt as though they were living as as as though they were under the heel of the picturarical society and finally have achieve the liberty to be actual queasy prostitutes on screen which is something they never had before except for literally all of human history to shake their bongoes for money a that never have women achieve this sort of this sort i mean except for in all sides at but

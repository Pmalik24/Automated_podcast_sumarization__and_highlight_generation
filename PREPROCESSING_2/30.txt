we are broadcasting to day here from blackout poland flew in here on sturdy night arrived on sundae nights wo could visit bushtit is with elonmasq we a invited by the european jewfish association every year they do in event here at bushtits around the liberation of aushitz is the time a year that bushtits was liberated in nineteen forty five and i have to say aushwitzis indican experience have never been there before i know that melon has not bee there before either and a we are walking the grounds together obviously being given a tour by tour guide and do now for those who have seen images of the holiest which i would assume is petty much one on a the by pole numbers apparently not for for those who have seen movies about the holiest seeing the actual structures where masstafth was brought upon the jewfish people as well as coma homosexuals russia soldiers it is in astonishing demonstration of the darkness that is present and possible inside the human soul and just first general impressions of what it is there and now for those who have not visited it it is worth the visit because i think that a we tendril of very easy lives thankgot in the west in the modern era we we tend to look around us and see people who are generally good people who who generally believe in non evil things and ten you go to a place shits and your realized that it actually is not all that unthinkable for the unthinkable to happen first we visited shits which is a much smaller aria of the actual death camps than than the death camp footprint actually is the death camp footprint includes the shit is complex includes some forty different camps around work camp steal camps on the bushtit is complex the center of it where you see that famous fence the a b m fry the work will make free which of course was a la the freedom was murder you see that when you walk in and then you walk into various buildings brick structures that had originally been built as actual barracks and that were then turned into these hellholes where they would hold a thousand people in a space that was maybe meant to hold a hundred couple hundred at bast twenty two toilets for a thousand people where the death rate in the early days before they were turned into fullskile deft camps was already twenty five per cent walk into the areas where prisoners were executed you see the basement structures where nylon b was first tried against russia to bus before was then turned into a tool of mass extermination against predominantly the news nine hundred sixty thousand news killed at shit is berkanal during world war too you are walking all this and it is the lowest of what humanity has to offer obviously the you over t berkanal which is even more astonishing was berkanows the actual camp complex that was mean to hold tens of thousands of human beings and it expands for wot must be hundreds makers it is it is an extraordinarily large complex they have preserved many of the structures most of the deaf camps were blown up by the notes destroyed by the note's an plowed under by the notes in an attempt to hide up what they had done aushrisberkenow obviously survived when it was liberated and these structures are now eighty years old and they are basically brick hovels in which you see bunks stacked one on top of another that are incredibly small were originally designed by the evil architects of the polices to hold three people at a time and then were eventually expanded to hold six seven people at a time i the privilege whence younger of helping to ate the memoirs a holicosoriver who d actually gone through ashrusberkanow and the stories obviously are horrifying now you walk it and its empty obviously and done yet you can you can feel the darkness of the place pretty clearly and i think they now i think the upon obviously thought well as well beta i do not think that you can walk through that place n and nose the the darkness inherent there an i think that there there a bunch of important things to be gained from doing something walking shits berkanow anything the first is to realize that people can be made to believe nearly anything and this holds true on decide both the evil people and m the people who are victimized by by those who were evil and one of the things that you see when you walk through outfits itself the the actual complex is you see a room that is just filled with suit cases and every person who brought a suit case two bushtits though they were going tend up on packing that suit case step by step by step european jury thought that whatever was next could not be this all the land told the final step into the gaschambers and when we criticized people for not having fought back at what point where they supposed to believe that the unthinkable was now thinkable because the unthinkable is unthinkable until precisely the moment that it becomes real an to cautionary note ta to people who do not take the world seriously do not take politic seriously that we all ought to be at s certain level attempting to read tealeaves now can read too deeply can be too catastrophic about politics and i thinks very easy to fall into tat when doom scroll on very social media services but it is also important to recognize that as relying upon is reading the memoirs of o victor clamper whose german new who lived in dressing usually and he kep these memoirs all the way through world ware to can it u living password wore to an into the movie domination of eastern rope and every step of the way in his memoirs he seems to think hell maybe things are going to be toque maybe it maybe this will reverse itself and even when he becomes comparing he never things that is going to turn to this and there is very little limit to the evil that can be created in the human heart that evil can only be masked by ideology ideology absolutely matters it absolutely matters to truly understand happen tin ashrisberken now you have to understand german history in european history eft t understand european antisemitism and then the first and most fundamental thing to understand about antisemitic m in the modern era which again if your operas berk no thitswhat you have to talk about that the first and most fundamental thing understand out as hissemetism is that at root it is conspiracy theory about power when you read the ratings of hitter when you read writings that proceed hitter by fifty sixty seventy years antiseptic writings when you read these writings what you see s that there is a conspiracy theory about news this conspiracy theory is that the powerful in every industry are jewfish that they are part of it in evil conspiracy and that the only reason that they have gained power is through some sort of perverse machination and that therefore they must be extirpated they must be destroyed now there's a recognition that it cannot be religious jewelry because it turns out that the people that many industries in prefer rope are not religious news their jewfish by ethnicity but doer not practicing many of them were converts to protestants or even catholicity but because news were just proportionately represented at the top of many major industries particularly in major cities around rope they represent a heavy percentage of places berlin wars because of that there is a theory of power in the theory power suggested they were the exploiters that they had rigged the system on their own behalf and tat therefore they had to be destroyed and that ideology a self justifying ideology whereby the people you are about to kill are actually the true victimizer which is why of course they have to be killed wen that particular ideology is seductive and it easy to replicate does not mean the holicostes can be replicated to arrow thing anybody thinks that the holiest is can be replicated to morrow god forbid but the ideology the breeds the victimization of news among other sub groups that ideology is very much alive well and with us and i thing one of the things that we tend to see when we see places ashes been out is the the extent of the horror is unthinkable and unimaginable that it means the we tend to cut it off from the rest of sort of human relations we tend thing ora this is an outlier is just as crazy statistical outlier when in reality it is just the culmination of a continuum of theory that has been present on earth for literally thousands of years going all the way back to the book of exits the same things that pharaoh is saying about the news that there rising in numbers in power tat they are threat to us that same stuff is being repeated by hitter in nineteen thirty five and its being repeated by some people to day ideology absolutely matters and to understand what happen to ashes been lav to understand the ideology to understand the threats to the west you have to understand ideologies that are pernicious wrong and yes evil melon and i visit pushes we visit bercanow and then we and of going over to the local double try hotel which is where the e ja a actual even is taking place and i had the the privilege of interviewing melon onset age now first all i should tell you i thing the melon is an incredibly good hated person now having met him this is the first time mention person but we we spoken before obviously now having having dealt with him melon is by nature a problem solving engineers the thing that he does its what is made him world famous he is a person who solves problence who sees things through a very angle i frame and that analytic frame means that he is both a risk taker and also somebody who i think is pretty clear eyed about when at problem is a problem the how to solve that prom that leads him to a shocking level of moral clarity mi true truly i think that that plans understanding of of morality is instinctively very its it is instinctively quigood which is obviously very different then what the me is telling you with impede i telling you about plan legs i media they have they're a stake in degrading en as as a human being largely because plan threatens their frame plan is obviously both a product and a create of the free market a plan is rich which according to many the media makeshift inherently bad plan is somebody who a free speech advocate which according to the media again makes him bad because he does not gate keep the way they would for him to gate keep or the way the a gate keep and they have been targeting him on a wide ride of issues nearly a of which i think a a fully specious on a get to the discussion that i had with t plan in just one second first a sock about something lighter how you hirer obviously we have accompany heritably wire we are very concerned with finding the best people on planted earth to work

ziprokrer a come less daily wire again ziprokru a come lashed daily wire ziprokreer is the smartest way to hire hays o back to this visit we set down together and we had a a wide ranging conversation about various topics including some the ideologies that lead to evil action one of the things that we discussed at fair length was diversity aquiline inclusion and d e i which of course sounds very happy face d e i is the basic thesis that i gain the world is driven by powerdynamics that virtually every system is a power dynamic system that free speech is actually just a stands in for power that free markets are stands in for power that those who are successful in these systems are actually perpetrators of this system four their own exploitative power that is a dangerous theory by the way that that theory not varsity equal inclusion but the idea that power lies behindall systems exists on the right as well as not unique to the left it in materializes in racial ways on the left it materializes in sort of bizarre populist crossways on the right the did the firxsampl capitalism is a tool of the globalist rich a that sort of nonsense exists on all sides of the political lie but d e i which is the most threatening version of this form tfrticgling on the political left it helps explain why for example you see a giant coalition of people harprohamas and one of things the i asked melon about was the fact that in the after muff october seventh an melon of course visited israel after october seventh he visited the areas in which mas slaughter of news left wing out belay took place in israel bahamas he still wears the necklace in honor of the people who are kidnap by mamas an hours to being held in captivity and dome and you see people in the lest marching on behalf of members of camps and i asked him about that because obviously the only rasionow for queers for raisin or example el g b t people who are suggesting that they have solid are people would literally murder them first chance they got in the goes a strip is this d i theory that there is the system of power that must be torn to the ground and that crosses streams very stronglythantisemitism because after all if you are making the case that there is a group of people with disproportionate power along rascal lines that nick lines religious lines and that the are therefore the the oppressors in the exploiters that crosses streams very quickly with antisemitism which is why by the way a hazard hairs pole that we discuss last year found that sixty seven per cent of those aged between eighteen and twenty four called news in oppressor class and ideology matters folks and has deadly consequences pellets the actual discussion with melon in just one second first if your me there is not a day that goes by the do not call or ten somebody they actually care about my friends of pure talk are making it easier and more affordable to connect with you most important people in your life pure talk gives you phenomenal cover on america most dependable five i network it is the same coverage and love but for half the price of the other gods thou limited plans turning just tabus month the average family will save almost a thousand dollars a year as a veteran own company pure talk rases ten million dollars toward veterans that last year along what is more pure folks customer service team it spoke rat her in the united states it can help you make the switch his little best tenmenutes i made the switch years tot go at this point i got play my courage is excellent pure talk make sure that ism getting it at he best possible price and only that actually do not hate my got in terms of values i challenge you to stand with company that actually likes you and champions your values go to pure talk dot come slash of pure right now the will seven additional fifty per cents off your very first month of covering that is pure take do come slasher part save on wireless the company you can be proud to spend your money with again that is pure talk dot come slasher pure pure talk dot come slashes which over that phone coverage to a company that actually likes you i ay we sat down together and we started by discussing d i hears what it sounded the ti aversely equity inclusion idealize they finally suggest that all of society is a vast pyramid of group identity and that the very tom are the people wore successful and that those people are exploiting everybody else whom e can ell the successful by the identity not by the loveless success by the up identity an and matches up incredibly sinks u almost avenge mark sorta antisemitism absolute the dives ectracrusio rejoice always be wary of any man that's i i could come out of he tore or well o as never a good signs a and a because it sounds sure diverse equity yes teal sound i words that what what really means is discrimination in the vase o rase a sexton an special intention and and and it is a waste merit an and and thus i think is finamentalle anticipate a ye an ta i think itthatthe whole all of tiki old all of the riots that were in the an ma u see an college aphesis i think i ad a shocking wake a pulse an i thin any any any sir civilization the civil minded person now obviously i think you'illunstake on d i is exactly right and it is dangerous because again any theory that suggests that principle is really just a mask for guess of power and there is a cover of you lead people who are standing behind that system when if i mat y freeware to system win comity free system for example or a free speech system when you make that suggestion what you really suggesting is that any one who is successful is a victimizer and as a victimizer they therefore ought to pay some sort of price this why you see all these streams crossing in the d i left is why you see blacklists matter protesting for ort uncap palestine this is why you see people who are socialist for protesting on behalf of some of the least socially responsible people on planed earth and you on talked in those terms more broadly with regard to for example this sort of reversal of morality when it comes to weakness verses strength one of things that were been seeing the modern world is this at tempt to read strength as evil and weakness as virtue that is it that is a despicable morality because it is not moral at all in fact it is directly antibeblical e bible specifically says that if you're a judge you are not allowed to favor either the poor or the rich why doesthe bible suggest they are not lowed to favor the poor when the suggestion by left as that you filleter favor the poor far father poor and powerless they answer is because virtue and wealth are not necessarily connected i know very virtuous people who are poor i know very virtuous peoplewho are rich and i know many people whore not virtuous for both poor and and rich as well and that makes a difference when it comes to world politics and makes a difference when it comes to the sorts of things the event if you believe that the weak are inherently virtuous and what that means that the system itself has made them weak and the system must be torn down and people who purport to uphold the system must be destroyed that is how all this connected visiting place atressburk ow that conspiracy theory is very much alive and well here as yean talking about weakness for his strength and morality well i i think we really to to stuff the principal that the the weaker not none we cur party is always right the si simply not true an if you are not its a press or or the weaker part it does not mean your right an because it some of the you now we weaker a grub once annihilate you that does not make him good unis we have to get rid of the rule that that if you weak a your ordimatically good that is that isabste make to since an ye don you it often make sens were a redone pedatisolents my an we in you an the if that if that smaller once to kill you that i that the that o an net eplakrin marl absolute as not mort tatithere is this gotten bat in the absolute and any days any goo r individual against absolute mostndis not whether the the pole oppressor oppressor just and able intense a ta in good things do they wont to murder invent people that is that his matter who they are in just a second on a gets to eons perspective when it comes to free speech and act which of course has been used as ay as a ration ow by the mediate to attack plan among others first have been talking but he looks mattressfors i had the honest the i am missing my he loiksleep mattress right now because i am abroad on the road i need the he looks mattress to get a good nights sleep it just that simple have had my he loksleep mattresses and on decade at this point

look sleep dot come slashed with he like battersleep starts right now away then plan i discuss freedom of speech one of the cretins of en and acts is that when plan bought ax he opened it up he broaden the called overtone window the the the window of acceptable speech and e on has tried to pursue the brightest possible speech that he believes is is legal i which make sense because twitter was originally founded to be a sort of town square and then it became instead the preserve of a select group of self appointed moral police officers who would not allow to say true things and i asked him one of the critiques of that has been while are not ongoing to alow more bad speech as well as good speech on a and that includes theoretically more anthem is met commentary on acts and i asked yellow about this and hears what he had to say had you balance the necessity for free speech with with all these critiques to dow what is hi speech what is antisemitisinan and had he balance that well the tigers of the the coming anal pee speech a i a air day creespeech whens in i that if somebody says something that is false a you especially not at come you can then reply to it the correction and then i ma you an of community not tat a make re sources in the mention i community notes body rest to prison false ti calicos i of something like that they can immediateletely correct again it is felons perspective on free speech that has made him at personal on grade in many of the halls of of power with regard to for temple government and legacy media if you look back forth threaten years at long public profile eons public profile was very much beloved of media and for insanely good reason this a person who is not built one or too but three of the biggest companies and world history he help build papally has she created company called extort calm than emerging with pay power which was time on my petertheo sow's a huge company and then he found ted on the back of that he invested his money into spasms and tesla a brocket company with the goal of breeding human colonization on mars in order to broaden the scope of human survival and to make provision for the possibility something bad happening on this planet which is just an amazingly audacious concept obviously and he actually has materialized that in the form of a profitable company that now carries ninety per cent of global payload into space which is just amazing and insane and that that is that is crazy of course that is genius level stuff and h upon if you n anything about him has been deeply involved in every aspect of the engineering process mean down to what materials ought to be used in the rockets and all the rest he builds that and then he builds tesla and he works with somebody to to start tesla than has o taking it over and turning it into the most profitable car company in the history of man actually because it is largely based on the tack not spaced on these sales of the car at the aid it is being generated in order to do things self driving is just insane makes better and easier for tons tons of people hand's the media loved him read you's this ontropenorial figure who ad come out of basically nowhere and then he buys act and by buying a he threatens the restructures he street he threatens the people who were the gatekeepers and a second i am to bring you upon to answers to questions about what was going on with the last met a why they have reversed course on him and why he is now the villain in their little morality plain just one second first think about your favorite child memory that you caught on film or videotape there's really not a great way to share that in you've got that in the garage somewhere youout a bunch of film reels from your grand parents do you have a film projector in your house you forget that m when i was growing up he's to take everything on cam quarter say a v hostage of the little takes hes put it in the the bigger tape block and then you had the lay mess a round with it put in the v just you are not any of those things an y more why not got all his memories preserved in a form me can actually yes this is why should go check to legacy box right now simply send legacy box filled with cancer tapes at filarial and pictures i get back digital copies that can be easily enjoyed shared and organized it is match have done it myself for my

hearts what you had to say about what he is trying to do over it act legacy media has spent an awful out of ink on you there is been a lot of attempts to paint you as as cosmetic or paint ex as antipyretic where do you think that is coming from well why why does the legacy media seems to have you particularly and last year to have i in in the cross her much well having the reality's that ex is competition for legacy me you i your ex is i is were you were going to get to is can years and then about the worlds the you the easy met is a readers the get g time to ever everyone that castle i the get we you one know why this happening wit at tin stone no an an exempt is hats a to time of peso i usage a an as a wat ta the risk print i cavil elision a you i wet a something i twenty thirty san actinon heather hand ex went up roughly the san roughly twenty tits sos e direct competition for peoples a taction now flow of in formation matters and one thing that that upon i think his very clear on and was focastin i know specifically yesterday when we visited shit was how l free flow of information when cut off actually leads to the multiplication of evil that when you actually cut off the sources of information you can make room for misinformation that both misleads the public as far as the bad things the are happening the world and also a lows truly powerful people to manipulate the narrative and that is incredibly dangerous i asked in about this in the contact of what is going on right now in the gosipstrep because as i say you on i think in in morally righteous fashion visited the villages that have been burned out by commons for twelve hundred people ware killed to unforced people were taken prisoner still almost a hundred people been cat in captivity that is an ongoing war and and i asked you on about the the fact that there is no informational flow in place select the gosipstrap than in fact in indoctrination and ineducation of young people can lead to a significantly worse world here is what ye had to say about education in the gosipstrep the education of kids an gosh a the tindocformation of hate indicates in gosh has t has to star sits you know when i as in is rallies sit tat that was my toprecmadation is the better make sure in can am sanded eat for to tin invite oman unfortunately summons o people will i is no way round it but that the the most important thing is to assure that afterwards that the doctor nation which gets a tort from as soon as they can under that language that the gold is to cut is was and an math toll that from when your cole will you get a believe it that meats to star over all it was just ism still promising the adiposity it is it was heavy going in now again have never been to this particular part of the world i spent years reading about it a lot of my extend gallic every you a lot of my extended family lost their lives in this part of the world during the holiest we have letters to my grandmother my my dadsmom from members of her family from eastern rope in the lead up to to the holiest and yo she lost large segments of her extended family over here and even flying into the area is e emotional and difficult visiting outfits obviously is emotional and difficult and terrifying in all the things meant is all the things and then doing that with you can most yo again in in a modern ear a looking at a world that sometimes can seem unbelievably day i think i thing was an inspirational thing for free lontogod shifts i think that the conversation that we had was was important i think again that when we talk about the true dangers to the world particularly in the west right now the idea logical dangers to the last are greater than they have been at any time in my lifetime ism ism relatively young i just turn forty and in my lifetime have been privilege to live in the freest society in world history america an unbelievable placeman unbelievable tolerant open place were people have the freedom to succeed where meritocracy is the rule of the day and as that is quash and as people oppose that as people try to craft weird and bazar left and right conspiracy theories about the inability of people to get ahead to blame the peoplewho are successful in the free market not not by manipulating leavers of government successful in the free market to blame the free market it is elf to blame the meritocracy to suggest that there is there the exploitative groups that there are a threat to the the population that is something that i have not experienced in my lifetime and coming here being reminded of the wages of of evil ideologies and and coming here again with plan i think good for upon ism and i twas an honor to be to be asked to to come and and do this then it'll gain just one second in n get to the new hamper primaries those of course are happening to day i think the end of this road is a furlong conclusion all explaining just one second first the menshviro shows supported

thousand customers who have ditched those work racers and twitch to termites hen on over germ's racers do come to day meanwhile to day marks the new samphire primary and this is basically nickel whale's lastshit nickel hale has to win this outright if nickel hale finish a second two dona trump in new samphire then the race is over for her because there in a head down to south caroling and she is probably in a looser home state two trump by all available pulling data trump as well ahead of her in north i in south caroling but he also happens to be ahead of her in new samphire and that there is some pules rally badly rated puls that that have nickel hale competitive in new samphire the latest pulls that have seen the ones that that real clear politics takes seriously enough to put in their average all those have trump up thrifty we l ahead of like half the latest travel gar pull has trump up fifty high thirty six over nice daily the most in gloom suffolk pull has up fifty seven thirty eight over nice half inside or advantage has went sixty two thirty five over nickel hale and again let just be clear about this the republican pity once trump i mean its just that simple now i may wish that things hade gone differently i supported on to mantis as at as a voter if had had a vote in the primaries i would've voted for governor to mantis as i said he is the best governor in america a move to florist at least in part because on to mantis had kept the state open because ronissans help make flora aurum and having that level governments extended to the federal government i think would have ben great i think wheat been left president of anybody in the pack the republican voters did not agree and do not agree by polling dato republican voters wont season in of thetrumpshot that wont to see trump run again they want to see trump beat one they looking at the pulling data and what they a currently saying is the donate trump is actually leading jobidon in a statistically significant way the latest hazard hers pule has donate trump up fifty three forty seven over jobidon which is mostly fascinating because it means that trump is actually breaking fifty per cent in more than one pull at this point and by the way in their general for of republican primary pules and those ones are the ones there to being released after to cantus dropped out of the race willet s that a second though those pulls had trump up in the republican national primary by sixty plus points over to mantis and second and hale in third the national pulling numbers for trump continue to be durable that is the reason why trump is denominate if donate trump or trailing join by ten points in a the pules and if ronissans were beating join by three points in all the pules i think this race looks totally different but basically since march the republican base has been brought into line on trump because of the unjust cases that are being brought against him in a wide variety of jurisdictions it feels legal espionage against the trump campaign and republicans get that and the way that they are fighting back against that is by singles give him the nomination i got that you can we that the poingdat beyond that the fact that trumpeted en durable against fight and takes away the chief but ton that fellow republicans could use against him for brief moment an time nonmember twenty twenty two it seemed as though the republican party was finally declaring the donned trump was likely to make them lose that he had lost in twenty twenty he had lost in twenty twenty one in gorge entire races twenty twenty two ideally poorly and twenty twenty four while why do this thing again and then as jobidon began to sink slowly into the pier it became clear republicans that actually trump could win and i trump can win there's no reason to nominate somebody else not only that a wide swath of republicans believe that for good reasons and ill that the twenty twenty election was not was not correctly decided that in fact trump one or should have one or that the rules were changed in e order to make jobidon win which actually is sowhatrup some people believe what i think his not true proposition tat it was just pure electoral brought whatever it is republicans are basely treating dona trump isn't in cumin in this race and because he n come in this race is getting in comment tight numbers in this race to that that was made clear by the facts that ta rondosantis dropped out of the race over the weekend here as governor to dances dropping out by the we this is the right of he did not have a paftfulwordon not of path new samphire he would not have path in south caroling getting out now makes san many's getting a lot of flack which will get to an a second for his campaign in the first place i think a lot of that flack is entirely is guided meaning that the theory of the campaign which is that re publicans had basically gotten tired of all the antics from trump and we ready to moves the next thing that was not false in canary february it became false as democrats targeted trump for destruction and republicans rallied round trump and the fact that he ran against trump i do not think that there is anything wrong with running against only trump in the primaries and all all the can n trump fans were aggrade other people for running against trump why why especially because again it was referendum trump one the referendum net fend of the story but the fact that that desansis would have made i think a better present and more effective president than trump was in his first drummer would be in a second term again you can reject that that is time that is not mean that that demands tanking wrong by running i also the there mistakes that the descants campaign made for sore me cans have out literally every non victorious campaign but were those mistakes the telling factor or was suggest that by palling tad a seventy per cent of republicans really love trump period and of story in encase heist sands dropping out in doing he indorsed dona trump for the presidency over nickel valley who's sort of become the because she is the only non trump candidate left in the race she is become sort of the conic candidate of the establishment which again is a little strange only in the sense that nickel valley was tonal trumps yuan ambassador is i she some sort of stranger to trumps a she she may be more in line with ours a bush erupt conservatism an she softer in affect a much much of re publican music belly is affect and nickel valley is actually to tonal trumps right when i comes to economic matters rites she tends to be a little more free trade she tends to be more interested in reforming entitlements for example she is to his left me be on social issues although unclear because dona trump himself has not made himself clear on social issues when it comes to say abortion or simmer marriage shut as more squishy in affect be she is more squishy and affect that means that she is been tags with the establishment label but descant's i think in horses trump for good reason here and that his trump is going to be the nominee why was you indorse the candidate it was not going to be the nominal in the face of that here is here is governor o senses tho following our second place finished and i always pray and deliberated on the way forward if there was anything i could do to produce a favorable outcome more campaign stops more interviews i would do it but i cannot ask our supporters to volunteer their time and do not ait their resources if we do not have a clear path to victory accordingly i am to day suspending my campaign ism crowd to have delivered on one hundred preset of by promises i well not stop now it is clear to me that a majority of republican primary voters want give donate tromp another chance they watch this residence gets time by relentless resistance and they see damicrets using aware these day to attack who've had this agreements with dona trump such as on the corona virus pandemic and his elevation of anchovy fancy trumps superior to the combining comment jobydin that is clear i sin the pledge to support the republicanomeny t i will honor that pledge now the on horsemen because we cannot go back to the old republican guard of yester year now again the sort of old republican guard talk is something i do not know whole sold republican guard is pertaining some names would be useful whenever people talk the old republican carvers is the new republican guard ism suiting down from was the president he is the current republican guard in i period is now as the down from is the wave of of the future tonal from is the present and also the past little bet because he was the president just a few years ago and not was twenty sixteen it is now twenty twenty four for at least almost last decade republican politics in dominated by trump in any case here is non from congratulating to mantis before we begin it'd to take time to congratulate rondesantis and afore really terrific per got no his wife case for having run a great campaign tropresidedey re a really good campaign i will tell you it is not easy they think it is easy going this stuff right is not e but as he left the campaign trail to day a three pikeman in doing he is very gracious ait he incus me i and it is amazing trump again what from thinks in the moment is what from thinks in the moment but he switches from case i distance is terrible rondiscance is terrible every terrible on do sanctimonious nonet to he man great camp in lake this was but that is what from has to do true does need to consolidate the party behind him i think the party is consulting behind him i think that is what is likely to happen in the new h amber primary to day and the polling shows that his well out ahead and if he were not to be the hominy now be an act of god frankly at this point if the the the half be an act of god from not to be phenomenal the republican party is in a consolidate as they should behind dona trump to be the person against bind on run this thing back and when to do it all over again now there is one thing that is worth noting here an the media coverage of is mantis dropping out there is a lonoscornful media coverage this being dropped on discants today for example ism in maheldin just the terrible commentator iron mason be we than i repeat myself becausang an mas i he is filled the terrible commentators s a gin red basket filled with terrible commentators here is man mahelden ripping on rondesantis and his campaign for to governor on to want is the man as heraldic as the future of the republican party the called apparent to the mama movement bowing out of the race for present he suspended his campaign a short suspended his campaign a short tum time ago a bringing it an to what are the most embarrassing in this estrous type primary showings in moderate america political history the move cons just two days before you haters primary contest where he was projected the finish well behind both former prefer brutal trump in for are you at abetter make have me that they could not be happier s on the one hand i think this cautionary note for republicans willseen a second democratic prepared to roll out their antitrust strategy it is been their entire strategy for the past several years get trump to be the hominy again then run against trumpet again be careful what you wish for politics is the monkeys paw what you wish for very often ends up being the curse against you but the amount of going there paint there they're pouring on to mantis is demonstrative of the fact that they actually do not believe otocrapic the said by trump when they say that trump is the most threatening political figure in america his try when they say that he is a filarian musolenias figure when they save this sort of stuff they do not believe that thing if they believe that thing then presumably they would have ben a lot more supportive of the chief rivals two dona trump but they ware not they are more than happy to watch those people go down in flames for for profit and political motivation and t because to them all publicans are the same and this this is is the thing that funny bout trump with all of the talk about hormonal trumpet out the box and crazy and dos wild stuff and he does he does wild crazy stuff critical antler when when he does those things he is treated in the pulling generic are he is treated generic republican which is my his puling is non differentiable from to mantis in terms of against jobidon he runs kind of the same as to mantis heller runs a little bit ahead because i think the america public is not is familiar with alien against his that softer affect then trump or tisanes but if you look at downs from pull numbers in for example twenty sixteen when ran ran against tiller they look almost exactly the same as it comes pull numbers in twenty twelve when outlook at his pull numbers in twenty twenty he performs generic republican may be a little better in the rural areas and that is because the left treats him as generic republican or to put in another way whoever the republicanomine was he was going to be treated or she as the ultimate form of the destroyer as the evil destroyed because that is every election cycle with regard to legs media and with the democrats o case speaking of the the strategy that is going to be rolled out here by the democrats one of the things there con try to do is jujitsu a lot of critiques of jobidon into critiques of dona trump the umber one obvious critique they're really two critics of duration one is that he is barely alive and the other s that he is bad president it is very hard to argue with he is bad president cause he really is a very bad president he has been terrible domestically he has been pretty awful in terms of form policing worsethan from of form policy than he has domestically and what the democrats are going to focus on is tried to defend the other prong of the attack right the senile and bad of the job they cannot really argue bad of the job cause he is not goa the job they cannot argue seen you say yourself wait how can they argue that hoiden is clearly non compliments he is not functional any more an he just is not i men you watch him in duplicates it is that as an america i up for our president to least be able to speakful sentences without running the risk of of having a full physical glass what is democrats have the response there response is at trump its to that is going to be the response response that trump is also somebody who is non compose menus they are basing this this week on a on a event that trump was doing and trump at least is doing events been cordon's schettuel looks this wake up at nine o'clock in the morning meeting at ten secure y riving at ten noon one free planed event two lid further day and that that is what a day loos for jobidon and then presume bless back to the old age home for a little bit of of water robes and then some outlook before they put him to sleep trump's doing events but the other day trump was doing is speech and he mixed up nick hale and nancy policy for whatever reason here is what a town od by the way that never report the crowd on canary six ton dicky half nick hale nick hailed do they did they destroyed all the information alley the evidence of within released at destroyed a of it all of it because of lots of things dicky hale is in judge of security we offerer ten thousand people on gat this is will the holly brain fit yes the the mean he is in saying it does not he he does not know the difference he nancy polo in nice half and that that is at that's a brainpan and it happens all the time an again you not a say that don trumps in a state of decline you have de show me a market difference between dole from twenty sixteen and dons from twenty twenty four i do not actually see a giant market difference if i played you back to back tape of trump twenty sixteen and true twenty twenty four they look very similar if i play you back to back tape of of jobidon twenty sixteen and jordan twenty twenty four the are radically different as much as i am not a jobidon fan jobidon at least used to be a person who as fluent with human verbiage in an outlook as oral and an strenuous as he does right now that is toe brainpan but the mediate aside this is evidence that he is just as he is just as off as rocker and losing it just as in a state of decline as as jobidon is here is john calls trying to make that case that moment which by the way the bison campaign has already cut in to it ad he's really something do trump is truly confused about who i in half his thinks somehow the she was in charge of security at the capital in canary six cell confusing her with fancy ploy but we have seen him confuse o jo biding with brock o bomb he thinks that he beat o bomb we saw one point he talked about how a biding was going get us into old work too a that that there has been that there any moments there's ben a moments in three been several moments on the sampan trail a where were he has seemed ay i may out of it again this attempt now to reverse polarity with regard to whose anal who is not i do not think that is comply but thief's what they have to do there can have to attack trump on that and presume my the growing to attack him on the criminal front now gan i think that is baked into the cake see an end manoraju seen spend his day very often tracking down republicans to comment on other republicans to gain that does not seem to be replicated with democrats very often when ill can oar says something deeply ntismetic you do not see manoraju remembers the media tracking down every democrat enter and asking for their opinion when when jobidon does something truly a inspirallings a inspiring stupid hey do not see a rush to capital hell to get comment from every democratic center but manoragou decide to go ask bunch republican senators if the wouldstill vote for trump if you were convicted criminally and there a sort of various answers to this the most obvious answer is well yes he is the republicanominy against jobidon a criminal conviction would not change the underlying opinion is to what he did or did not do ay ah i can think all the things i think about dona trump and his short comings in from a character and still recognize for example that the any willing cases craft that does not make any signs tor the blacksmith canary sixth case is a legal stretch beyond nearly all imagination but any cases now this t this is the the campaign the campaign is going to be for the democrats about how trump is really kind of losing it and also is a criminal an in good luck with this pitch i do not think ton work that well if you and be convicted before o am er which i still support i them was is aprons to o i i es i i witatsluce or that sentry get e crime o if is convict the it the convicted than you support e o to the the o totally from o forces i will support many e hit wat present to what begets the and convicted you sit start w crosse e e facts matter anti inn e love what the charges i yo what in it is convict ted what was he in evicted e i think here thinks batter i get now all those are the right answer but democrat see to believe that if thing grab a criminal conviction m an that that can be their day of such mackinaw is is if there is a hand of god coming down into the story it is going to be trumping criminally convicted first of all ism not sure the time in allows for that a it is not clear that any of these cases are going t come to a conclusion be for the actual election takes place the the only real possibility is the blacksmith case blacksmith is trying to accelerate that trump is trying to slow that down post the election it looks those gorge or charges are last too long for them to materialize i it before the lection it loos the florid cases can be delayed beyond the election really the only shot they haves that blacksmith case and that one is really legally tenuous not only is it legally tenuous it does raise the canary six questions all over again which i think is what democrats want they love to discuss canary sixth endlessly but i mean let us be real about this there are still some unanswered questions about canary sixth for example the the there is now tape outside the d n s that is at least somewhat strange i mean it raises questions was put it that way one of the big things that happen on canary sixth apparently is that there are a couple of hope bombs that were put outside the dance and the arise and we have not heard a lot about that since canary sex and not not quite as spectacular n video is those giant scenes of of riots outside the capital building on people breaking windows whatever but more dangerous by the way pipe bombs are men to kill people and these story on the pipe bombs seems tore getting weirder and e wearers represent of homes masses of kentucky he is accusing the government of a cover up he says if there were indeed two operable pipe bombs the be the biggest threat that existed on canary six that does not make any sente why they wouldn't be promoting that thread to advance the narrative unless they had something to do wit the pipe bombs their thing memory one the whole thing to avoid embarrassment it's apparently there is idiot's been identified by masses showing officers reacting nonchalantly after being notified of the pipe bomb milling slowly round the area you've letting kids walk in the area vice president columella arris was in the building at the time the do j did not really let that be known at the time massy says you would think thy be focused on these pipe bombs but they are not and i mean they really are not been the last time you hear out the ice bombs is from masses ore not hearing about about it from democrats at all not only that the bomb planter apparently is using itself on but data from myself on company was deemed corrupted the era was not table to find any records for the suspect i mean they that they've lock down who every person was who is in the capital building there arresting them and putting them in jail for years on end but you plastic pipe bomb outside the envier a and see that actual deadly thread of violence and we still cannot find who exactly did that that is weird again those sorts of questions are our going to to be asked during this campaign because this will be at the center of the campaign yet again now's that good for trump i killing's amazing thing if this campaign is held over canary sex think that that probably damages true politically does damage red enough to overcome the fact that jobidon is bad at the presidential i have serious serious doubt already in just one second we are going to jump into a supreme court ruling on the boarder pretty wild ruling by the supreme court if you are not a member become member use coach our a check out for two months for anallanual plans pick that lincoln the description and join us

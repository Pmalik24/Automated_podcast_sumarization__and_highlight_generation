jobidon's presidency is over ism's on t put it out there right now his presidency is over it was ended yesterday when the special council robot her the person who is investigating jobidons is handling of classified materials issued a report essentially suggesting that jobidon is non compose menus that the judge does not have a functioning brain he said it in the report bring it to all the details because hoiden then proceeded to blow himself up the challenger it is the most disastrous press conference in america history it was a shocking day in politics yesterday it all began with the usual which is jobidon going out on the stump and making due mistakes an seeming as though he is not all there yesterday jobidon was giving a speech in the middle of the speech he started again babbling nonsensically missing up basic terms here here he was yesterday well i si w i we pushjolis programer redone presereereee ester gangsta red state or a green stake and this is every single day with jobidon we'd doing this for a couple of years at this point where everyclip you play of jobidon he screwing something up and as have said before watching a jobidon press conference at this point is watching it will lend cross a tight rope over a volcano you are not watching because you are hopeful that he is on to make it you are watching because you want to be watching if god forbid he falls off the tight rope and yesterday jobidon did not just fall off the tight rope he jumped off the tight rope directly into the political volcano now again all this began with this usual day this sort of mistake caejohmp peris increasingly being asked to defend the fact that jobidon is not all there here so us yesterday giving a variety of excuses for why he ad screwed up a bunch of different things over the course of the last week or this happens it t a it is it happens to all of us and it is common but i do want to i do want to make sure we do not forget wit the oversaw arching kind of there what he is trying to say about about our leadership on the clue stage what do you maya to america ho tater and ma the three time in i the coup of gat a weer on a r ted tehtheagan as you just states in

two headlines from the report one of the headlines is that jobidin is quote in quote exonerated now that headline babies a law of misuse of classified materials we can go through the whole report but the big headline is that the real reason that they are not actively going to prosecute jobidon for is handling classified materials is because they believe the his senile old man let us go through the report in all of its detail when we will get to what again is the hindenberg of presidential press conferences of the humanity i mean jobidon set himself almost on literal fire yesterday we gets t

this pretty important first yes jo biding did keep classified documents clearly there ware classified materials that were in his possession but says the department of justice were not on a prosecute him quote we conclude no criminal charges are warranted in this matter we would reach the same conclusion even if to apartment of justice policy did not fore clothes criminal charges against the sitting president our in investigation on covered evidence that presinetent baton wilfully retained and disclosed classified materials after his vice presidency when he was a private citizen these materials included one marked classified documents about military and foreign policy in effganistam and two notebooks containing mister bison's hand written entries about issues of national security and foreign policy implicating sensitive intelligence sources and methods the agents recovered these materials from the garnish offices and basement and in mister bid's wellington delftware home however for the reasons sunrise below we can clue the evidence does not establishes mister brain's gilt beyond a reasonable doubt now what exactly did bid have in his possession apparently he had documents from fall to thousand nine that had classification markings up to top secret sensed f compartment information level those were founds in a box in bison's delftware garage that contained other materials of great personal significance to him and that he appears to a personally used and access as well these materials were mostly proof of a stay that mister bison took that he regarded as very important which was all about how he was pushing borakobama to be is pullfull scale out of afganniston which of course job then did as president when he became president in the most asastras fashion in america history now the report continues and he said and an the special council says that hoiden certainly knew this was a legal or should have known it was i legal to keep these classified materials and the report reads a lot the killer canton report that eventually exonerated her from names come busily saying she was guilty bought it is to what this this report really is is he is guilty of miss handling classified materials but libido should have now this was a legal according to the special council robot her some evidence suggests mister bid new he could not keep classified handwritten notes at home after leaving office bison ho had decades of experience of classified information was deeply familiar with the measures taken to safeguard classified information and the need for those measures to prevent harm to national security in fact twice in two thousand seventeen jobidon visited the national archive skiff to review his classified note class where writing his book tut he kept his note books which also contained classified information in unlocked drawers at home he had strong motivations to do and to ignore the rules were properly handling the classified information in his note books he consulted those note books liberally during hours of dis cushions with his ghost writer and viewed them as highly private and valued possessions with which he was unwilling to part in fact were reading aloud from his notebook and is the most damning part were reading aloud from his note book mister bid enlisted four points he made about the rock situation during truly seventh two thousand fifty meeting bid explained to his ghost writer or person in mark's sanitizer that he had made his similar argument years earlier during the two thaws an nine d abate about the troop surge in afghanistan bison old's waiter he had sent mama a forty page handwritten memo arguing against the employment of additional troops in nafgannistan mid sentence during the interview bison said in a matter of fast tone that he had quote just found to all the classified stuff downstairs again first rule of chiming folks do not do it on tape jobidon did it on tape he had its full scale on the tape in his words that he quote just found all the classified stuff downstairs which is him admitting that he hasifclassified stuff and it is downstairs it is no difference then donate trump ragging to a reporter that he had in front of them a classified set of documents all about iron for example is is the same things as i have i just found all the classified stuff downstairs n that should be open and shut case of violation of criminal law when a comes to classified information and mishandling thereof and as we see are are political boss is in this country they get treatment that no one else would receive when my wife doctor was working at veteran's affairs if she had walked out of the veteran's affairs building i whenchras in residency with violations of hippo material held ouldhave been prosecuted jobidon is bragging to his ghost writers that he has classified documents at the highest level in his cabinet downstairs on tape and the still didn't prosecute him the special council found that there is evidence that after his vice presidency bison wilfully retained marked classified documents bat afghanistan and unmask classified handwritten notes in his note boys both of which he stored in unsecured places in his hours and it is clearly b iron's material is not as though got mixed in and we know this because is can funny he wrote on one of the folders afghanistan but he spelled afghanistan without the age member this this a captain brilliants over here he cannot spell the word afanastand but e knows all about afghanistan policy according to the special council mister bid said the handwritten label on the folder looks his handwriting the distinctive miss spelling of afghanistan con firms this bison repeatedly used this or a similar mists telling in handwritten notes as vice president and before that notes he took a senator dating bactinactiaty again i man let let us be real about this jobidon was never any intellectual bracchakes the fact the is been dispelling the word afghanistan for literally forty years is kind of amazing real the special council then finds a series of excuses for why jobidon should not be prosecuted number one the special council says we expect bisons defense at trial would be he thought that his notebooks were personal property in who was allowed to take them home even if they contained classified in formation during our interview of him that mister don was emphatic to clearing his notebooks are quote my property and every present before me has done the exacsam thing a now that sounds lot preside in trump frankly president trump has been blaming over and over and over that every document in his possession is mine and that is actually been the real excuse it is not as though he was going to disseminate documents to the ruffians or something his i these are my documents ism cape that emir's exactly abide saying except basin herhornarces that excuse for not prosecuting bison looks very much the defends that dona trump is going to use in his one classified documents mishandling case furthermore the place where bison was storing this stuff not exactly the most secure location quote we expect many jury to be struck by the place where the afgannistansdocuments were ultimately found in bisons delftware home and a badly damage box in the garage near a collapsed dog crate a dog bed a capotes box and empty bucket a broken lamp raped with ducktail potting soil and synthetic firewood clearly handling classified materials in the way they should be handled now the special council does go out of his way to try to distinguish bison from trump saying quote most notably after being given multiple chances to return classified documents and word prosecution mister trump allegedly did the opposite according to the indictment he not only refuse to return documents for months he also obstructed just by enlisting others to destroy evidences and then to lie about it in contrast bison turning classified documents to the national our coss et camera now is that this positive on a difference between trump and bison not really because what that really suggests is that jobidon was perfectly willing to misshannal classified documents for years on end and only when he got caught that when he turned overall the documents which does not relieve you of the responsibility documents channel classified documents if i take home classified documents for ten years and iris handle them i lev the out everywhere and then you come to means a turn in the documents and then i turned in the documents that does not mean i did not yo a a criminal act before and by the way when it comes to killer clentonshe actually bleach bitter arrive nail that but none of this none of this is the real reason they are not prosecuting jobidon the real reason they are not prosecuting jobidon is because special council soberer makes it clear in the report is what devastating for baton he makes it clear over and over and over again in this report that jo baton is no longer mentally fit to be even in the even in the defense box let alone president of the united states what about to reach you are all direct quotes from the special council report making absolutely clear that jobiten is no longer with us and notably that has not been with us for years their is more on this in just one a second first that old car is still sitting right there you are tired of looking at it you are really tired of your spouts complaining about it i get it you are busy on of

that old car in the in the drive just get rid of it get the donation get the right off cry for ids at dot or slashed here is what the re ports has quote mister bite's memory was significantly limited both during his recorded interviews with a ghost writer in twenty seventeen and in his interview with our office in twenty twenty three now remember the year is twenty twenty fort this report is saying that jo bite's memory was going in twenty seventeen the is full on seven years go it's gotten worse since then quote we have also considered that at trial mister bit would likely presents himself to ha jury as he did during our interview of him as a sympathetic well meaning elderly man with a poor memory another words his defense is going to be and he is a nice old gent who does remember things any more which is that a great description of what you want in the oval office baton a direct interactions with and observations of him his some one for whom it many jurors once who dens i reasonable doubt it would be difficult to convince a jury that they should convict him by then a former president well into his ties of a serious felony that requires a mental state of wilfulness s there saying that they are just can to see a geriatric dotted and thereinto let him off more quotes from the special council report quote mister bit's memory also appears to have significant limitations both at the time he spoke to his got writer is wonitser in twenty seventeen as evidence by their recorded conversations and to day as evidence by his recorded interview with our office mister bison's recorded conversations with as waiter from twenty seventeen are often painfully slow with mister baton struggling to remember events and straining at times to read and relay his own notebook entries another quote in his interview with our office mister bite's memory was even worse he did not remember when hots vice president it in mind bowling sufffoks jobiton sits down with special council investigating him over classified documents he is president of the united states of the time he does not remember when he was vice president forgetting on the first day of his interview when his term ended quote if it was twenty thirteen when it i stop being vice president and forgetting on the second day of the interview when his term t began quote into thousand a i still vice president now call me crazy but it seems to me that the president of the united states should remember when he was vice president of the united states in terms of the years that seem pretty important like i remember the year that we started our company here at daily wire pretty important year twenty fifteen remembers pretty important there is lock going on that year that is not being vice president of the united states he was vice president he could not remember the years who is vice president it gets worse quote he did not remember even within several years when his son you died mind bowling absolutely in bowling mean jobidon pulls out the story of bofsdaf all the time on the campaign trail when ask difficult questions all the time its started off as for of a sad thing that he would that he would talk about his deceased son and then became obnoxious and terrible because he would do it in the worst possible circumstances he be talking to the family of he dead soldier in ho suddenly be talking about you and implying the to had died in a rock in service or something but now we are learning from the special council that he didn't he quote did not remember even within several years when his son to did and his memory appeared hazy when describing the afgannistandtbate that's once important to him among other things he mistakenly said he had a real difference of opinion with general carl i century when in fact i can bury was an allies who mister baton sited approvingly in his thanks giving memory to president mama there is more quote given mister tons tendency toward loose talk within waiter and mister bison's limited position and recalled bring his interview with our office discussed above reasonable jurors may hesitate to place too much evidentiary wait on a single eightfold utterance his waiter from almost eight years ago in the absence of other more direct evidence and other the reason that we not prosecuting him overpaying to his ghost writer i have a bunch of classified information down stairs is because he is too old in his two senile and then they reiterate bison will likely presents himself to the jury as a sympathetic well meaning elderly man with a poor memory while he is and must be accountable for his actions he is after all the president of the united states bacon are direct observations of him bison is some one for whom many jury wants to search for reasonable doubt quote we believe some of the same evidence that supports reasonable doubt for classified afghanistan documents also supports reasonable doubts for the note books including mister bison's cooperation withtheinvestigation his diminishing faculties in advancing age and his sympathetic demeanor again nice old senile man is the verdict that is why he is not going to jail this report is much more dove stating than a simple indictmentwould a ben a simple indictment bine puller to gotten off you to killed drums classified documents document as well but be stain of a special prosecutor saying we cannot prosecute him because he is old in senile is devastating and of course be giant been picked up on that right away they sent a letter his lawyers to robot her what we do not believe the reports treatment of present abiding memories accurate or appropriate the report uses highly prejudicial language to describe a common place occurrence among witnesses a lack of recall of years old events such comments have no place in a department of justice report particularly one that in the first paragraph announces no criminal charges are warranted and that the evidence does not establish mister bison's guilt and then they make an excuse the excuse they use for why hoiden cannot recall when his son died or when ho is vice president is quote his interview began the day after the october seven the tax on his roll that is going to be the actual line that's going tore the actual line now i ask you is that a good defense there is a major international crisis and the president gets more see nice and that apparently is supposed to be a defense to his senility see that is why we hire you for the job is because you are supposed to hands the fore a m for call as hillerclin once called it with some level of mental acuity if you lose your faculty is the minute in international emergency bricks out what are you good for what are you good for present eminent then put out a written statement in which he said quote over my career public service i have always work to protect america security i take these question seriously no one has ever questioned that ay he did not make any comment in his original statement about his lack of mental faculty at this point joke tavern tana was correctly skeptical abiding original explanation and could see many members the media were pretty critical of the defense because we can all see it we can all see it and everybody has ben told in the media to shut up about jobidon being senile he senile he can senile for several years at this point we all know it every timeout watch him talk you see it every time you watch him walk you can see he no longer is in control of himself this is not a giant secret we all much his been gasket for years on end we gets more on this in just one second first are you struggling with back taxes or unfired returns this year the tires is escalating collections by adding twenty thousand new agents great new welling these challenging times your best offenders use tax network you es say along with hiring thousands of new agents in field officers the tires is kicked off twenty twenty four by sending over five million pay up letters to those who have unfired tax returns or balances owed hes goes are not your friends do not wave your rights and speak with these agents on your own without back up tax not work you us say i trusted tax rely firm has saved over a million dollars in back taxes for their clients they can help you secure the bestial possible whether ten thousand dollars or ten million dollars they can help whether it is business or personal taxes whether have the means to pay or yon fixed income tax net work can help finally resolve your tax burdens once and for all sees control of your financial future right ow do not let tax issues over power you contact tax not work you u say for immediate relief and expert guidance call one eight hundred two four five six thousand or visit t and you i a dot come slash ofpuro turned to tax not work you say find our path to financial piece of mind that t and you u a dot come slash of per and even the medium members the media were tarting to say ought know this it the special council is not wrong here is take taper yesterday let us talk about that of a little bit more because this is a particularly bad week for this report and it is comments about present by faculties in his memory to come out because twice this week he has acted as if he in two thousand twenty one spoke to european leaders who have been dead for years a once he confused of franklin me thrall who died in nineteen ninety six with manual mac can who is still very much alive and another time he was referring to angle marcel until recently the the canceler germanely and referred the helmet cold who i think tot in two thousand seventeen i this memory issue is already out there but i wonder know how many voters in michigan with consent you think know the difference between no no a nobody but they a no or around half the we an oke or argue a calf her vote for president based on whether someone is naming manual mac iron or franc grandpa ma storage be name they probably do not even know but i though not i on it is ta count faculty in memory and and in whether not somebody they perceive is competent but he tapper is speaking for virtually all america on this whatever jobidon's random failure of the day it is one about what he said when he mixes up a dead french president with a live friends president or makes up germany in grand the problem of course is that every one knows every one can look and see that jobidon is no longer in control of his faculties this is now merchant time and fairly late last night for jobiton which is to say seven forty five at night we know that he usually calls a list seven p m because again the man is he is currently on the old age home schedule they have him in political hospice this president it is really sad honest to god it is really really sad he is my president because he was elected president and it is dad to watch the president of the united states not in control of himself say they called a pressor an emergency pressor at seven forty five now there's only one bull for calling in a merchant press conference and that is to blow up the widespread assumption that jobidon is not in control of himself at the ideal was going to be than normal political cycle what would happen is the present would come out he will be fully in control he be ready to go fully in control and he would then demonstrate that the special council was just wrong that he was having an off day or that he had not had a low sleep last night or that the special council hates him but clearly this is a person who is not only in command this is a person who is at the pig of his powers job don comes out last night went go through this whole press conference because it is we most is apterous press conference in presidential history it with baron baron a seen a watomum folks and following the stuff for over twenty years and if seen a lot o tape this is easily the worst press conference f all time because not only does join show that he is not in control of his faculties he then proceeds to commit the seems butcheries the lad the special council to say that he is not in control of his faculties this thing starts off and as always jobidon selling a wind up tonight at this point the first several minutes li got have well he looks away and then as whatever they have shot him up with wears off he starts to fail and the battery start to sputter and the light behind his eyes starts to dim he can see it happening in real time which is while is important t we watch thewhole thing jo bison staggers out at about seven fifty five is ten fifty minutes late to his own pass conference and as some fifty eight i guess as thirty minutes late to his own press conference and he proceeds to out to then speak about the special council report as the special counts released his find to day about then look into my handle of classified documents i please to see he reached to firm conclusion the no charges should be brought against me in this case this was in exhaust of investigation going back more than forty years even in in nineteen seventies when was still a new instate sent and especial council acknowledged i to operated concretely i did not troupe y road locks i saw it no delays in fact i was determent to give thespeciof council what he needed i went forth a five hour in person five rein personality over two days on octobey eighth and nine of last year even though israel had just been attacked by ha months on the seventh and i was very occupied was in the middle of handlyternational crisis i was especially please o we pester council make clear the start distinction different between this case in mister trump's case special council wrote and id to several me feral destinations between mister thumps case mister biters are clear continuing o to most notably after give a movable chances return classified documents to avoid prosecution mister compel legally did the opposite cording to the indictment he not only refused to return the documents for many months he all obstructed justice by enlisting others to destroy evidence and then to lie about it in contrast when to say mister bison turned in classified documents to the national our cart and department of justice consented a the search of music locates including his home sat for voluntary interview and another ways to operated with investing posit differs in you can see obviously his riding u tell prompter an he is not pausing to thank or anything hoses reading a quote of the tell prompter and the flowing is getting worse again ism hesitant to analyzed the affect of jobidons speaking because what is what is there to say but this entire press

evidence in tat i did not wilfully retain these documents in addition another sometention pan is some single in report about my recollection of events this even reference that i do not remember when my son i one were rest an get poof her second at this is where it starts to go off the rails for join truly authoress far he is just been reading from the report now he has no defense for the claim that he does not know what is hundred instead he tries to substitute outrage the claim was that jobidon will be found by a jury to be an affable elderly gentlemen who is not in control his fa faculties jobidon went out theyeraprove that he is in control of his faculties instead he spent the rest of the press conference demonstrating that he is in fact not affable that he is in fact not likeable this is where thing start to go totally sideways for him a can is ask the question thought to myself as to e can business wat what me say south si me common i was since to day he died every sing e day rose he got day oh homo they redpoll to service remember him of ta poser their friends he he literally in the middle of his big dramatic moment can not remember where they got the rosary for beau when we we are three minutes into the press conference it is started seven fifty eight is now into one p m eastern time and the president of the united states trying to demonstrate that he is in full control of his faculties and getting into the heightened o emotional moment of trying to show that he knows every detail about bad himself steps directly on to the land mind mentioning a thing no one asked about this rosary that he was going to uses a rob he pulls it out and then cannot remember were he got it in the middle of the pressor that is just the beginning folks it gets worse i me the the a loti i me anyone i me anyone i my me many was o way es simple we this as at er i i to day o tense can o ask party the same time i as maneasof crisis the task as to make the cion but whether o for the charges in this case that ta e resin to make that the counsels the is to make that is his don they e sit not to move forward an extraneous commentary say don no what they're talking about it that no places report o a of an the that that is not even true of course it has the place in the report the report is not just about whether or not jobidon is handle class my documents he very clearly did the question is why you are not prosecuting him if he is handle class i documents and the answer is cause we are not in a prosecute a seen our old man when he says that it is not their place to analyze that of course it is that is what prosecutorial discretion is this happens literally every day for prosecutors across the country they are the decide whether they believe they will be able to succeed in a case in one of the factors in whether young able t succeed is the state of the defendant in the case jobidon again trying to walk right past the question it is not going to work and again we are four minute's in i keep i keep time checking this because all he had to do was give o pressor in which he said things and did not answer questions for probably five minutes and within three he is screwing up basic matters of fact he is is characterizing the report and he is feeding incredibly b ably here we go matter is now close i dancing what have always foreskin doe y press a to ma i can not take som presses i sopping he festal councils say his report is the or of reasons you were i chorus is because in his description you a well me elderly man i or memory i come i not man i oi anna

i can passant o the i a pass a i get i es for at c posters an i gay he is not clearing up anything but his memory here he is simply saying i u i dunno low to stuff his present and he tries a file joke about why he is calling on peter dusty my memory bad that i even call to you a hah missing in a work he looks physically assaulted when the reporters start pestering him with questions as you will see for the rest of the presserage does not last very long the present of the united states his facing in coming questions this happens all the time every president to my life time has been in a press drum the press asked many questions there talking over one another they do not look this he looks i promise you he looks one of my small children when there are loud noises in the room he looks he looks physically assaulted by the questions it is really bad and gets significantly worse you thingies basso far and were five minutes in wait another thirty seconds will et to more of the most

conference continues remember we are currently five minutes into his press conference he is already failed to come up with where his son's rosary came from and again that is at that is an own goal nobody even asked him about it he has suggested that his memory is not in fact fading in any way shape or form well simultaneously fading an energy he looks his being assaulted by the questions that he himself solicited it gates worst folks were five minutes in it an last much longer but it is a bad period of time here he got he i we e e wo out i jolly my someone i a e i take responsibility o not

first of all that is the judgement of the voters every poll taken for the last two years has suggested that the america people have deep and apparently well grounded concerns about jobidin's mental states and then when he says he is the person who is most qualified to be present into in the united states it's a rather audacious claim how mad you bill really believe me democrats really believe that that there is no one else no one else in the united states who's better qualified to be president of the united states than hoiden nobody believes that which is why this cute has a serious rob on his hands i do not share classified information i did not here you l past my for even that is a why that is a why he is long it is not true the report it self says he shared classified informtionwith his ghostwriter it says it straight up when he says that he did not shared classified information with hisghostwriter he is not telling the truth it is a life if he is lying eyes for getting things in a press conference that is supposed to be how he is a totally with the truth teller continue not guarantee did no but the whether contest that ai e did not a that only be to e o mister pet woe or a the fact that the matter is what i did not want reneged i did not want him not i did not read it to him was i had written a long memorandum the president an agama why we should not be in this in afganstand and i was of is motile pages and what i was referring do i said classified it i should have said it was should be private because it was a contact between a president and vice press was to what was going on that is what his referring it was not classified information in that document that was not above bob when you look back at this incident is there anything you would do differently now and do you think that a special prosecutor should have ben appointed at the first place in both of these cases first of all what i would have done is oversee the transfer of the material that was in my office in my offices i should have done that if i go back i did not responsibility that there was my staff was post to that and a reference that in the report and my staff did not do it n a way that for example i did not know how half the boxes got on my garage until i found out staff gathered them up put them an gather and took him to the grove on my home and all the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to me on it was in my house it was not out and in farrago and a public place where and none of it was high classified did not have any that red stuff on me on o me in round the corners none of that and i wish i had paid more attention to how f the documents were being moved and were i thought there been move to the art come i thought all was bean that is what i thought it was the last party question special consists so the then appointed in this case had on the case of your liable present for i think especial council should have been appointed and the reason i think especial cancounsil should have been pointed is because i did not want to been a position that they looked a trump and work on a look at me just they looked at the vice present and the fact is they made a firm conclusion i did not break the all period thank you a is is thank you very much and then hes starch to head off and this point he stable bout this is this is bad is is not good bat maybe the bringing i relief and then he comes back he comes back for more ere we go action he comes back for mordants stafeihet must be springing what he our es it what are you doing i know you as that the conduct overesfonse in got in a guest as an ow over the to i think at to yo now man he is not fly present e mexico see i not one open a the gate too e man carrying to a caposipfer a second he comes back just to suggest apparently that israel response in gaze has been over the top now the whorehouses out there clean upon lie mine trying to say that what he was saying is at commands response in gaze to demands the release the hostage has been over the top whatever he means he clearly of saying something terrible morally there israel response to twelve hundred of its citizens being murdered and two hundred forty taking captive and a hundred still being held captive is not in fact over the top man's gross him to say to earn votes in deerborn michingan but then he makes the biggest of all boobs he calls abelfata else we who is the president of egypt the president of mexico in a press conference design to show that he is mentally fit and able and his memory is working just fine in oppress conference design to show that he is with it he says that the president of egypt is the president with mexico we of me what in the act what in first of all this would it this might explain why we have it open border heres calling etesian asking to shut the border and else his the borer is shot meaning the gasaborder and bazagua e tells me has shot i guess a en on over closeaway a a what the as some one treated hilariously the nilesn't just a river in mexico like my goodness my goodness remember this is ten minutes into apes conference ten minutes this not been two hours does not been five hours is not the daftractober seventh this is ten minutes into a press conference it is not late at night it is not ten thirty at night it is not eleven or twelve at night it is eight o eight p m and president of the united states is calling the president of egypt the president of mexico while babbling nonsensically about the s daily response in gaze i mean have you ever seen a political self immolation this he dowsed himself in political gasoline and then after a few attempts set the matchalight my goodness he is almost done here we go i took i can assagai tot the baby open the gate one as really ism a pushy really her really a ti man cancicencean the gat ne lot of innocent people ore starting i innocent people a to a ti as castor not a on number to i was also in the position that ism e i make the case than we have to d o much more to increase the mount material going including fuel the windemboys lindrnownce have been on the one with the canaries an can eon went the egyptians a a foment to studies to get as much aid as we possibly can into gossip the innocent people in is some women and children we are also a bad and badly need of help and that is were were pushing and i pushing very hard now to deal with as host cease fire because as a now of the working tirelessly in this teal how can i say this without revealing to lead to a sustain pause in the fighting in the actions taking place in in the gods trip and a because i think if we can get the delay for that can initial delays i i think that that we would be able to a extend that t that we can increase the prospect that this fighting in gods a changes as also a negotiations you may recall and the very beginning right after right before famous attack i was in contact with the bodies and others to work out a deal where they would recognize his reals right to exist let them make them part of the mattlast ad recognize an fully an return for certain things an to on states should commit to do and the commitment to that we were proposed to do related to two are two two way tan them i can going detail but one of them was to zeal with a havering on sense of protection against their arch enemy to the north west a northeast the worse less than files the second one by providing ammunition and material for them to defend themselves coincide deny that is the time frame with this broke ow i have no proof for hm about to say tut is not a reason suspect that a famous understood of about to take place and anted to break it up before it happened he and then he just con of staggers off and that is that does anyone believe that this person is mentally sit to be press if you are a democrat have a question for you you say the done from is the carious thing ever to come down the pike it sellout from becomes president of the united states that the united states bates lie over there will never be another election it is chilies it is chili broths i the the plot against america that warrant chiller is going to be the guidon charge are you choosing to keep it in place this doddering senile old man it seriously it is february folks it is february the election is not until no member a if you i cannot it it is hard for me to even imagine the democrats keep mint the do the ticket and if they do if they do are they likely to defeat dona trump the meditate taken various angles on this bison pressor angel number one is that everything is just fine tracheal math tried this one out last night an mas embysee she land the is all hub up about nothing after all jobidon can write a bike an neat ice cram occasional y her we go the fact tot his age is not something you can rebut nit cannot be you cannot tact that if some one is you are too far left you can tack to the center you you there is not the man is eighty years of he rite the bike kali he is he is inland its it it ti very useful political attack for that get get chis hays the least living the world of reality rather mattering lowlife does he does ride a bike he does right a bike good luck to you with that argument now let us be clear about this we live in such a crazy political time bat that see nice old man could very well win reelection treason i say this is because ism old enough remember a senate racon pennsylvania where a person who had a stroke and could not speak or weaker one a senate race simply because many people did not donate trump in pennsylvania is t quite possible the bison would win anyway sure is that a risk the democrats argon an ta take that is a serious question is that theritten out the proem for them is the the person who is backing up jobidin is coma arris the least popular politician in america history she is horrible and everyone knows it she is that she more likely to lose to dona trump then join looks to hide him in the basement maybe if they get away with it and then eventually hell pass on and then eventually coma harries present n a the rest that is the hope but if they have comely arris at the top an take at their toast another have a lot o other options they have to find some way of getting rid of comely arris and putting in say pavan knew some or something from californium in order to have in much more robust candidate for the presidency it is am loose talk about michellabama she is made pretty clear she is not interested in running at this point show would be a solution to all the democrats probe because she is a black woman which means that she could supplant comely garrison nobody would say boo inside he democratic party but she apparently does not want it but democrats have a real pickle on their hands a serious problem on their hands and donaltrum knows it which is why yesterday donate trump was out there slamming joint's mental acuity as thereto to never happen the was a balance against a ran and we blew out the balance and now a ran has sent holy tora and there s a li sang tat tat town is i of shame the world is in to en is can do the possible world wore three and we have a man this at tools the worst ten the i ti is toe tan to gan the to to is token this not to be e the got i who a she wo ti yon on we to tout en toea the tegotsion wit anybody only knows tat e this drop on go of the place meeting is bonce except the gimalout of people now here is not thin you see members the media for trying to compare dona trumps mental acuity to jobidons the not a questions about donate trump in terms of his for example impulse control but if you are trying to pretend that these two men our somehow in the same league in terms of closeness to senility that is obviously unto it is obviously untie out true for his part had a pretty awesome day yesterday first he watch join completely blow himself up in the greatest political self own i have ever seen my lifetime and then the supreme court basically struck em is idiotic argument that he should not be allowed on the colorado ballet the supreme court had a hearing yesterday during that hearing virtually all of the justices were slapping around the buyers suggesting the donate trump could simply be kicked off the ballet in colorado for quit what insurrection despite the fact that insurrection has no actual legal definition sufficient to support that on a federal level here is chief justice john robots of course is really no i winger talking to mason bury the colorado voters attorney who is defending colorado action o kicking trump off the ballet i would expect that it a goodly number of states will say whoever the de to critic candidate is your off the ballet and others for the re publican candidate year off the gallant it all come down to just a handful of states that are going to decide the presidential election tats pretty daunting consequence will certainly your honor the fact that there are potential frivolous applications of a constitutional provision is not a reason we told on i me you might think of frivolous then the people who are bringing o may not think to frivolous a insurrection is a brand brown term and to some the bate about an i suppose that we go into the atesision and then a eventually what we pul be deciding at whether and get was an insurrection when wen president tod something as suppose to wen somebody else to something else and wen we do to we hate until near the time of counting the balance also to go through which states salad in which states are not is as john robots taking to task mason many the colorado voter's attorney and its very much every justice yesterday it was just as caving it was just as forest here is just as corsage going after the anti employer ultimately there still has to be some kind of procedure in place to eradicate the disqualification certainly congress could impeach to sitting president but that is the only remedy ism aware of that exists for forremoval or otherwise negating the authority of a sitting president why wetting well on what the because the such o the speaks about disqualification from holding office you say he is disqualified from holding office from the moment it happens correct but nevertheless operates you say there is no no legislation necessary i thought that as the whole theory of your case and no procedures he happens automatically will certainly you need a procedure in order to have any remedy to enforce the disqualification which i under that is a wholesome question that is to defect of talent done work here o kept wit that aside he is justqualified from the moment self executing done and i would think that a person who would receive a direction from that person he president for a president in interview would be free to act as here she wishes without regard to that individual i do not think because i think again the i who officer doctor would nevertheless come in to play to say this is know defy to that would that the don't work is the mark is defect a officers to that a for e conduct that don afterwards an an an inly from audition of view put that aside mi cut a say to yen put it aside ha again getting baited around trumskan be on the ballet that is just the way that it is again democrats have a choice that can leave hoiden there and take their chances or that can tried to defenestrate him and throw the entire race into complete and utterly chaos twenty twenty four is indeed the at least he is not the other glitch that's effectively where we ale right now waif the democrat where actively making the case that at least jobidon is in true and we have true backers who're making the case two independents and democrats while at least he is not hoiden who what an election this is going to be of can meanwhile tucker carbon did his long wanted interview with ladder putter yesterday i thought tuckered fine man i thought that he asked some pointed questions particularly near the and about evengershcitch which were i think very usefultos were questions about the austere general reporter who is essentially been kidnapped by the russia authorities in is being held in jail for no actual reason for as a bargaining chip i thought there ware certain areas where maybe tucker could a push back her but the reality is that paten just used the platform as a way of filibustering i only tucker did anything wrong in doing the interview in fact i think again tucker asked him interesting questions that is fully coincident with a belief that ladder paten is an anti america dictator who has very evil intentions and proceeded to use the interview as a filibuster technic and i mean even tumor basically said to a from tucker said in inti introducing the interview at the virsthority five minutes of the interview is just ladder pouted essentially beginning with the creation of the earth explaining his version of the history of you rain in tucker is explain why you invaded you train and ladder potent is it began with the forging of the great rains i get that that is really that is really what happened he goes thirty five minutes just explaining what he sees as the history of you crane which he says with never really a sovereign country and was really created by ladder levin which is not really the case and all this is provisions history but you would have to be sort of expert on eastern european politics and the history of you crane the publish with the banian common wealth the history of of russia eastern rope in order to fact check him in real time on this sort of stuff and that is not some the thing tuckers particularly interested and here was ladder pouted taking advantage of the situation to talk about how levin created you train what matters this that landing the founder f the soviet say establish you crane that way i nothing is for the hates the cranial soviet republic developed as parch of the you a i a in i at the pecan she minyan for unknown reasons again the bulshofexper engaged in you cranianization it was not merely because the soviet leadertiop was compose great extend o those originating local ingather it was explained by the general policy of indigenization our soothed by the soviet union sene things were done in other soviet republics this involved promoting national languages in national cultures which is nod about in principe and went on was ti seeing passing of you by the way and tucker is sitting there can i get an answer to a question i o but a couple things jump out one is that when y actually listen to the full interview you will see that vinerpouden has a very self serving view of you cranial history the basically blows him to argue the you crane should be fully invested by russia he claims tat of course he has clean hands and all this he is never had in a various thought he is never had nefarious opinion he infects not anti america n just that the america have been unkind to him over the course of russia history after the fall f the soviet union you will also noticed that just terms of affect vlanmerpooten for all the tot there is a lot of told how ladder pouted dying how laderhooden sect he certainly does not look he is dying or second this interview vanmerpouden is very much alive he is very much with it am just in terms of personal affect if your worried about the future of the united states and you see as i to russia as in a various force in the world in terms of foreign policy which they have been and continued to be then the prospect of a president who is not with it sitting across the table from vladmerpouten should not make any one sanguine at this point again he went on this for a very very very long time and again his history basically suggested the reason that he a tacked you crane is because there is a promise that was made for example that the west would not expand dato eastward in the after math of the fall of the soviet union that promise was apparently never made according t my chip gorbichov who is the had of of the movie union at the time the promise was supposedly made he claims that the us broke its promises there and then tucker asked what is an interesting question he says wyeactly did the end of the cold worn not fix the relationship in of course paten than blames the united states why did the end of the cold were not fix the relationship what motive ate this from your point of view witscause into you said i was bitter about the answer no it is not bitterest it is just the statement the fact we are not brother groom bitterness resentientit isn't about those kind of matters since such circumstances which just realized we were in welcome there that is all one fine but t let us build relations in another manner let us look for common ground elsewhere why we receive such a negative response should ask your leader i can only guess why its o be a country i then opinion an soon and be i i sis i seeing how uses er being resoling n again his idea here is that t was the united states the really led to the conflict between the us and russia post soviet i get that is not accurate the reality is that russia took a very hard anti u s anti western stands in for example the war in yuduslava they were back in the subs the herbs were committing what amounts to technically a form of genocide there are all sorts of reasons why the u s and russia did not end up walking and lock stop as john corner suggest the he thought that they would in terminator to for example there are lot of reasons for that it is not merely that russia is a wonderful player on the world stage again russia has spent the the time since the fall of the movie union embracing oligarcstation destroying it is on democratic flowers shutting down the press telling political opponents invading sovereign countries they made georgia in made u crane twice their threatening other states that are in their near area and this none the secret to tucker by the way all the secreticaputn and it that is to of reminds historic patent for example he says that he did not actually start the war in twenty fourteen in u crane in crime and the donnas that of course done true he somewhat the called little green men which were russia soldiers wearing the uniforms of separatists into these areas to effectively create break away a rents in these particular areas but what is weird is that russia did not actually want to simply anna the parts the work crimiaso russia annex crime after twenty fourteen russia did not annex the parts of the donbassat controlled why the reason is because the russia government was trying to use those areas of u crane as a was of operations from which to democratically take over the government of crane and this led to all sorts of bazar sort of ramifications in which the central government of crane did not want to allow regional elections in the donnas out of fear the those would then become effectively sort of enemies within peoplewho wanted to hand to over the entiratyove crane to the ruffians it led to all sorts of serious conflict to led tote violation of the mink agreements which were agreement signed after twenty fourteen the or pretty in clear in exactly how they were to be interpreted both russia and u crane violated the mink agreements by the way the bottom line here is that only one country invaded the sovereign territory of another country russia invaded the sovereign territory of crane they tried to march on reeve and take the entire country here as lanrputent claiming that actually it was crane that started the word to spittle fact that realistically speaking vlodimers lens was a do and before the war lodgers lens actively informed his entire upper military echelon that he did not want them openly preparing for war because he was afraid that would scuttle any peace negotiations that he had with paten he came to office pledging that he was going to make peace with lanrpten in fact that a lot of people on the grannurane are very angry at zlensky for having improperly prepared crane for the invasion by russia literally days before the invasion hyenas basically happy tau king the entire possibility of an invasion of you ran is kolinsky in any case here is paten claiming that everything is everybody ease's fault of course it was the who start get the warring two thousand fort seen outgo is to stop this went and we did not start the snoring went went this is an absent to stop it i then why has not the war stopped that would be the big question that is the question that cougar asked he says won't just stop the war and punter then lays out a rational for the complete dissolution of the government u ran he claims that the government of crane requires deification listen to the twisted logic here now again you crate does have certain parties in is military namely the azo batellian that have been highly linked to neonaziism in the past foreshore that is true the idea that the government of crane is effectively a giant nay party is a bazar argument from ladder paten here we got do you think you have stopped it now en if you achieved your names no we have not the chimera's yet because one of them is the pacification these were people who exterminate the bulls news and ruffians if the d a testas biographyudu he was it is necessary to stop this practice and prevent the dissemination of this consist nnotthini say that the craning are part of the one rushing people they say no we are a separate point e o we e fineloishthi if they consider themselves the separate people they have the right to do bet noon the basis of nosisnthen not siateolege the is what he is doing there the case that his making is that many people who a considered serve the heroes of you crane because they resisted for example the soviet take over of u crane in the after math of world where two or as worldward wo his ending that many of the people who were resistant to the movie take over were people who were in fact pronate if this is the difficulty of european history that also happens to be true in a lot of eastern utopian countries that many of the people who who were rebelling against coming is rule in the postwar period wore people who had formerly allied with the natives that there is no doubt about that the idea that all of crane is taken over by nomism because of that is totally crazy that is a wild contention by vladmar paten by the way when punter argues that he is attempting denatfication in u crane which of course is an absurdity and than he tells his misbegotten history of worldwar to one of the e hate said this interviews he blame poland for the outbreak of honor too which is pretty while for god whose claiming that he wants o dents if the claim that the cozies were not responsible for worldward who is a hell of a claim hears what he had to say in can't teen thirty nine after plan cooperate end with thicklerculisg e i pushes oi did corroborate with honor hitter offered poland ta pes and the treaty of friendship h es elegy and a lions bemandtin in return that poland give back to germany the called the dance carridortho connected the bulk of germany with es brush and kinningspiras noises get i my sign we he slusstosiyposo errand this territory was transfer to poland and instead of dance a city of dunk emerged istthente tushitler asked them to give it amicably bit they reused thou course that still they collaborated with hitter and engaged together if get e that any in the petitioning of check salvation and now let me explain what he is attempting to say here and makes us sense you main this claim for a lot of years the reason he is making this claim is because he is a defender of the soviet union can the actual history when it comes to the break out of world for to is the malatov ribbon trot pact which insured that russia would not attack hitter from the east divided up poland it carved it directly in half and t give a large trunk of it to the natives and a large trunk of it to the soviets in the after mouth of the name's sweeping through poland they dive it up a bunch of territory the soviets and the navies they of course were the real allies if you are russia you have an interesting claiming that the malatov ribbon trot pact was not in fact and attempt to grab land wile allying with hitter whose actually an attempt to forestall a filarian invasion of the soviet union in invasion that of course did in fact happen in nineteen forty one that is a revisionist history the claim that that paten makes right there is that poland was somehow allied with germany because during the to data land agreement during the music agreements of nineteen thirty eight when checkslavaki was easily divvied up because hitter took it and then the western powers basically to shrug that is that is the famous peace in our time evil chambermaid stuff when that happened checkaslavaka got divided up by a number of parties including some to hungary some to germany and poland at the very last minute they it grabbed a tine sliver of checkaslavakya that had in the aftermauthol world were one belonged to them the born eastern rope were constantly changing all the time ay because of that he claim they were allies of hitter which of course his weird because then hitter demanded that e port city essentially be turned over to the to the german and poland refused and that was the outbreak of world for to and we sudden plays that is that poland was actually pushing germany to hard and forced hitter to invade poland which is insane and that that is why world war to began now the reason he saying that also is because that sort of is what he as saying that you crane when he is easily saying is that because you crane is in is defending it is own borders and because russia has been encroaching on those borders since twenty fourteen in crime and in the donnas and because you crane does not want to grants enough power to those areas that is what justifies you the russia invasion of you crane he simultaneously saying that we will saying that he is trying to de not toil and none of this makes any sort of sense but put's a clever operator he again none of the stontucker is an patent penis puns a clever operator obviously a very smart eye he is come lately vicious he has no commitment to the truth die cage you be operative i mean can we stop pretending that ladder paten is some sort of great saviour in scion of the west he obviously is not he is a russia she is an arch russia nationalist who wishes to expand the borders of what he receives to be his new empire he wishes to grab some strategic territory crime is very strategic there's this compass that he is colneltly occupying are very strategic and of course yo would love to break a partnato because that would allow him the possibility of further territorial expansion which his wife you talk to any one from any of the basic states they do not believe him and those are people who do have a border with ladder paten we talk about how now america we shouldn't really care a that much about going on e eastern our abut eastern reopens should i mean eastern europeans have every right to be afraid of ladder paten f yescalithuanian or if you ask in a utopian or if he ask somebody from poland are they worked about russia on their boarders the answers if you have any knowledge of history about three from on or of course the word about sh their borders rush as a long history of invading these blazes obviously tucker ask him about this in listen tucker says people are arguing that you invaded you can in you have further territorial aims in patent just platinize it which again i do not believe the cage you be operative sorry for the argument i know this is that wellie invaded you crane he has territorial as a cross the continent and your sang unequivocally you do not suit aslytio it is absolutely out of the questionhou just done have to be any kind of analyst it goes the against woman sense to get involve in some kind of a globaward loin tear and ta global word will bring of woman at thy to the brink of destruction he saying his after invading you can in threatening the use of newcleor weapons i do not believe you sir my and tom and then paten makes what is the case that he is been waiting to making entire interview read he makes the case that america should easily not care about any of this do not you got have your own promise tossing jest you crane what proem is it of yours and again clever tactic byputen because the reality is that yes you crane is very far away now they are serious jet political ramifications to paten simply being able to take over all of you crane first whole they are serious economic ramifications not only because of complete russia control of the blacked and shipping routs an all the rest of it but also because you crane is the number three grand producer in all the world also because that would then put ladies patent directly on the borders of hungary on the borders of poland it would also grant him the presumed ability to run directly through lithuania tart clinic gratis we discuss yesterday mean if you thing the queen's ambitions somehow after just wondering why did he invade georgia a the ads not the first time he is invaded you grain non ts first country is in mated a you granting him the benefit of the doubt that he is just a mild man or person who is seeking to protect russia interest without crossing sovereign bores ignores his entire receive i here here he was a though trying to make the sort of queasy isolationist caste for a for america ignoring what's going on do the united states need this what for tat editytoty wastnesom thousands of miles away from your national territory gat i meets e to buys do not you have anything better to do you have issues on the border issues with migration issues with the national dent more than thirty three trillion dollars we he have nothing better to do you should fight in your grain but you might did waocois would not it be better to negotiate with russia make an agreement who can pose i her s here is the question what agreement is paten proposing here what what agreements he proposing to during the interview he reference the idea that there is an agreement that was put on the table in aril of twenty twenty two in istanbol and that agreement is still being fought over there wrestle questions about whether agreement would be reached and her getting somewhat close to management by petty much all available reports including one from the wall street journal just this week there is only one problem in the middle of those negotiations has the ruffians pulled away from beth because they actually having someprety significant military problems near reeve as they pulled away they pulled away from a town clue bucks that town was the sight of a mask for of four hundred fifty people including men women and children and when the west saw that the west said of i do not think we can quite negotiate the way that we were before because you goes are committing full on war atrocities that is what scuttled the negotiations er the atrocities in bucks now if that table if that deal we put back on the table would bloomer paten accept that do today he is made that completely unclear the biggest question from the tuck or interview is what does paten want what will he except in return for an end to the war and in no point does he really explain that that is the biggest problem sir tucker does ask him that near the end of theinterview he says would you be willing to say tomato you win were done here and here is queen's answer would you bee willing to say congratulations dato you one and just keep the situation where it is now was not ye the pigmitmio i it is a subject matter for the negotiations no one is willing to conduct or to put in more accurately thesis i get they are willing but do not know how to do it look know they once in life it is not just i see but i know they do want it but they are struggling to under stand how to do it they have driven the situation to the point where we are at it is not us who have done that it is our pardners opponents who have done that well no let then thing ho to reverse the situation oke there is only one problem that that is not to answer to the question ' the only question the tucker yes set out to get an answer to putter won't answer a the only question that matters how do we get to an end to this thing putty would not answer instead he used the interview as an opportunity to talk about the west is terrible to ham in the west is superman to him and talk about the glories of the russia empire at some point he actually suggested that russia has always been very loyal to people who professother religions which comes as a bit of a shock to all the news were forced into the pale of settlements over the course of russia history and it but in any case paten is a is a skilled dissembler he is a skilled liar it is what he does he is in fact he dictator who does not have america best interest at heart again two things ho me tor at one one tucker did a fine incredible job in this interview there is nothing want tucker interview paten too you should not believe a word that comes out o queen's mouth because in fact he is an anti america dictator who kills his political opponents and really seeks to set russia up as a counterbalance to the united states in world politics army folks the rest of the show continues right now we will be getting into whether the senate had the united states will in fact approve some form of aid to crane and to israel it or not a member become member used coach per check out for two months free on all angel plans quick that

tell you that a government has utterly failed at any kind of responses to stop schoolshootings and mass shootings in the wake of that that nothingness that that non responds parents of children who died have stepped in in various ways to day a on a shore we have two stories for you about parents these in the second half hour if i show we have a dad from sandyhook who jumped into action after hi some killed but just to extraordinary measures and got results but om we on mean with this story about that couple sandyagony chillies the out and tell de texts this week they had their a straight

modest savings and seal security sandy is sixty eight used to work in tourism for the city of san antenna and lawn is seventy for he used to own some carrots sing is on so have you guys mat ye one thing i quickly realizes going to sannafay is that there ware now many of these mass voting s that they become grim reunions for all the people who show up to them is part of their abs or volunteer

lo waylay in them what is your am said the vans sandy a dandifies barrier ah ism sorry i ma was the day went on people kept dropping by the memorial in front of the high school parents and students stood huddled together staring at the crosses a writing messages on them i was quiet and hot a still i there was a low generator ham from the gigantic billy grand mannish shoe rock sat up in the harkinglat is community and then all of a sudden this young guys started wailing a sandy my to be line for a ais a he immediately threw his arms around her can her her here here to it of it is not oke it is not ope letter go inti iota it go cry ado genius o oo ask honey you are doing it now he graduated last year there we crosses sat up for three people he knew well one of them was a teacher name

minutes he is caught his breath enough to talk he tell sandy he wants the shootings to stops he must to take actions somehow and then the suddenly which is gears and starts spilling out his feelings about guns and gun control non the o to bis ten going in is for tit got o way his wait a shamus e gas i just li job en i sons in go gets to we e we and he plans to get a concealed hand gun license when he turns twenty one later this their the phillipses are actually gunners too they've a twelve made shot gun they believe in the second amendment but they areal advocates free universal background checks and tight regulations on the types of guns ammunition and accessories bomb stocks i person con by however sandy says the do not push their political place on survivors when they doing out reach their primary goal is to support but it is impossible for greeting parents to avoid the politics around guns there is a whole movement of conspiracy tears who believe that the us government stages masshootings to make guns like bat we were told by alit one said our daughter never existed alias ones of course this famous for seeing that mas shootings are vague he is now a defended and several defamation law suits when the phillipses ran in to him face to face an a gun control events he accused them of inventing their entire story and then two minutes later hes saying your daughters still alive and she is living in the bahamas and she is live in the high life and you are crisis actors and you are paid by the mama administration and doubted then ism listening going just going you are absolutely crazy lawn got into it with ones stood right in front of him it look a shooting match was about to start and tell sandy stepped in and broke it up i reached out to ones through one of his lawyers who declined a comments the conspiracy theories knows druthers or hoaxers troll families of victims on social beta immediately after any mas shooting this can get dangerous after the chilies hes sun gave interviews in aurora he got death threats and had to get the aft the ion valved the man who was thriving him ended up in jail hoppers are one of the things the chilies his worm parents about they tell families to brace themselves after watching lawn and sandy and senate i wondered why in the world they were throwing themselves back into the setting re living their worst moment over and over again the answer of course starts for their daughters shooting they got the news in the middle of the night when they were sleep at their home an tax us this was back into thousand twelve another doughtered messy was in college at the time she got to see the new batman move the dark night rises with one of her friends at molly plea an aurora coranto about a half hour after the move started pussy's fine called sandy from the theater the minute i picked up the phone there was screaming just horrible screaming in the background panic an he said don there is been a shooting and i i sit what is he talking about cause jess had been at am fallen pronto almost seven weeks before where there was a man shooting this was a coincidence jess ad left to food court a mall just three minutes before a man walked in and open fire my first thought was this is not funny you know but he is not a prankster and i squid are you okay he said i think have been hit twice and it was when he said that that i went why is not messy calling and i knew something was rally row he said i tried that is what i won up because the scream with a loud it was shall if pecan save he e ever heard before lane found sandy in the living room sliding down a wall he picked her up and took her to their couch beholder messy was one of twelve people killed that night another seventy people were injured and then five months later there was another mashshooting sandy hook we are twenty first graters and six educators died days later the breed campaign to prevent on violence contact tot the phillipses they are reaching out to families from their mash shootings and asked if they would be willing to travel to newton to talk to parents there sandy say they didn'en't had to think about it they immediately said yes because they wished they would had some one to talk to you right after tasse died but when they arrived at the community center in new town sandy says they felt nervous and uncomfortable maybe they were intruding they were not sure of these parents would feel angry or grateful about their presents you know it is walking into a funeral of people that you do not know and i remember saying to my husband then we walked in the room and i saw their faces i said that is what we looked five months ago what is that look what ugh they are hanging on to each other they have been crying their eyes yer red there walking almost robot their bodies you are moving that they are not really there i realized that is what i look just five months ago tut it all made me realize this is exactly what i want to be doing she wanted to help these parents acclimate to their new reality looking back sandy says it was probably too soon for them to be out their trying to comfort their parents when they were still raw but the chillies as said there was also a strong and instant sense of kinship that they could not turn away from while they were there they ran into parents from other shootings to parents from virgin tack an poison these parents had lost kid suddenly and violently and places where they thought that they were say the chillies as now had parents that they could lean on to this was the moment that launch the philipses and to what is become their life work they could see the need they are no experts on what to do when your child dies in a mash shooting the only experts are the people at tap ten to to help them find each other any and sandy have set up an organization called survivors and toward they help family's navigate their grief less a much of their practical things everything from medical bills and charity stars that use kid's photos to raise money to how to get your child's body home if you live out of state however this new mission was hard for their family and friends to comprehends they will not you to good with you they want you to get back to nor of might well rotheshd they should you're not shame as you were should no deny place your are it unlock to shad person in the will be they she as we are abuse with no no we are in the ships we are objhust with it the chillies as and a few other parents told me because it hard for people to understand that the grief never fads old relationships start to fall away people you were closes to disappear which makes is in formal support group even more crucial but that support looks over time and what it means to the parents who get it i got to see all that when sandy and lawn got to know a couple from florid who lost their son in the shooting at parkland nice and matched direct i met them at their house their sons name was nick he was the captain of parkland swinging was about to go to the university of india polis on a swim scholarship he was as six foot tall blow kid who collected different flavors of trios and waited for supreme drops they said they just reached a point where they were becoming real fronds they talked about relationships shared playlets and watched scar face together the day of the shooting kitchen nice got pone calls and tax all day from people who said they would heard nick was o say when person said they heard he would been move to a staginarea for all the students to witness the shooting anothersaid of please officer was giving him a ride home and then ha nurse at a local hospital said she saw path an who matched next description but by that evening the door at still had not heard directly from nick s they went to a maria that lawn forcemeat designated as a mending area the sat in a ball room with their parents and waited very time the phone rings you jump hand think his nay calling from somebody ease's phone ah the my a was calling you you have any comments can we help you find your son and as to say yet and am at two o'clock in the morning we see this if be i car and then they start pulling one family in to a rooms at the time and ersh screams from these arms then their names were called out even walking into that room we have this tiny little hope that therein a say we we could not find your son e know and that hopeful that buhl was some were es and ism takes keep on thinking maybe he walked home and and then you to the map in your head don't take that long to walk to our house and then they told us the news but he was gone hit was shot than he was never brought to the hospital at all but to second nightmare to second igtmar mics body was still at the school because he died instantly and the building was still a crime seen it'd be two days before they could see him maniac wanted to look at his injuries bitch did not nice says this was just how her brain works she is an e your nurse she needs details the director at the funeral home wanting to protect her called the medical examiner's office to ask about nick and the person that answer the phone said oh ah lemme let me take a look what is the name again this nicholas for i taste is simmer all this former's perfect i think it meant that there was nothing on his face or his head id he was he was perfect he would been shot three times a bullet in his cross destroyed his heart and lungs was r to see him yes he is hopeful because you are picture in your head when you hear when you hear that somebody has been shot with an ay up fifteen just grows horrible horrible and i think to see him and to see on his body where his injuries were were am made me get it he was peaceful and he was not in pain and he made me have a better anlage of him then the one that twas playing over in my mind the phillips's had travelled to parkland to couple days after the shooting they did not know the doormats but a mutual friend thought they should talk and this friend with matches permission gave sandy his phone number sandy called and got no answer she left a voicesmell ism very sorry for your loss i i understand your loss we lost our daughter then you could call me any time she let him know that she and launch would be in parkland for a few more days bitch called back quickly he did want to meet with them in person monad be helpful to talk to another family who would been through hi mas shooting but he told sandy the him he was not gat a work his house was packed with family in town for an next funeral and ism on the phone with him and ironically ism standing right in front of his child's cross and i said you are not going to believe this she said that you say sign for the next room work by we chills right now and we proceeded to have a talk and he said i do not think we are ready to meet with you i a i totally understand ism just glad that we are getting to talk but you do need to know that druthers are already on mine saying that this did not hapenhe should what a druthers he said ah oke i thought wo you kitty me we crazy mi chaster to stop by their house the following day molmitch was on board with the phillips's nice handed if fervent take on total stranger stopping by their house i was more may be more skeptical nervous of the why are they here what is the panda how can people come and meet with us if they do not want something from us their house was crowded that the only private place to talk was their bedroom cancan mic sat on the that longing and sandy and chairs once remembers felling a little uncomfortable and thinking to herself why am i sitting here why it my i with a family who are a these people i do not know them but ah i guess it might help but he was very overwhelming like i cannot believe that i have to sit and have this conversation what is this this is my life now it was her appointing the conversation were it sturtedco turn for you yet think i think when they when they said do not to join a on grin o station now do not find now just take care of yourself and let yourself grieve they asked questions about nice n before long they we just talking long remembers inch asking if they were religious if they ever got signs from pussy he told bitch that them they were not but they took eleven eleven as a hollow from pussy the conversation went on for three hours all our friends and family as much as they did for us and how much have they showed none of them can have any clew what we were feeling and here what two people knowing exactly what we are feeling they also made me feel little more confident if e that is the right word you are in a club we all don want of mean we did not war me you we wish we would have met on the different circumstances but you have people help you with this kind of grief and a few days later when the online conspiracies started a wearing about ink that he did not exist or that he was living in californium they remembered candy's warning it was still upsetting but last upsetting because they knew it was coming they helped another ways to the doit took the phillips's advice and got into troat there be right away both individually and as a family their younger son ale has been through a lot nice was his bast friend one of the last things netted on the day of the shooting was walk ale to his english class ale was injured in the shooting and sat by a kid who died right in front of him once says managing her grief along with persons has been tough the was much attention on nacknacknacknacnack everybody came for back at the flowers for for nap to letter wo from ink i felt i if this did not happen to nicholas and only this i could been there for ale much stronger and much more si i was afraid that he would get neglected in all that i think some times children feel when you must have loved that child more than you love me sandy son was twenty five when his sister died sandy tried to talk to him about it which ended at pushing him farther away when she talks to parents job about her on mistakes to ay months after they first mat the just till in touch with sandy they tax er call each other one re couple weeks nice relies on sandy more than nice who in him order has a billon network of friends she talks to all the time then then we text it i think we tested yesterday it was letter levin actually we vexed yesterday and i feel she still in it she still with us say shes it is some one who we can lean on and an give us support and in turn order her to lead on me maybe seeing us get stronger it gives her energy to he is right about that sandy spends almost every day but her tiny kitchen table in their trailer feeling tux and pone calls from survivors and massaging with people on social media who ask for help the pain is always there at the end of the day and when you go to bed at night when you first wake up in the morning it is there but you have a sense of purpose to met that helps little bit of a life liners oh it is total l flohtotal if and didn't can this work i do not think i be alive i really do not i i say that to loony all the time he got i do not you love me enough kind of thing to stay alike i just t do not think i would have had the ability she cheap going piton on cop tell me that when there feeling stronger he to do father families but the phillipsons have done for them he sad god forbid another shooting happens but if it does we will be out there but tat meek meek is one at the pacers of our she coming out a pain tries to combat an infuriating and very personal piece of misinformation on mine that just will not go away and does some things a parents almost never do that is in a minute imago publgadio wen our program continues simar o life fro my glass to data program the parents step in with the government doing i know is it nothing is it next to nothing to reduce the number of mass shootings in this country we have a stories to day of parents taking action specifically parents of children who ware killed in mass shootings hen in the stories we have him to day so these parents they get results the dad in this next act to somebody a who gonna an sandy introduced producer meek meek to his name is penny poster this act two of our show down the rabbit hell and when penny poster was to explain to people what his life is he a sometimes sells this story when election night back in twenty sixteen he says he went to a bar got a seat near television order beer and stor to making small talk and i turned to the guys to my right and i said did you not and from there he went into a long explanation about some shadow government ideas and and whether voting makes a difference and probably ten minute sin to whit he was talking about mas shootings and then eventually sandyhook sandhog of course where gunman killed twenty children all on first grate as well as seven adults the stranded stranger then started telling went this particular story about sandy hook he thought the whole shooting was fake it had to be fake said is one of this first raters also shut up as a victim and a second mass shooting all the we over in pakistan in the corners of a the internet were people trade sandyhook conspiracy theories this is a key piece of evidence the sandyhook was not real cops a was real what happened to pakistan was in reality about two years after sandyhook the than gun down more than a hundred kids there and there is a public vigil and at the public vigil probably as a sign of solidarity with other kids who had died in school shootings corners had this photo of a boy from sandy hook smiling and when a spider man shirt under a quarter jack with furry cower any how deniers saw that in the coverage and they pounced did he die twice did he die at all the guy at the bar with penny is rattling throughall this pakistan stop and then as penny explain to a meek meek who he told the story to the guy mentions the kids name no a poster i don't really need to hear much more than that just needed to shut him down basically is you i took out my farmers licence ai said who look or your talking to show some respect the boy in the photo was penny son no ho was six when he died i he we well he sure he connected i instantly o and om he just became more agitated very anger one outside may the hat a cigaret came back yeeldat e some for go my god how much to they pay w how can you do this he headed to his believe i was the given he believe this man at the bar pretty much re to find everything about the way when he lose is life where he lives how he lives he runs in to these hoaxers in person and preach every day on mine the think the government is paid i millions played the part of a grieving dad and never minds any is the sick one nous never even his kid and the person who has populated these theories more than anybody is ales ones he runs e website info wars and he push these theories this radio show is you to bodies e oxjones made is name right after nine eleven fro funding the idea that nine eleven was an attack frustrated by our own government we sandyhook on said many times that he did not believe the shooting was real shan't he how u a than static completely far with actors in my view manufactory i could not believe it at first i ne they had actors there clearly but i thought they kill boreal age an us show how boldly are the they clearly used actors exclaimed tat the government or some shadowy gob forces of the one who hired these actors he and the other hoaxers call them cracks actors as like this whole alternate world that es his right next to the real one the makes miserable freparents leaning tooling most parents in that situation tennis decided go all action hero on the hoaxer is in on ale sons action hero i will do what needs to get done to defend my family damn the consequences penny is resourceful he is dogged he does not give up and this world that would within hoaxers in trolls he is much to a path i think very few of us we not to take meeting me who did the story on sandy and many also put together this story about the transformation of penny poster we first bodies is back in twenty nineteen there is some curse words in the story that we have beeped for this podcesversion f the show if you prefer be version go to a website he seek the first time penny became aware of any conspiracy theories about sandyhuck was about a month after the shooting he been on a media black out trying to get through now's funeral and taking care of his two young girls they were also at the elementary school that morning and one of them was now's twin sister she hid in a supra lass room but one day line finally felt ready to go on line by the news guggled son's name and forward wire coming up on finch results and the cans wore and it is just completely discussing in just over thirty days this whole world had been invented and one of the central pieces of it involved pennies wife in fa wars hands were directing this one interview she did on syannan it was with andiron cooper just days after now's funeral when he want people to know about o he left running and playing with i o plans and in the face bats and fire flies and he lives eating in side of oo cookies and he played the city gang side ad nasal understand use to tell his the samplings that he that he managed to taco factor yes that he was going to split his tin as in a dull the swing mansion taco factory and be an ascent the comments on line were grows and flimsy why did not she sound safer i touch he put on lipstick if she was really grieving and was not she too old to be the mam of hi sixfold kid they were convinced that something was to how or you holding up om in om a most e tin i i ana not i think ageing i ay out there he relates to the fact of how long it six rein a ban of mi lots an ye watch oi off to sounds and ai hart be an its is nine months to created human being ani take spins for an barf to take got away for the surface to the berth this reference to guns was another alpha moment for conspiracy theorists some of them started digging into brain slip looked up her maiden name and then said hay look at this there is a twist diplomat who has her exact same name and even fishier this diplex at once went to an arms control summit at the united nations maybe there the same person maybe she is one of those a league goblins trying to make guns look bad president mama can repeal the second amendment suddenly every real sentiment barony hired about nah was getting reinterpreted as lines from a sinister script they were here and they matter they all have families and they matter and the kicker that seniti for these conspiracy theorists andiron cooper's not there is as moment when the tip of his nose disappears because of a digital glitch in the video what see an end says was normal interference that happens with a live slight feed it is just a couple seconds but hoaxer's would not let it go they said that screen screw or blue scan whoever that was a fake interview in permit was a purchasament of a fake stage see in an interview that conspiracy theory was all aver you to and it was all you to would nosing have talk to parents who lost his and other masshootings and they have all been blind sided by online harassment from conspiracy theorists the crisis actor claim is common now he is a tacks usually star almost immediately after vet time are indeed in the mega and parents who go on to and talk about gun control vervet they get at the worse sandy hookas when this really took off family's get stock fending off all this crazy hate by themselves there just art that many sees horses for them he cause on forcemeat still has not figured out had to deal with no fiber harassment and the tat companies are not much help son those families just try to ignore the conspiracy theorists and hopetheyll eventually go away and that is what penny did for a while his life was a rack tut after about a year and a half they were still at it and he could not let it go any more the realize that i the grieving requires a comments in a silence and all of this material was a distraction for me in it was noise and i needed too handle that noise that i could have the silence and come that i needed there is a photo love of penny with his arm wrapped around nah he is got a walker's moustache and he is kneeling on a trampling with ha soft smile it is spring and nah has all this big brown hair fat cheeks he staging his whole body into penny's chests penny's got tons of family photos these out of them in and online memorial he made for nah right after he died the sandy hook denier is download them and re props them into cruel means wrote fake across nosh's face ten a picture of his headstone and photo shopped under his name is not buried here boots of his daughters were circulating too he could not just leave them out through the web with the tools penny got consumed with mining about how to take control the situation hadexstrack not and his family from all this the garnet did not scare him it was actually his comfortsone he ran his own eye tee business the was not the kind of guy who catamount and complained about how something did not work he was the guy who fix stuff you me to find who he prophetess and then find what your solution is and tin tar canning closure to that solutions ta bishop otherwise the problem is overwhelming and then you just want someone else to fix it for you on me you have the tract down where you can make a difference and get closer to thing less broken there was one other thing that made liny especially qualify to deal with the conspiracy theorists use to enjoy those theories and half the classic fun once this but sickness very fifty one nassifaking the moonlanding like what is the fun of it am it is spending your disbelief it is sitting down and watching siensfection w we an an looking at the foot if and it is it is just fun specially if there is no price to pay in your life in his now cost to that way of thinking that it is just the game sometimes he even listened to ales ones in his car and in fact just a month after the shootings when penny first saw those things on ales one's web sight he tried to reach out he founded general infowarsymal dress and shot him off this message ale ism very disappointed to see how many people are directing more anger at families that lost their children in newton accusing us of being actors have not we had our share of pain and suffering i used to enjoy listening to er shows now i feel that your type of show created these hateful people and hey need to be reeled in exclamation point about an hour later he hard back from one's staff and they responded with we have not supported the reactor clam we consisted its true event not this was not true ones did spread the crisis actor theory it was on his wed side at the time and he start talking about it a lot that see an an interview with veryneiqu he talked about it all the time such we have got bitty o mansion copper we have clear blow screen out there he is not there in the foursquare we have got people clearly coming out in in an laughing in the down the far crine we have clearly got people where each actors playing different parts of different people i we dotted tan dotingly there is a cover to there's actors the men i pulsating they ben caught line and the were pee planing before it an world out with it what penny wanted was a one on one conversation with ones but it did not happen there females after that asking me prove that ism really who i am and for of leading on t it get me mosh penny did not want that he is very private and very reserves a behind the scenes kind of gie he is careful when he talks things no commit that is off the record for do i had to talk about my personal life that came up all the time during our interview one of the groundrulls he gave is that i had to run his lots past him and his lawyer because he is worried about his own safety if his words for is construed also he is fighting some of the conspiracy thereon quirt we agreed to his terms and in the and he did not ask me to add it any of his quote but he did request that we remove one personal deetown and we did now a year and a half after he reached out to ales ones he decided to try t a new tactic he go directly to one's followers and he other sandy hook conspiracy theories i think he his approach was ism going to make them see the light this is veryneiq she an penny wreseparated when the shooting happens but were still a very much in each others lives they decided to start releasing documents about not report cards schoolphotos even disclosed the is deaths certificate which was a difficult decision that we made but figured after a while if providing this this hard copy convincing evidence that reason would prevail and they would say oh say ye you have made your pit it or to come around penny also decided he would answer any one's questions he wanted to join this notorious face book group called sandy hook hooks it swear lot of the deniers were congregating and sharing theories the cover photo on their page look it came straight out of a hour move a corpse girl with a keep quiet finger in front of her mouth the administrator of the face book group immediately let hymen did you identify yourself is i am a father a house y any wasn't stably to me it seems crazy to even go there this does not exactly sand a group of people who want a listen to you people who are conspiracy minded a see these tragedies unfold on the internet were on toleration they still feel separate from these events and i considered that a bridging that gap could be an important step at a human element to this right that is right and here i am i on the person and let let us see what happens the question started pouring en why were not these children rushed to hospitals my was not anything done weren't you going he know thaantease or won't ye doing this why was not rescue how after called from hertfrd and i started to recognize some of the patterns they were there there were the people you would expect in a conspiracy group ant i gun control people and i government people but also parents they were young parents with small children and they just could not wrap their minds around the reality that than indulged can look and children in their eyes and bullet into their heat they just cannot deal with that the conversation on the facet group quickly got ugly and abuses some of the members started using antisemitic firs let he was trying everything to keep up a report with them even told them i listened to ale ones in my car i used to argue with people about nine eleven being an inside job i entertain that we did not go to the moon but it did not work he started blocking people and fighting back this got him booted from the group what is remarkable is just how up for this whole fight he was when a bunch of people kept private messaging him penny thought what it'll to start my own facet group he called it conspiracy their a synonymous this name was men as a joke he has a dry sense of humor anyway he made some progress with people the people who were not full blown deniers who actually wanted help parking out the truth of what really happens but they dropped away once they got answers and pretty soon the only one's last were just dark sadistic trolls coming in to entertain themselves one of pennies worst trolls was a guinea wilfgang cabbage that is his real name by the way he is a retired school security expert for them his probably the number one new town hooks are in the world this guy travels to new town appeared is an expert on alecjonesis show he is even called for newton parents to exhume the bodies of their children to prove that their at how ten ordered a background check on money then sedan out in hemal to lots of people it was almost a hundred pages listen everything from his social security number and to number to almost every address he would never lived at with photos names of his relatives were included to the online harassment had become intents that leaning and very need and their two girls went into hiding they move been to spear ate high security gated communities but penny's address kept getting expose and hoaxes er started posting videos of where he lives one apartment that i had moved then to it'd only lived there i think for a month and i got a call from a particular hoaxer who happened to be in prison now for attempted murder and don he called me up and was acting a harass and then red me myselfsecurity number and then red me my address where i just moved think and i said won youknow i to department that much anyway and and i moved shortly after that to try and throw the hoaxers off penny started putting utility bills in different names and got multiple per boxes all over the place ball this force letting into a new battle strategy if they were on exposed him he do the same to them he wrote newspaper on bad cling out handbag an the others by name and when the hoaxers posted his new address as on line he did the same to them he also made it to that if you gurgled their names the first thing any one would see was all the sandy hood garbage they would created and deny being penny decided to write a biography about wolf gang habit's life called the hoax of a lifetime he really sis an you book penny became the one who knocks he calls is troll rustling tit is trolling the trolls he gets both energize and sheepish when talking about it he insists sometimes he only way to fight hard for hoaxers as i turn the tables on them and at worked on some of them free them out still penny was just one guide and every day new mountains of content about no overflowing up on line his crusade was a lonely one the hoaxers seemed dangerous this to the other new town parents wanted to stay as far away as possible from them and my darker moments the conspiracy part of me would return and ask myself and mi the only one that pushed a child why am i the only went fighting thank author's goon and people were trampling all over other peoples children memories and the children no longer had of wish to defend himself and beoplere u silent about it but while penny was escalating his tactics was the other side around the second anniversary of sandy hook a small group of conspiracy theorists made an almost three hour move on you tore questioning the shooting the described themselves as independent journalists and researchers but their backgrounds were totally random they included a magician the owner of a moving company a guy who been arrested for stabbing some one five times and to stay at home dad i just have an idea that i wanted to be and underground sill maker myself this is dug my guide he says he went this group on line on you to and got brought in at the end to help polish the move it felt exciting at the time dug was a struggling fill maker and lass angels occasionally did some stump work he got in to conspiracy theories the way lots of people to watching them on you to penny he loved the ones about big foot and you a foes but then he went to look up news about sandy hook and you toes recommendation system started suggesting hoax idiot he did not believe the theory that the kids were actors he thought children died but he felt pretty sure there was some other kind of cover up going on maybe one with the coffin and where did you get that in formation where did you come up with this idea of a mob had you run this somewhere a movers was i make move a i think i have an act of imagination well i am confuse the what was your thinking a family head done some one wrong my li say the move good fellows o a i henry hell is is hiding out an a little village is he the also mention kinnerverin cop when they release their film they uploaded it to a bunch of different accounts on places you tore visit daily motion pretty soon it was showing up everywhere to combat this penny had a changed tactics one final time no more talking to hoaxers one on on now the thing he would focus on was content removal scrubbing their stuff off the inner not he decided he was going to get every single copy of the me taken down which was not going to be easy he could not just writ into you to and say hey the radio was full of lives that was not on to be enough the inner net is full of lives he needed something else and he realized he had it the conspiracy therms had used photos and videos of him and and barney those were his property taking this move a copy wright violation the stolen images were now a useful we ten deny track down every place where the video was posted and he probably seen thus there is little button and click on to report stuff that is what he did for hours every day and success sorts the hoaxers kept reporting and moving the midi re on the other sides the crazies an to running the asylum it is it is the platforms who were allowing this to go on that solidifies it for me that we have to just remove all of this carriage and that is all we need to do but this of course pesto a lot of hoaxers we do not know what is going on we just now don't look right alit ones he was stumped penny had successfully forced the endower sight to remove pictures of not using copy right show furs trade this is amazing the clamant us penny prisoner they think because takin hold out some little change in hate we are shutting people's wat shit town because there be littering e memory the shelter no ere not but even if we wore you couldn't filing our first to moment because that is what a stere for tat you take all right you taken my right id can ones put one of the guides he

he lived in and the address my picked up his nail even held up some slight shots from gugorth lenningout this itiotaken down too fagging it for privacy bill signs but it did not matter the boxers had taken on a mob o mentality pursuing in harassing money this is an impiwarsman named lucky orchards who left multiple bathmats on money phone you had your mat very a a a ago the a ani your a ha a ant e re a ring or variety a a ha habit a ye a er but behind you et a er o she said look behind you death is coming to you real soon blenny was already living in hiding he would moved multiple times by then because hoaxers kept tracking down his address but now the chances that a hoaxer might show up at his door and kill him suddenly felt much higher his kids were living with hin half the week and he worried about them at the same time he did not consider stopping he did not think it would make them safer that is one of the misconceptions that exist that people think that i am only targeted because of challenging the content and that is not the case i took the action because i was being targeted f my addresses published all over the internet my photo is published all over the internet and my living children photos are published on lying that is existed before i did anything i dare not cause the targeting it was already there it's minimizing the targeting he posted receipts for firearms it'd asked if he actually bought them and he would not give me an answer and that all this penny kept up his daily ritual he would wake up m my coffee and then sit in front of his computer for hours flagging content trying to says thematically race not from the sandy hook hook story there is a lot of stuff he could invoke copy right law for let the death threats an harassment that was much harder to get taken down the tut companies were wary of becoming arbiters of truth making decisions about what its users could and could not say but penny and his usual methodical fashion kept chipping away on you too he kept a square card whence he nailed some one with three copy right strikes you two would remove their accounts he killed thousands of videos this way the hovers called this getting powered he become a hast then he and ferine help get a professor an florid named names track fired the sky at harass than for years and kept using know his image to promote his conspiracy theories he is also the one who help popular eyes the conspiracy term crisis actor on his blogright after the shooting and that woman who was leaving death threats lucky orchards penny reported her to the police and they arrested her she was sentence to five months in jail the judge rebuked her for going after penny saying quote this is a reality and there is no fiction there are no alternative facts he barred her from infolwars and that their conspiracy web sights is of of the conditions of her parole one surprising thing that happened over the years is that some of the hoaxers who used to harass penny flee to his side there were demands of them penny says these were people who came to him only after they change their own minds not people he tried to convert he says that never works it is a waste of time some of them became disenchanted when they saw sandy hook hoaxers who were more interested and photo shopping evidence and getting on line followers then tracking down the truth one

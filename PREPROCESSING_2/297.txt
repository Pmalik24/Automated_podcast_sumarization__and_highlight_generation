recon theater website was to twelve theaters during shakespeare's hamlet i ween productions of the play i hate hamlet when production of something caught hamlet dreams and one theater doing the dreadful and feared hamlet machine work tam would dits of his kind of a weird play the central character is in a situation that very few of us are ever going to find ourselves in his uncle killed his father and then married his mother in order to become the king the place for hours long the main conflict of the play is a guide debating in long complicated monologues whether or not he should kill somebody what is there in that for most of us to relate to why succors we happen to be murderers n what would the way be if it were actually performed by murderers another violent criminals what would they see that the rest of us do not what the day in our prom we answer that question and the answer is a wat i would the course of six months reporter jack hit visited prisoners at the missouri eastern correctional center it is a high security prison from the first rehearsal to their last performance a back five of shakespeare's hamlet were dividing our entire program today to the drama that he found there i pro hm to day act five we bring you what we believe is one of the most evocative productions of shakespeare done anywhere in two thousand to when he would have had a hard time getting tickets to is only performed in prison here is jack hit the first thing the hammy when i pass through the thick iron doors is a tiny black box called a screamer pull the courted tach an a falling of arm gars will sweep from all points of the prison and try to rescue me i keep in my pocket as i inter a huge yard with more than the thousand prisoners wanting round some of the finds are playing handball against walls some ere lifting waits as i walk across most or friendly a couple of the skin heads the arms dense with spider taxis narrow their eyes as i pass a cross the yard there is a big building a long corridor leads to a door marked education annex inside there is rounded one sixty eight were a small white haired woman ages willow is holding on editions for hamlet we a e to no ham a

black last room beneath inspirational slogans believe in yourself think positively the aspiring cast is half black half white and ranges from young lifers in their twenties to old timers in their fifties because it is against the rules to congregate an audience of fellows for the four hours it would take to perform the whole play ages is staged one act every six months starting in remember nineteen ninety nine to night is the first greed through at five the final bloody climax many then made here never finished high school and all the had known of shakespeare was the phrase to be or not to be to night the adhering some of the other famous speeches for the first time pestilence on him for a mad huge rogue rogue he pored a back wagon a flagon of relish relish on my head once the same sculls sir was sure boric skull the king's gesture let bore your i knew him radio the fellow's infinite just of most excellent fancy he have bore me on his back a thousands i must reethris with any class or terrible or this one is terrible do the actors know it but they plough on through the script and in mat name pal who serves is ages as assistant director explains why first two reacts at too there s nowhere is no way when to get this sang down an go the live performance in e was soliloqually to pass on tethers no no this is is impossible but well end in here i guys s from perform in in here at done time again was the it'll beta it will working the local critics agreed with pal the act four performance to review in the saint of his paper the actors were said to be commanding and compelling but the entire performance the review road a four hundred year old text is restored to freshness it seemed hard to imagine en have seen hamlet a dozen times have seemed have inclined to it at the public theatre i saw the famous dined minor version three nights in a row ages sort in ma bergmans production don a bookman performed entirely in sweetish what else is said to learn from watching another hamlet s but the truth is this production was different because this is apply about a man pondering a violent crime in hits consequences performed by violent criminals living out those consequences after hanging out with this group of convicted actors for six months i did dis cover something i did not know anything about him remember how it starts hamlet sees his father's ghost who explains he was murdered by colaudius hamlet us uncle the ghost command hamlet to avenge his death by killing ladies the play is basically hamlet pondering this single terrific action and whether he can be the man to do it to be or not to be these days when people say the name hamlet it is usually just to metaphor shorthand for somebody who was afraid to altho dithers and thinks to much we on must forget just what action hamlet was contemplating these actors have not forgotten the name is hamlet johns and i thirty six years old i here for two first three assaults a play hamlet when you're on stage doing hamlet what do you draw upon in your own experience to make the the character come to life the idea of wanting to heard someone i have experience hurting on not to know to to the one of their in their life may be in danger i was very confused an angry person on and it es palate into me shooting a two people and leaving them for did oh my name is cries arris on thirty right years old and i play the fourth character of hamlet let me explain something the character of hamlet is played by four people they are all on stage at the same time taking turns delivering the lines ages tod this partly to give more actors speaking rolls and not sale any one man with all that dialogue but is theater it works hamlets roll is full of long soliloquies and rhetorical asides this small gang of hamlets which mutters to itself and laughs at its own jokes nicely captures that fractured quality of hamlet us different personalities and it is also bonded the four actors together they call themselves the hamlets and constantly talk about their character to chis it seems hamlet is just the fifth guy in their odd clear another criminal with a complicated past we put in terms of you are two thousands will be have as an upper middle class youngster nineteen twenty years old who calls smell will to do family they will not quite a bit of land o the people in a small town respect i a level and a is uncle a murder this father and is now married to his mother i mean all kinds of serious as i all kinds christen the hamlets practice alone most days finding time when the four can just get together by themselves as tough when this always a thous and inmates around they do it where they can on every sundae after the noon meal the florist will assemble will have our little gray hamlet books and we will pose down to the track and if you are simply walking bye which you'd probably here is you would hear this chatter of somebody given their lines clearly the rest of us with our heads down in the books walking the line now there are there are people because there are benches that are all throughout the inside of the track there are people actually watch us you will hear this old english style speech in all oh whole ratio and these people i o what one of the problems of doing any play in prison is it being a good actor is the exact emotional opposite of what it takes to be a successful inmate rather then close off all feeling and looked tour you have to open your vulnerableself up and withstand often cruel laughter you try to find some authentic commotion within you an this way a level four high security prison is no different from high school and most of the inmates who addition for ages tend to be factory people the theater types of pros on back in nineteen ninety nine he just had to put up with abuse from the bigger meaner in mates but that changed fact a lot changed after ages cast the roll of hamlet us best friend my name is drink big hutch hutches i play o radio the solar you might be surprised to learn that derrick big hutch hutches is big he has a smooth bawled skull and hooted threatening eyes the candy other if he met him you might think he is probably serving a hundred and twenty years for arm robberies and that would be correct hutch is not the rest of the cast and he is the first person to tell you in prison you got his howwalk he sit listen that's come paid to thees you got the minors and you got to kill a was in old bean lows kill a we is to which are you big hutch ism the blue way the mean i control to kill a was and i can up do minds if i wo and i mean as i dis mostly guys in hem the minnows i mean i do not know n ye would assubsiate with hm last heap play say the killer wall verses the copies and where i gopisand his the killer well that is him who plays ostrich and as a minnow slash copy his take is a little different an darling wat an individual a killer well lit that is a lot if eight in for ham as a lo shell the guy seen own he are are i now see the guys hat coming to hamlet seeing how he has an acting at and the seriousness and he takes he is not what his person as in other words he is an actor but big hutch is also a critic his criticism is sharp and extends to place his most actors a void his own character ratio i think his chump for real it thin s who i me pol to be cool with hamlet the best far wit i than a dragons just some ma a sounding boy for hame i mean a majority of his lies is a my lord yes my old i mean i we afraid we do not communicate better to night i mean you go not them you'll deep as secrets i will not know what you in a feel you dey la i i bell he should ha ben a sow me did ism truly mess for e downy to get town heir a five and ism get really drink a cup of paws an i you stop men i mean know down alive and that ism really you front in n have you never heard anybody talk about shakespeare's characters this way hutch was always doing this talking tough but then betraying a real gift for literary criticism call it his inner minnow in fact he pointed out a weakness in the structure the story it'd never heard before an all my experience with the play that hamlets dilemma over killing plaudits is not really much of a dilemma do not see to comply i do not see whet hall is dealing with man i oh i should kill a cheer now i soon kill him now o dance your father see re yes and you knew use got duty who was the to about do i mean same way i could not see somebody rain my daughters som a just seen run no no no no no i got to do you man and hat's just you don't he lit to ham his old mind to are there no reason s to delay taken swift action even if you are convinced that you have been wrong hen that is why he stays is to play within the play right to make sure the cloudy assist the bad gay see dive when we got to go back now f ism strong enough to believe in goes i did ism strong enough believe wit the got to all me om strong enough to belie you e gold did ism true as what happen we you once much get on this if he kept going ten mark to prison hamlet tells roman crantsnack too and i says you could do a version of the play that takes this central meteor literally all the characters in the play or types he seen the yard every day the claudiusis will do anything for the emblems of power money drugs high intend shoes polaniusas who kiss up to the power for rosin chanson gildersterns rob a chance is o o man ministration push i to the just gives i mill he got you rat and in hutch's version he solves the play structural problem fabricating a true dilemma for hamlet by giving him good reasons to kill ladies and not to kill him just away would happen claudyis she will dis guy her cause guy ad the biggest do not bend is imprison the sell go not yowl be some sissy you find him i way privy but to got y keel be hemmed his broke now been in the prison world he must doll been that a but he got a girl to to you only got if

get into something else that open that did of eyes into getting to reading civil plain frost and and whys wort for different other people o everybody had powerful answers for why they were in the play one guide with a third great education level said that he was surprised to find out that he was not stupid just in educated and for almost all of them acting was beside the point but one an make a bit

brother of a feeling for the first few acts rarities was played by an homage petiole that is another story but the amiss petafoguad transferred and it is almost legend in the prison now something out of forty second street names word stepped into the roll he created a sensation among the cast when they realized what a really forceful performance could do for a character word made a lasting impression even on the killer wail you come along in a for and you get just god have word the words play lefty he was e was it spell when he was more than the devil feel you wo we fool he made his

questions and answers many people was man you was good have you done this before you'd to do this more you'd to continue this and that feeling for me was is it was one the best things have ever fell it was the it was the day my daughter was borne and it made me ant to be better and i jest an act o me it just opened up a whole world from man if i apply myself i can pretty much do what ever i wo oh

talked about acting that way too party's emotions and the final act dollar coaster from grief to fury to shameful regret pull it off word channel's clarity's character in a way that should make any method actor cringe with jealousy coming in to act for he was very and violently and and i can i identify it that and i can place tat roll very well because have been playing that r or all my life us

gun in somebody is face this a unfair advantage unless ta cowardly at that is what criminals or we are cowards when we are criminals we are cowards do you feel you can molarities because much ofiliarities is inside names word y am there it seen am am coming out what the ghost of hamlet us father can teach you about murder in a minute mchicaco public ratio when our program continues it is his america life am my re glass if he just turning in what were doing to day is that were devoting our host to jack hit's story from the missouri eastern correctional center wherever the course of six months jack watch prisoners rehearse and stage act five of hamlet again heres jack as the performance they grew closer an i spoke to more more of the actors it became clear that each actor used to pass and then psychological ways to understand his part all the hamlet saw themselves in their version of the done and edger would stop me in the hall to tell me that he thought evil king radius had some redeeming qualities but for one actor the relationship was even more complicated he used his part tell understand has pass my name is nanny wallet i forty four years old the character that have played was the ghost of hamlet us father the reason i chose that a when i first read the the script the words jumped out at me and they made me feel things that i have not felt before what what what in your what in your experience drew you to those particular words a i took a man's life and a i felt he was talking to me through that that he a he wanted me to know what i put him through a i am thy father's spirit doomed for a certain term to walk to night and for the day can fine fasten fires till the foul crimes done o my days of nature a burnt purged away but that i am forbid to tell the secrets in my prison house i could talk on fold whose lightest words would burrow up thy soul freeze thy you good and make thy two times stars start from the sphere there is one other spot the ghost this thus was i sleeping my brother's hand of life of crown of queen it once dispatched cut off even in the blossoms in my sin no reckoning mad but sent to my account shall my imperfections on my head and the it was pretty much the same way with him he he was ho was si taken before his time so when when you read the character are you do you feel am who talking when you say those lines ism ism the body up there a but the words or coming from mostly a e willing pride the the man that i will he he is he is mostly the one to where is not much defense between the actor and the word as you get with an actor who puts his or heard training between the two these guides call it they see it and it is true it is just dead true that is ages the director besides putting on plays the missouri muster in congressional in her visiting room she is mounted chows on more familiar stages the claimed actor studio in new york the picture festive once factorage and the eugenaneal theater sent in connecticat after becoming e artistic director of the new theater in saint louis she started an outreach program to take professional actors doing dramatic works by writers don fellow and performed them before prison audiences in time the prisoners became the actors and in more time the side project took over her entire theatre company now this is what she does directing prisoners who may not have the chaps of professional actors but have an intimacy with the material that does not exist anywhere else when ladies is in the chapel and speaks about his sin and his regret and is ability to undo it it broke my heart because the man playing it felt all of this things fully and minnow i know these guides have deep regret but it was palpable the audience was stoned you could hear a raindrop and that was especially true with the in made audience he says o my offense is rank it smells to heaven if had the primal eldest cesipime o is i rather on harder a bothers m afraid can i not break it to not the w

engages hell angels may gassy a staggering me and what ass being as deal he half a see o the to my bay all may be well ear would not tell me is crime although i found myself playing a constant guess ant game with all of them about this that would not discuss the past that was then they said this is now but i had to know one morning instead of visiting i went to down town saint louis not far from the arch and sat in a records depository reading of case files it was more horrible than i thought one guy i particularly shot a man in the head twice and point blank range another of my new friends raped his pubescent daughter and impregnating her later there was an abortion another friend grabbed a man getting out of a car put a gun to his chest during a robbery and pulled the trigger others had sought of my children younger children the age of my own children i did not fall asleep for a long time in my frigid remora in room it three in the morning i had one of those cinematic nightmares i dreamed that a very good friend of mine and editor a magazine had me over to dinner she got angry with some one else there pulled out a gun and plucked him twice right in the face then she asked me not to talk about it with anybody i panic and the next thing i knew i was sitting up in my hotel bed panting a sprinter it did not take frond to fig to what it meant some one i knew when was a murderer i wanted to talk to the cast about this but i was anxious i know the sense crazy but i was afraid i might hurt their feelings i felt they had betrayed me but strangely i felt that i had betrayed them too there was only one day left to talk just before the final performance before curtain i asked brat to sit down with me i could barely said out my question we came in here three months ago or five months ago i met yell for the first time as is actors and yesterday we decided to go down to city hall and read everybody's record and we read everybody's record and and i have to say

see what i could do as far as go into the house my lie it was a hard question for any of them to answer they all said the same thing but ism the my now ism not that guy are we for ever the prisoner of our actions to good question it was hamlet us question and it is the unresolvable conflict in our penal system why do we put people in jail to rehabilitate them and restore them to our company or to punish them regardless of how much they might change one cannot hold both these ideas in one's mind simultaneously that is why our prison debates on t v and in congress a vehement and incoherent the two sides cannot be squared by mere politics they cannot even be squared by the people at the center of the debate here is nanny when i when i first o got the sentence i did ya i it'll it'll go ahead just die in here cause i do not deserve to be out there the way i am no i was thirteen fourteen years ago and a but a person changes ism no longer the criminal i used to be i know that i will not do

tho really respond to the motion an anemia's funeral march rarities is the last morning humming at the side of the grave tossing rose petals on it right away the action picks up the hamlets appeal taunting rarities about the sincerity of his grief they quarrel and exchange insults a duels proposed which culminates in the last sword fight scene er most directors blocked is scene as a professional fencing match ages has it looking a knife fight in an alley the audience totally gets it gorge holds his arms slightly out from his sides his hand dripping his sword he would a shiv he and one of the hamlets are circling each other thugs gorge jerks his shoulders forward a pure back alley faint a fake movement to intimidate his opponent something all of them a probably scene right

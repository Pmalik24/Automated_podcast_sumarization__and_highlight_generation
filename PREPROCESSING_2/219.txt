i is many people who have films that they have watched over and over and i have never really got that i was fee there is many films that i have not seen why would i watch one again but we get to these conversations and there always comes a moment where ism asked hell what is the film that you have seen the most and then i have to admit it is the besides adventure which i know is not a good film it is this seventy's move about an ocean liner that gets it by i sonar flips upside down and the passengers tried to make their way to safety it is part of an entire jonrof films disaster films that v never gotten any respect nobody thinks of these films as a it but i loved it at the time when i so it it felt big and i felt important and serious an i remember it was very of emotional and the reason that i saw it many times that this is the film that i saw more than any other was not cause i loved the film itscause o where i saw it is on vacation we did not take many vacations when i was a kid but on one of them we stated at this hotel an flared were the rooms had this thing where they offered a couple movies all day long anything's is long ago and the nineteen seventies my sisters and i we had never seen anything that even cable t v was rear back that but beside an indenture with the film that they offered and my sister crew and i we eat it up that was the iffy we watch over and over again yo as o this was a very importantving that are and ears in zap my nephew who we tried to explain this percent my we entered up watching it on t v at night if our parents one ut to dinner or if ere was a rainy day yet we loved it the way that i remember it is that is that the hotel just had this move on a loop and it would just as soon as it would finish it would start again and the way i remember it is that every time we would come into the hotel room you could turn on the t v and you would be someone in the beside conjecture et sounds vaguely familiar to me i do not totally remember that but that might be right y and i remember it having a lot of feeling do youemember it having lot of feeling what does it mean having a lot of feeling lit every meting yells a lot of emotions ye wit carry and you really invested in their journey to escape alive i do not think ism getting anything way by saying that sort a here the raider she these last three weeks have ben talking about the random films that people have strong attachments to thinking that might be a good episode the shell and i started to think by the besides adventure an i wondered what it would be to see it again would it have any feeling what any of it feel the way it did to me as a kid would be away to care my sister and i we watched it and i invited zap to since he is the age that we were when we watched it back in seventies he is to thirteen i was fourteen at the time carat was eleven and i when is there i did not expect exact to it he does not i lot of films and right away very foreseen let us know the kind of film we were in for i a little boy visits the bridge of the assess boson this ocean liner in the middle of a big storm and the w boy is greeted by the captain who is played by maser nelson who at this point had not made the career transition to parody characters this captor so as lo o i a go on on li en i we s on line what mind does lines si as i did not remember how winced the acting got some places when anis lorgnon shows at it is care that the nineteen fifty six so one of her best actor is not i one of his best rolls of he angry organ does seem to shout nearly every one of his lines in the film when they have got a done me and i did not expect seen the om again was how much of the dialogue i remember from decades to go and vas all surprised realize an i do not know what this as about me the lines that i remember the most i the little comic zingers i when a remember is ask to he is married i know his corny response for he says it no marriage for me missus rose i got a mistress la the see es thenhny i did remember and remember liking from the film was it this is an old fashion enough move the producers tried to insert some big ideas into the adventure all means hes big ideas are provided by gene hackman who play a rebellious young priest in turtle make his big theological idea is a very conveniently helpful one for e we were about to be capsized in mover the ocean god does not want you to wait for miracles yet to take matters into your own hands do not rat to god its a your broke s from a sermon delivers early in the film at the does the quite for yourself got wat a sol wat witters not quitters i you cannot a at we try away he comes back to this over and over through the film rolling the passengers to fight arm i loved that is than nature that there was this ideal is to guy with this principal that he trying to live by and this idea about god that the film is tasting and i have to say seeing it to day i still loved it that the put that end there my mi he soon enough read at the struck of midnight on new years eve the venom hits the boat flits the plot tit n the wreckage of the upside down i es party tin hacking cons es on e it passengers that they should not stay in win to god to send rescuers a clime with him the safety please got the prep from back to back very escaping the rising waters they go the ceilings of the rooms

give been really in vest yours mess sort rid you do feel very invested yet an slake in long hermits can a happen nights unlike most other louis i wondered if zap was con to feel the same big feelings that i felt for the film at his age and til we did e wells o dons no o hedges to no the for close no by the time get sing a on i clip tactic speech to god s g i i you it's clear the beside an venture it does its job it gets to you but thin he by the experience tat zap had watching the film and the one that i was having it is different right for me it was walking into a room for my child toast home and finding it in tat and exactly how i remembered it or we weld get to a scene and i would remember things didn't realize i remember is reading a ne am for that we watch i moving together we think we are watching the same thing but we are not for me the beside an indentures in portal back to that vacation and being in that hotel rum with care and knowing those move stars from other things they made in just that whole time in my live i cannot those act that move don't by easy chico is this america life ism mire a glass to day on you program after months of pandemic when many of us ha been staying home and seeing way more movies than usual we thought he would our so let us do a move night a show about moves and in particular decided to get people who watched a film over and over we see something in it most people do not see films tor which they are an audience of one including somebody went to keep with the feeling line in somebody watched ta classic gidsfilm over and over a film that many of us have seen she loved it and only learn years later is in a dull that which he'd seem was only the first half of the film stay with us that on putting the ease and disease back when t pandemic for took hold to o people were watching or re watching the move contagion which we only came out in two thousand eleven if you have seen it it is about a deadly and fast spreading virus that is spread by respiratory droplets goes around the world governments fail to contain it and i think we watch films that or read books about the nineteen eighteen fly cause hes at t is just scratches this itch we we just one sum way to think about what we are going through right now and is nicety just see somebody else go through some version of it one of our producers shank has never seen contain but he found himself turning to this other move moving by to virus you probably have not heard of it is a very different seen on the subject youthen you will not find this move on net legs or you to or anywhere that at least i could not find it that way i finally had to order a d v d from an online vintage move store in's clear my copy was pirated off cable skips lot and all of the contagion geeks i was floored by some of the parallels to now especially given that the move came out in nineteen sixty eight more than half a century ago for instance in this move instead of a bat the vector of the virus is a bird a two can that is stowed away aboard a green freighter somewhere near central america then the boat docks in new york harbor for inspection and the first mate alerts the military that a lot of the three was said o a a a on a a a o a a a a i a a a you a a conned tan o o o o a i a a the two can is still on board held in a makeshift chicken wire fence but then it gets loose lies straight into the city and starts infecting people just a few at first the mayor of new york an empty so motivated mostly by money and pull numbers holds a press conferencvyspeaking into a

law an order and also courting segregationists and given all that you might ask what is bad about feeling good which is what the mayor in the move wanted to know in one of the first crisis management

just that their back together the cityspuws the valine into the air by a factory chimneys and exhaust pipes and most of new york lives miserably evert but some people stay pleasant and uplifted because major lock twist fifty per cent of the people who seem to be infected actually never got the virus in the first place the joy just rubbed off on them and lie was one of those people which is why she did not get quoting quote better in the hotel room which is actually the moral of the move that happiness is a choice but watching the move during this pandemic i drew another darker conclusion somehow that willy weird jolt of recognition i got over and over again what it felt was this is how it goes when face with ha crisis this governments will minimize the severity of the danger the value the wrong things the focus on the economy over people's lives and blame foreigners in an ugly zinaphobic way ism sure there is version of america where all that might not happen but we are not living in that america right now and pet and lie were not living in it either if it is possible for human beings to do the wrong thing we will figure out away we are resourceful that n con to is one of produces of or show coming ought five o'clock somewhere at it what's online they're asking when is five o'clock here does that really mean five o'clock that is in minute kagobobagradio wen our program continues ten march m a gas to day's program audience of one strays by people watching movies and watching some other things to and seeing something in them that other people do not we

been kalhoun described one that he found pretty mesmerizing it concerns cane west as a you probably know canniest is when for president he is not on the ballot and enough states to actually win the presidency but is n some key battleground states including wisconsin course a celebrity on the ballot while we sipphenoff at least som votes in witsconsin both parties are scrounging for any little pocket of votes that they can get cause as you may recall in twenty sixteen down trump one is cousin by just twenty three thousand votes out of two point eight million cast any city wedge of votes could possibly make the difference and determine who wants the state this time which brings is to the video bens cur is this five and half our video is of the wisconsin elections commission deciding whether cane west we get to appear on the states ball at nonmember wisconsin my home state it is a lotto places if your cane west or any one who is not for a major party you got a collect a certain number of signatures to get on the ballet in cane west case a company flew in canvases who started circulating petitions just one day before the signatures would have to be turned in to state elections officials at five p m they collect and collect next day comes tuesday august forth and we arrive at the dead line five p m the tiny moment cradled between four fifty nine and five o one the speck on the surface of america history but one that would spiderallout into marathon political debate a name ancon in sere the was sons in election's commission we are here for a special meeting here we are a couple weeks laterite thursday after eye was cousin election's commission gets together to decide about kicking city west off the wisconsin ballad here the setting at one that is familiar to a at of people now assume mister spindle here mister common here the camera toggles between the six commissioners there three republicans three democrats occasionally it flips to some of the staff a meeting running a show for an jacobus was the commission here the democrat jacobus gets right down to business challenge to west petitions here we a lawyer on each side to first of the representing the challengers the folks tried to bump west off the ballad there is a lawyer named eff man dell he looks a little a young john famvreu ere the actor answered poster mandible appears in what looks a cosy spot in his house think you very much may it place the commission the nomination papers submitted on behalf of mister wanton is taller on timely they were filed after five p m statute eight point twenty subdivision eight section a m says the nomination papers must be filed not later than five p m that is a very legal way to say lest was little him ottoman attorney for his campaign tithe woman name lain ruin she rolled up to the building in an ethene moments before five she shuffled papers around in her dash word and then rush i as a t b setscrew filmed ears mere and mantel leads all this out with the punching swagger of a prosecutor on a capital murder case when really he is just talking about a lawyer wagon through a door by her own admission attorney ruin twas in her car at for fifty nine p m that is in paragraph six of her affidavit on page nine twenty eight of the commission materials is ruined exist her car couple of seconds after five o'clock you can see that in exhibit a to the reporter affidavit at three minutes and four seconds in the did m what follows uses the bruter film style reconstruction of this whole scene at the front door of the wisconsin election's commission the moment when west lawyer rushed in with petitions eighteen mandible his stitched all this together from affidavit o to new story an a video from a democratic party operative it is who filmed all this including a shot of his apple watch for a time stay is ruined entered the building no earlier than fourteen seconds after fie o'clock her college followed eight or nine seconds later with the bulk of the papers that left them no more than thirty six seconds to walk the length of the first floor to wait for the elevator to ride for the third floor to wait for the door her to open to walk to the maindesk of the commission and to transfer the papers to the five officer that cannot happen in thirty seven seconds the staff member reaches that conclusion on page fifteen the papers were in the elevator and not in the filing clicks possession at five or one maybe you have seen stories about how republican finger prints are all over city west nebulas presidential campaign awaythete was no attempt to hide them in wasconsin the company that hired the canvassers who got west signatures it is reportedly run by a republican operative it did the same thing for him in oho west virgin arkinsa lean ruin the lawyer who dropped off his petitions in wisconsin these to work performer republican governors cot walker and the republican party of wisconsin the rest only represented the turn campaign and lost to when a the lucky journal sentinel human to who is listed on west paper work it found one republican actors and operative after another black officials in milky have accuse republicans of helping west candidate as a cynical and insulting attempt to divert black voters away from jordan to aid donate trump is canton republicans having admitted that he have also conspicuously not denying in asked about the republican attorney who submitted west paper work a get pe spokes woman told the newspaper quest it appears that kind west made a smart decision by hiring an experience the section of turnoback to the meeting the attorney trying to knock west off the ballad goes through several other prognencs with west petitions and then it is time for the tenement response from the west campaign you may begin your times targe i thank you good afternoon man carry techs commission staff n love o council representing the west campaign its not the lawyer who filed the petitions but a lawyer name mi can current guess he looks unnervingly billionaire mark cuba and he appears unfortunately backlit his face shades and kind hard to see i when he gets started attorney current makes but i supposes the argument tat he haskternanthat walking in fourteen seconds pass the five o'clock deadline as that is not actually lateen when we are talking about tintypes no later than includes the time framed the referee thevereuses for example no later than tuesday tit is not me prior to tuesday no later than tuesday means all tuesday and to make five pan fort o court late the proper language would be e four five him for prior to find yet or not later than for if the nice him but no later than five him does not include the get four minutes the question the wester lawyer is posing in a you is five o'clock a point in time ant or is five o'clock all the space between four fifty nine and five or one tit is not actually such a bad question happily fifteenth as the talk dead line he get all day on the fifteenth five right the next clock to his happens when the first republican takes his turn asking questions of tho two lawyers that is a republicanize been to nelson he is a former state lawmaker is a veterinary anime tonewsan sitting in front of this folksy painting that makes it feel he might be in the waiting room of his veterinary practice and he is noticeably skeptical of the west campaign's atturneynin five o'clock it's five o'clock i i understand your time to make an argument the five o'clock at five or won but it just seems to me that everything that starts with the for is in four or five o'clock and five o'clock for deadline maybe ism just time and since o not a lawyer but that shed seen e turned turn if you seven time or on your fall the go off at five o'clock when would it go off it should go off at five o'clock shark as soon as the clock turn to five five s terms euros euros hero on yes f a we at seven time or a good at five would the papers have been in on time or not but the first response we be that is for the living offsearh to becharmed but to dance your question directly i but if conuwsan does not seem to be towing the party line the next republican commissioner to ask questions he seems more than ready to do the opposite we a a it is your for o thank you in camera commissioner robot spindle he looks here being held captive in a sup lie room somewhere his against this white wall that has nothing on it inn mam pretty quickly he goes really big on the west campaign's argument that five o'clock means you have right up an tail final wont you know on your point about i a just five o'clock five o'clock i de a lot of a my an try an to flip something and there is no real e felt of act over the next few minutes spinal makes a member of creative arguments trying to help the china west lawyer thing yes like he says since the petitions entered the building at five o'clock and fourteen second well fourteen seconds since less than half a minute that really rounds back down to five plan sharp bray the man hat's just something ma in in around a round you ti fears sos panel also questions whether the lest campaign tanks actually had to turn in the petitions in order for the petitions to be turned in as y under stand these in er sustain got on the elevator a were the staff person just the three on i which you back tho sit of the tat could be stamps fer a a a documents it that time the once the door close to the alley to be clear spindle is contending that being in the elevator vet the staff member and not handing the staff remember the dimes is the same as being in the office and physically turning the men can i say there is something about how the action of all this plays out on zoom with all the normals whole interruptions it feels intimate one commissioner keeps dropping off the call at one point there is a cat but the pops into a frame next to a commissioner asking questions and also when people go at each other it feels more personal somehow because you just see them and they are in their homes and jacobus the chair a few times she gets in to it a spindle and you see her and what i think is her living room she is wearing pearls and she sitting in front of a fireplace and what looks a silver tease eye it is way less a debate in some random government building or whatever and more family members getting in a fight on the pone or something i to make for her member i do at you can you like think at since i i to make a femme emotion that we motion at i a i that is that i good i sir no just wait but i still have been got into the most memorable parts of a spindle specifying he started when he talked about covet which you sir i e gree the the pandemic was made why and everything else much harder yes the situation this were the ban day makes things harder and ere everything else there is great efforts to in yelechin process is to try and make the proceeds our laser for all offs then you are win younger the we e should try and make it love user spindle's essentially making in argument that democracy takes more time wearing a pandemic and people should get more time to do san with somebody which mam that is just pa spindle for a second here because the wisconsin go p has systematically staked out positions to do the opposite this year wisconstin conservatives hae fought the idea of giving more time for early voting an absentee voting in aril republicans also made it very clear that they opposed postponing an election do to covet including robot spindle who said bovid was no reason to postpone and election still spender had one more argument ten caps an damn raps which is which is the people o bringing the a challenge i my mi worsen why they gain stops question the back f a her they wish to take away for wet by population on opportunity to take a black was the manual canoe the the gal yo tub choice us o who they want not for an all whats labs terns of try o expressly the black choice this is where the meeting truly bent my mound as if it would make sense for democrats to suppress black voters nationally eighty seven present of them identify as democrats i could not help but think watching this that here we are in the throes of the sirenic elections i go one in which lots of people on both sides argue that the people on the other side there out to destroy the country it feels huge it is we are to think that the legitimacy of the election process over the coming weeks well hinge on what happens in many rooms this in tiny screens this wit public servants and volunteers and campaign workers will be wrestling over rules and dead lines and signatures and postmarks this video it is actually kind of a near preview and honestly i think will be lucky if it looks this meeting absurd is a got at times i respect this much these commissioners are paid a little over a hundred dollars a meeting after we hundreds of pages of documents to prepare for this and they went around and round and round splitting this fourteen second hair every which way for the vast majority of the time people were thoughtful and they were willing to step across party lines if that is what they had to do to get to what they thought was fair mostly they seems they were trying to do what was right and in the end a very simple argument not out the was precedent now lots of many people had missed dead lines in the passing whether by lot or little they just could not accept it i thought i the motion is carried five to one and just that an kind west was off full wisconsin ballet the remainder of this video is worth mentioning if unjust give me one more minute here it'll sum it up for you will city west campaign made the headlines the next day the wisconsin elections commission also made another decision that night one with the power to affect the outcome of the presidential race also on the agenda that evening was a challenge seeking to bump the green party candidates off the ballet on something that is really pretty technical see during is convince signature collection period the v p candidate for the green party seems to have moved her address at the beginning it does not matcher paper work at the end re publicans were that is in the picky b s but the democrats would not budge and the end result the green party was gone just west remove from the ballet and you do not have to look far to see the enormous stakes of that decision you remember how in twenty sixteen donate trump one wisconsin by twenty three thousand lots that year the green party candidate jostling she got thirty one thousand lots and was cons bancahen is one of prices of show after this meeting the condo west campaign in the green party candidates both so the was constant elections commission trying to get on the allay the great party went to the statesprane quiet and lost no green party and the gonna west campaign's lost suit a judge also rode now judge johns okay give final word on the debate overtime meaning of time and has written decision quit the court believes at the cameo grandfather back rings out five times is the moment it is f p what us now it you midnight there is significant difference between eleven fifty nine fifty nine pi and one second after midnight the passage of a second after midnight e first an entirely new day other words quit the sort finds o basically five o'clock is five o'clock a three many thing she ought to understand what a producers dial wo spend most of e life thinking that she did not have a uniqueand personal take on the film the sound of music e sound o music after all if ready loves it what is her to say and then you or now her time is very different i watched the sound of music all the time as it kid it was one of maybe six w chess tapes we had at home along with baby an hundred ondelmacions and a few years ago i was talking with ha friend about how much i loved the maybe going up and he said me too though the not sea scared me and i said what not sense and that is when i learned it'd never seen the second half of the film it turns out the my came out in a two v cs bock set and i for stories and had only ever seen the first tape my dad does not remember a seconder and why would you need one the first half makes perfect sense on it som here is the lock it is a move about a woman name maria who was sent to the country side to baby sat a giant family of children with ta mean dad the on traps maria shows up bubbly fun and teaches them to sing and play and befall against the wishes of her father but the singing whence i over they sing together as a family and finally at a party the kid sing a beautiful song for the guests farewell and after that maria having successfully fix the family laves just many popinstid when she fixed that family and that is the end of the move i had very clear fine memories of the goat heard puppet show and the seen an the gazebo were lease the oldest daughter secretly met with the male man she was in love with and they sang and danced and it was romantic i had no further questions about any of the characters when i learned that there were seventy more minutes to the film i did not bother going to look for them the sound of music was a full complete and wonderful artifact from my childhood i don't want a taint it with not sense but when my checker lend who is producing the week show and is a musical theater fan which i most definitely am not when she found out i still had not seen the whole thing it seemed heretical to her she could not let it stand we watched it together over the inner net one sundae afternoon and i prepared to have a childhood memory either slightly enhanced or completely ruined before we started she had me predict what was going to be in the second half a why base sot and this is based on my childhood memory and just what i would to see is it is the second half is just focus thin my favorite two characters lease and the hot man man i want to see their court ship and and then they get married and that the end of that the move we had play and started at the very beginning started with a parting now and the first half was more or less the simple sunny move i remembered seeing the kindly and dower none come on screen early on was recognizing teachers i had in elementary school refer not shestevery i simply can't in are there is that gaze rosin when the male man and lease sing to each other in six the i in seventy i oi i then whirl around the gazebo dancing oi a the still let six mu i watching now though i saw a lot of things that i had completely missed as a kid because as a child it'd apparently ignored anything that adults who were not maria said to each other literally none of that dialogue registered was the mumbly grown up sin charge around my kid self had edited full characters out of the film i barely remembered the baroness who wants to marry the dad this really is exciting mommy gale be here with you tree word to so confutable that is not what i mead you do it any of their hotlines that were not resolved in the first half but i also miss of course how maria in the dad supposedly fall in love the dad by the way was even meaner than i remember just cruel to maria o what e true ha o bus on win try but at an had anon ocean because of that i still had a lot of troubles squaring the idea that anything between the two of them was remotely remanded he thinks she can half with you but that is not try all they really spell it out body you you must get all a surly you have noticed the way he looks into give and you blashdin i time en yo a i just the one romance that still sparkled was between level in the mail man tho watching again i have to say the mailman was not as cute as i remembered it is the man mad o he candles lice an mats rape the man man comes back later in the first half to throw rocks on weasel's window that moment i remember again dreamy but the one that followed was completely over my head as a kid i in see i man it did not not your his idler all hitter ye hill hitter the hero of my version of the sound of music who it'd hoped the second half would center around he was the noisy also not the man man yes he was wearing a uniform and delivering messages but he was not employed by the postal serves as my childself had understood he was some kind of military messenger the first half is peppered with a humor since this that things are going to take a turn historically in the second half of the move uneasy talk about austria flags and something called an unsure but all against the backdrop of a glamorous party the kind of easy to miss if you are seven the last thing i missed as a kid the big title card that says intermission in yellow script that comes on screen after maria closes the door maybe was on a second bagels lend and i fast forward through the music at intermission and the second have stats i daddy a is class i si eerie for yo a this really beard you haunting an is fie is sept does the second half starts i suddenly feel i have seen all of this watching the children playbill on their backyard felt strangely familiar six it'd spent much time already was anon traps at their home that this new scene just felt part of my memories this confusing dajavo sticks with me all the way through the scenes of maria back at the abbey it is not until the dad goes to meet maria at the gazebo and declare his love for her that i am certain i have never seen this before you know what a o to loving you a not of either when you settle the continuous on to coat i knew the fist time you beentcity issue o my guide ma this is grouse they basically just stared at each other three times an maria was letting this horrible man marry her i could not believe just as ism settling in to the newness of the second half locking at more is wedding dress everything in the move shifts the knots sees roll into town it is incredibly abrupt he cut from literal wedding bells to a bell toying over a giant spastic a flag on the town square finds of soldiers march across the plaza ominously the collars seem to drain out of the my the children show up next in drab brown close against the tony back drop instead of their perky curtain outfits from the first talk the characters meanwhile are dealing with their own with flash rape surprises lease as she is getting into a car easel weasel o real me basically as excited to see rape as lease is right here because maybe this is when we get to the version of the second half it'd been wanting to see dolphin measles courtship alpha cad to see you an gdoctin you will take this place and to liberty your father as soon as she comes home ouch rape he standing in front of a nose flag weasel is clearly dis oriented but still hopeful as she holds the telegram and coly asks do not you want to come over to night i de rices ism now occupied with more important matt and your father better be tribe knows what is good for but real always sal chose a bad one this was the only relationship in the move that interested me at all is a child and it sobering to see the whole realistic ark of it as for the rest of the second half it is predictable their first escape is in can a work out it is bodies the when the singing contest great songs from the first affair just recycled in a heard way the one moment that moves me though does not have anything to do with the characters i was attached to from the first tax it happens surprisingly when the dad starts singing a love song to his country on stage the is doing it as an active gentle defiance that makes the not we officials mustache twitch and as the crowd joins in with him i feel my throat catch a little they remind me of people all around the world to summer in honking they rote bellerous here an americium we are longing to hold on to something as their own country's change rapidly excruciatingly around them the darkest moment of the move is perhaps at the very end when the family has almost escape but then rape finds them in the abbey he raises a whistle to turn them in but the dad stops and reasons with him you not really belong to them she re was come away with us a rape look scared and boyish he really pushes his gun and leans over relieved but then the dad takes at one step too far you will never be one of the won rape chooses to betray then it such a sinister and ti sine scene held up against the cotton candy first half the family still makes it out in time but in spite of him not with his help and that is the actual end of them i as far as i know tote here is my conclusion having seen it all he do not need the second half tit is actually better without it the second half just takes one of my kid's selves favorite characters rape it makes him a villain then takes the worst character the dad and makes him a hero there are barely any new songs maria disappears as a person weald just looks uncomfortable the whole time trying to act a child for another hour everything memorable and i conic about the move my favorite things the kid singing good night do a dear that will happens in the first half but then i was at the beach this weekend with he friend staring at the clouds in the kids tearing sand and he said a thing that changed my feeling about the second half he told me that lately he can last about three minutes feeling everything is normal before he remembers it is not it made me understand the urged to increase the dark end of this story and the move about the singing family because once everything in the world his changed he cannot really will it to stay outside the frame in is one oftheproduces of

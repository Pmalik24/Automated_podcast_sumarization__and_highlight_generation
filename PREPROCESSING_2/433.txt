welcome to the superman lap a science sciencepace to i may drew superman and om our professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine today we are talking about the science of heat and more specifically the science of he ting the verb meaning how our body heats up from both the outside and the inside heat is a remarkable stimulus meaning when we are in a hot environment it has a profound effect on our biology end heating up from the outside or as you will soon learn from the inside has a profound effect on many different aspects of our health including our metabolism both in the immediate and long term our cognition meaning our ability to think more or less clearly and if you're immediately thinking that heating up makes you less capable of thinking your wrong heat applied properly as a stimulus can engage certain narrow chemical systems in your brain en body that can allow your brain to function far better we will talk about those data to day we are going to talk about the science of heat and heating both in terms of their mechanisms and as i know many of you are interested in the tools related to the use of heat things sand how often to dhyana how long to be in the sand how hot to be in the sand for particular goals and outcomes we are also going to talk about the very exciting new science around local heating that is the use of heat applied to specific areas of the body in order to heal or improve tissues at that location that you are heating as well as your biology and health over all in fact we are going to talk about one very recently published paper that came out in the journal cell sell is one of the three apex journals meaning three of the most competitive most rigorous scientific journals those are nature science and sell this particular paper was published in cell and i will go into it in more detail later but basically what this paper shows is that by locally heating up skin and fat you can change the identity of certain fat cells at that location and elsewhere we have three kinds of fat white fat base fat and brown fat and as you will learn more about soon white fat is not very metabolically act of its more of a fuel reserve is what we typically think of as lovely fat base fat and brown fat are rich in mitochondria and those mite conure up provide a sort of furnace or heating mechanism for your entire body an increase your metabolism and the burning of white fat another words having more base fat and brown fat is a good thing and it turns out that the proper application of heat to specific areas of your body can increase the conversion of white fat to base fat in other words turn an innocuous fuel source in to a metabolically active tissue that can help you burn off more white fat think many people are going to be interested in this paper and the tools that emerge from this paper it is a fascinating set of findings that actually emerged from he understanding of the biology of burn and people who receive intense burns and that is not what ism going to recommend to you as a tool of course but understanding a little bit about how burns impact our biology and health has allowed these pioneering researchers to develop new tools to combat obesity and metabolic disorders and that you can apply for basic things fatalists ism please to announce that the superman labpodcast is now partnered with momentous supplements our motivation for partnering with momentous is to provide people one location where they can go to access the highest quality supplements in the specific dosages that our best supported by the scientific research and that are discussed during various episodes of the superman at podcast if you go to livemomentous tockcam slash supermen you will see those formulations i should mention that we are going to add more formulations in the months to come and you will see specific suggestions about how best to take those supplements meaning what dosages and times of day and in fact how to combine those supplements with specific behavioral protocols that have been discussed on the podcast and our science supported in order to derive the maximum benefit from those supplements and many of you will probably also be pleased to learn that momentous ships not just within the united states but also internationally once again if you go to live momentous stucco slash supermen you will find what we firmly believe to be the best quality supplements in the precise dosages and the best protocols for taking those supplementsalong with the ideal behavior protocols to combine with the supplement formulations before we begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and researchrols t stamford it is however part of my destroy effort to bring zero cost consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens at lentic greens is an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand in twelve som delighted tat their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athletigreens once or twice a day is that it helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which our vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called up microfilm and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body with out lentic greens i get the vitamins i need the minerals i need and the phobics to support my microfilm if you to triathlete greens you can go to athletic green stockroom slash supermen and claim a special offer they will give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of videoed three k too there are ton of at and ow showing that videoed three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if for getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient in vitamin d three and k too is also important because it regulates things cardiovascular function calcium in the body and on again go to atletigreen stockman slash supermen to claim the special offer of the fivfree travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are in element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar one talk many times before on this podcast about the key roll of hydration and electrolytes for nerve sell function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium and potassium present in the preparations all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the preparation of electrolytes if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element doc cam slash supermen and you will get a free element sample pack with your purchase they are all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to element element dot calm slash supermen oke let us talk about heat more specifically let us talk about the biology of heat and heating and the health benefits and tools related to heat and heating the first question that we have to answer is how do we heat up and the answers to that question is we heat up two ways we heat up from the outside meaning the things that we come into contact with the clothing that we put on our body whether not theirs heat in the room or whether no its cold outside or cold in a room and we heat up from the inside our body has the capacity degenerate more heat or to cool down mean to turn off the heating process and it can do that in ways that match the external environment the simplest way to think about this is that we actually have two body temperatures and people say oh what is body temperature ninety eight point six that is ashy not true body temperature varies between individuals varies across time of day withinindividuals and at every point cross your entire life spin you have two distinct temperatures one is the temperature on your skin what scientists call your shell and the temperature of your core your viscera meaning your organs your nervous system in your spinal cord and as you can imagine the temperature of your c ore is always higher than the temperature at your surface the importanthing to know is that you have a temperature at your shell and the temperature your core now you do not need to know exactly what those temperatures are in most cases but it is vitally important to understand that you have those two temperatures and that your brain is constantly sending out signals to your body as to weather not it should heat up ore cool down depending on the temperature of the shell which makes total sense this is a lot a thermostat in a room which is bench a paying attention to how cold are hot it is and then sending signals to the heating your cooling system to either heat up the environment or cool down the environment depending on the temperature in that environment your brain has neurons that send signals to other cells in your body and deploy the release of chemicals in your brain on body to heat you up when you are too cold and to cool you down when you are too hot if you can understand that you have too body temperatures want at your shell the surface and want at your core inside and that your body and brain are always trying to balance those two temperatures in the appropriate way well then your half way there to understanding the biology of thermal regulation and heating and you will be a lot further along in understanding how specific tools can be used to improvementabolism or improve cognition for instance in fact later you'll learn that one way that you can heat up is by cooling down the surface of your body that is right if i were to throw a cold tall ice coal tell on to your tore right now and ask you well how do you feel you say how that is cold that is chilly however because your brain is acting a bit of a thermostat as the surface the shell of your body fell cool it would make sense that that thermostat would activate biological mechanisms that would heat up your core similarly if i were to put you into a very hot environment you would say oh wow it is really really warm in here but your brain in your body would go through a lot of effort to activate mechanisms to cool you down any time or thing about heat meaning deliberate heat exposure things sand it is very important to understand not just the stimulus how hot something is how long you are insane et camera but the effect that has on your shell and on your core if you can understand that you can design protocols that are literally perfect for your goals and as a final point about this if you want to develop the best tools leveraging heat for your biology and health and performance you want to understand heat as a process as a verb as heat thing not just heat because there is the temperature that you are at be fore you encounter the heat stimulus before you get in the son for instance during the heat stimulus a wilier in the son and then afterward everything in biology is a process as you will soon learn that there is a specific san a protocol that can allow you can allow anybody in fact to increase the amount of go with hormone released into their brain an body sixteenfold that is right sixteenfold however it involves shifting from a hot environment to a cool environment to a hot environment to a cool environment over and over and over again over a very short period of time because it engages a switch a process that compounds it builds on itself to increase growth harmony father and further in fact if you were to just get into a son for a very long period of time and crank up the temperature to match the exact temperature that was used in that study you would not experience those increases in growth hormone it really is the transition between hot and cool temperatures that engage the process of heating and reheating over and over again to day you are on to learn about the use ofsana you are gong to learn to about the use of other heat related tools for health and optimization not just for growth hormone but also metabolic health for control in sort is all even to impact mental health in positive ways and in order to do that you need to understand a little bit about the mechanisms of how you heat up and how you cool down wear the cells and circuits are in the brain and body how those sells in circuits work i promise to make the description of that which follows very clear even you do not have a background in biology and once you have that in hand along with the understanding you now have about the fact they ya got a shell and a core and you need to think about both the shell and the core will then you will be in the best possible position to yuan or hot tub or other tools even just a hot shower as a powerful stimulus to optimize your biology now the science of heat and heating and cold and cooling for that matter goes back well over a hundred years in fact it is kind of amusing to me that nowadays there is a kind of renewed interest in the use of heat and cold and the science of heat and cold because this was the first topic that i studied as an undergraduate and in fact i did my graduate thesis on thermal regulation and at the time thermal regulation was not really considered one of the hot topics in nauru science people are more focused on things memory and consciousness and e corse those topics are still a vital interest to many people in many laboratories but thermal regulation was considered more a thing for the physiologist nowadays notjust on social media notjust in the landscape of biohackers in athletes but in the landscape a mental health and frankly in the general ethos around health optimization people are really interested in heat and cold and the reason there interested in heat and cold is that a lot of the science has been done both in animal models and mice and in humans and translates immediately to protocols that any one can use now a brief warning now and another brief warning later any time you are talking about heating up your body you need to be very cautious because unlike cooling down where you have a very broad range of cold temperatures that you can go into before its damaging to tissue well you do not get to heat up the brain and body very much before you start getting into the realm of neuron damage and neurons in the central nervous sister the brain and spinal cord once their damage they do not come back hyper therm as a serious thing to avoid later it'll talk about ways to rapidly protect against hyperthermia but i do want to give everybody a cautionary note ut front obviously if your pregnant nursing if you are very sensitive to hot environments you want to stay out of sands and things of that sort ism sure there exceptions to that you definably have to talk to your doctor if you are going to violate that rule and for everybody you want to approach any kind of tool related to heating very cautiously you always have the opportunity to increase the temperature later proceed with caution be smart about i do not you say that to protect me i say that also to protect you now let us talk about what are the circuits for heating up hows it happen i many of you have probably experience to fever how does that happen what happens when you go into a cold environments and your shivering but you put on a coat and then you feel warmer what is really going on there well there is a very basic circuit meaning neurons that exist in the skin in the brain and the body that communicate with one another that allow you to heat up if you need to in cool down if you need to i mean to throw a little bit of coming cloture a few new words at you you do not need to memorize these words except for one as you need to memorize one acronym but it is very easy called the p o a if you remember p a you be home free for the rest of the episode but i know that there are some phacianatoes out there and people interested in getting a little bit deeper mechanism and i do think it is important understand this circuit because once you understand this circuit and the way it structured then you are going o be in a great position to use the tools relate the heat id here is how the circuit is structured you have this shell which is basically skin and within the skin you have neurons nerve cells those nerve cells have channels or receptors on them they are called trip channels there some other ones as well which basically sent changes in heat if i were to put a hot object on your hand or your arm or for instance if i were to put a hot object on your hand or arm and then remove that hot object those neurons would respond to that they would send electrical signals into your spinal cord and that is where the next station of the circuit resides in your spinal cord you got a cluster of neurons exists to the top part of your spinal cord all the dorsal horn the name again does not matter and those neuron specifically relay heat information up to another air of your brain now heres where we get into some fancy names it is the lateral parobrakial aria you do not need to know late perobracio area but it is a relaystation the latter perobreakt aria sends electrical signals to the p o a and i would you to know p o a the p a stands for are optic area neurons in the peptic area basically reside over the roof your mouth these are neurons within the hypothalamus and neurons in the peptic aria have the ability to send signals out to the rest of your brain and body to get you to heat up and actually to change your behavior that you heat up that is right if neurons in the peptic area receive an electrical signal through the circuit i just described that goes from skin the dorsalhorn of the sponalcord to lateral perubricio they will start sending signals out to the organs of your body and the tissues of your body to get those organs and tissues to do things and believe or not your p way your erotic are will actually change the way that you think and feel immediately for instance if something warm contacts your skin or something very hot contacts your skin the peptic area will send signals out to the endothelia cells the blood vessels both of the brain and body that get them to dilate i to essentially increase their volume and their surface area in order to cast off heat you will also start sweating that sweating response is initiated not by the hot day or the hot sun but by the peptic area neurons that send signals out to what is call the periphery of your body and other chemicals are released things a sector calling that get you to sweat and if you happen to be shivering neurons in the peptic area will make sure that you stop shivering you are probably familiar with the feeling of being somewhat lethargic or spreading out your limbs on a hot day well that is the result of neurons in your peptic area impacting your musculature to get you to increase your surface area you can sweat off or release more heat there all these different mechanisms by which we dump heat some of those are purely physiological the low are conscious control things sweating which you cannot just make yourself sweat on demand maybe you can through a set of stressful thoughts but you can just make yourself sweat that is autonomic its below your conscious control things vasodilation the dilation of your veins in particular in capillaries in particular these sorts of things and of course there are these behavior somewhat voluntary aspects of dumping heat and the lethargy the kind of tiredness that we feel on a really hot day that is also controlled by this circuit that i just describe in fact i just got back from a visit to a very warm place and it was remarkable to me how lethargic i felt in the afternoons i just felt a total slug i just could not move or rally to do anything except if i waited until the evening even though it was later in the day even though i had not napped as the temperature in my environment cooled off as my body temperature cooled off i felt had more energy i was actually waking up even though i had been awake for longer the relationship between temperature and lethargy is a very intimate one if we are warm enough we feel active and we want a move around if we are too warm we feel we need to stay put and spread out our limbs and dump heat and that brings me to a quick and con of fun point about how we dump heat verses how other animals dump heat many of of course that we dump heat by sweating other mechanism's as well some of which i describe but that is our main way of dumping heat other animals dogs do not have the capacity to sweat at least not very much they pant right in order to dump heat and still other animals rodents when they get too hot they spit on their paws and they rub that spit on the surface of their body which might sound contagious and probably will get you to think twice before petting any f those animals or holding any of those animals again unless that is your thing now one other anything to understand about this circuit related to heat is that the peptic area also can send electrical signals to the eidola a brain area that is often talked about in the context of fear but is really just a brain area that can activate your sympathetic nervous system the sympathetic nervous system is part of your autonomic nervous system and is the one associated with fight or flight or with the stress response or even just the excited response right the sympathetic nervous system is also what gets activated when your really excited about something the peptic area has the opportunity to trigger the activation of the imigdola now t does not do it every time but it can and it tends to do that when you are suddenly in an environment that feels too hot that you feel is risky levels of hot if you ever have got an into a sauna that was very very hot maybe two hundred ten degrees farenheiht you sit there for a minute you will notice that your heart rate increases and their reasons for that and will talk about some of the health benefits of that in a few minutes but it is pretty uncomfortable you may not feel your skin is going o burn up but you often will feel the impulse to get out especial if you stay in there for a little while that impulse is the consequence of this peptic area communicating with your amygdala saint hey this environment is really hot and ism trying to cool down and it is not really working ism dumping heat but ism not able to adjust the core of my body temperature and ways that are going to protect my narrows and it is a signal that you probably should not stay in that environment too long now later will talk about the advantage of pushing yourself a little bit through some of these very hot environments provided you can do it safely but the impulse to get yourself out of a very hot environment is the consequence of the pita communicating with your amygdala and the imigdola then in turn activating your a renal glands which are straight above your kidneys the release of a adrenalin and this feeling of agitation you want to move usually you want to move out of whatever hot environment you happen to be in now the circuit again it is simply goes from skin to spinal cord one brain area to another brain area that is the key one in this discussion which is the p say the peptic area in the or y urticaria can kick off a bunch of autonomic subconscious responses to heat which make us attempt to get cooler things sweating vasodilation et camera and it can kick off behavior responses spreading out our limbs in a n attempt to dump even more heat feeling lethargic a lack of desire to run and move and it also has the opportunity to kick off a mild or may be not mile panic response to get us out of that hot environment if you can conceptualize that circuit or if you can even just understand what i just said even at a top contour level you are going to be in a great position to understand the rest of the information and the tools that follow next id to talk about the use of deliberate heat exposure including sand but other tools as well as a way to understand how heat and heating changes our biology you are going to learn o mechanism and you are going to learn some tools but first id to just emphasize that the use of deliberate heat exposure can be a very powerful way to improve health and longevity there is a wonderful study on this that was publish in two thousand eighteen that includes a lot of data from a lot of participants in a lot of different conditions for instance people that only did sand once viruses to to three times a week fries for to seven times a week and on and compares all those the title of the study is sand bathing is as located with reduced cardiovascular mortality and improves risk prediction in men and women a prospective cohort study this is one of several papers that clearly demonstrate that regular use of sand or other forms of deliberate heat exposure can refuse mortality to party of vascular events but also to other events things stroke and other things that basically can kill us what i much about this and the related studies and yes i will provide a link to these in the so notes is that they involve a lot of participant for instance in this particular paper which was published in be see medicine they looked at a sample of one thousand six hundred and eighty eight participants who had a mean age of sixty three but there was a range of ages around sixty three and of whom fifty one point for percent were women the rest were men it is a pretty nicely varied study in terms of the populations that they looked at and basically what they found was the more often that people do sand the better their health is and the lower the likelihood they will die from some sort of party of vascular event now what do we mean by sand we need to define some of the parameters around sand and i promise to provide you some alternative ways to access some of the health benefits that we are observed in this and related studies without the need to have a sand as i do realize that a lot of people do not have access to sand first off the temperature ranges that were used in this study and pretty much all the studies that i am going to talk about unless i say otherwise are between eighty degrees sell is meaning a hundred and seventy six degrees farrenheit and a hundred degrees easiest meaning two hundred and twelve degrees farrenheit somewhere in that range how hot should you make the sand or the environment that you get into should you decide to use these tools well that will depend on your tolerance for heat how heat adapted you are yes some people are better at sweating than others and over time we all get better at sweating meaning if you going the son more frequently you become a better sweat our not what are you were but the verb sweater you get better at sweating at dumping heat through the loss of water it is going to depend i recommend starting on the lower end of the temperature scale and if that is too hot for you that you even lower the temperature further now how long were people exposing themselves to these hot environments anywhere from five to twenty minutes per session and as you will soon learn very brief periods of just five minutes of heat exposure can be a powerful stimulus if the heat exposure is significantly great enough for you of twenty minutes can also be beneficial but eighty to a hundred degrees easiest meaning hundred seventy six degrees farenheit to two hundred twelve degrees aren't is the general ranged at this and most studies use in this particular study they compared the effects of people that did sand once a week two or three times per week or four to seven times per week and what they saw was really remarkable what they observed was that people who went into the son two or three times per week were twenty seven per cent less likely to die of a party o vascular event than people that went into the son just once a week again at the temperature levels and the duration that i talked about earlier and as you can imagine the duration than temperature levels were related if people went into very hot environments at w really in comfortable for them maybe they only went in for five minutes whereas if they were more comfortable and heat adapted in ha given environment of their tolerance for heat was just simply higher for whatever reason well then they tended to stay an longer we can take a sort of average of this five to twenty minute range and to day were mainly going to talk about exposures between ten and twenty minutes at temperatures between again eight degrees and a hundregree series hundred seven six degrees farenhei or two hundred the degrees farrnheit these data point to the fact that going in the son two or three times per week is really beneficial and can lower mortality to cartevascular events and in fact the benefits were even greater for people that were going into the son four to seven times per week those people were fifty per cent less likely to die of a party vascular event compared to people that went into the son just once a week these are really impressive and frankly encouraging studies certainly they caught my eye and encouraged me to start using deliberate heat exposure on a regular basis what is particularly nice about this study and the related study that again as linked in the shownotes is that they looked at a number of potentially confounding variables things whether not people smokes things whether not people were over weight whether or not they tended to exercise or not exercise and they were able to separate out those variables the percentages that had described early or twenty seven per cent less likely to die of a care vascular event for those that went ne sand two to three times a week and fifty per cent less likely die of a cardiovascular vent for those that went in the sand four times per week as compared to just once a week those effects really do seem to be the consequent of the sand exposure and not some other effect that is correlated with sand exposure going to the him where people are working out seven times a week andthan also happen get into the sand or quitting smoking right about the same time they adopt a a sand protocol these sorts of things and now there have been additional analysis of the use of sand for improving health where i should say for offsetting mortality that have found that it is notorious reductions and card vascular events but called all cause mortality this is kind of medical geeks speak for saying how likely are you or somebody to die from a care vascular event but may be also from some other event some other health rebatement cancer or something of that sort and in every case regular exposure to sand starting it about two or three times per week all the way up to seven times per week greatly improves meaning statistically significant improvements in longevity in the sense that they people are less likely to die of cardiovascular events and other things that kill us i and many other people who are interested not just in our own health but in educating about health related tools to the general public find this really exciting but knowing what we know about how heat impacts a biology it probably should not surprise us that this sand type exposure or deliberate heat exposure has these incredible effects before we get into the biological mechanisms of how heat can have all these impressive health effects i want to just talk about the use of sand as a tool and emphasize that you do not have to use a sand in order to get these benefits it is simply a matter of making sure that your shell and your core heat up properly a bit not too much not too little they heat toes up and know you do not need to carry a thermometer round or place a thermometer into your corpse you known laboratory studies and in humans if you really wanted now soonescort temperature easily try to put the thermos probe as close to the cop as you can typically that is done rectify or o mouth thermometer or even up the nose you do not need to do any that o right this is an laboratory study there is it there are ways to create a hot environment such that you heat up your shell in your core safely without having to measure your sort temperature all along if you want do that be my guest but ism not can provide a protocol the question is how are you heating up your environment a and i realize that there are drysonas there are steamsonas there are imferdsonas there are hot tubs and there are simply rooms that you crank up the heat oke there are also ways in which you can increase your shell in your sort temperature by moving around a lot and doing that wearing a lot of clothing there is nothing special about any one of these approaches or protocols it is just happens that sand is one of the more convenient ways to do this and certainly for the studies that have talked about not just the ones i reference before but all the studies that i research look in this episode it make sense why they would using because it is very hard for instance to create conditions wear you have you five people go out jogging wearing heavy sweaters and hats will hats on the middle of summer it is very hard to set up those conditions in a way that is controlled for everybody whereas it is pretty straightforward to have a sand where you have one or several people just get into that one uniformly hot environment that is a much easier study to run just to be clear the temperature range is important you want to get between eighty and a hundred degree sellsius now the conversion to ferenheiht you out however immerse yourself in a hot tub or hot water bath up to your neck that is another way to approach it if you did not have access to either of those you could also put on as a hood or a wool hat and bloody or you could do the wrestlers do and you couldashy buy one of these a plastic suits the lily call plastics that a wrestlers ore other athletes that wish to drop water weight will wear and then go jogging that all of those will increase your shell in your corrode temperature i specially you do it on a hot day but o course be careful hydrate and do not over he do not become excessively hypothermic use you can get heat stroke and you can potentially die but if you are going to use sand often i get the question how hot show the sonar will now how long should you be in their five to twenty minutes our session although i will talk in a minute about waste optimal hormone you put in particular grothormorn out put by doing four very brief sessions maybe not a continuo a session will get into that a few minutes and of course you have to ask yourself persona prison you know does not matter use what you prefer many people ask me what about imferredsona we have an entire episode all about the use of light and low level light therapy including impeded light it does have certain benefits for skin and other organs and tissues of the body if used properly my understanding r at least my assessment of most inferred son's out there is that they do not get hot enough they do not get up to that eighty to a hundred degrees easiest range some do most do not what you end up with is a situation where you have got a red light low level light therapy stimulus and you have got a sand that is not quite hot enough and there are a lot of ideas and claims about how they work together in order to get you improved benefits i personally amok the stance based on the literature that have read that you want to get into those ranges of a eighty to a hundred degrees sulcus before you start considering whether not your also going include red therapies et camera there is nothing special about red light sand it is really the temperature of the sand thatyou happen to get into which tool which sand which stimulus rerunning wearing plastics in a woodland will hat you get in to a sonar nescaan depend a lot on your circumstances your age in what you have access to on a regular basis this is a lot our discussion about the use of cold most of the studies have looked at immersion in cold water up to the neck because that t e very controlled situation that can do in an laboratory they have not explored cold showers as much others just last data or walking around in a cold environment but we will talk alibi about those data a because as you will soon learn when you talk about cold your ache talcument he ting as well what kind of mechanisms are activated in your brain envoy that allow for the various health benefits of sand or other forms of deliberate heating well we talked about reduce risk of cardiovascular event related mortality in all causemortality as you will soon learn there are also tremendous benefits in terms of increases in growth hormone reductions in cords all et camera i will detail those what happens when you get into a hot environment what are the mechanisms that allow for the various health effects of that well your shell your skin sense is that and through the circuit that described earlier activates neurons in the pee the preopticaria which in turn activates mechanisms in your autonomic nervous system vast dilation blood flow increases plasma volume of your blood increases and stroke volume the volume of blood that is mobilized with each beat of your heart also increases and your tartrate increases to anywhere between a hundred to a hundred and fifty beats permitted that general constellation of effects looks a lot cardiovascular exercise and in fact for all intents and purposes it really is party vascular exercise except that there is not the mobilization and the loading of joints and limbs and things of that sort and of course there are additional benefits of cardiovascular exercise that relate to in pact on the ground improvements and bone density et center et camera but basic your heart starts beating more blood start circulating your musculature change yous shape literally to accommodate those increases in tartrate and blood volume and your busy getting a party vascular workout in that hot environment even if your just sitting down another set of positive effects related to being in these hot environments are hormone effects shifts in the output of hormones both from your adrenals and possibly from the testis an ovaries and even within the brain one of the more striking examples of that comes from a study that was published in twenty twenty one the title of the study is indicant effects of repeated hot thermal stress and cold water immersion in young adult men and indeed the study was in this case just done on men it'll just briefly described the protocol they use they had these men attend four sanassessions of twelve minutes each again well within that range of five to twentymentes twelve minutes the temperature of thousands was ninety to ninety one degree census on dis quickly do the calculation admittedly not in my head that is a hundred d ninety four degrees farrenheit and they did that four times afterwards they had a six minute cool down break during which they did get into some cool water or cold water of about ten degrees which is ten degree sepsis is fifty degrees farrenheight and then they measured hormones at various times throughout this study before during an after they looked at testosterone they looked at d h e a which is in the androgen pathway they looked at prolactin and they looked at cortical the significant effects of the protocol that i just described were on cortical a called stress hormone called because when we are very stress for long periods of time cartel levels ten to increase dramatically but i should point out that a increase in cortesall each day write about the time of waking and specifically right about the time of waking is actually beneficial for our alertness and our energies having some increasing cuartesal every twenty four hours is a good thing provided happens early in the day late day increases in qartesall are associated with depression that is been shown by studies at stamford and elsewhere the major effect of the study is a significant decrease in corteisall output in these subjects i think this is really interesting and important because many people suffer from acute meaning immediate and long term stress and are looking for ways to control their stress controlling your cortical is tricky in the episode on stress i talked about supplement such as ashwaganda that can be used to limit cortical but you have to be careful not to use ashuaganda for extended periods of time meaning for longer than two weeks because you can get into other issues i talk about breath work protocols that can allow you to clamp or reduce the stress response in real time again see that episode for those but many people are over worked their over stress their for one reason or another there subjected to many too many stress or or their level of stress razilians is in high enough to keep their cartel levels clamped at a healthy level the protocol described of twelve minute exposures to ninety degree environment that is again nine degrees sepsis followed by a six minute cool down break in cool water o fifty degrees or that is pretty cold i can imagine that you could also just take a cool shower or cold shower afterwards that had a very significant effect on lowering cartes also there you have ut tool it is not a completely e zerocostol came cumin to heat the water you need have access to hot and cold water at least hot and cold contrast of some sort but it is fairly minimal cost and for most people especially you start getting creative about may be taking a twelve minute jog wearing a lot of clothing if it is hot out then getting into a cool shower you might not get the same extreme or significant production in quartisal that was observed here with these very specific protocols but it is likely that you would get a similar result over all now i mention they did look at these other hormones and it'll just tell you that they did not see significant shifts in testosterone prolactin duties et camera using this protocol as you soon see their other son protocols that can impact those other hormones if your seeking to use sand to reduce stress i think this is a very interesting and potentially useful research back protocol and again we will provide a link to the paper i you would to read more about the data that is one set of biological effects on quarts a and the related protocol hat about some of the other benefits of sand well we will talk about those but i one to talk about those in the contacts of the underlying mechanisms because if you understand in those underlying mechanisms you can really tailor your son protocols for your particular needs one of the more dramatic and important effects of going into a hot environment for some period of time is the activation of called heat shock prolines or each s pees heat shock prolines are a protective mechanism inpour brain an body to rescue prolines that would otherwise misfiled i mean by this well most of your familiar with the fact that ye have proline in the kitchen a a stake or a piece of chicken or a piece of fish and you heated of it changes its texture i wrawmeat is different than cooked me to be quite blunt about it heat changes the quality of routines notes in terms how they taste but the way in which they are configured change the right down the molecular level when your body goes through changes in temperature each day and will talk about those changes but in response to hot environments are cold environments heat shock prolines are deployed to go and rescue and prevent the changes in prolines that would be detrimental to your health at least in the short term activating heat shock prolines is a good thing you do not want heat shock protist to be activated for long periods of time because that gets to be problematic for other reasons but these heat shock prolines of which there are many varieties easily have the job of traveling in your brain and body and making sure that sells that contain prolines that are infolding because they got heated up too much do not misfiled and they also servo a protective mechanism making sure that prolines within the cells of your brain anybody do not fold in the wrong ways gan ism describing this in very general terms but it is well established in animal models and in humans that sand exposure of the sort that i described earlier activates these heat sh rock prolines there s some interesting studies that were carried out in animal models that really nicely mechanistically support the role of heat shock prolines in some of the benefits of deliberate heat exposure some of these studies were done in flies some f meaning drasophal of fruit flies cause their great model organism because you can defeat genes are agents easily other ladies have ben done in mice and now there also studies being carried out in humans an i will talk about those one of the more dramatic examples that is always and towed in this field of deliberate heat exposure as that relates to longevity is that if they expose these flies these fruit flies to seventy minutes of a heat stimulus that would obvouseedint kill them but activated headstock prolines it could extend their life by fifteen per cent in a heat shock dependent way meaning if they made flies that din have these heat shock prolines well then they did not see this extension in life and this is one f the reason to use model organisms is not an experiment that you could do in people however there have been interesting studies done inhuman examining some of the downstream molecular pathways of deliberate heat exposure that point to the mechanisms by which delicate heat exposure can help protect against different forms of mortality improve health over all and possibly no when a highline possibly possibly extend life one such mechanism involves a genetic program involving a molecule called fox o three fox three is a very interesting molecule because it is involved in dial repair pathways liana repair is part of the process of remaining healthy we would all to think that were born and based on the genes we have we are healthy healthy healthy than eventually we age and then we die but from the time were born until the time we die there is a constant repair of our prolines in ourselves in a modification of the genes that are being expressed no puberty being the most dramatic example right you see a kid before puberty and after beauty looks a different kid sounds different kid things different kid in fact basically is a different human being is not just the hormonsits that hormones themselves have the capacity to turn on and turn off certain genes literally converting certain tissues and sells in the brain embody to do entirely different things is not just the sprouting of new aspects of our biology is literally the conversion of different brain centers from one function to another that is puberty when the whole episode about puberty we actually did an episode on sexual development that talks a little bit about those mechanisms but the point is that throughout our entire life stand genes are being turned on genes are being turned off genes are being turned on genes are being turned off and liana the stuff of genes gets damaged in that process fox three sits upstream in a pathway related to data repair and again clearing of these sentiment cells son exposure in particular son exposure two to three times or i really for to seven times per week in that eighty to a hundred degree series range has been shown to regulate levels of fox three fox three in turn regulates pathways related to dean repair and clearing out of these sentiment or dead cells which is known to be important for various aspects of maintaining cognition and other aspects of maintaining health these are the likely biological mechanisms for the improvements in lifespan or i rather i should say these are the biological mechanisms that apparently offset some of the party of vascular risk and other forms of mortality that were described earlier one especially interesting thing about fox three there are individuals out there that have either additional copies of fox three or who have versions of fox three that are help or active to speak those people tend to be two point seven times more likely to live to a hundred years of age or longer these are people that were just naturally and fortunately for them endowed with more fox three more clearance of venison cells more liana repair et camera for the rest of us at least you no to my knowledge i do not have a the one of these health promoting fox three mutations remember mutations can be beneficial they can be detrimental this if your goal is to live longer is a beneficial mutation well if you do not have these fox three mutations that allow you to be a seminarian at two point seven times a her likelihood than other people deliberate heat exposure is one way that you can increase fox three activity at this point in time meaning when looking at the research out there it is not clear what the optimal son o protocol is going to be specifically to increase fox three and that is probably because there is not one there is no son oprotocall designed specifically to reduce cortex all or specifically to increase fox three or specifically to act of eight headstock prolines any deliberate heat exposure is likely to impact all of those mechanisms again i encourage you to use this guide of eighty to a hundred degrees sulcus as your kind of a book ends for what you can tolerate and where you want to start and eventually transition to in terms of deliberate heat exposure and i would encourage you to use that five to twenty minutes par session for the sand as your rough guide of how long to remain in the sand now there was a study publishes this last year that was mainly focused on deliberate cold exposure a detailed this i quite extensively in the episode on cold this is the beautiful work of hosanna sober and that study looked at deliberate cold exposure but also sand exposure and that study found that fifty seven yes fifty seven minutes per week of sand exposure conjunction with eleven minutes per weak total of deliberate cold exposure was the threshold forgetting improvements in metabolism and increases in brown fat this very active fat tissue that improves my a cordial function and thermogenesis mean heating of the body will talk more about round fat later why do i mention this well for those of you that are interested in increasing metabolism it does seem to be most beneficial to do that eleven minutes per week of cold exposure again divided up across two or more sessions it is not eleven minutes all at once but shorter sessions and to get fifty seven minutes minimum per week of son exposure again in the temperature ranges that have talked about here and again it is not fifty seven minutes in the son all at once that is fifty seven minutes total per week as the minimum threshold you might divide that into there sessions of twenty minutes and again i do not think fifty seven is the magic number it could be sixty it could be sixty four hitrouly could be fifty five remember your biological systems are not counting things off in use by minute second by second least not in most cases for those of you there interested in improving metabolism check out the episode on cold or just take the sober protocol as i call it which is eleven minutes total per week of uncomfortably cold but safe cold exposure in comfortably gold means you really really want to get out of the shower of the immerse the or the ice bath or whatever environment b you can stay in eleven minutes total per week divided across the couple sessions and then fifty seven minutes per week or of deliberate heat exposure again uncomfortable but uncomfortably hots caves me but safe to stay in probably divided up across three or more sessions okas said we have talked about the use of sand to decrease cordial we talkedabout the use of son into increase heat chalk prolines wee talked about the use of son to increase fax three now it'd to talk about the use of sand to increase growth hormone growth hormone is a hormone that we all naturally secrete from our pituitary which also resides near the roof of our mouth the signal for the pituitary to release growth hormone arrives from neurons that exist in the hypothalamus growth hormone releasing hormones believe are not that is what herecalld stimulate the release of growth hormone from the anterior to pituitary gland into the general circulation and then growth hormone impacts metabolism and growth of cells and tissues of the body it is responsible for tissue repair as well and the prosper that everyone experiences during purity is the consequence of growth hormone when ism about to describe is a study that found dramatic really dramatic i should say increases in growth hormone but i also want to emphasize that these increases in growth hormone were not of the sort that are observed impurity or in infants becoming adolescence are adolescence growing into teen ages those levels of growth harm that are associate with those massive transformations souse me of body more apology of shape are far greater than the sorts that am talking about here and yet as all of us age when we go from adolescent green age years and then into young adulthood but then starting in our early thirties or the amount of growth harmony that we secrete is greatly diminished normally we would release growth harmony every night after we go to sleep in particular in the early part of the night when our sleep is comprised mostly of slow wave sleep as we age less growth harmony is released during that slow wave sleep there are various things that can promote the release of growth harmony and we will talk about some of those other things in a moment things low blood sugar turns out is a stimulus for growth hormone release and i do not mean hypoglycemia of the sort that makes you dizzy in want to pass out that is bad i mean not having high levels of glucose and insolent in your bloodstream this is one of the reasons why many people are drawn to intermittent fasting or even prolong fasting because of the reported increases in growth harmony it'll touch on those briefly but if you want to learn more about those in what their real impact is and extent of growth harmony check out the episode i did on fasting you can find that at superman raped out calm certain forms of exercise have also been shown to stimulate growth harmony release and in a few moments it'll talk about how exercise and fasting can be combined or how heat can be combine with exercise are certain patterns of food in take to further increase growth form but before i do that i want to review some of the data and one study in particular that discovered certain forms of deliberate heat exposure using sand can stimulate very large increases in growth harmony output which for people in their thirties forties and beyond could be very useful and may also be useful for peoplewho are just trying to stimulate the release of more growth harmony in order to for instance recover from exercise or stimulate fat loss or muscle growth or repair of or particular injury the title of this paper is indicant effects of repeated sand bathing and this is a paper that was published in nineteen eighty six which is some years ago but none the less serves as a basis for a lot of other studies that followed lemme described what they did in the study they used in eighty degree relies environment that ha hundred and seventy six trees fare height and they had subjects do this sea for thirty minutes four times per day that two hours total in one day thirty minutes in the sand a period of cool down rest thirty mince in son again cool down rest a third and a fourth time oke two hours total in this eighty degree series environment that is a lot but what they observed was really quite significant they had subjects do this protocol and i should mention they had both male and female subjects in the study and the entire study lasted a week they did this two hours of sand exposure on my one day three and a seven of that week and they measured a lot of different hormones cortical fibroid stimulating hormone firewood hormone itself utilizing hormone and logical stimulating hormone which are hormones that essentially drive the production of otherhormons we will not get into that a two deeply but if you to learn about effasagh logical stimulating hormone and utilizing hormone place the episode on optimizing testastron in estrogen at hubermanlabdatcam they looked at prolactin and they looked at growth hormone it'll just cuts of the chase and tell you the effects on growth hormone in subjects that did this two hour a day eighty degree selcios protocol experienced sixteen fold increases in growth hormone they measure growthhormon before the sand and after the sand and grothormon levels went up sixteen fold which is obviously an enormous and it turns out statistically significant effect now one important avian here remember earlier when i talked about people who did sand once a week verses to three times a week verses for to seven times a week and the more often people to sand the less likely they were to die of party of vascular events or other things of that sort well in this case the effects of san exposure on growth hormone actually when down the more often that people did this deliberate heat exposure as i mention they did this two hour day dividing the thirty minute sessions protocol on day one day three and day seven of a week and what they found was on day one there was a sixteen fold increase in growth hormone on day three however there was still a significant effect on grothhormon as compared to beforsana but that effect was easily cut by two thirds ora now instead of gating sixteen fold increase it was more a three or fourfold increase which is still a huge increase but not as great as the increase observed on day one and then on day seven there tended to be a two may be a threefold increase but not as great as the one observed on day on what dis this mean and why does this happen well the reason this happens is because heat just cold is a shock or a stressed to the system in the contacts of cold if you get into a very cold ice bath for instance a five degree ice bat even for twenty seconds it is known to increase nor apinefren two hundred per cent it can double the amount of norupan even they you suddenly release into your brain and body which actually can have some passive effects ill talk about those in obit but if you were to do that every day you would become cold adapted this circuit that compares the shell and core of your body would adjust in ways the t it could either predict that cold stimulus or more likely to create some thermogenic mechanisms in preparation for that cold exposure this is why for instance people that use deliberate cold exposure to try and increase lipolysis the burning of fat oftentimes will get results for while but then if there going it a lot a lot they stop getting those effects i talk a lot about waiting cold adaptation if that is your gold in the episode on coal but similar mechanisms are at play here we have to imagine that when the subjects got into the anon de one whatever pathways went from measurement of temperature at the shell to changes in temperature at the core led to these big increases in growthormone which is easily away of dust describing the result i already told you before but the fact that that result diminished over time either means that the circuit was not as efficient in communicating that shift in temperature or that that shift in temperature was of less impact because the downstream effectors wore not engaged to the same extent because it was not as much of a shock and i think the latter explanation is far more likely this is very much akin to wait training or carry vascular exercise where if you run up the hill very fast for instance and your lungs a burning and your heaving and breathing hard on the first day that is a very painful thing but if you do it every day or every other day provide you allow yourself to recover presume your running up that hill and your not breathing is hard there is not much burning in your muscles et center et camera your body adapts one of the key things to understand about the use of deliberate heat exposure is if you are going to use it in order to trying trigger massive increases in growthhormon you are going to need to be careful about not doing it more than lets say once a weak now i m extrapolating from the study maybe once every ten days would be even better but if you start getting heat adapted it is very unlikely that you are going to get these massive increases in growthhormon i do not mean to be discouraging of using deliberate heat exposure to access growthhormon increases but if that is your specific goal or your main goal then i think it is reasonable to say that you do not want to do deliberate heat exposure at least not of the sort that i describe here more than once a week or maybe even once every ten days and that you would want a time that to other events in your life may be hard work outs or if you are trying to push through a fat lost barrier or simply in order to access growth hormone at peak levels may be three times per month or four times vermouth if you start doing deliberate heat exposure more often you will still get increases in growthormon but they are not going to be nearly as large as the increases in growthhormon that you are going to experience if you shock your system with theledeliberate heat exposure every once in a while an important way to frame this is actually in the context of cold and while you might say weight this is an episode on heat in heating not cold you really cannot have a conversation about heat and heating without talking about cold because as i mentioned earlier if you cool the outside of your body the shell your rashly heating up your body in fact the circuits that control l heating of the body in that control cooling of the body for instance the activation of things shiver or fat loss in response to cold and shiver those are also controlled by the peptic area of the hypothalamus we can take a step back and start to think about what it would take to design the optimal protocol for deliberate heat exposure by looking at cold and here is what i mean therehave ben beautiful study showing that if people get into a very cold body of water four degrees versus for twenty seconds as i mention earlier that will cause e a two hundred to three hundred per cent increase in norapaneferon norapaneferan is also called noradrenaline and nor up an efferent another call catacolomines dopamine increase dramatically in this very brief cold water exposure and those increases in norupinefran and dopamine are known to have long lasting effects that generally to improvements in mood focus in alertness they arepretty significant however they are not significant enough to increase metabolism to a very high degree whereas other studies have shown that if people go outside in sixteen degrees sepsis weather with a proper amount but fairly minimumamount of clothing you can experience even greater increases in trapan felon but the time that is required in order to experience those increases is six hours at for instance sixteen degree telesis if you have six hours a day to be out there in the colder if you an turn the air conditioning on and an environment make it very very cold t fine but easily what i am describing is that you can sort of book end the parameters that you can use you can use a very brief exposure to cold or to heat in order to stimulate heat shock prolines growth harmony et camera or you can use longer exposure in less intense versions of heat and cold you really have to find what is can a work for you an what you can do safely and if your confused about where to start please use the parameters that i described earlier first of all check with your doctor as always make sure that you're somebody who can do deliberate cold or heat exposure safely but that eighty to a hundred degrees sepsis meaning hundred d seventy sixteen for inherit to two hundred an twelve degrees for inlet that keep repeating over and over cause i know somebodies gan to asked n i repeat it over and over which is filum am delayed to keep a keep saying it and to respond of sone ask again well those parameters are going bookend what you should do in terms of the intensity of the heat stimulus how long well we heard early er five to twenty minutes why not start with five and then ramp it up to ten or fifteen and then if your feeling really bold and you really want a crank outcrothhormon will then you could do that thirty minute four times in one day stimulus everyone in a while you halter really figure out what you're using heat exposure for this is one of the reasons why when people say is it better to get in a wetsonor or prison o what is the optimal temperature ah is it better take a hot shower o hot bath or a hot of to be completely honest it depends on what you are going to be able to do regularly whether not you want to do it regularly and what your specific coals are the purpose of this episode is really the army with the underlying mechanisms and army w it the general parameters that are going to allow you to access the result s that your seeking for what it is worth i personally use a protocol and have been using a protocol for a long time that involves trying meaning i accomplish this most weeks not all trying to get in to ass for three twenty minute sessions every week i use a dhyana it is not a steam room if i do not have access to it i might take a hot bath or something of that sort but in general i just stick to doing the san a three times a weep and i generally will do that either after a work out either a cardiovascular work out or a wake work out or it'll do it later in the evening why later in the evening well asked to do with the circadian shifts in temperature that we all experience take a lot about this in the circadian episodes and the episodes relate to sleep but in a nutshell hears how it works every early morning about two hours before your typical wake up time your body temperature is at its all time lowest one we call that your temperature minimum right about waking your body temperature increases in fact an increase in body temperature is part of the reason you wake up at all unless of course you are setting an alarm increases in body temperature are going to be one of the major things that wakes up your brain an body body temperature will tend to continue to increase through the morning you get that increase in cortical that is in healthy increase in cortical body temperature will increase into the afternoon and then will start to drop in the later afternoon this general contour can be shifted by whether not you exercise how often you eat because of the call thermogenic effects of food that is every time you eat there is a slight increase in body temperature metabolism butts nuts really that significant to throw off this general contours rhythm but toward the afternoon around four five o'clock most days depending on time of year your body temperature will pick and then it will start to drop and as your body temperature drops by one to three degrees in here on referring to your for body temperature not your shell body temperature you will start to get sleepy and to transition into sleep and to maintain sleep throughout the night your body temperature will remain low to you hit that temperature minimum they will tart to come up again of what that means is that when you decide to do sand or cold exposure for that matter is going to be important why well as i mention early if you were to make the surface of your body cold at least in the immediate period after that your body temperature will increase for those of you that are challenge in getting to sleep and are still working on your sleep remember sleep is the foundation of all mental and physical health and optimal performance you should try to get really equality sleep of sufficient duration at least eighty per cent of nights that should be an ongoing got throughout your life seen for a huge number of reasons watch the master sleep episode if you to hear more of those reasons than the mechanisms to make sure that you do that but in any event cold exposure late in the evening will start to increase your body temperature again and that can make it hard for some people to fall asleep now if your very very tire end because you have been working hard or training hard or both throughout the day may not throw off your sleep much have gone through bouts where ism just busy from morning till night that the only time i can get into the ice both of the cold showers late in the evening and i have no trouble sleeping after that however you have trouble sleeping i would recommend doing the coal exposure early in the day to match that natural heating that natural increase in body temperature that occurs across the twenty four hours called circadian rhythm similarly if you are going to use deliberate heat exposure you be wise to do that later in the day you be wise to do it later in the day because when you get into a warm environment sure the surface of your body the shell heats up the core of your body heats up but then it also activates cooling mechanisms through the peptic area and when you get out of that hot environment sooner otherwise your body will continue to cool down and many people find that if they do san it in the later half of the day or even just before sleep and then take a warm as shower afterwards then they find it easier to fall asleep and that make sense because their body temperature is dropping and in fact if your goal is to really promote the maxim amount of growthhomeon release that is also going to be the best time of day to do it especially if you haven't eaten in the two hours before sleep gist if you are really going for growthomone release your really trynoptimize sleep and the two things are actually linked because of the release of grothomon the happens from the pituitary in the early nights sleep well then you would be wise to do your sand may be once or may be twice a week in the evening or at night time than taking a warm or cool shower just briefly just enough to account o ring off all the sweat from the sand and then get ready for sleep and to do that not necessarily fasted but to try and keep your levels of glucose and insolent somewhat low in your blood stream the reason i say that is that having elevated blood glucose and or insolent tends to blunt or reduce growthhome on release and that is true for any number of different stimuli including exercise and including sand she is a really nice study on this that i can point you to s the study that was published in the journal stress literally that is the name of the journal i love it when journals have these names pain or stress i find that somewhat amusing for reasons that escape me but none the less amuse me the title of the study is growthhome on response to different consecutive stress stimuli in healthy men is there any difference and i do not want to going all the details of the study because its pretty extensive and complicated but baby what it is that they had people do sand and then gave them a drug or a condition of having low not dangerously low but low blood sugar or they hade them in a condition where they had low blood sugar and then did sand or they hade them do an exercise protocol that led them to increase growthhormon and then hade them do loblutcher basely mixing and matching the various stimuli that could increase growthhorman and what they found was very straightforward hat they found was that doing sand once and then waiting some period of time and then layer that day doingsana again they did not see the same increase in growth hormone both times first they got a big increasing growthhormon and then less if they distant again if they had people do exercise and then sand what they found was exercise could stimulate growth hormone but then falling it with sand did not allow you to get twice as much growth hormone in general any time your release growth hormone you reduce the likelihood that your going to release growth hormone again later that day and this partially explains that earlier study where if people did this growth hormone promoting protocol on day one but then on day three that didn't see quite as big in a fact an on e seven they didnsequit as big effect all a basing boils down to is that if you really want to crank out the most amount of growth hormone response to sand do it fasted or at least not having invested any food in the two or three hours before you do not have to be deep into a fast and the whole notion of what breaks a fast is kind of an interesting conversation because it is contextual right will asipicoffee break your fast well may be probably not will one grain of sugar and break your fast no will a an entire candy daybreak your fast yes it has to do with where your blood locos is when you invest that particular food dam not much what that food item is person but the bottom line here as if you want o crank out the most amount of growth hormone get wait a couple of hours after eating before getting into the sand maybe do it before dinner and then prepare dinner do the sand before dinner that is then prepare dinner then eat dinner and then make surethat you wait a feu hours before going to sleep you are going to have to arrange your schedule accordingly i know most people can arrange are scettual perfectly just to get growth hormone increases nor do i think people should approach health photo calls that way i think for ninety percent of people ninety per cent of the time just getting into the sand once or twice or three times a week is going to be beneficial for the number of reasons that i described earlier and you do not want obsess too much about the exact conditions you need in order to get the greatest effect at of that sand treatment these are just some additional weeks related to food and take and low level hypoglycemia and exercise that if you wanted to leverage you could if decreases in body temperature tend to aid the transition o sleep and getting out of a hosanna tends to promote decreases in body temperature it make sense why you would want to put your sand exposure or other deliberate heat exposure in the second half of your day and maybe even right before sleep now regardless of what time of day you dhyana or how frequently you do it you're going to want to hydrate after going in the sand when you go in the sand you lose water and when you lose water you need to replace it why well you need water for all yourselves but you also need electrolyte make sure that your replacing the water that you lose in the sand now there is no exact formula of how much water to drink and whether not you need electrolights in that water or not is going to depend on how much you sweat meaning how heat adapted you are it is going to depend on how much salt you tend to it sure e in your sweat huge amount of variation but in general one way to approach thus would be to make sure that you drink at least sixteen ounces of water for every ten minutes that you happen to be in the sand you count o that before enduring end after you count o it during and after or you could do it after now there are other reasons to do deliberate heat exposure that have nothing to do with cardiovascular facts nothing do with growth hormone or anything of that sort but rather have to do with improvements in mood and mental health in fact the data related to sand and other deforms of deliberate heat exposure improving mood are very impressive both that the mechanistic level and in terms of the long term consequences that people experience first of all we need to ask how is it that deliberate heat exposure can improve our mood and well being while it turns out that it improves mood and well being but it also improves are capacity to feel good in response to things that would ordinarily make us feel somewhat good now this is not a situation where you are going to be walking around grinning er to ear in response to nothing at all simply because you went in a sand what i am talking about is the regulation of pathways meaning chemical pathways in your brain and body that allow you to experience pleasure in all its fullness hears how this whole deliberate heat exposure sand mood thing works many of you have probably heard of in orphans and organs are a category of molecules that are made naturally in your brain and body and that are released in response to different forms of stresses that is right in response to stressed ever you have gone out on a long run and at some point that run you feel your aching in your joints heard may be of shin spins and you push through that part of the reason that you experience a lack of pain at some point usually or you experience a fora during or after that exercise is the exercise induced effects on endorphin release or rather to be more specific i should say the exercise induced consequences on the stress system which in turn trigger the release of endorphin in other words when we experience short term or acute stress the endorphin system is activated and the endorphin system is not pious about feeling good believe stare not it is also about feeling bad and the two general categories of endorphins the first are the ones that you normally hereabout in orphans things that bind for instance to receptors the me opioid receptor opioid are not just prescribed compounds or unfortunately drugs of abuse which they are right we have this opioid crisis in the united states and elsewhere which is a very serious and tragic thing but we make indigenous opioid we make endorphins that naturally act as pain relievers and that make us feel mildly euphoric we also make in orphans such as dinorphan that is d i n o are p h in din orphan that actually make us feel worse in response distresses when we get into a hot sand or a hot environment of any kind dinorphans are liberated in the brain embody and i shall mention that dinorphans are made by many groans in many different areas of the brain might think well by what i want that why woald i want of release dinorphan into my brain body well first of all when you get into an uncomfortably hot situation uncomfortably hot scenario on gashthis is sounding terrible and a deliberately hot environment that you are using to try and triggerrsome sort of biological or psychological benefit i should say the discomfort that you feel the desire to get out of than that environment is in part the consequence of the release of dinorphan it is also the consequence of the activation f that sympathetic nervous system remember the preopticarry a can communicate with the eidola and trigger that on fight or flight soda won get out of the sand this is really really hot but dinorphan is also liberated from a certain number of anurans dinorphan binds to what is called the cap receptor the caper receptor binds dinorphan and triggers pathways in the brain en body that lead to agitation to stress and believe it are not to a general sense of pain this is why you want to get out of the hosanna and remember if it is unsafe levels of hot than you should get out of that sand or other hot environment but if your working in arrange are your exposing yourself to arrange of heat that is uncomfortable but safe to be in dinorphan will be liberated from these groans bind to the cap receptor and as a downstream consequence of that there will be an increase in the receptors that bine the other endorphins the endorphins that make you feel soothed that make you feel happy and that make you feel mild euphoria there been a number of study showing that initially deliberate heat exposure banana or otherwise causes the release of dinorphan in fact i think it is fair to say that every time we get into a hot environment that is uncomfortable or a cold environment that is uncomfortable dinorphan is likely released and binding the cap receptor but over time that binding of dinorphan to the caper receptor leads to downstream changes in the way that the feel good endorphins things endorphin binding to the myopia receptor and there are still other feel good endorphins to speak that system becomes most much more efficient such that people feel an elevation in their baseline level of mood and when a good or happy event comes along they feel a heighten level of happiness or joy or awe or improve mood in response to that this is not unlike the effects of coffin on the opening receptor that have described previously and for those ye the aren't familiar with it many of you drink caffeine and love it part of the reason you love it is because of the release of certain chemicals norupenefran et camera the energy that it gives you may be the ta waste i would hope as well but coffin ingestion also causes increases in opening receptor concentration and efficacy inotherwors it allows the receptors for dopamine to work better that for a given amount of opening release you experience more pleasure and motivation this is a similar mechanism but within the endorphin pathway what does it mean it means that a little bit of discomfort as a consequence of deliberate heat exposure while in the short term does not feel good by definition it is activating pathways that are allowing the feel good molecules and normal circuitry's that exist in your brain and body to increase their efficiency placing you in a better position to be joyful in response to the events of life i confess on very excited about the data on deliberate heat exposure and improvements in the chemical systems that underlie good mood and just to underscore this further the dinorphan system is not unique to heat indue stress in fact there beautiful studies and reviews out there about the role of dinorphan in stress and depression in stress and alcoholism just as a brief aside and in the future we will do a hole episode on alcohol and alcoholism but turns out that chronic alcohol use and alcoholism causes changes in dopamine receptors that make it very difficult for people to achieve pleasure through things other than alcohol and even alcohol that is count of the you really diabolical nature of a diction which is the thing that initially brings pleasure eventually is just required to maintain baseline levels of dopamine and have talk before and doctor onalemci when she was a messed on this podcast talked about the pleasure plan balance that exists within the dopamine system is beautifully described in her but dopamine nation by the way excellent book i recommend to all people attics or not well in that contact of pleasure and pain ts very clear what the pleasure molecule is that tesla molecule more related to motivation and that is dopamine the pain molecule however appears to be dinorphan and the fact that dinorphan is deregulated stress in depression and alcoholism and the relationship between dinorphan an dopamine is something that we should all take very seriously and for that reason ism very excited about the fact that deliberate heat exposure and leverage o the dinorphan system in a short term in n acute way that allows mood to improve after the son exposure for those who that do not heat exposure keep in mind that a lot of the observe positive effects on our biology relate to metabolism cardovascla function but also mental health and along those lines there is a wonderful study again published in twenty eighteen i donor i gas twenty eighteen was a big year for a the liberate heat exposure studies a the the title of this study is son a bathing and risk of sync comic disorders and this was a prospective cohort study again will provide a link to this study it is a really interesting study that explored the relationship between mental health people suffering from various forms of psychoses skis affrennianother forms of psychoses an use of sand sensually what the study did is they looked at a very large number of subjects more than two thousand subjects who had no history of psychotic disorders they were classified into three groups based on their frequency of sand use either once a week two to three times per week or for to seven times per week this should call to mind that earlier study on all risk mortality and cardiovascular event risk and then they explored the hazard ratio for psychosis specifically meaning how likely it was that people would develop psychotic symptoms or flyblown psychotic a illness according to the frequency of son session again this is not causal this is correlative and according to the date on the study what they concluded is that there was a strong and inverse independent association between frequent son bathing and the future risk of psychotic disorders in this population this does not mean that going to son seven times per we is going to prevent people from becoming schizophrenic necessarily or from having a psychotic episode necessarily end of course frequent son use will be related to other health promoting activities but in this study as in the previous study they went to great lengths in order to try and limit this called confounding variables now courses is just one study and again its correlative not causal but based on the large number of subjects they included plus the rigor of the statistical analysis we strange to see a general picture that using the sorts of son protocols that have described throughout this episode might five to twenty minutes or done one to seven times per week is associated with a general improvement in cardiovascular health a general improvement in mental health and it really points to the fact that yes sand done acutely for three or four times a day thirty minutes each session separated by a cooling may be getting into combat sure that can potently increase growth harmony but done on a more regular basis can reduce cortical improve hearthealth improve mental health and for that reason and the fact that for most people it is conceivable to come up with a way that you could get into deliberate heat exposure for a minimum of cost right it is a hot bath or if you had to resort to bundling up and going for a jog this sort of thing or if you have access to it son of some sort that wee really talking about a stimulus to initiate a large number of different biological cascades that weak out to improve multiple aspects of brain and body health some until now i have been talking about whole body heating for instance putting your whole body into the son which of course is what most people do or getting into a hot top or hot bath up to your neck or in the cases where we were talking about deliberate cold exposure as a means to increase corer body temperature in metabolism getting into an ice bath or cold water of some sort up to your back are into a cold shower et camera now i to talk about deliberately heating or cooling specific parts of the body meaning certain surface areas of your body as a means to get affects on those particular areas as well as at the whole body level numerous timesthroughout this episode i have talked about the dangers of over heating what should you do if you think you or some one else is hyper thermic is too hot well if you understand just a little bit about the cooling in heating systems of your shell and core there are some terrific tools that you can use in order to cool off your for quickly and remember the core consists of the nervous system the spinal sort in the viscera which are really the organs your trying to protect being able to cool of the core of your body quickly can be very beneficial and in some case it could even save your life there is a way to more quickly heat or cool the body and that is through specific elements of your shell meaning particular skin surfaces have talked extensively about this in the episode on cold it was also covered in the episode with my guests doctor crag heller from the biology department at stamford it relates to the called galaborauts skin surfaces on the upper half of our face palms of our hands and the bombs of our feet and for those areyouther heard this before i encourage you to continue to listen none the less because to day ism going to talk about specifically how to heat the body or cool the body through these glazer skin surfaces very briefly the mechanism is as follows the palms of our hands the bombs of our feet in the upper half of our face overlie specific types of musculature meaning specific types of veins and arteries that do not have capillaries between them and as a consequence heat and cold can move very quickly from the palms of the hands the boys of the feet in the upper half of our face and change our core body temperature there is a name for these particular vascular structures that are called alias or artery venous astemosies basically veins and arteries interacting directly without capillaries in between which allows cooling of blood or heating of blood much more quickly than as possible by applying cold or heat elsewhere on the body where capillaries intervene between veins and arteries these a vas arteriovenous stenoses can be leverage to cool off your cop body temperature very quickly the key thing is to get the palms of your hands the boys of your feet and the upper half your face contact with a cold surface or fluid that is cold enough to cool the blood and the core of your body but not cold that it constricts the veins just below the palms of your hands bags of your feet or the upper half your face not placing ice packs necessarily but may be placing cool towels on the boys of feet the palms of the hands an the upper half of the faced as they warm up replacing those with other cool tells the exact temperature will depend on how hot you happened to be i cannot know that without knowing your particular circumstances if you to learn more about how to cool off your core very quickly and some of the details and some of the technologies that are being developed to do that pile see the episode i do with cragheller or the episode on cold if you do not want to go to those episodes here's a good procedure that you could use you could grab for instance a package of frozen rocky or frozen blueberries if some one is really really warm make sure they take off their shoes and socks get their feet on top of those i really get some into their hands as well get some cool compresses and get them on to people's face you could of course also put a cool compress on the back of the neck on the top of the head that would be an especially good idea if some one were hyperthermia because of the way that cooling of the brain occurs under conditions of hyperthermia but the key point here is that just putting cold compresses or cold materials on to somebody is torso is not going to be as efficient as cooling those glazer skin surfaces the bags of the feet the palms the hands in the upper half of their face similarly or i suppose to be more accurate i should say conversely there are times when it is desirable to heat the core of the body and once again just simply throwing a hot towel over somebody is not going to be the most efficient way if some one is hypothermic their too cold it is not a problem to cover them with a blanket but ideally what you do is you use some warm object or warm fluid to warm the bottoms of their feet their hands and the upper half of their face of course not warm that you burn those skin surfaces this is actually been examined in studies from the heller lab turns out that for instance you get people out of anesthesia it is beneficial to warm their corody temperature and of course there is fever which you should know is an adaptive response while fever is uncomfortable and in fact often involves a mismatch between our perception of our shell and perception of our for temperature in other words there are times when our body temperatures really high we have a fever and yet were shivering were cold and that is because under conditions of fever the immune system liberates certain molecules that impact and in some ways intentionally disrupt the preopticary the pe away and the way at normally functions that it can override pure rural signals and simply try and heat the body and kill whatever package in has infected the body for those of you that think about fever is always a bad thing it is not now of course we do not want our corody temperature to go high that tissues of the brain body or damage this is one reason why if a fever ever goes you know above a under and three you need tho start getting a like bit worried under and fore there are times when you need to call an ambulance to go to hospital youreallean to employ cooling m methods of the sort that i talked about before to prevent hyperthermia course safe ranges for body temperature very between infants and adults we can look those up on line depending on the persons age what is a safe range what is not but keep in mind that if you're taking compounds pills to reduce your fever you are actually short circuiting the protective mechanism for burning up the pathogen and that is because most pathogens bacteria viruses do not survive well at high temperatures in fact in laboratories if we want to preserve of iris for use we put it into a freezer if we want to kill a virus we want we heat inoculate it in many ways fever is your natural form of heat and ovulation design to kill packages of various kinds now last but certainly not least i want a referred to the study that i described at the very beginning of this episode involving what is called local hyperthermia in order to trigger a number of biological processes in fat tissue in order to convert white fat to base fat which is the metabolically active form of fat many of you or at least some of you should be familiar with the fact that deliberate cold exposure can increase brown fat stores these mitochondrial dents fat stores that can in turn allow a person to feel more comfortable in cold temperatures water or otherwise and increase cormetabolism i talk about this in the episode on cold but very briefly the general protocol again is to get eleven minutes total per week of uncomfortable yet safe deliberate cold exposure either through ice bat coldchower cold it immersion up to the neck or some other form of cold exposure that triggers increases in brown fat that is been beautifully shown by doctor hosanna sober and that increase in brown fat in turn increases cormetabolism and one's ability to feel comfortable in cold temperatures this was a study done in humans and there now ample evidence from animal models to support that this is a general phenomenon i think most people could use in benefit from local hyperthermia is a distinctly different phenomenon it involves heating a particular surface of the body as a way to convert the white fat at that location to base fat which in turn leads to more systemic increases in thermogenesis and increases in metabolism and believe are not in fat loss now the study that i referring to is a very recent study that was publish again in this terrific apex journal cell suppress journal and again one of the three top journals nature science an cell a r the three top journals top because there the most compete but also generally not always but generally the most stringent in terms of the re view process papers that make it into these three journals generally of are very very high quality and certainly enough people see them that if they're not of huh quality they get shot down pretty quickly and at a short amount of time whereas papers and other journals can sometimes last a long time before wherever replicated et camera the title of this paper is local hyperothermiatherope induces browning of white fat and treats obesity this was a study that was performed on mice end humans in the same study what the study involved was heating of a local patch of skin to forty one degree sepsis which is a hundred and five point eight degrees ferenheite but not damaging the skin case they the methods of heating did not involved placing something on the skin that would damage it in fact in the study on the mice they use this and a clever molecular om chicanery in order to do it and in humans they used a thermocouple that would allow them to heat the skin up a just locally in particular locations on the body they'll talk about in a moment they referred to this process as ell h t or local heat therapy the reason they did this is worth considering it is long been known from clinical data end in fact from bit of research data that people that experience burn on a small or unfortunately in some circumstances significant portion of their body experience over all decreases in body fat and increases in metabolism that can last many years now of course is not reasonable nor would one ever want to induce burn in order to induce fat loss but the observed increases in metabolism and fat loss in response to skin surface burn could not be explain by reductions in activity related to the burn for instance end in fact there are molecular pathways related to something called u c p one which is uncoupling proline one i talked about this also in the cold episode but do not worry if you did not see that episode if you choose not to u c p one has the ability to increase might a cordial function in ways the increased for body temperature over all in particular in age and brown fat which are these fat cells that exist generally along our spine and in particular in the upper part of our back and around our neck and clavicle and their responsible for acting as as sort of a a candle er i should say the the fuel or the fat of a candle that can be burned up to manufacture heat in the body if you normally think about fat anything about blubbery fat your thinking about white fat which again is just a story sight base fat and brown fat existed just a few locations mainly internally around our spinal cord and are clavicle and those fat stores are responsible for generating heat in our body they very metabolically active form of fat small children have a lot of brown fat and age fat in particular because very young children cannot shiver number of you probably do not know that but very young children cannot shivers of they need some way to generate heat in order to make sure that they stay alive if they were ever to get cold this is also probably the reason why locates can run around on a cold day outside without their hurt on and the only even seem in notice re adults or freezing cold as we get older the amount of basin brown fat tends to either reduce or shrink or disappear entirely it still debate d which happen s but we know that white fat can be converted to this more metabolically active form of bash fat by deliberate cold exposure according to the protocol i talked about earlier and now it seems based on this new study that local heating of skin tissue can also induce u c p one and the effects of u c p one on increasing metocondra and in fact that local hyperthermia forty one degree calcium that is hundred five point eight degrees ferenheite can actually induce the conversion of white fat to bash fat now that is pretty interesting and i can already predict the way this is probably inner in the can a wellness and bilehacking in longevity communities ism sure that pretty soon the are gong to be people putting heating pads on different fat pads of theirs on their body trying to reduce or at least convert the white fat in the be fat and who knows may be tattle work there have not been many controlled studies of this yet this is the first at least to my knowledge of such studies looking at this in non burn conditions none the less the data are mechanistically even more interesting than this whole business about u c p one and hers why local hyperthermia using the protocol that i described before resulted in the increase of a promoter which is a essentially a mechanism by which certain genes regulate their activity this is a d in a binding of something called h s f one we do not have to go to deep in the mechanism here or the nomen cloture but h s f stands for h shock factor one an h s f one binding to a particular location in the gene allowed for a different molecule with a very long name ill just tell it to for for but you can just let the numbers and letters stream bides not important h and are n p a to b one shorten to a to b one which frankly is not that short to begin with to b one still a name that should be meaning lest to most everybody but hears what is really cool to b one is directly involved in glucose and lipid metabolism and regulates the genes that control glucose and lipid metabolism here we have a situation where local heating of skin converted a metabolically sluggish or inactive sceltype the white fat cell in to the metabolically charging to speak bush fat cell which in turn led to systemic meaning body wide increases in metabolism through two mechanism one mechanism is this increase in u c p one which for those of you that wan to know u c p one causes shifts in the way that potential energy is pushed from the protons through the mitocondrapasily more meticondrual function which means more a t p which mean sells a more active a c a increase metabolism end increases in things chock factor one and to b one which are involved in lipid in glucose metabolism an regulation i want to be very clear this study does not say that spot reduction is p possible with local heating of tissue i just conceive it now that once this paper gets out into the press people are going to say oh heating up a certain patch of skin is going to burn fat or convert fat to some other teletype at that location sorry that is not the way it works they did observe increases in age fat cells at certain locations in the body but those increases in age fat occurred where be fat sells always reside around the spine the upper neck the clapvicals and on this is exciting because it provides yet another potential mechanism in addition to deliberate cold exposure to increase age fat meaning the metabolically active form of fat see it also nicely provides a mechanism re at least a potential mechanism for the observation that burn either small patch of skin being burned or again sadly large patches of skin being burned leading to these very extreme and very long lasting increases in body fat loss and metabolism what if anything should you do with this information while first of all i want to very much caution people about putting anything hot that it can damage the surface of your skin on to your skin that would be a terrible idea however i do predict to time not too far from now where people will start to explore the use of local skin heating as a means to increase the conversion of white debate fat and in turn for age fat stores to increase metabolism over all and maybe even improve locos metabolism and thermogenesis if you more details about this study we will provide a link to it in the shownotes caption i should mention that the study least the portion of the study that was focused on humans involved roughly equal numbers of males and females the subjects followed their normal daily schedule including time and composition meals they say rest in active hours et center et camera the local hyprothermiatherapy was done in the following way here on paraphrasing from their method section the subjects were seemed an upright posture they were waring a standard test robe with the head and neck and shoulders unclothed and one meter away from a thermal imaging camera which could easily measure the temperature at their skin surface to make sure that it remained constant across subjects and yet safe the superclaviculer fat deposits meaning the upper shoulders and upper back area were exposed to this thermal source again forty one degrees for twenty minutes as forty one degrees for twenty minutes and their cortemperatures and skin temperatures were monitored before and after this local hypothermic therapy the subjects were exposed to this local hyprothermiatherape three days per weak separated by day money wednesday and ferias they ad weakens off for five weeks total after which their data were collected and the study has a number of other really interesting features that are sure to lead to increased understanding of both mechanism and new protocols such as analysis of the genes and propenes that are activated downstream of this local hyprothermiatherapy i find these date incredibly interesting in part because of the ways that local hypothermia therapy mimics deliberate cold exposure therapy same downstream mechanisms you c p one and some of the other pathways are involved and all of that points to a somewhat new but certainly an important concept many view h probably heard of horses which is the subjecting of oneself or others i suppose to enough stress to induce an adaptation of some kind hormesus is the reason why if you get into cold water repeatedly at first it is very painful psychologically and overtime you get used to it you never at completely as to it we get more used to it hormesis is also used to describe the adaptation to cardiovascular exercise or to the hard rep sets of resistance training and the growth of muscles or the strengthening a muscles or the improvement in party of vascular function tor endurance exercise and forth hormisis is a somewhat common term nowadays if you have not heard it now you heard it in this paper they describe what is called mite for mess which is in essence the fact that any number of different stressful stimuli provided they active ate u c p one and some of these other pathways that have just described a chi of one can induce changes in the mitochondria that lead to increases in metabolism it should not surprise us that cold an heat can both lead to increases in metabolism and conversion of white fat to a shat it should not surprise us because both pathways or stress local hypothermia is stress burn certainly is stress sand is a form of stress deliberate cold exposure is a form of stress exercise is a form of stress and the adaptation to those stresses is not infinite all of those protocols any protocol for that matter is going to be effective because it is going to converge on in existing internal biological mechanism there is no unique mechanism for each protocol each protocol that have talked about today whether its five minutes a twenty minutes are four times in a day or three times per week or seventies per week is tickling or pushing or stomping if you will on a given pathway in really activating it to a milder to severe degree what have tried to do to day is to illustrate the general mechanisms by which heat in particular can activate certain biological pathways that you can devise protocols that are going to be optimal for you in your needs suggest a briefly recap if you want to get the greatest growth hormone increases do sand or other deliberate heat exposure fairly seldom probably no more than once per week may be even less and do it a lot that day just make sure that you break it up in multiple sessions and the study i described really they did for sessions thirty minutes each but that was just once a week if your incite in the cardiovascular benefits and the potential longevity benefits of sand we ell then it is clear that doing it three to four may been seven times per week is going to be more beneficial than doing it just one or three times per weep it stands to reason that for those of you interested in the general health effects of sand about an hour per week broken up in tho three sessions makes the most sense passed on my great of the data and again that range of eighty to a hundred degree sepsis is going to be your guide and in terms of the mental health benefits it seems that getting a little bit uncomfortable in that heat environment sooner otherwise provided t safe is going to be the best way to access those mental health effects by way of increasing dinorphen which as you recall will then increase the ability of endorphin to have its plosive effects on mood after you get out of the sand or other deliberate heat exposure and in terms of timing after a work out of any kind morning or afternoon or if you are not doing it after a work out certainly in the later part of the day is going to be most beneficial as it relates to sleep but of course is a caviar there which i mention again which is that for those who you have no trouble sleeping cause your exhausted or your just going to these phenomenal sleepers well then do it any time of day or night but for most people doing it later in the day is going to be more beneficial because of the post son a cooling effect and the relationship between cooling by a degree or more as a way to enter sleep thank for joining me to day for my discussion about the science of heat and heat ting for health if you are learning from and

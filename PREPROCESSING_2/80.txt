seventeenth century and cominitski the largest serum was of course the holiest will since the polices the largest serum against news took place on october seventh of this year when some one thousand five hundred is rallies were murdered by comas derris since that serum we have been told by our great thinkers the compass brutality requires context never mind that body camfootage from comes terrorist reportedly included footage of comas killing a father putting the father's baby in an actual oven and then burning its death and repeatedly raping the mother while all this went on according to our suit intellectuals commons terrorists invading peaceful villages and slaughtering babies and raping women and shooting entire families they were not truly engaging in a pogrom they were in the words of somewhat colombia university professors engaging in a military action they were in the words of some of our suit intellectuals engaged in a project of decolonization no a many of our thinkers the commons magnum was not really aby killing news it was actually about settlement in sudan maria the west bank this about the break down of negotiations with the palysinian authority the massacres where anti israel they were antizianist not antiseptic and yet the pogroms against news continue on sundae mobs of angry procomoss pagrumasts stormed the airport in the russia republic of dagastan

the tarmac where this flight was supposedly landing from tellies on hear the aloguac tires of course som eighty three per cent of dagastan is mole and practice they are literally going to the doors looking for news trying to break through doors looking for news right own is what serums look there running through the airport into private areas of the airport obviously people telling them their no news here does matter the stolooking and then they would finally make their way out on to the karma a and a they are looking for news an mean they the to partictatly smart some of them are looking for news in the actual engine which would be a heard placed it i fine the news guise thisin't the evacuation of have ganistandor anything but they were not being particularly shed about what they were doing in the words of this particular perron perpetrator he was there to kill news me yes some wiry here says i came for the news e yes the kills and i connecticentys well you care the the night these are chilled show me the highway did you come here ya wish youiay machine on a came here for the news din you yes o stay here till morning understand the bagrummas also held signs reading we are against jewfish refuge es and child killers have no place in tagastand according to the mascot times local media report that some of the agamas rashly stopping cars outside the reports to quote check the personal identification documents of drivers and passengers as they search for is daily citizens among the motors an in fact you can see this mob going around rocking cars they attack to bus as well here they are grabbing a car rock backing fort that is actually a police car and they are rocking back and forth loot's a delightful group of people the people who think just you obviously they also attack hobos their children on the bus here's no news anywhere here by the way does not matter the mere rumor of junks sent them in to a spasm of violence en out children the bus are trying ton they are looking on wondering what the all is going on mobs a round tagastan have been going round hotels looking for news trying to break into rooms owe the rules doing hotels that you they were literally checking people's cars they we ask them for i see papers to show that they were not jewfish they're asking people for their passports is thin in see their paper now dagastans population is largely muslin they been radicalized for years hey radicalized both by their authorities and by their religious leaders the magnums aware not going to end in dagastand all over the world demonstrates are appearing by the hundreds of thousands baying for jewfish blood here for example is footed from onion over the weekend this is one hundred thousand people walking through the heart of onion chancing slogans antiseptic slogans about the slaughter of news look at the size of this crowd sere all people imported to the west under the thenar misimpression that all cultures are the same and everyone will be equally likely be an excellent western civil and citizen some of the allies we are chancing here some of some some here from the rapiers in travel a square and i will inform you at their chancing they're chancing a hear hear yayahood what is that mean that is they slogan referencing at mahammeds slaughter of the news of hear a city in the corn again that is in the middle of onion here they are again in onion chancing about the love of martyr them they're chancing here by sol and blood we sacrifice ourselves for you coxa it in the middle f wester have the thing with our blood we will liberate aloha never mind the fact the aloe an mas a son of control the s on iguana an israel that is matter at all now here is the story the story the jewfish people it is a story of serums from pharos to layman to compass were told in the aftermath of the worst programming history the polices that the world would never allow it again never again we are til well it turns out that much of the world was just line long as the proposed serums our company by some political context but drums against the news are just fine not only are they find nationally have to continue in fact israel a state created with the explicit promise to protect to news against such serums must allow such programs to continue in the name of human rights that is why the international community right now calling for a sense fire against comas because too much of the international community fifteen a hundred news slaughtered for the crinoline news they do not count the jewfish state and the news have to just absorb at that loss will pretenlecan never happen those at they are gone and forgotten all that was three weeks ago guises who was three weeks ago the baked babies and the ranked women and the kidnapped where still under the tender mercies of compass israel has to leave comes in place in the name of humanity in the me of the children after all if the news were not being quite pity in their own self defense would news be targeted in tagastan ain reality the programs never went away they were just minimized because the state of israel and its allies were considered strong but now israel and its allies they seem week they seem vulnerable in the aftermath of october seven and jewhators now believe the news everywhere are vumerbol and here is the thing news everywhere we will be vulnerable long as israel and the west are week hin just the second we will show how how week the west is and that they are literally going propaganda efforts in the media ism behalf of comas to truly is an amazing thing to watch first pure talk recently announced they would alleviate ten million dollars in veteran debt by veterans day thanks your support last week they are seventy four per cents that gold with two weeks to go think about this the just military is made up of one hundred percent volunteers these are men abdomen who willingly sacrifice everything they have for the country and

slash pro switch to pure take to waits the right move its the america way by way the coverage is excellent an the same towernetwork is one of big guise their coverage is great plaster saving money play our popping out veterans there is a lot they are alike but ta pure took mom slasher pure tody to get started that is pure talk dot cam slash chipiro today the reason why the we is proceed as we is least in part because of the media mean truthfully speaking met the western media there justagarbacy they will ad it the truth but in back handed fashion for example right now we keep peering about the plate of the poor palistinian people living in gaze and yes they have a horrible plate it it turns out that it is terrible to live under a government the elected that touch of terrorists it turns out that this a really really terrible thing nobody seems to care about that for solidly twenty years and then the minute that comas launched the most murderous attack inches since real or too and then israel retaliated suddenly be comes israel responsibility to protect comes civilians he hers the thing america civilians they are the responsibility of the america government brutish civilians there a the responsibility of the brutish government and comasivilians are the responsibility of the comascoverment to what exactly is comas doing for its own smiling the answer of course is nothing the near times which has been covering for comas throughout this conflict printing actual propagation behalf of comas including the li that these rallies killed five hundred people at a hospital when it turns out that it was a is fired palistinian is lomacihot rocket that may be killed a couple dozen people and don't even know that because is comas getting the stay l it the same year times the prince awful idiotic columns by people nicholas kristov to nicholas kristov has a piece to day called we are over paying the price far sin we did not comment andthat is a quote from palastinians and here is what nicholas kristov says moral idiot in nicholas kristov a person who again you want a show your neck to terra is a great way for the west to do it f the most consequential decision israel will face in the coming days how hard to continue hitting gaze should not undertake a month's long ground invasion continue with large skilled ariel bombardment allow fuel into gossip keep hospital's running over the lass we give spent reporting in israel and wetback have tried to listen and learn to f respell we should note he is not reporting from gaze wise nicholas kristovnot porting from gaze because comas controls gaze comas controls gaze all they do is allow you to report what they want you t report but he is a happy to run round israel museum let me sher we believe sudden that willow back at this moment an yep profound moral and policy failure says nicholas crista what exactly is the profound moral and policy failure the profound moral and policy failure is not stopping the news from defending themselves he says to conclude his column quote the united nations secretary vernal atonal gluten's has condemned what h called clear violations of international humanitarian law we are w nosing in goa the bid administration which in the contact to your can constantly speaks venter national law ruder to security council resolution calling for humanitarian pauses to deliver ad every accounts have heard from gaze this past week including directly from people that who despise comas suggest the civilian tole has been heredes one gages that at least fifty three you an staff members ha been kilos fir in clouding teachers and engineer a psychologist and a myna colonist and now the suffering in gaze is set to get much worse that is partly because hospitals are running out of deal fuel and israel is not allowing feel into the territory i understand the reason says nicholas khristov come ass cut us nasal fuel for its attacks on his rallies and israelitary in frailly military spokesmen also told me the you an alarmist may be exaggerating the borages however says at nicholas crista israel faces an agonizing it challenge a neighboring territory is rule by well armed terrorist well committed unimaginable atrocities amdicment more and now shelter and tunnels beneath the population more than two million people it is a nightmare but the sober question must be what policies will reduce the rest not in flagman where honoring the intrinsic value of palisinian life as well as this railway life people want answer that question in different ways says moral exemplar nicholas kristov and i do not claim to have all the answers but i think some that we will look back in for at both the comosspbutchery an israel and at the worsening tell of suffering and goa in which we are complicit you see according to nicholas khristov the wast in allowing israel to kill terrorists yin saying that israel should in fact wipe komosovf the map is just as bad as moms pure moral equivalence who loves that stuff love that comas common who loves it they love it because cares literally zero about painting into millions come of the don't care at all about them but they know that you care about them and if the idea is that they get to survive by abusing their own citizens and youorgaen go long that well you have been complicit in the continual rule of a terrorists group which is the alternative there's not a third alternative come they the goes or comes states there is no there is no third move here get to more on this unjust one second be again the west constantly bearing

mafia a patrician a comma adman hospital in northern gaze called ism a pediatrician an goa please save us from this horror i crack there is literally no mention of anything commentate in this piece nothing zero mention of it and theourare times printed it because of course the idea is that israel is responsible for everything that is going on in the gozesstrip which presumably is also by the united nations as have said before the most sold of international politics o wretched hive of summon villainy voted a hundred and twenty in favor fourteen against forty five abstentions in favor of a

it is getting desperation goa i mean i would imagine its getting desperate gas goodwill that problem to day comas by surrendering that is it all commonness to you is walk out the tans up an hand over

plenty supplies comas is underground with plenty of supplies will get to in just a moment but leave it to the morally blind of the morally obtuse to again promote the interest of comas here is anti

you expect that to happen meanwhile you have other democrats who are trying to warn jobidon into abandoning his roll out include leader of the progressive congressional cocks fro milagiopole whose literally warning jobidon to stop being supportive of those damned news he is i think of you know going can be challenged to explain can issue of this moral significance the people the america people

not the port a war crime exchange for another war crime and i hake the passant house can be careful about that is a war cremiccifa come is desperate to aquavit it is slaughter of babies and rape of women with israel attempting to kill comas terrorists they're desperate for this and the west is giving is them on a platter at least the western left the western left is giving ts them on an absolute

agencies for example our currently you have not heard the story because not important to you man's on important take as not important t the media because i does not involve the news that is the way that let us be real others that is why people care if this involves muscle on muscle issues no one cares none cares that there's been several million syria refugees who have been shuttled back and frothing dorky and serial for yours know cares about that no one no one cares that hundreds of thousands of serious of killing to ben killed by the asterisking in fact brokalom pretended to care that he care little that he handed it over the ruffians well now according to the voice of america you one agencies are warning that pakistan plan expulsion a more than a million one documents od foreign nationals risk triggering a humanorite catastrophe what is happening we apparently pakistan on nonmember one is going to deport one point for million a gas back to the talisman one point for million fans back the talisman apparently the on refuge agency you an h we our reports that pakistan is cruelly holding three point seven million off can refugees seven hundred of thousand of whom at let afghan stand after the talisman take over one points seven million are theme to be in packastany legally pasta says that those wore registers refuges ten enough to worry but every one else is going to be returned two the talisman things are going right not nobody cares about that no one cares about that what is known care about that well because that might mean can knowing pakistan i can can no packaston when we that when one get involved in that that whole problem of an is lonactoc tutorship that masquerades his democracy when one won owning but when it comes to israel if to be oh that that is when that is what human rights concerns it their papas when the news respond the violence against the news and as i say comes could not be more excited about this because they are very clear about what they wanted do and one the most amazing things the homages using to its own benefit is the paternalistic sens that westerners have about third rollers i mean really is an amazing thing they are people t at the comas to says out loud over and over and over we do not care about our sidelines we want our sillies to die were planting tunnels beneath ours t they wait out loud all the time every day and what is is well but really you carabackar shillings and if something was happening to this millions probably its the news probably it is the news i mean here is is mile honest have is the political leader of camass he is living in great style and luxury over in costar where he and his group have embezzled hundreds of millions dollars from their own citizens and here he is saying what we actually need is the blood of more women in children that is what we need e hoorays to stop this war against our children women and the elderly a gotta admasses are universities in our home sin a is brutal aggression must stop off him this new hallo coss dustup by the gall of these people a we have said this before and i say again m a blood of the women on showered and elder all i am not saying that this blood is calling for your help we are the ones to meed this can we need this blood m to wakens within us the revolutionary spirit they need more blood they they need to awaken their own revolution they need dead kids they need dead women in order awaken their own revolutionary spirit and they will achieve it according to the nearer times is an amazing piece from the nearatimes over the we want quote as dozens it s rounds for food and water compass sits on a rich trot of supplies quit at supplies of virtually every basic human necessity dwindling grip one group in the besieged on clave remains well stocked compass arab and western officials say there is substance to his daily claims of comas stockpiling supplies including desperately needed food and fuel compass has hundreds of thousands of gallons of fuel for vehicles and rockets assures of ammunition explosives in materials to make war stockpots of food water and medicine according to officials as senior laziness official said comas which is estimate end to number between thirty five thousand and forty thousand people has enough stock away to keep fighting for three formonths without resupply the arab and western officials who described comes supplies situation spoke on condition of an enmity because they were disclosing in formation glean from human sources the stocks are typically kept under ground and caution that precise details on comssspplies were difficult to come by where the blockade is left gossip roughly two million people scraping by with what little food and water they s grunge up it does not appear to have begun to great compasses ability to fight the supply situation speaks to the relative sophistication of compass as a fighting force and here is the key sentence from the nearatimes it is just an amazing incredible sentence quote yet with dozens facing humanitarian catastrophe comes stockpots raise questions about what responsibility if any it has to the civilian population why would that possibly raise question wet e mean what responsibility do they have to they are the governing party in the goo strip that is saying america during war time this raises questions about what responsibility america has to its own citizens for their safety a you mean that is literally why the government exists hon it comes to comas its easy to be at terra man when you are terrace you can great murder kill your own citizens put them on top of your own bombs and the rest of the world apparently just goes well you now that raises some questions about your responsibility bod in the answer no blame the news in the answer to blame the news mass said little of its supply situation but the government runs in gazes as it has an emergency fuel stud stockpots quickly being to pleaded those feedstock pop are separate from and far smaller then the two hundred eleven thousand to two hundred sixty four thousand gallons of gas and vessel these rallytmilitary says comas has on hand and by the way everybody understands the comas is stealing everything that goes into the gazes trip this notion that israel sending an aid the death not going to take macomaste lie of course it can be taken pajamas and that is what cams has been doing for literally decades another piece in the last few days from end sinews quote the unemployment rain gazes forty seven per cent more than eighty per cents of its population lives in poverty come however has funded an armed force of thousands equipped with rockets and drones and built a vast web of tunnels under gaze estimates of its dance military but tot range from a hundred million dollars to three hundred and fifty million dollars as the of house an sent will be asking in separate hearings wednesdayand thursday where does all that cash come from comas has filled its coffers with hundreds of millions in international aid overt and cover injections of cashomaran and other ideological partners much of the public much the money is public and legal including large financial aid from cater via the in by the way how much money does comas have on hand hundreds of millions of dollars hundreds of millions of dollars maybe billions one thing reported here by enbsinews is that comas has a wide portfolio that they really diversified comes leadership has invested its income in an international investment portfolio worth five hundred million dollars in real estate and other assets from companies n oliguria south suntan turkey and u a which you used to conceal and wander its money according to treasury announcement comasassa supplements its in come with various criminal enterprises for example comas has a presents n the tried border area of south america origin along brazil potoguay and argentina known as a haven for terra an transnational criminal organizations there comas participates in drugs arm and people smuggling naturally this is all israel'sfall right israel the recess fires that israel can take care of the humanitarian situation now i just have a question please name the last war a war for the survival of the state please name the last war in which the chief question was what happens to the civilians where under the control of the opposing side did you hear this at all in the afromathanane eleven how to we open a humanitarian corridor to cobble do you hear this during the warlock how do we open a humanitarian corridor into bagged what was the first order of business you destroy their capacity to make war if you wish to win a war that is the only thing that you can do but again the goal is not here to protect palstonians villains an an because again none of these groups of cared about the predations against palstonians village for twenty years the goal here is to use the palstoning civilians lay comas wants than us as press to stop is real from deposing comas it is that simple that is all that is happening n will that case is taken the form of large scale valleys a rock by your favorite left wing sources remember that time when now everyone on the left suggested that if you said the name gorge sorts this meant your an antisemite it did not meanyour an antisera gorge sorts is terrible he is a terrible person who believes terrible things and fun terrible clauses according to the apropos gorge sorts has funneled more than fifteen million dollars since twenty sixteen to groups behind pro palestine protests where demonstrates openly cheer comas an negro post examination of open society foundations records the records shows sort is grand making network gave thirteen points seven million dollars though the tides center a deep pocket had left the avocet groups sponsoring several one profits have justified comas while lemming palistinians obsessed with the eradication of the sewers state are the real victims tides men officiates include illinois based calla justice project which the day of the october seen massacre posted a photon histogram of a builds or tearing down part of israel word fence and a capture quote is daily colonizers believed they and in definitely trap two million people in an open or prison no cage goes unchallenged and this s gorge sorosis money gorge job is given money to newish voice for peace and if not now both radical left wing organizations that do not represent dues in any serious way and side with comas criticizing gorge sorts is not only not antisemitism it is filo feminism because he backs every anisometric cause that apparently he can find if you are wondering by the way how these giant relics of shaped into place all the way across the action and beyond the the reason is because there is an entire network of people who basicleep professional protestors and a yo have to do his

so con slash men use corban save fifteen per cent off keen meanwhile on the presidential side of the i the republican party continues to have a a pretty not contested primary mean if you look at the pulling date outright now this is not a particularly close election in the national pulling averages and us ben awhile but in the national pulling averages donna trump is currently up fifty nine to thirteen over onto san is nick half at eight per cent of acromasuommy at fourgon five per cent in i true running a similarly large lead the latest i a state simple has trump up fifty five to seventeen over to mantis daily at eleven romasuommy at five shot at four well the field needs to consolidate because the reality is that trump has such a lar lead right now that and unless there is some sort of consolidation he is just on a walk through the field pretty obviously whatever else his foibles and given the fact that the world right now is on fire and the the world was not on fire when donate trump was president his case to be president of the united states again is pretty easy which is shot the hell up and point the guy who is the president again that's a pretty easy case for dona true to make that is seriously all he has to do even if he is bog down now an i was it isn't i was doubtful that got bog down for with four separate trials over the horseman election cycle was going to have an amazing shot of victory but i may have under estimated just have about a president jobidonis o jobidon is really really bad at this and it turns out that he is basely set everything on fire and dona trumps walks back into the room donate glover from that out take from from community that mean from committee walks in everybody's on fire then he might become press unit again well one of the with the felt is consolations that my pence has just drop to outs might pence is really not running a campaign for present he is really running a campaign to justify what he did on canary sex which is to stand up for the constitution it mi pence to the right thing on canary six he did not have the right or the obligation under the construction of the united states to reject states certified electoral votes that was not something the is called for by the constitution of the united states he am was speaking at the annual republican just convention in wasfagus and he announced that this was not his time he said he isgingto suspend his campaign for present effective to day ism and then h he gave a bit of speech talking about what he hopes the future of the republican party is in here's sense will republicans continue to be the party a the traditional conservatives that is defined our movement over the past forty years or will our party full of the siren song of populism on more the conservative principles is war rage is in eastern rope and is tree an china continues its provocations in the age of pacific a new populous movement in the republican party says that america should retreat from her leadership position turn inward and focassolely on domestic concerns i do not have to tell people gather here that there are powerful voices within and outside our party that say we have to choose between supporting our allies and solving problems here at home let me say for my heart anyone who says that america cannot solve our problems at home and be the leader of the free world has a pretty small view of the greatest nation on earth thous pence his case and the reality is that pencehis case has now been taken up by pretty much the entire field and there is that there is a bit of exaggerations down going on inside the republican field there is people who saying others a lot of isolationist since had dona trump was not an isolation is president dona trump did not venison tend into any new wars because he was muscular in foreign policy because if you mast with him you did not know feds nofirements late you he squish him anon he kills cossemsily money meanwhile he is to the cunning teal the sorties that is not a not intervention is foreign policy that is a muscular piece of strength foreign policy that is in fact very reminiscent a road pagan's foreign policy froe told about dona trumping wildly conciliatory toward russia his policies on russia were significantly harsher than barocobomas or rockaway literally cut a deal with ladder with dmitri medvadav literally on camera in the run up to the twenty twelve election now that there is a feelings had the republican party this harshly driven by the median by social meeting there the huge gallons from so foreign policy i i do not think that is actually true and o with that is ad feel listen i think the pence is a good man i my pence i know my pence and i think that his service to the country was well worth while an excellent as vice president and and yes i think he of course he did the right thing in canary of two thousand and twenty one by not delaying the certification of the election illegally artoguize the rest of the show is about to continue right now ancon warms it will get into the mail baknansfor some mere questions you are not a member become amber use coach bear o

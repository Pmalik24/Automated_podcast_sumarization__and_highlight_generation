the shosponserbaexpress vepianistime to stand up against bigger protect your data express vipianti come flashes republicans are made giants losing street there aren't losing street for two main reasons first republicans have disconnected themselves from data second republicans have embraced the performative over the substantive first the republican disconnection feedback is the only way to course correct when you are doing anything in life wrong if you refuse to adjust to the data you receive when you take an action you're likely to continue making the same mistakes over and over and over and yet republicans have decided that data r r enemy not that data ought to be questioned and examined and taken with a grain of salt all which is true republicans have entirely obliterated the feedback mechanism republicans very often seem to believe that the echochambers that we have created are some sort of reality that the republican perspective represents a sort of silent majority that the more extreme the redbrick expressed the less public support received the more silent the majority the problem is not disconnection it is that nobody will express their support for the republican position which is what they actually believe now that may be turn certain issues the parent's right movement is great example a broiling under current of hi satisfaction that broke out into the open in virgin in twenty twenty one that poles were not quite capturing but it is not true over all republicans have now created and unfalsifiable theses when we do something that is kind of in popular it is publication till popular because polling does not matter and as it turns out the other form of data feedback elections those do not matter either that attitude has been reinforced over and over again by dona trump because trump one in twenty sixteen despite the data republicans correctly inferred the we systemic problems with the data and that was true in twenty sixteen but then republicans concluded that all data were not merely to be taken with a grain of salt they could be disregarded entirely and tows particularly truth regarded trump if trump one it was because the data were wrong and if you lost the data were still wrong and he had one when trump one in twenty sixteen it is because the data were not to be trusted which was true and when trump lost in twenty twenty it is because the elections were not to be trusted this why trump can keep getting away with losing therepublican party is thatafacto party of donate trump's leadership until somebody else rests it away from him that is to politics works under that leadership republicans have on one election and they have lost five trump's favored candidate have fared uniquely poorly hit is chosen ore an teach a on aroma micdaniel has presided over an unprecedented losing street theproblem is not primarily the data itself theproblem is the republican believe that data no longer can even be used has an important in put in the political system that is reason number one that republicans are losing then there is reason number two republicans are frustrated with our institutions the publicity has become largely performative as you've olive has pointed out our institutions used to shape our leadership class you en to congress in order to become a congress person u would learn how to doe congress you became president then you are shaped by the office you grew into the office instead our institutions have now become platforms for more notoriety that dynamic is reinforced by a commentaries the cheers words and pays very little attention to actions saying the right thing or for get the right thing the most militant thing is deems more important than actually doing the right thing we have been told by our commentary class that the thing republicans lack is courage will power the what we have here is anemia struggle between the dionysian power of dhestrong and the vast under class that hemmed are don't soul leaders but that is not really how politics works posies is rarely about a lack of will power most of politics is about knowing where the levers are and how to work them occasionally yo got a will power issue but a lot of time it is not about will power its about in sense structure republicans seem to enjoy the losing these days they have despaired of ever wining again because the gods are stacked against them they feel that even if they win there still going to lose the deep state will fight them the media will destroy them and here istle thing republicans aren't wrong about any of that but the answer to that is competing not raging not screaming not all capstueets republicans seem to have forgotten that which is why we treat candidate to make loud noises the same way we treat candidate who actually do things and since loud noises matter most and as the canniturns out most america do not really love old noises the problem of performer of politics feeds right back into the first problem the republican disregard for the thebackloup in fact republicans often treat unpopularity as they measure of virtue the more people hat you the more right you must be again that can be true on occasion butts a really bad rule of thumb what can republicans do to win again well first that can start to look at the data again and course correct if america keep saying over and over and over again in five straight sections that they do not something perhaps republican ought to take note perhaps they ought to attribute that not son of various forces that they cannot control butte things that they can that can do something about it their messaging their strategy there unwillingness to stick and move second republicans can start to do things rather than just to say things the answer to charges of malevolence of evil which his democrats favorite charge republicans are always either corrupt stupid or evil an they love the evil argument most the answer to that charge is over performance on behalf of the america people the answer to charges of in competing which is democrats second favorite charge is over combatants be good at your job this is what republicans should be looking for in their presidential candidates especially because jo biding is incompetent now done trump is way ahead of the rest of the republican feeling way a had forty points ahead he embodies both of these republican problems twitter he disregards all the data that by the way can be one of his charms he ignores the wags and he does what he wants sometimes that is fantastic because everybody is wrong in he is right but the problem is that if you apply that rule consistently as the rule of thumb that is a strategy that actually makes defeat more likely and then second of all trump is the most performed a politician in america history which is why many people dislike him trump could theoretically learned from the data he could embrace his own record case actually did a good jobs president rather than the performer of h aspect of his personality that seems really unlikely which means the republicans should at the very least take a look at the other candidate on the table that is what the their republican debate nite wit sop of to be about we will jump into that to bate night in just one second first i got tell you my sleep quality these days is too much going on not sleeping great

last night again i will just point out the democrats are basing their entire elect torn strategy for jobidin around tonal trumping the nominate norther doing because the day to suggest the donate trump is likely going to be the nominate but they are also doing because they ware ill to beat donate trump with the dead man in twenty twenty when they figure is yet he is a dead man with e bad record but he still dead and re publicans are going to i nor the data ad re publicans are on to be performative and that is going to you jobitin frtruet to the basement while donate trump takes hunter stage and the entire democratic campaign is going to be rooted in completely the wildness of donate trump in's yet hilly canton for example yesterday shares on the view still peeved over the fact that you lost to donate trump which again god's justice never sleeps and one o the things that i see an america politics over and over and over again is that everybody kind of gets what they deserve in the end a heltoclin lusted after power her entire life and then she almost hand picture opponent and then her hand picked opponent the most pot the second most unpopular figure in modern america history politically defeated her ism in she got she deserved that lade will ever be president but hilleryes tactic here is the democrat tactic it small i here she is explaining an why trump is bad and this while didn't has to remain president what an your we would happen if he work to me me elect oh i cant even i cannot even think that because i think of be the end of a con create as we know it and i do not say that light wan i hated loosing and especially hat a losing to him because i had things ten warning signals ran campaign but i immediately that luck we have to give him a chance we have got to support the president we have and i meant i and i try really hard and then literally really an inauguration on it was nothing but a using people of things making up fact the denying the size the crowd at is own in operation and everything that i worried about i saw unfolding and to i i think that cannot be even worth now and then she compare him to hitter i that is going to be the democratic campaign the question is whether trump is going to swivel away from that ntelliten i was over competent look it my presidency the stuff i did round present booming economy piece in the middle east a harsh a harsh crack down on russia aggression and all those things really good is been a run that campaign or is aginsteer directly into this thing with people cheering him that is can be the question and that is the question republicans and this is probably i republicans my wont o take a look that is him the candidates now by the polling data what is you real about this the debate last night the third republican debate was the under car debate trump has been able to fly over the rest of the field the entire republican field right now if item a star worst cover is the cover of empire strikes back lunch of action the foreground and giant earth valor in the background a it donate trump is looming over the entire field a huge a huge character in a move poster and the rest the field fighting with each other in the foreground that is what does looks with that said should we take a look at some of the other cant we should not only because it is worth while looking all the candidates but also because it teaches us something about how republicans are approaching matters of politics in general and what the flaws are cay the debate open last night with the intros from each candidate the candidates who are the most woke last night it really was can a three person debate there there couple people on stationobody cares about chis christian them scout the other three people on stage are rondo mantis who is been basically holding position since the beginning of this race he has not groan his his share of the vote in any measurable way he is basely been fairly stable since approximately ow tune jury of twenty twenty three i sing since jury of this year he is been stuck at seventeen percent he still stuck like seventeen per cent nick valley is the person who has seen some growth she is started off con of linked with the rest of the field she is now popped to about fourteen per cent in the i walk caucuses for example and then you have the value romasuame who is still stuck down and fore five percent in is very very loud it he is the loud noises guy in this particular race trump by the way is stop up on thereat of the field by thirty forty points and the national pulling average it goes trump fifty eight the mantis fifteen haply nine romaswuammy for and then everybody else is blow three i here is rondo mantis now again as i say have said this before i think that of the candidates of ill be on the stage rondo mantis the bast hominy why because he is actually complete his job he can point out success is in florist and he can say i did the thing i did the thing is a pretty good campaign slogan i did it it i made my stake better i made my state stronger it's a pretty good campaign slogan that is basically what the sans was doing last night here was now if you look where we are now it is lot this from the we were in twenty sixteen in donate trumps lot different guy that he was in twenty sixteen she own it to you to be on this stage and explain why he should get another chance she should explain why you did not a mexico pay for the border war he should explain why he fact thus which tat he should explain why he did not draw the swamp and he said republicans were to to get tired of timing we saw last night i sick of republicans losing in flowed up i showed u wits don on year a go her we a o win sit right here an my the dad coney right the stasis campaign is basically we bunking these second prom republicans have if prom number one was ignoring the data problem number too was performative over substance to mantis has posed himself as the substance got in one second will gan get to nickel whale's introductory statement first novemberis here the holidays are just a couple of weeks away this season why not give the gift of comfort to

john dot tom slashed that is mommy john dot come slashed to check him out right n out of case the want as introduces himself as the guy who gets things on nick hale she introduces herself as sort of the person who is taking data into account that is really her her stick right her stick is ism looking at the polling ism a busting based on the polling feeling the polling ism very durable an a lot of the swing stakes it that she is trying to go after after republican mistake number one there is no feed backup she saying there is a fee backlog an pangattention o the we backdoor and that is why you ought to vote for me right to do wasting on prong to i do the thing harvesting on prong one i look i look the data here she was last night introducing herself everybody wants to talk about president top i can talk about president chop i can tell you that i think he was the right president at the right time i do not think he is the right president now i think that he put us eight trillion dollars tan at and are kinks er never gan ta forgive us for that i think the fact that he used to be right on you train and and for if she is now we getting we in the geese and trying to be friendly again i think that we've got a go back to the fact that we cannot living the past we cannot in an other had lines were got u tat publicity on what is on to make a america strong and proud again yes she she is the i see the data i see what people want him to give it to them and then finally have t van romswomt the vakeschik is ignoring both visuals right the data do not really matter very much and the performative is all there is that is the van romisuomy story i say that because a vac shifted his position on every single issue in this campaign multiple times but he knows what the base likes to hear i the van romasuamy is the guy he he is basically a tucker carbon sweet come to flesh made flash and and you conceal last night now again do not dis agree with with virtually anything the take is is staying here i just wonder what exactly the take strategy is here for winning a presidential election he is critiques are right and then he has no prescription which is the which is the essence it really is the essence of performed o politics the essence of performing o politics burnisanders does not on light is there is many problems let me tell you about all the promise the is somaeny promise and i hate those promises the really bad probes of public suck man i hate those problems man i was somebody would do some bothers promise luck me that that is effectively what the take was doing last night now again i kind of love to is when he do this la i would it right again ism a conservative have a guttural visceral hatred of legacy media i think they are garbage i think they are liars and i think they deserve every bit of scorn that been heaped upon them in recent years i also recognize this has nothing to d with winning an election this has to do with sort of appealing to the on line base here is he take last night i think there is something paper going on in the republican party here and i am upset about what happened last night we be om a party of losers at the end of the day is a cancer the republican establishment i speak the truth a it since ronomac danio took over as cheer women to the arise and twenty seventeen we have lost twenty eighteen twenty twenty twenty twenty two no red wave that never came we got trounced last night in twenty twenty three and i think that we have to have a count to ability in our party for that macaronic you on come on stage to night you on to look the jet pe voters in the eye and tell in you resign i will turn over my yet my time to you and thank luck the people their cheering for losing in the republican party think about whose moderating this lobate this should be doctor colon jo broke and an melon most we would have ten times the vie worship asking tweskions that jet pee primary voters actually care about the bringing wore people into our party ting the i ti teactwuld actually tire great got fell to to t o democratic debate they would not do it and far the metis i e cristimit is is togas is actually about you in the media and the corrupt media establishment ask you the trunk russia collusion hokes that you pushed on this network for years was that red or was that hilleryclintand made up disinformation answer the question go a billion because this media rake the twenty sixteen election they rid the twenty twenty election with the under by laptop stores an rosanert my this lecture timers o count ability en turn to governor fighter you sot what he says that intirecrity again the critique is largely sorry t r by way when he mentions run iron i dance losing er job which have been calling for for what a year at the split your and half when he says that he is not wrong we should point out by the way the reason that run iron my dance tod not lose for job is because hours supported by wait for ittonnal trump that is why she is still in her job at the are inch and the when he says that here should be it s bate moderate by tucker organ and melon muss that that that sort of a slightly weird take given that the only one those figures who actually has voted republican any time into recent passed is tucker and tucker is job shall we say controversial on foreign policy inside republican halls if you are really do that you need natural to verse basic of sort of ideological people in any case the disconnect is between what he says the eating the criteekue and then his set and then him saying at the end this is how we get our country back what by criticizing the media i mean again ism in that business ism up for it am just wondering is that really but if we let you president the vakromasuammy is your chief goal going to be criticizing me i hurts true to that allot and then he lost actually you are what what your actually going to need here at some point is to take stock of the first you probing data matters and performative politics is not going to be the solution o get then that abate moves on to for policy and this was sort of fascinating there sort of a a try par tight division inside the republican party over for policy you got the very hawkish her of no con position represented by nickel daily and the the sort of middle of the road position presented by ronisantis and then you have the sort of fool scale queasy isolationist position presented by van romasuammy and these are interesting to bates they really are the reality is that i think that the republican party to its great discredit cares very little at this point about policy debates because the reality is we do not know which side the to bate trump is on when trump was actually president hots cant anew con and then when you talking about foreign policy he sounds play and then he sometimes looks lake he is get him all over the place am not sure that policy is actuate the republican party its about but it was an interesting to bat will get to that momentarily first let us talk about again your sleep quality the fact is poor sleep got is what gain mood issues parental health lower productivity sleep is the foundation of our mental and physical halting performance having a consistent night serotine is not negotiable if you are struggling with

for limited time when you go to shop beam dot come slashed use cod ben at checkout that shop b e m dot come slashed useckoben from to forty per cent off that shop beam do come slash ben o gay the debate then moved on to issues of foreign policy they they talked about israel both tenants and hale mired the same perspective which is that combines to get mash which of course is correct here is to mantis last night i would be telling b b finish the job once and for all with these futures m r massacring innocent people they would wit every you off the blow if they could he cannot live with that three right by his country that mama should release e re hostage and they should unconditionally surrender ism sick of hearing the media ism sick of hearing other people blame israel just for defending itself we will stand with israel in word and indeed in public and in private i can tell you as govern actually did something about it gate again that is is back pictures i did something about it that is that is always to mantis pitch and then he got romasuammy slogan evade it he is just a series of twitter impulses that are that are made real here he was talking about israel and then he suddenly swivels and talks about the america border now ism a big fan of of solidifying america border i been going for the america word to be clothesfor for years and years and years in fact as long as i can member talking about the migration debate give talk about the fact that the southern border has been basically unprotected i do not have any ideal at that has to do with israel dstrocomass but here is the aromas warm trains connected to with the implication being the basically cut israel loose in the face of all hits enemies because we need to protect the border or something which again to disconnected issues america can walk an you gum at the same times it turns out the founding vision of israel was based on the idea that they do not want t an not any body else sympathy or direction defending themselves what i would tell be is that israel has the right and the responsibility to defend itself i would tell him to smoke those terrorists on ti southern border and hen it'll tell us present not states ill be smoke in the terrorists on our southern border that is his responsibility this is our responsibility o gay that is a complete evasion of the question is to what level of material support you wish to provide to israel which is the actual question in that to bay and then romasammy went even further again performative performative performative the take dies not on o be present has now intention of being present if a vac ones to run for senate from oho or he won's to run for a dog cast or he wants to be in drums cabinet wont one of those things but here he was last night going off on you crane and again i think that a lot of the criticisms of cranes corruption are absolutely true you crane does have serious eruption promise is had serious corruption probing for as long as you crane has has been in the postsoviat era with that sad this is some pretty wild stop here from vague you crane is not a paragon of democracy this is a country that has bandalevan opposition parties it is con solicited all media into one statevemedia on that is not democratic it is threatened not to hold elections this year unless the guess forksover more money that is not democratic it is celebrated an not the in its right compete an cargo pants a man called kolinsky do it it in their own ranks that is not democratic more facts for you that you want here from the main stream an neither party or the mainstream media the regions of you crane that are occupied by russia right now in the donors haunts done gets these are russia speaking regions that have t not event been part of you crane since twenty fourteen that other people probably could not name those provinces for you those are the hard facts and the trade this is some kind of battle between good verses evil do not buy it n that that that is a wild form policy stands am n again you crane is indeed very corrupt have many many probes to you cranial government when he says that you crane is basically honey combed with notes in terms of its upper ranks the government is honey combed with notes and calls teensy the comedian in cargo pans and when he talks about how the occupied resit regions of of you crane uremia to eats thank that t these are ruffians speaking regions and therefor what that russia had a rights to seize those regions in the first place or when it is e just is not a battle between good and evil well i mean both sides do not have to be purely good in order for a particular battle to be between good and evil and it turns out the invasion of a sovereign country and n attempt to depose the entire country's government on behalf of most vicious dictator in the region that is kind o nock grate that is kind knock gate but again take is the all per formative it is just performative is not actual america form policy no one thinks it is here is nick hale taken him to task over this i am telling you paten and president she are salivating at the thought that someone that could become parrot at first thing it'll tell you is we all remember what that got dead when he invaded you crane we all know that half a million people had died becasetut that that is the basic line that hale to against rooms one and this turned into even more performative easily anything that weak touched in the debate last night be cant performative and this is it is interesting just on sort of in a a political level to watch the gap between to take and the rest of the field the take is playing the politics of per romance art and other people in the field are really not the cantus and hale both would to be president again i think that there can a bumper car each other out i think that the logic of the election suggest that if hale were able to gain enough credibility that she knocked out tho mantis a lot of his support wet then go to trumpet than the election is true well and truly over it may be over anyway but if hale were to knock out to mantis again his twenty per cent is not go to hale his twenty per cent ten person mac goes to clean ten perpend mac goes to trump and elections over if hale gets knocked out presumably nearly all for supportgoes to discants because a lot of her support base is rooted in not particularly warm feeling toward trump but whatever you thing of that internal longest the the sort of gap between the sasin hale on the one hand who actually have been governor is actually do things on occasion and take is really really wide and you can you can see this i mean last night a take and hailed we are going at each other wit wit with hammer and tongs he an he he throwout am insults about hurt her wearing heels and then he made n implication that the san to swore heels which is just can very on line pen of garbage not don't but then he went even further and he went after nickel whale's daughter else is this guys are even serious here here ego why y la whin i cabin in a your question which is about looking at families in the eye an the last the bathe made filmy for act joining tic took shall her own daughter was actually using the at for a long toy bout i ti care your family first we a i here is the truth yo titan our is actually to say that we are just con ban one at we got to go further it is o you have the candidates calling other scum and all the rest of this sort of suffice is that what re publicans one a you ad t certain point puking can have to make truss cud turns out the america people do not shit of the performative if there is one message from this debate and from all of politics for the last several years it is that performative politics only works when you are running against pillory canton that is the only time it works ism sorry maybe the outlier here is not trump maybe the outlier here is killer is that killer with such it dam dislikeable politician and every one hated her for very good reason that literally any per formed of politician could score points officer from barokobama in two thousand eight to burn sanders in to thousand sixteen two dona trump in two thousand sixteen but that is not actually a case for per formant of politics as a mode of of getting things done back o the original message if trump is t a hominy or if the want whoever is t e hominy but assume that its true for second he is on have to go back to the drawing board and he is into have to actually think about what do the data tell him what do the day tell him because he did lose in twenty twenty and our lek she him not lose if he is denominate in twenty twenty four an he is in a half to go back to what is his record what did he do what will he do from here on in not the performative the actual material can just one second again i don't a lot what vakesat last night what he said about the media's a hundred cent from the media are absolute hot disgusting garbage i mean they are just a dumbstore fire of horror it'll explain why i say that particularly in just one second first there is a lot at stake this nonmember do not be a chicken and shop at the grocery store usual instead heat on over two good ranchers they're black fridge your way sail is live it is something yo no iris yes they've great meat pons but they've even better meats this nonmember gets at choose your favorite meat to get free for a year pick a year of free stake say on chicken a bacon when you subscribed to

ranchers do come the world best meet at an amazing price good ranchers do come and use prumocod chipper all meanwhile as have said when awake criticized the media honestly ay i i discursive with the van on many many things but when he comes to his criticisms of the rest they are if anything not actually strong enough for example over in the males commas is friends in the press have now hit upon a new strategy there now claiming the israel turning journalist according to the washington post quote for weeks hundreds of locally base journalists in the gossistrip have provided the world with intimate views of the devastation on palisinian lives and homes while trying to find ways to survive themselves and keep their family safe yes we are told journalists in gaze are under assault and it is the journalists are telling us this but there is another story here it is another far omnifarious story and here is the real story it goes this journalist in the gosistrip ore typically propaganda for comas that is how they got in that's why they been allowed to operate comas deliberately places these studio journalists in areas designed to shield comas military resources that is how t goes over there yesterday honest reporting which is a five ones he threwweps i dedicated to uncovering prejudice in journalism ran a pretty damned shocking story they reported that during the october seventh massacre of one thousand four hundred as bailees in the kidnapping another two hundred and forty gaze base photo journalists working for the associated press and riders called stringers for the major wire service were present a stringer is an independent contractor a person who sort of on an individual case by case bases is used as a person who does journalism for particular journalistic outlet that presents could only have occurred with prior coordination witkcamas see had quod duo journalist hare actually just members adjust members of compass taking photos f atrocities and then the a p and riders andsianen all using them as duo quod quojournalists as a honest reporting says four names appear on eight piece photocredits from the israel gossaborder area on october seventh hazan esleya some mud of the manhood and cater alee here is a picture of one of them hazan esleya as you can see he is being kissed by an elderly gentleman that elderly gentleman is yayasinoar he is the military leader of compass and he is the mastermind behind october seventh he is be this is a journalist forsaken is a person that signed decided was actually good rightseanend decided they would pay this person for his footage footage also shows as lay a standing in front of a burning tank during october seventh as you can see he is wearing no presses no press marking of any sort he is on a member of the press his a comasfellow traveller and he is taken video of it just a compass member wood the will had go prosonreh ferias in the middle of compass massacre t is the journalist is a person that signal calls a stringer journalists forsaken seamen when they were informed that they had apparently hired maya sinners best friend released the following statement quote whet we have not at this time found reason to doubt the journalistic accuracy of the work he has done for us we have decided to spend all times with him no reason to doubt his journalistic accuracy i mean other than the fact that he is a terrorist supporter and all and literally haw by the way that the terroratack was going to happen otherwise why was he there journalist do not just stand around on the fossa border the only reason quota quote journalists are there is because they are in league with mass if there is a surprise attack on a particular sights and journalists are there it is because the journalists knew about that advance the other the reasuto journalist were there as well prepared to take pictures of omasa atrocities and then the wire services paid them for it and give them photocredits now this in fortunately is nothing new the quotiquot journalists station in fossa either work directly forkomass or under the thumb of mass all way back in twenty fourteen the times of israel reported the journalists had been questioned and threatened by comas photographers who to pictures comsstin that their cameras confiscated and were kicked out the boss's trip the washington posts reported in the same year that all sheaf hospital had quote become a to fact head quarters for comas leaders who can be seen in the hallways and offices the midalieast correspondent for the water journal actually wrote on twitter at the time that comas used all shift as a safe place to see media but then they inexplicably removed the post y say inexplicably we know exactly why the remove the post if the post had remain they have ben kicked out the goose trip one french reporter printed a story about being threatened by comas and then had remove the story for his own safety now these reporters are all claiming that if israel hits the allshifa hospital its not a military sit despite fact they eve all reported over the corse of a decade that this is in fact a military site used as a prop grunts by mass when you see journalism from the gossip stript just understand there are no free journalists in fossa either the journalists are living under man's thumb and doing their work or they work directly with comas as one punish reporter sad quote we saw the come men hiding behind civilians but had we dared point to cameras at them they would open firearms an killed its here is a big question for you would one quit journalistic outlets the a p and riders you stringers associated with say white to premises groups in order to tic pictures at charlottesvill let said there a can fellow traveller who showed up at that big march in charlottesviltine pictures wild the a p have just used hm as the trudger or are they only willing to use strangers who associate openly with terra

answers they bear in awful lot of responsibility they are making the world a lot more dangerous they are promoting masses propaganda and that of course is prolonging the war as usual that reality is obscured via projection it is comes threaten journalist worse post to believe that it is israel threading journalists projection is the name of the game in this conflict always it is why we see idiots or moral perverts playing silly semantic games obviously meant t ' air israel wit the crimes of its enemies we see morons making vague statements about opposing genocide from all sides which the bit saying after you watch of siphon butcher his tatslive and then you watch the police arrest him that you are pagans violence from both of siphon and the police on all sides got a watch out for that cruel terrific violent only one side in this conflict is pursuing genocide it is not israel and h implication to the contrary is either idiocy or evil it is we we see idiots or moral perverts at tempting to reflect from compasses crimes with talk about israel treatment of grabs in israel despite the fact that twenty per cent thou israel population is arab that any you who wanders into goa arginine will be summarily murdered it why we see idiots for moral purports pointing to civilian casual ties and goa and mud civilians in usually villages and pretending that these are somehow exactly the same thing the value of every human life is absolutely infinite that does not mean that the cuausits of every death are equivalents for israel enemies and for compasses most ardent advocates every

out of congress to demand a sense fire yesterday here is what that looked we a to a a a ha o e an we a not a o e the ere or o the were e e a o really trillion an we are or o the vermin wort o

are they are not they're not give me a break el get by the way they can tell that these are people who do not story stand by the curch of their con fictions because they wont toke off their masks the reason t they wearing mass and his now habit out was the university witsconton and ism schmuck got up wearing a mas ask a really dumb question about a i generated image is that these rallies were putting out or some such nonsense and the reason there hiding their faces is because they should be ashamed of the positions they are taking by the way they are congressable m exactly they are were staffers are in congress f you're still employing morons corse whore doing the propaganda work of compass you might wont to think about whether that is a good idea or not meanwhile pro palistinian protestors disrupted the house judiciary committed on free speech again what what lends these people the moral credibility is the media compass is playing a game the game is if they can get the media to parrot their propaganda they can push grease fire here is only one party that wants see fire here an it is the party that is losing that would be comes see here's the disruption yesterday the you your me fourgon e in member me her i members it my would be in order the would be in over sorts of distormantses are happening all the time all the time i love when they say that this guise since is propel simians is not equal antisemitism hell mot it is being procomas that equals antisemitism and that is exactly what you are doing that distinction between propel banian an procomass have been utterly obliterated by the movement in favor of compass how many of these protestors are willing to to the comashould surrender the answer of course is zero zero they do not exist where are they they will not say it why will not they say it because if they did then they would have to admit that israel is right and they cannot do that that is who it that israel has a reason to exist they cannot you that either it will never ever admit that commons ought to surrender instead what they will do as you will say things it is common o terriscripnago me so the terrascrup and is real is evil gate that false moral equivocation es the entire design they do not have to prove his been the game all long for those who wish to we the jewfish they destroyed the game all long has never been to prove that palisinian authority is niche hotcomass that these are in any way good liberty seeking organizations or even that the palisinian people whore in gaze or ingenine that those people desperately want western style liberty and democracy they do not they there is no pulling to suggest they do zero zero it is evident that it is an evidence free proposition they never make that case instead what they do as they sire will condemnterrism but the real terra are these rallies that is the game that they to play and then that allows them to engage in whatever a sort of evil they want to engaging it is laws at concoction university last night here is one student were the massage just off here she is screaming what you really things which has this about the news we screaming aging hayward and then a stuns at concortiate university who are a hare trying to rip up in his daily glad an starting a physical altercation over it that is not the only physical altercation is get get worse by the why last night there were a process protestors who attack people outside a showing of a film that was compiled from all the go procameras from the commons terrace israel budget of this film that ben showing it is to journalist it the doing an secret why because it is astonishingly awful that it is simply cannot be released to the public what id procomoss protesters do they are to trying to beat people up outside the showing at the museum of tolerance in loss angels an no well when tie seal literally nextstories to be in the museum of tolerant preach everyday they would that youknow insane insanely evil and perverse you have to be to beat people up outside a showing of atrocities that were pursued by a terror scrub it that is exactly what happened last night here they were as gal could do was showing this thing and apparently the best way to do pare for your own side is to beat up people quart seeking to learn about what commons did the the other day and the moral equivalents the mora equivocationthat has been promoted by the media here is absolutely vile it is absoluevile and it is what is causing a prolonging of the conflict it is what common is hoping for in the same way that the voicing hoped that the media would do their dirty work and eventually undercut america sport for the warn venom commons is hoping that the media do their dirty work and eventually undercut support for israel that is their entire goal m meanwhile the america administration is already for making overtures to the bad guise base on this moral equivalent nonsense but they are doing is there trying to now distinguishing compass and the rest of everything going on in the at least all other the calcining people the hate comas they now again i wish i really wish i wish tat the palicinging people hate to comedos much the overthrew them in actually putting place a government the wanted to build things instead of boy things they'll be amazing it are not true ism sorry it are not the same thing happens to be true with regard to the west bank you ain't maria the fact is that people infinite are not looking to an elect to elect a san francisco mayor they are looking to an elect a another terrorist government which is why there is assassination an time that makmotabas the ad of palcinian authority other day rockoon boss by theta's a holocostonier who actively pays terrorists it is a it a part of palicinan authority was that anyone who kills a new fit they are family gets a stipend they get a siren from the palcinian authority had for a large pry bi your tax pair dollars rely that where is the pavement but if you can craft in your own mind this bazar false narrative then this allows you to provide some sort of middle ground between evil and not evil right that is which is what many people are looking for this is why there is now in open debate that is broken o over over what happens in gaze after all of this is over israel has said that there is going to need to be some form of military occupation grip obviously that is true in the same way that if there is a massive crime outbreak in a major city anywhere in the west police aren't on need to go in and there there n e state for quite a while that is just the way that it works but twenty blink an saying do not now we cannot have that we can have that instead they are preferred solution its unified palicinian authority rule in gaze and wetback ism sorry this ridiculous the reason that's how do i notes ridiculous the policing auruthorty aridly even governs should ain solaria the last time the palicingan authorities put up for election in two thousand five to thousand six in the gazistript not only d they lose they were then submit summarily murdered by mamas they have lost the election and ten mom most killed all of them the reason again the mambas has not held an election in anywhere in in the palconian occupied areas at he is not held than election since two thousand at why he is afraid he will lose is the population is extremely radicalize that is just a reality we try to walk your way through this but that happens to be the case secretary take anta blank an thinking out on the coat a a rat at than to ant a pan no reoccupation goal the cote es no tor locate deserve us no region the her or o gas we must all our no her sir than urinate we tat it'll get well ism in or for that to happen guess what israel is going to have to actually retain military presence in all of these areas but because the press why about this sort of stuff because they pretend that israel is somehow the equivalent of its enemies that is he you end up wit the solution that israel should not be in these areas to retain actual security and it is a lie there that believer not thirds natural good piece can and a come i know i was shock but also by aguidam john spencer he is chief of urban warrior studies that modern war institute west point and corrector of the modern war institutes urban warfare

international humanitarian an experts in the modern wars tat have occurred in populated organ areas model drama even when western power the united states is leading or supporting the campaign destruction and suffering he says as awful as they are do not automatically constitute war crimes otherwise nearly any military action in a populated area would violate the laws of arm conflict rules distilled from a complicated patchwork of international treaties cortrulings and historic conventions scenes of devastation israel strikes on the abulia refugee camp in northern gaze earlier this week quickly spark accusations israel engaging in war crimes but war crimes must be assessed on the evidence and the standards of arm conflict not a quick glias at the heroin aftermath of an attack he says i have seen it nothing that shows that israel defense forces are not following the laws offers and gaze particularly when the charges that the idea of its emitting war crime often come too quickly for there to have been in examination of the factors that determined weather and attack and the resulting civilian casualties are lawful the factors that need to be accessed are the major dimensions of the most commonly agreed to international humanitarian an law principles military necessity proportional distinction humanity and honor israel has pledged to obey international law proportionality is

been implementing and in some cases going beyond many of the best practice is developed to minimize the harm of civilians in similar large skills or ben battles these idea practices include calling every one in a building to lurk them of a pending air strike and giving them time to evacuate tactic have never seen elsewhere anywhere in my decades of experience as it also notifies the enemy of the

using melting media broad cast nectar flier drops they provided roots that will not be targeted civilians have paths to non combat areas though there been some tragic report the palistinians from northern gaze b have relocated o the south for subsequently killed as the war rages throughout the strip when common uses a hospital school amounts for military purpose it can lose its protected status become a legal military target israel must still make clear attempts to get is many civilians out as possible but the cites do not need to be clear of civilians before being attack again this is a military expert who saying israel not violating the loss war but that is not with he media say the media in all f their wisdom all these morons whole never spent five minutes examining military strange or even international law accusing israel of warring and the goal there is to do the work of mamas to do the propaganda of mamas to do the projection that mamas wants people to do what is that contend with off the media got their way would in with most an power if the media got their way it one with more people dead in the long run is it turns out when you protect terrorist that become more plentiful it turns out that hope is the actual soil from which terrorism grows not to spare one the great lies the media is that it is to spare that breeds terrorism that is absolutely untrue it is hope immediate hope that what you are doing is going to make a difference that breeds terrorism that is why people do it and the media are providing that hope by propagating the lies of mamas and

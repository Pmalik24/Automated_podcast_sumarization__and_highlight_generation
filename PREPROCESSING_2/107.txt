we break down the latest effects of bid comics the white house gives the baronial government access who six billion dollars while touting their deal making prowess and spectral horasmanaligations emerged against tenballard the inspiration behind sound of freedom i been sure the is the manscero so the benshpirosho is sponsored by express be plan protector salmon privacy to day at express veins a come freshmen a poles are really bad for jobidon on the economy in fact the poles are really bad for trobidon pretty much a cross the board a c is newspole that came out over the week shows that the qualities that most america are looking for are just not present in jobidon according to the latest c is news got pole it chows that sixty seven per cent of america one o president who is tough sixty six per cent want a present whose caring sixty two per cent on a president whose no nonsense only sixty one percent wile calm and fifty eight per cent one energetic a among people asked about jobidons leadership style sixty three per cent say that he is calm but only fifty percent say that he is curing and only thirty five per cent say that he is no consents meanwhile donate trumps leadership style is seen as provocative by seventy one per cent by tough it would seem as tough by sixty seven per cent energetic by sixty five per cent no nonsense by fifty five per cent and entertaining by fifty five per cent even more importantly despite the fact that america are really dissatisfied with this match up the strumpet's bison perspective match up with sixty four per cent of america saying that that rematch would make the them feel that the political system is totally broken on the economy the numbers are awful four jobidon as well they should be according to this pole it shows that only twenty per cents of america say they are better off to day than they were before the pandemic forty five percent say they are worse off to day and thirty five per cent say they are t about the same level which just to say only twenty per cent are pleased as punch as far as the choice for president if finances are worse now than before the pandemic seventy one per cent say they would vote for trump f you said the your finances are worse than they were before the pandemic which is forty five percent america seven and ten of those voters say they are going to vote for present in trump olein the administrations efforts according to c is news has been detect what t senses bisons a compliment a lot of orders do know about some efforts and an apparently matters for example independent who've heard about the bide administration investing an inform structure are backinghim but those in a pecans re present a small minority of people and here is the reality the vast majority of people far thinking about the economy either think that they are no better off or significantly worse off than before the pandemic and that has to do with jobidons policy the facts and matter is that jo irons easy money policy which has been combined with a extraordinarily restrictive regulatory environment massive subsidies to his union buddies green boondoggle and all the rest it is making people feel pretty insecure their wages are not stacking up the same way they were before the pandemic prices have risen dramatically and it does not look as though an end is in sight even people in the business sect or here supposedly doing amazing thanks to the stock market boom even those people are holding their money on the sidelines not sure exactly where to put it and he can hear the inability two hands the economy in the voice of treasury secretary panic yelling who suppose to be he beg expert on this sort of stuff sir gran yelling an interview on in b s yesterday in which she basically explain that the has no clue what to do next because they do not they have no clips next the probably to mainly an stimulus is that when the stimulus does not work you have no more bullets to fire the thing about innovation is that innovation is done by individual ontropanors who have ideas and then look for the funding in order to go and build those ideas but stimulus does not make the ideas magically happen this the equivalent of suggesting that some kid who get straight sees if you just give him an extra jukebox able is gang get ais that is not the way any of that works the reality is that the only way to truly stimulate in economy is with innovation and growth it is not simply by hellocoppering money everywhere but that is the entire premise of all left wing economic policies that if you simply hover up money from the private sector and then you blow it out or your ne do that you hover it up from the future and you blow it out in the present somehow that is going to lead to long term economic growth and innovation the proof just are not in the pudding sir jane yelling was asked on san b see at quack box about the gas price is gas price it continue to be extraordinarily hight significantly higher than when jobidon took office and janniellis has look we do not we do not know there is nothing we can do about it the tout is tar standing a production cots throw the and the a are you looking at taking any action on that fir welt the president wants to make hurts it gas prices rely fortabol foramericans a america care a greatest about the price of gas a there is still down dollar they of the miles summer although they have going a presimply a we are splintering the situation very closely the present has taken acting for the letter certainly the release is of oil from the strictitic petrol refer a pig been a important in holding don well priceisan will continuo monger t that closely fashion wonder how actually now the two things that jordan is done tat of tremendously effected gas prices rely three inflation affects the gas price two massive regulations placed on oil and gas companies and the notion that bison spins out at every turn that he is going to kill off gas he is going to just destroy oil production in this country and thane's at why do not you invest in the oil re finery's to day hell because you have said thatyou are want destroy the industry over the course of next five one ten years that factor number two regulation and incentivization an factor number three join has decided to make enemies of many of the best oil producers on plain earth including the sally royal government and before he come in office you basically said that ex's gin to cut off the saltines at the need and they return the favor by saying we will cut you off at the need which presumably is why the gas prices in twenty twenty one canary twenty twenty one when this tool took over work two dollars and forty two cents and to day there three dollars an seventy cents or thereabouts and the rally never sunk below that in any serious way meanwhile jane yelling is claiming that we really should not worry about this u a be u strike we cogently have a massive strike the biggest strike against the t strike caretakers in modern america history it is against all three to strike caretakers and she is pretending that this on o have no economic impact the slow down at these plants because they have to be worried about at lagan give it that just as it starting to connadan t li tanto throptan are rest care that well yo i i think it is premature to been making forecast about what it leans fifty economy i it would to an very much chon how long the strike lasts and exactly who affected by it but i important point ti think is that the posits see to now they're disagreements and a to work for win win s it a contract that is good good for the work is and fifty intiscres well it'll gene it the entire reason this strikes happening all the other strikes that have happened on jobidon's watch is because every one in union world thinks that jo biding is on their sides the are now all taking advantage of the easy money policies and the inflation of the bide administration in order to strike against they're employers hoping that the by demonstration is going to come in and ram down some sort of beneficial deals them that wool in the end bankrupt these car companies again remember the car companies when bankrupt the first time because of rich union contracts including to find benefits pension plans that is exactly what the u a be u is seeking right now all of this can be laid at the footstep of this white house all of this stuff all get's more on this in a second first there is a company looking out for you right now that company is pure talk first of all there it hate your gossip lout of the other phone company's but pure talk also has just to added dated to every plan and the including mobilhotspot with no price increase t whatsoever if you have considered pure talk before but you haven't made the switch tick look again for just twenty bucks most to get in limited talk tax tat now fifty per cent more five show a to plus they are new moblhotspot this why i love it pure talk they are veteran own the only her the best customer service seem located right here in the great united states o america most families are saving almost one thousand dollars to your while enjoying the most dependable five chou not work in the country remember he both haw you splendor cash stop supporting woke wireless companies that do not actually support you when you go to puretalktock comslash of per you will seven additional fifty percents off your very first month because they actually do value you that is pure talk dot come slash chipiro pure talk is wireless four america by america bemusing puretalk for all my business calls for months an months and months now they are right the sure on of the tower not works wot he big eyes which means that your coverage's excellent and again you are giving money to a company the does not hat your guts but a pure ticktock comslash of pure save an additional fifty per cent off you are very first month of covers this pure talk dot come slash chi pro i gat these strikes these you a blue strikes again are just part of a broader whole picture here which that the unions have paid off jobidin in the norcratic party for literally decades on end and finally they got their man in the white house he most progun in president since barakobama and probably port mort morrow union even than borakobama who suit you least orbit has benin the pocket of the union since day one in wellingtons delftware well now all of these unions are seeing there moment to shine according to political the you a less walk out fridge at three four general motors in stilancis plans still antis by the way is wrestler they got sold to a european conglomric could become chemist politically and economically tostruptive strike since president o bin took office butts hardly the only significant labor management clattering his administration made part of that is because usually appointed a union man had of your labor department and your national laborelations board in absolute frank and steinean monster in terms of it is pathetic a fact on the america government theanalarby it is disgrace to america government we by by all rules and regulations of the analarby have o say that every time because literally one time i are a joke and they sent us a threat letter here is what they do for a living there just threaten business is there are not in violation of the law workers according to political armed with the power of its tight labor market and at times angered by how employers treated them during the pentomic have organized with new energy from holloed to you p stostarbas is only one problem the money are not there to go around out pretend it is but it are not if all of the left wingers over an holliwat are not signing the rich union contracts why that is s cause if they do they will go bankrupt you are seeing this by the want in the stock prices have lot f the major entertainment conglomerates ranging from that flicks to dizzy the taken into rectally on the chain an meanwhile got their writer striking when comes to the auto manufacturers thermal get their luncheon by tesla which is a non union show it is amazing how we can keep relearning the sand lessons over and over and over again now all the all the dolts who suggest the its unions that made america life wonderful during the nineteen fifties nineteen sixties who the union job the union job where you sat there for ten hours at ah going riveting or whatever and neglect the fact that a lot of those jobs now is uniting in an air condition office doing another kind of job an that your grandfather ho had to sit out there in the fact or doing the riveting would kill for your job right now put that aside the fact is that the real reason a america boom during the nineteen fifties is because every other place on earth was on fire during the nineteen forties it is not because the unions did such stellar work they effectively bankrupt did the car industry which was the single greatest industry in the united states in the nineteen thirty's forty fifties and sixties by the reining an ninety seventies ever as moving over to the cheap toyodas there is a reason for that crap union contracts the first atonal outs are happening by the eighties but says political biding has work hard to brand himself as he most probably labor president in america history hand relied on unions political muscle to help i when the presidency hen here is even the threat of a major strike he is in the stole more than other president a ben again they know they have got him over the barrel in the show down between the you a than auto makers bean has publicly stepped carefully as the administration engages primarily behind the scenes but the has not always been the case bison was able to intervene directly in talks been railroads and rail workers because federal log is the government a big say in that industries relations because its economic importance is top labor apartment official was involved in a deal this year be ween west coastports and dock workers when it came to rail negotiations biding sad a rail strike without its out would a benin economic catastrophe o very bad time in the year the contract did not incallu paid sickle for more than a hundred thousand workers wo had threaten to strike the administration weeks before had broker to yet to avert er earlier strike but four of the twelve labor unions involved representing more than half the union work force rejected the proposals sending both congress and the ad ministration into a frenzy to get involves before a holiday shipping rush the same thing happen for great to the ups in teamsters as well as west part cost as the west comport negotiations because this administration is basically own by the unions lock stock and barrel unions know that and they are pressing while the iron is hot meanwhile you can hear burned sanders out there mi picking you a sedans including at can you not you a be once for its workers get had f this a thirty two hour workweek a thirty to our working now your mouth is not deceiving you that is a foray working that is eight hours a day four days a week a thirty to our working is what they are seeking the u a w of course burned is big in favor of it the this push a from the you a fou for four day work week is that in the gotiatin can ordo you see that is the future of labor in the u as foray work week what say what i think and thanks for rasing that question drink we all looking an an explosion in this country a official intellections and w was and that means that the aura worker its going to be much more for doters what yo work o o activity i goingincrease significantly the question is nation that we have got the erscucls is who is got a better it from that increase from activity is of a no incoming wealth incest o work open nativity got to go to the people o oo works going to net of it wight now in mind you i happentably that is e nation we should begin a serious discussion and you a suits women about substantially lowering the work we i a first of all we should point out here the corner pot worker prodoctivitying united states has largely been result of investing in better machinery's i because workers suddenly got massively better at their jobs is because they're jobs themselves are more productive thanks to the use of for example capital equipments this is brought down prices which has benefited workers or would have its the are not bin massive inflation one way to reverse all the product a the productivity gains one way to do that its to artificially in creasuasions and lower the hours that is one way to do that and by the way it is always short turn gain for s long turn pain when it comes to these union negotiations the you a duly rite now negotiating for all of the stuff because they see that all the car companies did real well because of the boosting in elation prices of cars right car price is wen up dramatically over the course of the last couple of years best a supply chain woes well now those supply chainboes are going away and now the easy money policies of the united states are gan i have to be curbs what happens when the car says drop off what happens when jobidons push to force car companies to spend extraordinary amounts of was shifting from ass power vehicles which represent ninety seven percent of all the topsails to eves electric vehicles whosecan absorb this cost it is on me the workers if they get their contract from join but join don't car cause again it is all cup bargain the unions spend billions of hours every election cycles back democrats his why i always scale when they say that democrats when to get money you a police my as democrats when to get money out of politics who you think is paying for jobidon's bills it is the unions when key's a big business runs re public an politics first of all that are not true but second of all unions run democratic politics in direct bribery fashion they hire effectively democrats to then negotiate with them at the table it is an amazing scam that is been going on for decades on end another part of the scam is that the only employers in the united states who right now our benefiting our way for way foray for t the government we are getting rid of job creation in the private sector through rich union contracts but we are definitely boosting more em payment in the government sector which of course is what jobidon would if you would likes work for the government now an excellent time's gets that momentarily first everybody knows i love my heels mattress have you checked out their most high and collection the relics

relics better sleep i starts right now l there is one sector of the employment market that is going by leaps and bounds and the is government employment are not you lade the you pay the taxes the government can hire lots people according tote salary journal while many companies have been cutting staff and freezing new hires this year the government is laying out the welcome mat public sector jobs at the federal state and local level have risen by three hundred twenty seven thousand positions far in s twenty twenty three according tote bureau of labor statistics that is a preaching one fifth of all new america jobs created in the first eight months of the year in contrast public sector jobs accounted for five per cent of em payment growth turkey during the equivalent period last year if you look at public sector jobs to per centare of pay tell gas this is the biggest number that we have seen in any given year since two thousand saving two thousand sixes the mean that does even go back that far the chart the water journal is showing what we are watching here is the government basically subsidizing a bunch people to come work for the government some of this is worth while becauseyou within need people working for you us customs and for protection as will see the administration isn't allowing them to do their job but they are hiring there but there is also a tun of people largest working in con of make work programs for the government private sector em plowmen is now three point tupertwo nine per cents over it is propounds on ma level but public sector is struggling to shore up staffing and they are just rationing up they're rationing up the amount of money that they are pang people jobidon's but i economy here is one in which you have a government job working a thirty two hour work week with a public sector union pension paid for by the america tax par a growing public sector at the expense of a shrinking private sector is the future of this come they wonder we many america seem a dissatisfied wit this arrangement then as basically the arrangement that lengthened the great depression by eight years during the a senior it is the same arrangement that led to economic turmwell in the nineteen sixties nineteen seventies under elf j and then under richer neon that that would be the reason bad economic policy is is parton parcel of what jobidon is doing right here combine that with jobiton's crape emigration policy and you have a real you have a real tempest on your hands at the same time the jobidon is making unaffordable for people to live in this country particularly the lower end of the in come scale he continues to ship in millions of illegal immigrants then release them into the interior over the week and fox is grief mankind posted video of the called faro me train it is an amazing video these are all people ore headed up to the america border they are coming from zacatecas mexico and they are cheering trout to the united states earlier of the summer the bi administration according to mediate ended the goal true our emigration policy remain a mexico which required asylum secret to wait in mexico and tom the the administration has successfully in sensitized literally thousands people to hop on trainchist had right for that border here is the video why not jobiton is going to process them and release them ins the interior of the united states that was going to happen here well know that these are not all people who are attempting to escape from tyranny ridden countries these area lot of people who are looking for jobs and the can come and welfare benefits n there to come into the united states n that is what they are going to take advantage of and meanwhile by the way immimages of immigrants an cages are emerging from turn arizona thanks to billmalugan i don't i do not see to see crying anywhere near these cages anywhere you seethes giant cages filled with people all these people will be processed and let into the interior of the united states that is jobidntimigration policy if you are a low wage america it understand that jobidins importing and entire labor pool to take your job away from you in the private sector simultaneously paying bunch of middle class people in northern virgin to work for the federal government blowing out the spending as to increase inflation and pang off his union cronies and then you wonder by america are not superfine of his economic policies i cantomangion why and just one second all get to jobitons absolute discombobulated in immoral foreign policy first the valotoror a setups of he much we have to do everyday at the so a practice and the science fairs in the prepping for the holidays and all o that the goodness is you can take one giant thing off your plate by putting great meat on your plate with good rangers e care about your family eats does good rangers that is why they have spent years building relationships with local farms to

mullahs to the tyranny from in exchange for five america according to the puca daily mail the five us prisoners released by son's day s part f a controversial prisoner swap have arrived in dona costar to begin their journey back to america or one says he is eager to visit an apples tor to find you with latest phones are after eight years behind bars the prisoners were flown first from than to dona on a costar airways jet to day they are greeted on the him i cat dough by the us ambassador to contour time dais the price their freedom six billion dollars in frozen fun fou us seized from are in twenty eighteen now we claim that it'll be use for humanitarian purposes only which is a complete lie teethe president of ran said as much recently he was recently on with them with lesterholt and he is as specifically about whether they re in you restrictions on these he fun that not or can use it for whatever we dam well please meanwhile the administration continues to deny that there is anything to the stale john hurry with the national security spokes person he says do not worry we are not ignoring bran's terrified activities were just ignoring ran terrified activities how is new etanastron security batter to day because of this tale and not work off as give herd many re publicans say first of all a what is really better off are five families titi that is a really important a remember a number two as i said earlier we well we just executed more sanctions on entities and are to day specifically for the offense of wrongfully detaining america and just in the last couple of weeks we up tour military presents in the got region we a added some additional sanctions all on iron just a few days ago a ma we are holding iron to account and we are mindful of our national security interest in the region and we are doing everything we can not just on the economic space but even in the military space to protect our troops to protect our interest to protect our allies on partners in that part of the world no one should take away from to day's events any idea that we are somehow turning a blind eye to what ran is doing in the region around the world not at all quite the country o well i mean quite the contrary you be seconds strict democratic president to ship palate of cash over to the agrarians effectively speaking by the way we also released o bunch of cranial prisoners in the united states martial criminals including one cranial who sentence to sixty three months in prison in twenty twenty one retaining equipment that could be used in missile we ironic warfare nuclear weapons in other military year another eonian and permanent residence of the united states who charged in twenty nineteen with e legally stealing engineering plans from his employer to send to iron as well as another one who ut was arrested in february and sentence to thirty months in prison for purchasing sophisticated copter you us elect ironic equipment in stofswuare through confront companies in the u a meanwhile john carry continues to maintain do not worry the resume is never going to get their hands on this money which is weird because on t they totally are that what happens when you release money to criminals what can the united state n do if it is seen that they are using this money not for o not for maiden for badresonlock at back down can stop a transaction it is important to remember cate that the ya believes so does it get the money that they can request or withdraw for humanitarian goods agricultural products medical supplies food and then we will run a process through which those goods are contracted for the cronies do not even get the let the contracts we will make sure that the contracts are let with venders that we know we can trust and then that material will be delivered to the baronial people the baronial regime does not get hands on this money there is nothing that america of better than foreign a going directly to the sources that were seeking to attend to i ben incredibly sarcastic right now the amount of money that we waste every year on fraud and grapticaes directly to dictators all over the world is insane it is hundreds of millions of dollars there is a reason the yocerariphit and up the richest guy the palicignian authority in give that money to all of his all his subjects and the same thing's happening over our by thewy money is fungible let us assume for a second that he is right let us u sum the six billion dollars goes for humanitarianade that six billion dollars are on now doesn't have to spend on that stuff and then now spend on giving missiles to hasbelot it it is just an absurdity but the administration on form policy is an absurdity in terms of other absurdities this administration by the way join continues to mock re public is on the impeachment stuff now our re publicans can be able to achieve the impeachment of of jobidon now i do not now of the on to beagle to even achieve in the house i do not know they hae a majority in the house i would assume that at the end of the day monarchy is somehow tin a wrangle a bar majority to impeach bison and to that that will have an impact on bine is he can actually be remove from office by democratic senate of course not of course not but that is not the point the point is the me a lot of damaging material about job's corruption from now u to a lection day and jobidon is absolute blithe about the whole tenement the thing which is which is pretty shocking moment to go at the pracidat reacting with defied when ask about the new house in peachmanquiry as he arrived back at the white house was plug was so by the we now an now that i watch jordan walking around i cannot get dona's drum's description of job not my head it is an excellent description he says he always of let walking on a bet of toothpick yo he definitely definitely does by the way hunter has somehow come up with the money to so the iris which is exciting stuff remember he does no enough money to pay his o baby mamma but he does have enough money t the iris alleging his privacy wrights were violated when agents are concern to congress in the media about the handling of the investigation into his taxes in business dealings while that a she whistle blowers coming forward to a ledge bad behavior that is a thing that is happening you know whose actual taxrturns were least to the media dona trumps you recall turns out the isn't anything particularly on toward in them but it is totally crazy to me how the iris routinely weeks tax records of various people on the right to propublica or wherever but hunter is mad apparently bat do hunter is is angry that whistle blowers pointed out that yous getting a sweet hartal from the is pretty amazing stuff in a second we will get to republicans be clowning themselves speaking of people be clowning themselves the medical establishment has been beclouding itself on the issue of abortion for literally decades many doctors we own callas because it seems serial to think that over sixty four million babies have been killed reborn will not stand silent nor should we we cannot stand by and let babies die t the hand to abortion this is why reborn exists to stand up for those who counts defend themselves the only defense four these precious babies is their heartbeat which begins just three weeks and can be heard on ultra sound by five weeks when mom making that ultimate choice here is her babies heartbeat and sees the precious life in her the majority the times she will choose life by sponsoring an ultra sound for mom you are being the voice of the reborn please join reborn in the clause of life for twenty a bucks yo can be the difference between the life and dead of a child the ultrasounds there basically magic can there amazing the technologies incredible we met all four of our heads long before they were born it changes your perspective on what is in the soon when you an actually see your babies face to donate dill pounds who fifty a key were baby that is pound at two five zero baby or go to reborn dot calm slashed that is reborn dot calm slashed once more reborn dot calm slash ben of gap meanwhile the got ism not sure if they are running out of rakes to step on you would imagine at some point they might i have some bad news from the world of love apparently lorn sober the congress wen from colorado who is lasting burly winning a a reelects to her colorado well om now she has broken up with with her beloved not not our husband of eighteen years with whom she has until children

romance cant last ism not sure what romance can lorn sober has now parted ways with the and seen groping her during a frisky date at a colorado theater where enjoying a family friendly performance of the musical beetle juice the self described eccentric polisygian is accent its eccentricity now to a to grope your date in the middle of a performing to needle juice is that is now et centric asked

that they had not been dating very long and when i say not very long there is one reports suggesting that this was their first date which o boy like wow wow family valleys takin it right on the shin right there not good stuff there that that that is bad meanwhile in other not good for the grope news apparently president trump wrote to duelists fore his assistants on white house documents marked classified idea now man i anatstelle a yes heller clotting is treated classified documents yes she should have been prosecuted and is donate trump should not rating to dulls on the back of lake here is i attack pan is i nap my dick pes three diestocks and the back of the ran hackman according to a c news one of former president drums long time assistant told federal in investigators that trump repeatedly wrote to duelist for her on documents from the whorehouse that ere marked classified maybe's wonder cychael he just too bushmen environments less hat much paper god something of it as described to a c news the aid molly michael told investigators that more than once she received requests or tasking from true that were written on the back of note cards she later recognized those note cards as sensitive white house materials with visible class vacation markings used to brief trump while he was still in office about for calls with forge leaders were other international related matters that that is just that is bictacular that is spectacular in she thatsent eighteen at michael became drums executive assistance in the white house she continued work for him when trump left office she resin last year in the much of drums a legs refusal to comply with the federal guess an the flies at subsequent search of farrago machaelr counted by late twenty twenty one as many of ninety boxes materials from trams time is present were moved into a basement store room at farrago i and a apparently they say this is very easily disprovable ism but tat had this is that bat knows disprove to yet that is that a i that that is how important the class my documents were had writes some hoping less on it a but do not worry the clowning does not end there republicans are hell bent on running directly into a wall at full speed which is presumably many of the republicans plan on this government shut down again if you are asking for a moderate cut and you might get part of that moderate cut in a government shut down negotiation all right but if your plan is let just run directly in to a government shut down get blame for everybody by that for that and then lose the house on the basis that which is very likely what could happen ism wondering about your strategic choices again ism ism into point out again i am morphiscally can serve to them pretty much any one in congress ism certainly more conservative than many of the people who consider themselves man or re publicans right i want a restructure social security on restructure mat scarab a makenobones about it was sun's con a bankrupt the united states but there is also such a thing as tactical as tactical competent and it turns out that the tactics the are curtly being used are not particularly smart according to the near times speaker even cartel's bit to gain the upper hand in a battle over federal spending had stiff opposition from within his own ranks on money leaving him with dwindling options and

fantastic film sound of freedom will now according to vice do come timballard's exit from operation underground railroad earlier this car followed in investigation in to claims of sexualmius conduct including seven women according to sources with direct knowledge of the organization again were not see if all these charges are confirmed i always great ta carabin is just don't know until the facts all out the sources familiar with the situation said these self styled anti slavery acts who appears to be preparing for a senate run invited women to ask act as his wife on under cover oversees missions a pensively aimed at rescuing victims of sex trafficking who then allegedly coerce those women to sharing a better or showering together claiming that it was necessary to fool traffickers ballad whose played by him comical in the hitfhome sound freedom it said to have sens at least one woman of photo himself in his underwear for stone with faketattus and to ask another how far she as willing to go to save children those sources request an unanimity because they fear retaliation the total number of woman involved is believed to be higher than seven one worse close to the organization as defend knowledge o ballad making sexual advances to a volunteer using methods similar to those he allegedly used with implores those methods are also consistent wit his conduct toward another former employ who spoke to vice news as spoke person four operation underground railroad told vice him ballad resigned from the organization on tune twenty second twenty twenty thee three he has permanently separated from o u r we yours not con to make any further their public comment the time to preserve the integrity of its investigation o this obviously is a horrifying report and tom we will see the details as they as they come out according to an anonymous letter that is been circulating in the to pillar tropic community they say quote it was ultimately revealed through disturbingly specific and parallel accounts that him has ben deceitfully and extensively grooming and manipulating multiple women for the pass few years with the ultimate intent of coercing them o participate in sexual acts with him under a premise of going where takes and doing whatever it takes to save a child women believed to be at the center of the in investigation not respondent or quest for comment at this points we have anonymous allegation to this point the ere made to vice we are going to we are going to have to weight to see what comes out about this and i am going to reserve further comments until more conformation is presented at this time for what it is worth the the church of jess christy of lateral sales the woman church they have removed all articles promoting ballad and tenon profit that he founded when all this came out this came out the same day the church release si statement setting be trail and con damning ballad for morally on acceptable behavior which makes a found a little more real than merely an anonymous report that is om truly bad stuff glen back hose one ballad's partners indicate on dial me to the ballad had ben quit effectively excommunicated from the church the ambiguous but unquestionably dating statements thou being given adequate notice or the ability to response to again ism n a weight to see more come out before i comment more extensively on this particular subject but obviously its in the news and worthy of cover meanwhile in entertainment new s that is a essentially being ignored by by pretty much everybody except for the right hassle mina she is a a pretty famous comedian a he apparently has basically just been making up stories about himself about how horrifying america racism is it's altkik points out a profound e new york er of minas says in mishmash's approach to comedy he leans heavily on his own experience as an alien america a muslin america telling heroin stories of on foremen in trapped n personal threats for many of his fancied come to adventure of the power of representation and entertainment after many weeks of trying i hade been unable to confirm some of the stories he had told on stage and then when the author confronted him and minas admitted that the stories hat he tells on stage a offer exaggerated or made up well i mean some of these stories are just purely intended o paintamerica in the worst possible light and there completely made up is not resulting in tremendous blowback from has one of his anecdotes apparently claims a white woman from high school stood him up for a pram because her family did not want her to take pictures of a brown boy minas then disclosed identifiable details about the woman during his telling of the story prompting his fans to harasser the woman apparently addressed the threats withmanhae who then told her to scrub er social media presents to deter for threats it is one thing to exaggerate u no family stories for comedic effect it something a lot o people do is another thing to make up out of whole quash stories about the evils of america racism this this ye effectively bores on emotional fraud and the fact that there are many people out there in hollowed who are making excuses for him people would be golfer out there suggesting that is a this is totally fine again woodwork by golfer say that about any one else have have a difficult time believing that she would booby golfer's defense of him is that this is what we do quote that is what we do we tell stories whom we embellish them golfer said that she recalled the time when reporter called to paycheck one of her standup in which she said she had agreed from and you she told the reporter she did not have agreed from theuniversity and ever said she did before realizing the was referring to one of her stand up characters but that is not exactly what is happening here ray minas tells stories that are ostensibly about himself and those stories are false and there inherently tied to the idea that america deeply evil in race's place men make those sorts of claims presumably you should have some sort of backing for them from the fact that that he had to make up theories in the first places pretygoodevidence that america is not remotely as races and horrifying as minas suggests for laughs and profit and leftism is a very very lucrative point of view for comedians that is ow you get that is ow you get a comedy central special that is how you and up being extremely rich and extremely famous he says every story in my style is built around a seat of truth my comedy areola poler is seventy per sent emotional truth this happened and then thirty per cent hi culpably exaggeration and fiction he says the punch lines worth the fictionalized premise but do how is there a punch line to my daughter was exposed to a substance that couldhave been anthrax's which is one o the things that he actually sad at one point now that is not something that you are supposed to fabricate especially as a person who has receive powder in the mail at least twice as far as i am aware yoga is still investigating case this am that is on a story that you make up or embellish that's trust that is either reality or it is not this also e part of the problem with our new comedic our new comedic world which plays can a clown knows on clown knows off ism a comedian ram telling deep and meaningful truths about the world to you however comedian you tell jokes very comedian you tell penny stories but that is of a comedy is any more our to our comedians are supposed be newscasters and our newscasts are supposed to be comedians one o the great ironies of john start attack and cross fight back in the early two thousands which at that point was polbigala and tucker carbon is that this is led to the temptation for comedians to basically become newscasters and newscasters to play john start every one has become they've converged on john start basically son mintage is now john start telling meaningful stores about as the are completely made up to expose the evils of the united states o america and how resist it is and then when he is caught on that ralspost t pretend that it is no big deal at all say speaking of things the are unbelievably stupid the a the senitmajority leader has now declared hat there will be no informal rest code ford the senate chamber why because john federal likes to wear the close of the homeless apparently we have to be nice to mongo over here and that requires that we a that that there be no dresscode in the senate any more according to the your times in the tradition at bound halls of the senate customs ti hard rules can be next to i possible to change on money or the potential government shut down days away an newly begun in peaches inquiry and lawmakers preparing for a visit from the president if youcrane a major change had the capital abuzz for the first time in centuries will makers are no longer expected to suit up to conduct ta business on the senate floor from now on members are allow to take a more business casual approached to the workers office staff by thewy and not guests only if you a enters you get this this special dispensation the modification is in many ways to bowed reality in recent years them in plenty of enters who's departed from the suit entire uniform that for decades was considered the only acceptable attire in most clearly reflects influence of john veteran the six foot ate nature brain damage first treat democrat from pennsylvania he don a sure cipher's first months in congress but that now he just wear and around him starts and carhartswetcherts and our changing the entire rule of the senates in order to make nice with a dude who does not want to actually just wear suit pretty ridiculous data that is were we are in in america public life because i pretty much everything is mockery at this point time for some things i and some things that i hate things that i to day a lot of states urenoucstarn cuttings with the america library association which is utterly approbate considering that the a la is now a left going interestscroup many of our public institutions sent mile according to the washington post has now targeted the ale when twas is turned to question witnesses he call the avidin of deer called millstones director of the america library associations office for intellectual freedom in mum call called well stone hade been reported arguing book advocates should rearmament the book challenges the debate should not return whether gentles are sexually and appropriate for minor said calledmostone it should be about diverse materials that are about every one's write see themselves in their families reflected on bookshelves we then said the goal is to serialized children t oxide miners with sexually explicit material than hide this content from parents the ale a is now facing a partisan fire fight unlike anything at almost hundred fifty year history says the washington post i one who brought that up who may that firefight happen i love that we now it is a full time sport now the we will do something unbelievably terrible and provocative and if you notice you are the one starting a firefight the once unto in controversial organization which says it is the world's largest and oldest library association which provides running training in tools to most of the hundred hundred and twenty three thousand libraries has become entangled in the education culture wars the raging debates over what and how to teach about race sex engender culminating in tuesdys senatorial name check lee politicians and parents on the right increasingly paint association known as the ale e as a defender of pornographic literature for children tying their allegations into a broader conservative movement that asserts school libraries are filled with sexually explicit inappropriate texts a two thousand twenty two treat in which the organization's president calls herself a marksist lesbian added to the concern well ye think yo thing i love that its that the problem is not that the ale is president calls to self a marks is lesbian the problem is that ever anyone notice that show tweeted that out publicly over the stumer state libraries and montanamos organ texts announce they were severing ties with the ale e which is good they should meanwhile librarians and those on the political left are defending the ale e as a keeper video of money and skills for librarians in particular they are setting in ale apart tracking one thousand ton a sixty nine attempts to remove library books in twenty twenty two the highest number of challenges to books since the ale a began compiling starts on the issue what are the issues they are all related to l g b t who plus minus divided by sign books directed kids well good good for parents for finally waking up and taking notice the fact that's i somehow considered in instance of writing radicalism is truly an astonishing and silly thing skate time for a quick thing that i hate for all of those people who believe that there is no correlation whatsoever between politics ideology religion and sexual practice or sexual identity ism sh cannot point out that that is completely false that is a lie it is untrue it was always untrue the notion that sexual activity or sexual identity are inherently written into the wanna unchangeable unchanging non affected by environment not affected by by any other mode of human behaviors is written in the same way that melon an level is written in door skin that is a lie bran new study out from had hillocks and the fire and iron urge it shows sexual orientation bi religion an now here's what you oud image you imagine their would not be major gaps in terms of sexual identity by religion and you might imagine some gaps are not massive gaps because after all i mean you'll imagine that if it is biologically in grain sexual identity in sexual behavior biologic purely biological ingrain it would fall the rain upon all equally but that is not what you see now the counts argument here is that people are leaving particular former of religion if they are leg b t u for example and they are moving into other categories that is possible i do not think it's totally plausible considering the size of these gaps for example of you are muslin eighty five per cent of muslin identify as straight eight per cent identify as unquote something else do not no it something else amounts to but a neglig gill per centare write that eighty five plus eight is ninety three seven percent identifies either gain lesbian or by sexual among protestants eighty four per cent identify is strait catholic eighty three per cent identify is straight hind eighty two per cent identify is straight el d s seventy eight per cent identify as straight an thenyou start getting s the more atheistic runs jewfish is a is generally people who identify as jewfish very often thereof religious ninety particular way only sixty five percent identify is straight fifteen per cent identify as by sexual six per cent identifies gain lesbian twenty one percent plus fourteen who identify as connotes something else if you are an eigtheist fully forty five per cent of atheists say they are not straight forty five per cent tell me there is no linkage between environment ideology and sexual behavior and identity at i it is all biologically in grain sure sure it is it is if that that lie which is which lies at the route of the entire leg b t u movements to equate itself with the racial civil rites movement has been a lie since inception and remains a lie to day it is purely a matter of genetics and never matter of environment and the behavior itself is exactly the same as a biological component melon an in skin absolute silinisok one more thing that i hate apparently the rolling stone confounder yon winner has been removed from the rock and roll hall of fame board why hell he wrote a book and this book is about a bunch of great rockanrol artists the problem is the pick seven white dudes to profile which is bad apparently you're not allowed to do that because he was asked about it and om he was asked to quote acknowledge the per commence of color and women per formers are just not in your likewise and winner said in far as the women just none of them ere as articulate on this intellectual level and that none of the female or black musicians meat his criteria as philosophers of rock rather than just creative geniuses this provokes a mage reaction he said at one point just for public relation sake maybe i should have gone and found one black in one woman artist to include here that did not measure up to that same historical standard just to avert this kind of criticism mister runner's comments according to the near times troughanimmediate reaction with his quotes mocks on social media and past criticisms on earth of rollingstones covered to female artists under winner and a the rock an roll hollifame has now effectively kicked him off that is that is what they do now l is in other words it turns out that the seven men that he picked he things fer the best the and ut being seven white men he is not ayin that womenarenot capable of being great artists he is not saying that black people are not capable of being philosophers of rock he saying that the seven philosophers of rock who are the best are not blacken are not women ism not sure why that is super duper crazy maybe that is the way he sees it others can obviously disagree but that is that l if you are asked to name to day who are the greatest classical composers of all time an you are betoken both brains modzart all white men does this make you some sort of anti feminist radical or anti black radical you're not even saying that if given the same opportunities there would not have been a black baton you are just saying that betoken was the best had iron iron on understand the critique but that is the way that it works he is right by the way if you'd just placed one black woman in the compendium everybody left him alone which is truly incredible thing already coming up going to jump into you vaunted benchiperocho man back to make sure the you're a subscriber over at daily wire plus doom became member use

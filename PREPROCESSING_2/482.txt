welcome to the suberin lo science science path i man drew supermen and ism a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls t stamford it is however part of my desire an effort to bring zero cosmic consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i the thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens athletic greens is an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand an twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens an the reason i still take athletigreens once or twice to day is that t helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which our vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called got microfilm and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens it get the vitamins i need the minerals i need and the phobics to support my microfilm if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock come slash supermen and claim a special offer they give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin d three k too there are ton of at and ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if for getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient in vitamin d three and k too is also important because it regulates things carvascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic greenstone come slash supermen to claim the special offer of the fire travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar have talk many times before on this podcast about the key role of hydration and electrolytes for nerve sell function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues an organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium an potassium present in the preparation all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the preparations of electrolytes if you to try element you can go to drink element that is element t do come slash supermen and you will get a free element sample pack with your purchase there all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to else went elements dream slash superman this month on the superman labpodcast were talking all about physical performance that means athletic performance recreational exercise wait lifting running swimming yoga skills and skill learning to day we are going to talk about and focus on skill learning we are going to focus on how to learn skills more quickly in particular motor skills this will also translate to things musical skills in playing instruments but we are mainly gontofocus on physical movements of the body that extend beyond the hands just playing the piano or the fingers playing the guitar but everything we are going to talk about will also serve the formation and the consolidation and the performance of other types of skills if you are interested in how to perform better whether not its dance or yoga or even something that just very repetitive running or swimming this podcast episode is for you we are going to go deepest the science of skill learning and we are going to talk about very specific protocols that the science points to and has verified allow you to learn more quickly to imbed that learning that you remember it and to be able to build up skills more quickly than you would otherwise we are also going to touch on a few things that i get asked about a lot but fortunately recently have had the time to go deep into the literature extract the data for you and that is mental visualization how does visualizing a particular skill or practice serve the learning and or the consolidation of that practice turns out there are some absolutely striking protocols that one can use striking meaning they allow you to learn faster and they allow you to remember how to do things more quickly and better then if you were not dong this mental rehearsal but the pattern of mental rehearsal and when you do that mental rehearsal turns out to be vitally important ism excited for to day's episode we are going to share a lot of information with you and they are going to be a lot of very simple take always let us get started before we get into the topic of skill learning and tools for accelerating skill learning i want a briefly revisit the topic of temperature which was covered in the last episode and just highlight of few things in clear up some misunderstandings last episode talked about these incredible data from my cold crag hellers slab at stamford he is in the department of biology showing that cooling the palms in particular ways and at particular times can allow athletes or just recreational exercisers to do more pull ups dips bench presses per unit time to run further to paschal further and to feel better doing it there really are incredible data that are anchored in the biology of the vascular system the blood supply and how it is involved in cooling us many of you dozens of you in fact said wait a second you gave us a protocol in this episode which says that we should cool our palms periodically throughout exercise in order to be able to do more work but on the episode before that on growth hormone and fibroid hormone you said that heating up the body is good for release of growth hormone and i just want to clarify that both things are true these are too separate protocols you should always warm up before you exercise that warm up will not increase your body temperature or the muscle temperature to the point where it is going to diminish your work capacity that it is on harm your performance the cooling of the palms which is really just a route to cool your core in an efficient way the most efficient way in fact is about improving performance heating up the body with exercise and focussing on heat eat increases or using sand for heat increases is geared toward growth hormone release which is a separate matter you can do both of these protocols but you would want to do them at separate times such was to make this very concrete before i move on to to day's topic if you are interested in doing more work being able to do more sets and raps per unit time and feel better doing it or to run further or to cycle further then cooling the palms periodically as i described in the previous episode is going to be the way to go if you are interested in getting growth hormone release well then hot prana and i offered some other tools if you do not have sand in the episode on growth hormone and theroid harmony is gong to be the way to go was those are separate protocols you can include them in your in your fitness regime and your a training regime but you do want to do them at separate times and as at last point about this i also mention that affine can either help or hinder performance depending on whether not your affine adapted because of the ways that affine impacts body temperature and all sorts of things vast dilation in constriction it is very simple if you enjoy affine before your work outs and your accustomed to affine meaning you drink it three or five times or more a week hundred to three hundred milligrams is a typical daily dose of affine some of you are investing more some less if you do that regularly well then it is going to be just fine to invest affine before you train it is not going to impact your body temperature in your veto dilation or constriction and ways that will hinder you however if you are not a regular affine user and you are thinking oh ism going to drink a cup of coffee and get this huge performance enhancing effect well that is not con a happen chances are it is going to lead to increases in body temperature and changes in the way that blood flow is happening in your body and in particular on these palmer surfaces and in your face that is going to likely diminish performance if you enjoy affine and your accustomed to it call kafir adapted in joy it before your training if you regularly excuse me if you do not regularly use caffeine then you probably do not one of you caffeine as a performance enhancing tool and while we are on the topic of tools and because this is a month on athletic performance and exercise and physical skill learning i want to offer an additional tool that have certainly found useful which is how to relieve the called side stitch or side cramp when running or swimming this actually relates to respiration and to the nervous system and it is not a cramp if you have ever been out running and you felt you had a a pain on your side that pain could be any number of things but that what feels cramping of your side is actually due to what is called collateralization of the irenic nerve which is a lot harder to say than a side cramp or a side stitch but here is the situation you have a set of nerves which is called the irenic nerve p h re e an i c the irenic nerve which extends down from your brain stem essentially this region to your diaphragm to control your breathing it has a collateral meaning has a branch just the branch on a tree that enervates your liver and if you are not breathing deeply enough what can happen is you can get what is cold sometimes a referenced pain reference pain is problem can be familiar to any of you have ever read about how to recognize heart attack in a you have heart attacks will some as have pain on one side of their body the left arm sometimes people to have pain in a part of their back will suddenly also get pain in their shoulder or part of their face this has to do with the fact that many are of our nerves branch and are meaning their collateralize to different organs and areas of the body and the way those nerves are woven together it is often the case that if we disrupt the pattern of firing of electrical activity in one of those nerve branches that the other ones are affected to the side stitch the pain in your side is often because of the contractions of the diaphragm because of the way your breathing while your exercising running or swimming or biking and as a consequence you feel pain in your side but that is not a cramp the way to relieve it is very simple you do the physiological side that have talked about in previous a episodes of the podcast and elsewhere which is a double inhaul through the nose very deep and then a long exam and you might want to repeat that two or three times typically that will relieve the side stitch because of the way that it changes the firing patterns of the irenic nerve the side stitch is annoying its painful sometimes when you think were dehydrated and you might be dehydrated but oftentimes is just that we are breathing in a way that causes some referenced pain of the liver we called a side stitch or a side cramp an you can relieve it very easily through the double inhaul long hail that pattern done two or three times often you can continue to engage in the exercise while you do the double inhaul hail and it will just relieve itself that way give it a try if you experience the side stitch some people i know are also doing the double inhaul long hail during long continuous bouts of exercise i actually do this when i run we have decent data although these are still unpublished data that that can engage at kind of regular cadence of heart rate versatility there number reasons why this physiological side can be useful but it certainly can be useful for relieving the side stitch or called side cramp let us talk about the acquisition of new skills these could be skills such as a gulf swing or a tennis swing or you are shooting free throws or you are learning to dance or you are learning an instrument i mainly going to focus on athletic performance there basically two types of skills open loop and closed loop open loop skills our skills where you perform some sort of motor action and then you wait and you get immediate feed back as to whether not it was done correctly or not a good example would be throwing darts at a dartboard if you throw the dart you get feed back about whether not you hit the bull's eye you are off the dartboard or you are some other location on the dartboard that is open loop clothes loop would be something that is more continuous let us say your runner and you are starting to do some speed work and some sprint and you are running and you can kind of feel whether not your running correction maybe even have a coach and they are correcting your stride or your trying to a do some sort of skill the a hop scotch skill of which a maybe you are doing the latter work where your stepping between a designated spaces on the ground that is clothes loop because as you go you can adjust your behavior and you can adjust the distance of your steps or you can a just your speed or you can adjust your posture and you are able to essentially do more practise permit time but you are getting feed back on a moment to moment basis o came you have open loop and clothes loop and just to make this very very clear open loop would be practicing your tennis serve let us say that you set a target on the other side the net you throw the ball up and you you a hit the ball it goes over that is open loop you will know whether not you are in the cork you are on the location you wanted to hit or close to it or not that is open loop closed loop would be if you are in a regular canes maybe our learning a swim stroke or maybeou're trying to learn a particular rhythm on the drum may be you're trying to learn a particular beat ism not very musical not can embarrass myself by giving an example of this a the later i i i will ah where you are trying to get a particular rhythm down and if you are not getting it you can adjust in real time and try and catch out or slow down or speed up et camera o case topfull you will understand open loop and close loop you should always know before you try and learn a skill whether notes open loop or close loop and it'll return to why that is important shortly but you in learn something ask open loop or close loop there are essentially three components of any skill that involves motor movement and those are sensory perception a shall perceiving what you are doing and what is happening around you what you see what you hear sometimes your paying attention to what you are doing specifically the trajectory of your arm or how you are moving your feet if you are learning to dance sometimes you are more focus on something that is happening outside of you you are listening for something in music or your paying attention to the way your partner is moving et camera there sensory input then therefore the actual movements i there are the movements of your limbs in body and then there is something called proprioception ampropria reception is often discuss as kind of a sixth cense of knowing where your limbs are in relation to your body proprioception is vitally important if i reach down and pick up this pen and pick it up ism not thinking about where the pen and my hand is relative to my body but proprioceptively ism aware of it hat kind of a six cent deeper subconscious level i can also make myself aware of where of where my limbs are and typically when we learn we are placing more focus on proprioception than we do ordinarily if i get up from this chair and i happen to walk out of the room i do not think about where my feet a landing relative to one another but if my leg had fallen a sleep because i had been i you ka leaning on one of the nerves of my leg or something that and my leg feels all tingly or nun you i and you if the sort happen you would immediately notice a shift in gait it would feel strange it'd have to pay attention to how ism stepping and the reason is ism not getting any propriae captive feed back now skill learning has a lot of other dimensions to but those of the main ones that we are going to focus on as to remind you its you need to know open looper clothes loop and you need to know whither not t excuse me you need to know that there is sensory perception what your paying attention to movements themselves and propria caption and there is one other important thing that you need to know which is that movement of any kind is generated from one two or three sources within your nervous system within your brain and body these are sensual pattern generators which are sometimes called c eggs excuse me c p c see we s pages are something entirely different in biology ah c p g asses this dispose to show that i have a module c species are confront and sulphur prod likens they have nothing to do with this topic c p g asses are central pattern generators or c p gs there sometimes called these c p gs are in your spinal cord mine and yours different ones and they generate repetitive movements if you are walking if you are running if you are cycling if you are breathing which presume all you are and you are doing that in a regular rhythmic cadets central pattern generators are controlling that movement after you learn how to walk run swim cycle do anything really much of the work is handed off to these central pattern generators and there were experiments that were done in the sixty seventies and eighties that shall looked at decerebrate animals and even decerebrate humans these are humans and animals that lack a cerebral quarters they lack much of the brain and yet they can engage in what is called fictive movement it sounds get how to barbaric experiment ism glad i was not the one to have to do them but this is the stuff of euro science text books that cats that or dogs or mice that have their yo quarters we moved put them on a treadmill they will walk just fine and they will adjust their speed of walking just fine even though they easily lack all their thinking decision making brain and it turns out humans that have unfortunately massive strokes to their quarter and lacking no quarter but preserve these central pattern generators will also walk just fine even though they lack any of the other stuff in the brain these c p gs or c p g see are amazing and they control a lot of our already learn behavior when you are really good at something c p gs are controlling a lot of that behavior that is true also for a golf swing even if it is not really repetitive somebody whose really good at golf is gan i gs i call it a t you put the ball on the the a show of my knowledge of gold have only done many golf frankly in a but some day may be it'll learn how to golf bat you set the golf ball down and swing said the ball golf all down swing central pattern generators are going to hands lot of that if i were to go to the golf course stammered as a beautiful golf corse if i were to go out there put a ball on the the my central pattern generators would not be involved in that at all the moment i get you bring the club back to swing it is going to engage other things and the other things it is going to engage because i do not know that behavior now or then is upper motor neurons we have motor neurons in our quarter in our no quarter that control deliberate action and those ore the ones that you are engaging when you are learning those ore the ones that you have to pay attention in order to engage and that is what is happening for instance if i decide up en a reach down and pick up my pen which i rarely think about but now ism thinking about in man to do this in a very deliberate way om in grab with these two fingers and lift my upper motor neurons a now involved of upper motor neurons are very important because a little bit later in the episode when we talk about how to use visualization in order to accelerate skill learning it is going to leverage these upper motor neurons in very particular ways k we have sedges for rhythmic movement upper motor neurons for deliberate unlearned movements or movements that we are in the process of learning and then we have what are called lower motor her on lower motor irons of the ones in our spinal cord that send little wires out tor muscles which actually cause the firing of those muscle fibers of the way to think about this as you have got upper motor neurons which talk to so gees and to lower motor iron it is really simple and now most to everything there is to know about the neural pathways controlling movement at least for sake of this discussion any time we learn something we have to decide what to place our sensory perception on meaning what are we going to focus on that is critical you are listening this and you the type of person lights taking notes this should be the second question you ask the remember the first question is is a open loop or close loop the second question should be what should i focus my attention on auditory attention visual attention or propriety caption should i focus on where my limbs are relative to my body or should i focus on the outcome of this is a critical distinction you can decide to learn how to do a gulf swing or learn how to shoot free throws or learn how to dance tango and decide that you are going to focus on the movements of your partner or the positions of your feet you maybe are going to look at them maybe our going to sense them you are going chalk feel where they are or maybe you are going to sense the position an posture of your body which is more proprioceptive of you have to plicate your attention and ism going to tell you how to allocate your attention best in order to learn faster these is the sorts of decisions that you have to make fortunately for you you do not have to think about whether not you are on to use your upper motor her on and you are lower motor neurons or not because if you do not know how to do something your automatically going to engage your upper motor nerds and if you do you are all it then your ocean use your upper motornrons your mainly going to rely on central pattern generators you are always using your lower motor near on to move muscle we can really simplify things now if giving you a lot of in formation but we can simplify it basically open looper clothes loup that is one question and what am i get a focus on and then your horology will take care of the rest now i want to talk about realistic expectations somewhere in plywood presumably it got in bedded in somebody is mind that instant skill acquisition was possible that you could take a particular pill or you could touch a particular object or you could have a wand wave over you and you would suddenly have a skill and that is the result of hollywood at all it does not exist at least not in reality and i love movies but it simply does not exist then the self help literature created another rule called the ten thousand hours rule and frankly that does not really match the literature at least the scientific literature either i it because it implies that learning takes time which is more accurate than the hollywood at all instant skill acquisition rule which is not really a rule it is a myth but the ten thousand hours rule overlook something crucial which is that it is not about ours it is about repetitions now of course there is a relationship between time and repetitions but there are some beautiful experiments that point to the fact that by simple adjustment of what you are focused on as you attempt to learn a new skill you can adjust the number of repetitions that you do you adjust your motivation for learning and you can vastly accelerate learning some of you may recognize this by its internet name which is not a scientific term which is the supercargo effect there is chalk a quite good video on you to describing the supercargo fact i think it was a tuber who has a think background in science and he did an interesting experiment and it'll talk about his experiment first and then i will talk about the neurobiology that supports the result that he got the supercargo effect relates to the games supercargo brothers but you will see why at the end but basically what they did was they had fifty thousand subjects which is a enormous number of subjects learn a programmed essential taking words from a computer program work i the commands for a compute program that were kind of clustered in a column on the right these are the sorts of things that computer programmed will be familiar with but other people will not and those commands are essentially they mentally translate to things go forward and then if it is a right hand turn in the maze than go right and a continue until you hit a choice point et camera it is a bunch of instructions but the job of the subjects in these experiments were to organize those instructions in a particular way that would allow a little curse to move through the maze successfully of basically the goal was or at least what the subjects were told is that any one can learn to computer programmed and if somebody can just organize the instructions in the right way then they can program this little curse to move through a maze very simple and yet if you do not haver background in computer programming or even if you do it takes them skill yet to know what commands to give in what particular order and they made that very easy youassemble them in the list over on to the right people started doing this now there were two groups and some one half of the subjects if they got it wrong meaning they entered a command and the curse would move and it was the wrong command for this little cursed move through the maze they saw a signal jump up on their screen that said that did not work please try again if they got they put in the wrong commanders and the wrong sequences say that did not work please try again and than the people would at the subjects would reorganize the instructions than then the courser would continue and if they got t wrong again it would say that did not work please try again on the other half of the subjects if they got something wrong were told you just lost five points please continue that is the only difference in the feed back that they got now i have to confess i would have predicted based on my knowledge of dopamine circuitry and reward contingency and at the reverend and stress and motivated learning and this other thing that we have been told in many many books on behavior economics and in the self help literature which is that people will work much harder to prevent losing something than they will to gain something that you hear all the time and it turns out that that is not at all what happened if they looked at the success rate of the subjects what they found was that these subjects that were told that did not work please try again had a sixty eight per cent success rate sixty eight per cent of them went on to successfully program this curse a moving through the maze whereas the ones that were told you lost five points had a fifty two per cent successrate which is a significant different but the source of the success or the lack of success is really interesting the subjects that were told that did not work please try again tried many many more times per unit time in other words they made more attempts at programming this thing to allow this cursor remove through the maze whereas the people that were told you lost five points gave up earlier or gave up entirely of let us just step back from this because to me this was very surprising it violates a lot of things that i had heard in the kind of popular culture or the see help literature that people will work much harder to avoid losing something than they will to gain something and it did not really fit with what i understood about reward contingencies endogamy but it did fit well with another set of experiments that a very familiar with from the narrow science literature and it'll give you the punch line first and then we are going to take what these dateamean and we are going to talk about a learning protocol that you can use that will allow you to learn skills faster by willingly participating in more repetitions of the skill learning meaning you will want to do more repetitions even if you are getting it wrong some or most of the time the experiment that i want to tell you about is called the tube test and this is generally done in mice although it sometimes been done in rats and has a lot of parallels to somethings that you have probably seen and experience even in human life in regular life may been in your life hers the experiment you take two rats you put him in a tube or two mice put him in a tube and mice and rats they do not to share the same tube what the will do as they'll start pushing each other back and forth back and forth sooner or later one of the rats or mice pushes the other one out the one they got pushed out is the loser the one that gets the tube is the winner one now you take the winner you give it a new competitor and what you find is that the mouse or rat that one previously has they much higher than chance probability of winning the second time in other words winning before leads to winning again ad the reverse is also true if you take the loser and you put that loser in with another mouse fresh mouse new mouse the loser typically will lose at much greater probability than chance and this is not related to differences in strength or size or testosterone or any other the things that might leap to mind as explanations for this because those were all controlled forth now that result have been known about for decades but three years ago there was a paper published in the journal science phenomenal journal to one of the three apex journals that examined the brain area that is involved in this turns outs of particular area the frontal quarter for those of viol that want to know and they did a simple experiment where they the experimenters increased or decreased the activity of this brain area in the prefrontal quartexlal subregion of the prefrontal quarter and what they found is if they stimulated this brain area a mouse or rat regardless of weather r not it had been a winner or loser before became a winner every single time and they showed that if they blocked the activity of this brain area regardless of whether not the mouse a rat had been a winner or a loser it became a loser every single time and this translated to other scenarios other competitive scenarios where they put a bunch of mice or rats in a cut a cool chamber they would have a little heat la p in the corner and mice heat and there was only enough space for one mouths to get the be under the heat and the one that had one in the tube test or that have the vranario stimulated always got than nice warm spot so what is this magic brain area what is it doing well the reason i bringing this up to day and the reason ism bringing it up on the heels of the supercargo effect is that stimulation of this brain area had a very simple and very important effect which was it led to more forward steps more repetitions more effort but not in terms of sheer might and will not digging deeper just more repetitions per unit time and the losers had fewer repetitions per unit time the supercargo effect this online experiment and the tube test which has been done by various labs and repeated again and again point to a simple but very important rule which is neither the ten thousand hours rule nor the magic wand hollywood version of learning but rather the nerobiological explanation for learning a skill is you want to perform as many repetitions per unit time as you possibly can at least when you are first trying to learn a skill i not a repeat that you want o perform as many repetitions as you possibly can at least when you are first trying to learn a skill now that might sound a do is just more reps but it is not obvious there is no reason why more repetitions should necessarily lead to faster learning because you could also say when more repetitions you can make more errors and those errors would lead to poor performance misstepping a number of times and in these cases there is there is very little feet back right it is not every time ah the the rat pushes forward or moves back that it is sensing oh ism winning ism losing ism wing ism losing on a micro level it probably does that as it starts to push the other one out the rat or mouth probably things ism winning and as it is backing up its ply things ism losing as you play the game the supercargo game you are told nope that did not work nope that did not work please try again but the important thing is that the winners are always generating more repetitions per unit time it is just a repeat of performance repeat of performance even if there are errors and that points to something vitally important which is reps are important but making error ups is also important in fact it might be the most important factor let us talk about errors and why those solve the problem of what to focus on because as is said earlier if you want to learn something you need to know of its open luperclothe loop and you need to now what to focus on where to place your perception and that seems a tough task but errors will tell you exactly what to focus on let us talk about errors and why you can leverage errors to accelerate skill learning cast we have established that performing the maximum number of repetitions per training section is going to be advantageous and that might seem obvious but there is a shadowy side to that which is well why would i wanted just repeat the same thing over and over again if ism getting it wrong ninety per cent of the time and the reason is that the errors actually cut your nervous system to two things one to error correction and the other is it opens the door or the window for narrow plasticity her plasticity is the brain and nervous systems ability to change in response to experience essentially to custom modify itself in order to perform anything better we did not entire month onnerrow plasticity and i talked a little bit about errors and why they are important now we are going to make this very concrete and operationalize it make it very actionable the was a paper that was published in twenty twenty one from normal at all this is a very important paper it was publishing the journal neuron which is a sell press journal excellent journal the title of the paper gives i gives it away essentially which is post error recruitment of frontal sensory cortical projections promotes attention now what that says is that when you make an error it causes and activation of the brain areas that anchor your attention remember we need perception attention which are there sensually the same thing we need proprioception and we need the upper and lower motor none to communicate in the proper ways and this vital question is what to pay attention to errors tell your nervous system that something needs to change if you are performing a task or a skill your learning how to dance and your stepping on the other persons toes or your fumbling or your not getting it right those errors are opening the possibility for plasticity if you walk away at that point you have made the exact wrong choice ora unless the errors are somehow hazardous to your health or somebody ease's well being you want to continue to engage at a high repetition rate that is really where the learning is possible without errors the brain is not in a position to change itself errors actually cue the frontal quarter networks what we call top down processing and the narrow modulators things doomed in a set coming an epineferon that will allow for plasticity while the supercargo experiment the maze experiment was only focused on generating errors telling people that was not right please try again or that was not right you lost five points the key distinction is that the errors themselves cued people to the fact that they needed to change something if you are trying to learn a new skill and your screwing up in your making mistakes the more mistakes you make the more p plastic your brain becomes such that when you get it right that correct pattern will be rewarded and consolidated and you can trust that it will because the performance of something correctly is associated with the release of this normodulator dopamine dopamine is involved in craving and motivation involved in a lot of things but it is also involved in learning we will do an entire episode on dopamine and learning but because some of you're probably wondering this does not mean that just increasing your dopamine levels before learning will allow you to learn faster in fact increasing your dopamine levels before learning using farm colony will actually reduce what is called the signal to noise it will make these increases in dopamine that pop up in your brain that suddenly make yourelize ah i got that one right it will make those smaller relative to the background levels of dopamine of you want a big spike in dopamine when you perform a motor pattern correctly and you want to make lots of errors many many repetitions of errors in order to get to that correct performance now if you are most people you are going to do this in a way that is somewhat random meaning let say it is a tennis serve i cannot play tennis have i think have probably played tennis twice if i throw the ball up in the air and hid it a in it get it wrong and pro hit the net than hit the net then it'll pro go too long than pi e over the fence at some point i to think it'll get it correct the dopamine signal for that is going to be quite big and it'll think of what did i do there i actually do not know i was not paying attention what i was paying attention to is whether not the ball when to the correct location on the opposite the net remembers an open loop move i do not actually know what i did correctly but your nervous system will take care of that provided i in this case complete more and more and more repetitions now if i were to just elevate my was a level of dopamine by taking idon'kno fifteen hundred milligrams of tire ell tyrosine or something that would be bad because the increase in dopamine would actually be much lower right the we would say the deltas smaller the signal the noise is smaller if my overall levels of dopamine are very very high a mashiganl learn less well for skill learning motor skill learning increasing your dopamine levels prior is not a good idea it might help with motivation to get to the learning but it is not going to improve the plasticity process itself and it is likely to hinder it as that is very important these errors cue the brain that something was wrong and they open up the possibility for plasticity it is what sometimes called the framing effect it frames what is important and i think this is a a shift at we have here it about growth mind set which is the incredible discovery and theory and practice of my colly carrell to i could stamford this is distinct from that right this is not about a motivation to learn this is about how you actually learn the key is designate a particular block of time that you are going to perform repetitions maybe that is thirty minutes may be that is an hour work for time and then try and perform the maximum number of repetitions that you can do safely for you and others permit time that is going to be the best way to approach learning for most sessions it'll talk about other things that one can do but making errors is key and this is not a motivational speech are not saying oh go make errors errs are good for you you have to fail in order to win no you have to fail in order to open up the possibility of plasticity but you have to fail many times within the same session and those failures will cue your attention to the appropriate sensory events now sometimes we are working with a coach and this is a shout out to all the coaches thank you for doing what you do however there needs to be at least what the scientific literature say there needs to be a period of each training session whereby the athlete or the person of any kind can simply pay attention to their errors without their attention being cued to something else ut really well trained coach will say oh your elbows swinging to high or your you are not gripping the racket in the appropriate way et camera they can see things that the partition or cannot see and of course that is vitally important but the practitioner also needs to use this error recognition signal they need to basically focus on something and the errors are going to tell them what to focus on put simply there needs to be a period of time in which is just repetition after repetition after repetition i think many people including coaches are afraid that bad habits will get in grained and while indeed that is possible it is very importing that these errors occur in order to cue the attentional systems and to open the door for plasticity if ism told look at you know ism standing a little wide i need to tighten up my stance a little bit great but then i need to generate many repetitions from that tighten starts case if ism constantly being cued from the outside about what ism doing in correctly that is not going to be as efficient chest for some people these learning sessions might be ten minutes for some people it might be an hour whatever you can locate because your lie styles will vary in your wether not your professional athlete et camera will vary you want to get the maximum number of repetitions an and you want to make errors that is allowing for plasticity science points to the fact that there is a particular sequencing of learning sessions that will allow you to learn faster and to retain the skill learning at involves doing exactly as i just described which is getting as many repetitions as you can in the learning session paying attention to the errors that you make and then the rewards that will be generated again these are narrow chemical rewards from the successful performance of a movement or the approximate successful performance maybe you get the guffawing better but not perfect but that still going to be rewarded with this nor chemical mechanism and then after the session you need to do something very specific which is nothing hit is right there are beautiful data describing neurons in our hippocampus this marry of our brain involved in the consolidation of new memories those date a point to the fact that in sleep there is a replay of the sequence of anurans that were involved on certain behaviors the previous day and sometimes the previous day before that however there are also data that show that after a skill learning session any kind of motor movement provided you are not bringing in a lot more additional new sensory stimulant there is a replay of the motor sequence that you performed correctly and there is an elimination of the motor sequences that you performed incorrectly and they are run backward in time ski to be very clear about this if i were to learn a new skill or navigate a new city or let u stay with the the motor skill let say that the freethrow or a gull swing or a tennis serve dance move novice ism still in t make a lot errors do not get it perfectly in maybe i get a little bit better or i perform it correctly threesomes out of a thousand that sounds something i might do and there a am probably being generous to myself after i finish the training session if i do nothing ism not focussed on some additional learning ism not bringing a lot of sensory information in if i just sit there and close my eyes for five to ten minutes even one minute the brain starts to replay the motor sequence of the corcorresponding to the correct pattern of movement but it plays that sequence backward now why it plays it backward we do not know if i were to wait until sleep or regardless when i sleep later that night the sequence will rebel replayed forwards in the proper sequence immediately afterward it is played backward for reasons that are still unclear but the replay of that sequence backwards appears to be important for the consolidation of the skill learning now this is important because many people are finishing their jujitsu class or they are finishing their yoga class or they are finishing their dance class or they are finishing some skill learning and then there immediately devoting their attention to something else you here a lot about visualization and we are going to talk about visualization but in the kind of obsession with the idea that we can learn things just sitting there with our eyes closed without have in to perform a movement we have overlooked something perhaps even more important or at least equally important which is after skill learning after putting effort into something sitting quietly with the eyes closed for one to five to ten minutes allows the brain to replay the sequence in a way that appears important for the more rapid consolidation of the motor sequence of the pattern and to accelerated learning if you would to learn more about this this is not work that i was involved in i want to be very clear there is an excellent paper that covers this and much more for those wether really want to dive deep on this and we will dive deeper in a moment this is a review that was published in the journal neuron excellent journal many of the papers that am referring to were covered in the in this review which is titled narrow plasticity subserving motor skill learning by don d a we a n i hope off not buttering the pronunciation and con by leopard con but not he not the leopard con most of us are familiar with on the musician a leopard con don in con negro plasticity subserving motor skill learning and this was published a in two thousand eleven but there been a number of updates and the literature that have described in other portions of today's episode come from the more recent literature such as the more recent twenty twenty one paper one soave this basic learning session and then a period of time afterwards in which the brain can rehearse what it just did we hear much about mental rehearsal and we always think about mentor rehearsal as the thing you do before you you train or instead of training but this is rehearsal that is done afterward where the brain is just automatically scripting through the sequence and for some reason that still not clear as to why it this would be the case it runs backward than in sleep it runs forwards and certainly absolutely sleep and quality sleep of the appropriate duration et camera as going to be important for learning of all kinds including skill learning we did not entire four episodes on sleep and how to get better t sleeping those wore the episodes back in canary episodes a sensually one to three in for and maybe even episode five a do not recall but you can go there to find out all about how to get better at sleeping now there are other training sessions involved right ism not king a learn the perfect gulf swaying or the tennisserve or how to dance in one session and i doubt you will either the question is when to come back and what to do when you come back to the training session now first of all this principle of errors curing attention and opening the opportunity for plasticity that is never going to change that is going to be true for somebody whose hyper skilled who even a has mastery or even virtuosity in a given skill right remember when you are unskilled that something uncertainty is very high as you become more skilled certainty goes up right then eventual you achieve levels of mastery were certainty is very very high about your ability to perform yours certainty and that of other people a when there is this forth category of virtuosity where somebody maybe you invites uncertainty back into the practice because only with that uncertainty can you express your your full range of of abilities which you are not even aware of until uncertainty comes into the picture right i a happen to a have the great a privilege of of being friends with lair hamilton the biguavesurfe is phenomenal i do not serf a certainly do not serf with laird but he and am another guy that he serves with lucapadua their these guys a their virtuosos at serving they do not just want the wave that they can master they want uncertainty they are at the point in their practice where when uncertainty shows up a wave that either big or om is moving in a particular wave that it brings an element of uncertainty for them about what they are going to do that they recognize that is the opportunity to perform better than they would otherwise casa they are actually trying to eliminate uncertainty at the beginning of learning any skill and as we approach from uncertain to skilled to mastery we want a reduce uncertainty and that is really wat the nervous system is doing it is trying to eliminate errors and hone in on the correct trajectories if you perform a lot of repetitions and then you use a period immediately after we do not really have a name for this may be some one will come up with it and put in the comment section if you are on you to have you are watching this on you to a name for this posts learning kind of idle time for the brain the brain is an idle at all at actually scripting all these things in reverse that allow for deeper learning and more quick the were quick learning but if we fill that time with other things if we are focused on our phones or were focussed on learning something else re focussing on our performance that is not going to serve us well at least is not in a serve the skill learning well please if your interested more rapid skill learning try introducing these sessions they can be quite powerful and then on subsequent sessions presumably after a night sleep or may be redoing two sessions a day although two sessions the days can be a lot for most people unless you are professional or am high level athlete the subsequent sessions or where you get to express the gains of the previous session right where you get to perform well presumably more often even of its jussuttle sometimes they will be a decrease in performance but most often you are going to perform better on subsequent and subsequent training sessions and there is the opportunity to devote attention in very specific ways right not just let the errors inform you were to place your attention but rather to direct your perception to particular elements of the movement in order to accelerate learning further i to be very clear cause i know many of you are interested in in concrete protocols it is not just that you would only folk let errors cue your attention on the first session you might do that for one session or five sessions are going to depend but once your familiar with something in your performing it well every once in a while your accomplishing it better every once in a while then you can start to color attention in very deliberate ways and the question therefore becomes what to curious attention to and the good news is it does not matter there is a beautiful set of experiments that have been done looking at sequences of keys being played on a piano is work that was published ah just a couple years ago thar a she several papers now that are focussed on this one of them ah was publishing twenty eighteen this is from a cauda late and colleagues ell a p p e done some really nice work which talks about the the influence of pitch feed back on learning of motor timing and sequencing and this was done with piano but it carries over to athletic performance as well some on to describe the study to you but before i describe it what is interesting about this study that i want you to know about is that it turns out it does not matter much what you pay attention to during the learning sequence provided at something related to the motor behavior that your performing right that seems incredible right ism not good at a tennis sire if have done let us ay a thousand repetitions o the tennisserve may be i got it right three to ten times now being even more generous with myself and i do this post training session when i let my brain idle and i get some good sleep and i come back and oi start entering errors again presume or hopefully fewer errors but i decide on an accuse my attention to something very specific maybe ah how tightly ism holding the racket or maybe it is my stance or maybe it is a whether not i rotate my right shoulder in as as i hit the ball across than i making the up again i do not playtennis turns out that as long as it is the same thing throughout the session learning is accelerated and it'll explain why this is make sense in a moment but just to be really clear you can and one should use your powers of attention to direct your attention to particular aspects of a motor movement once your familiar with the general theme of the movement but what you pay attention to exactly is not important what is important is that you pay attention to one specific thing at cauda late and colleague showed was that if people are trying to learn a sequence of keys on the piano there are multiple forms of feed back there are error signals if for instance they he are a piece of music and then they are told to press the keys in a particular sequence and the noise that comes out the sound that comes out of the piano does not sound the song they just heard right instead of a and here forgive me because i can neither i neither musical nor can i sing but instead of dentettetete they hear that e e terete the the and then instead when they play arrest would sound something dententit would not sound right it would not sound right because i likely got the sequence wrong or i was pressing too hard on the keys or too lightly on the keys et camera what they showed was if they just instruct people about the correct sequence to press on the keys it actually does not matter what sound comes back provided it is the correct sound or it is the same sound right here is the experiment they hade people press on these keys and the it was a typical piano and it generated the particular sequence of sounds that would be generate by pressing the keys on the piano or they modified the keyboard in this case or piano such that when people pressed on the keys a random tone different tones were played each time they pressed on the keys it sounded crazy it sounded noise but the motor sequence was the same or they had a single tone that was played every time they press the key and the job ere the task of the subject was just to press the sequence it it pressed the keys in the proper sequence instead f deteteteteteteit was just detetetetetete instead of de tee we e the it is de tide date e the it is even hard for me to say it i con it even a tone but you get the idea a singular tone just think a door bell being wrong with each press of the key we be really annoying but it turns out that the rate motor learning was the same whether or not they were getting feed back that was accurate to the keys of the piano or whether not it was a constant tone performance was terrible and the rates of learning were terrible if they were getting random tones back what this means is that learning to play the piano at least at these early stages is really just about generating the motor command it is not about paying attention to the sound that is coming out of the piano and this make sense because when we are beginners we are trying to focus our attention on the things that we can control and if you think about this if you conceptualize this pressing the keys on the piano and paying attention to the sounds that are coming out or two things what this means is that as you get deeper and deeper into oppractis focussing purely on the motor execution can be beneficial now this is going to be harder to do with open loop type things where you are getting feed back i guess a good example of open loop would be the attempt at a backlit right if you get it wrong you will immediately know if you get it right you will immediately know please do not go out and trying to a backlit on on the solid ground or even on a trampling if you do not know what you are doing because very likely you'll get it wrong and you will get injured but if it is something that is close sloop where you can repeat again and again and again and again that is advantageous because you can perform many many repetitions and you can start to focus or learn to focus your attention just on the pattern of movement in other words you can learn to play the piano just as fast or maybe even faster by just focusing on the sequence that you are moving your digest your fingers and not the feed back now ism sure there are music teachers out their and piano teachers are screaming no you are gin ruin the practice that all of us have imbedded in our minds in our students and i agree at some point you need to start including feed back about whether not things sound correct but one of the beauties of skill learning is that you can choose to parametrize it meaning you can choose to just focus on the motor sequence or just focus on the sounds that are coming back and then integrate those and we hear a lot about chucking about breaking things down into their component parts but one of the biggest challenges for skill learning is knowing where to place your attention to dial out again were building a protocol across this episode early sessions maybe it is the first one may bet's the first ten maybe it is the first hundred it depends on how many repetitions your packing in but during those initial sessions the key is to make many errors to let the reward process govern the plasticity let the errors open the plasticity and then after the learning sessions to let the brain go idle least for a short period of time and of course to maxim sleep as you start incorporating more sessions you start to gain some skill level learning to harness and focus your attention on particular features of the movement independent of the rewards and the feed back right the reward is no longer in the tone coming from the piano or whether not you struck the target correctly but simply the motor movement focusing your o for instance in a dart throw on the action of your arm that is imbedding the plasticity in the motor pattern most deeply that is what is been shown by the scientific literature ism sure there are coaches and teachers out there that will entirely disagree with me and that is great please let me know what you prefer let me know where you think this is wrong a and it rarely happens but let me know where you think this might be right as well were breaking the learning process down into its component parts as we get more and more skilled meaning as we make fewer and fewer errors per given session permit time that is when attention can start to migrate from one feature such as the motor sequence to another fencer which is perhaps am one's stance and an other sequence a component of the sequence which would be the result that is one getting on a trial to trial basis rights of changing it up each times may be i serve the tennis ball and focussing on where the ball lands then ism focussing on the speed than infixing on my grip than infixing o my stance from trial to trial but until we have mastered the for motor movements which is done session to session that at least according to the literature that i have access to hear seems to be suboptimal hopefully this is starting to make sense which is that you these connections between upper motor nor on lower motor nor on and central pattern generators you cannot attack them all at once you cannot try and change them all at once and what were doing is were breaking things down into their component parts some of you may be wondering about speed of movement there are some data meaning some decent papers out there showing that ultra slow movements performing a movement it essentially in slow motion can be beneficial for enhancing the rate of skill learning however it least from my read of the literature it appears that ultra slow movements should be performed after some degree of proficiency has already been gained in that particular movement now that is not the way i would have thought about i would a thought well your learning how to do a proper kick or a paunch in marshal arts or something that ultra slow movements at first are going to be the way that one can a best learn how to perform a movement and then you just gradually increase the speed and turns out that is not the case and i probably should have known that and you should probably know that because it turns out that when you do ultra slow movements two things are not available to you one is the proprioceptive feed back is not accurate because fast movements of limbs are very different than slow movements of limbs you do not get the opportunity to build in the proprioceptive feed back but the other reason why it does not work is that it is too accurate you do not generate errors and the data that i was able to find showed that very slow movements can be beneficial if one is already proficient in a practise but very slow movements at the beginning do not allow you to learn more quickly because you never generate errors and therefore the brain does not it is not open for change the window for plasticity is never swung open to speak brings us back to the theme that errors allow for plasticity correct performance of movements or semi correct performance of movements cue he the synapses in the brain areas and spinal circuits that need to change and then those changes occur in the period immediately after skill learning and in sleep super slow movements can be beneficial once you already have some proficiencies this might be standing in your living room and just in ultra slow motion performing your tennis serve learning to r thinking about how your adjusting your elbow in your arm in the trajectory exactly how you were taught by your tennis coach but trying to learn it that way from the outset does not appear to be the best way to learn a skill when should you start to introduce slow learning well oviduct tacked your coaches about this but ah if you doing this recreational or you do not have a coach i realize many of you do not i do not have a coach for anything that i do ism going of just navigating it a through the by using the scientific literature it appears at once your hitting successorates of about twenty five or thirty per cent that is where the superslow movements can start to be beneficial but if you're still performing things at a rate of five or ten per cent correct and the rest a errors then the superslow movements are probably not going to benefit you that much also superslow movements are not really applicable to a lot of things a for instance a you could imagine throwing a dart superslow motion but if you actually trying throw an actual dart the darts just can a fall of the floor obviously there are number of things a youknow baseball bat swing which you can practice in superslow motion but if you try no do that with an actual baseball or softball or something that as i can i give you any kind of feed back about how effective it was superslow a movements or a decelerated movement has its has its place but once you are already performing things reasonably well maybe twenty five to thirty per cent successor now and have tried this i actually i struggle with basketball a for whatever reason and my freethrow is terrible have practiced threethrows in superslow motion and i nail them every time that he promise there is no ball some of you already have of fair degree of efficiency of skill in a given practice or sport or instrument and if you are in the sort of advanced intermediate or advance levels of proficiency for something there is a practice that you can find a interesting data for in the literature which involves metronomic this you will realize relates to generating repetitions and it relates to the tone experiment where it does not really matter what your attention is cue to as long as you are performing many many rests of the motor sequence you can use a metronome an obviously musicians do this but athletes can do this too you can use a metronome to set the cadence of your repetitions no for swimmers there is actually a device i was able to find on line i forget wat the grandame was and that is not what this is about but a that actually goes in the swim cap that can cue you to when you need to perform another stroke and for runners there is a therefore other metronome typed devices that a through headphones or through a tone in the room if your running indoors are on a treadmill will cue you to when you basically you need to lift your heels and if you do that a what athletes find is they c and perform more repetitions that can generate more output you can increase speed a number really interesting things are being done with auditory metronomic and then ism involved in a little bit of work now that a hopefully it'll be able to report back to you about using stroke of comic metronomic sashay changing the the speed of the visual environment these are fun experiments expbasely changing one's perception of how fast their moving through space by playing with the visual system something for a future discussion but you can start to use auditory metronomic for generating more movements per unit time and generating more errors and therefore more successes and more narrow plasticity there are number different as out there am i found several free as where you can set in metronome pays might be titctitititc that is a little fast for most things but you can imagine if this were a darts or this were a golf swings that you might be tictictitic or something more tactic and every time the metronome goes you swing every time the metronome goes you throw a dart she is en wild experiments out there dinothere is he world championship of cup stacking s a a young lady who am i saw could take all these cups spread out on a table and basically just stack them into the perfect pyramid and the least amount ofttimes all the kids go wild this is mouthy i never thought to pursue in and frankly never will pursue unless my life depends on it for some reason butts really impressive and if you look at the sequent cause these have been recorded you can look this up on on you to a what you will find is that these expert cupstackers is just all about error elimination but there to metronomic and auditory use can actually cue them to pick up the cups faster than they would ordinarily and to learn to do that you can do this for anything i think unstacking am is probably not a skill most of your interest in doing but am for any skill if you figure out at what rate you are performing repetitions per unit time and you want to increase that slightly you set a metronome which is slightly faster than your current rate and you just start generating more repetitions now whit is interesting about this in is cool is it relates back to the experiment from lapping colleagues which is your attention is now harness to the tone to the metronome not necessarily to what you are doing in terms of the motor movement and really you need a bit of proficiency again this is for people in intermediate advanced intermediate or advance but what your essentially doing is your creating and outside pressure a contingency that you generate again more errors it is all about the errors that you get and now these are an errors where all the cups tumble or you have to stop or you can't keep up love to set the pace just a little bit beyond what you currently can do and when you when you do that you are essentially forcing the nervous system to make errors and correct the errors inside of the session i find this really interesting be cause what it means is again you have got sensory perception what your paying attention to proprioception where your limbs are and the motor neurons in your upper lower motor neurons and central pattern generators and you cannot pay attention to well they are my ow upper motornrons they are my lower motor none forget that you are not going to do that you cannot pay attention to your proprioception too much that would be the superslow motion would be the proprioception but you have to harness your attention to something and if you harness your attention to this outside contingency this metronome that is firing off and saying now go now go now go not only can you increase the number of repetitions errors and successes but for some reason and we do not know why the regular cadence of the tone of the metronome and the fact that you are anchoring your movements to some external force to some external pressure or cue seems to accelerate the plasticity and the changes and the acquisition of skills beyond what it would be if you just did the same number of repetitions without that outside pressure we do not know exactly what the mechanism is presumably it is near a chemical their something about keeping up with a timer or with a pace that presumably and ism speculating here causes the release of particular chemicals but i thing it is really cool metronomes that they are totally inexpensive at least the one that you use to outside of water are very inexpensive you can find these free as own you can is a musical metronome metronomes are a powerful tool as well in particular for speed work for sprinting or swimming or running where the goal is to generate more strokes or more efficient strokes or more steps et camera the the rate of the metronome obviously is going to be very important sometimes you are trying to length in your strides sometimes your you are trying to take fewer strokes but glide further in the pool for instance but the value of occasionally just increasing the number of repetitions the number of strokes or steps et camera permit time is also that you are training the central pattern generators to operate at that higher speed you one of the sports has kind of interesting to me as speed walking it is not one i engage in or ever plan to engage in but ifyouve ever tried to really speed walk it is it is actually difficult to walk very very fast without breaking into a run all animals have these find of cross over points where they go where you go you i think of horses ait is that was that they they trot than they galloon what is the next thing i n clearly don't knowing about a about horses a except that they're beautiful and i them very much but they they break into a different kind of stride and that is because you shift over to different patcentral pattern generators when you are walking or a horse is moving very slowly and then it breaks into a jog and then into a full sprinter i i get i the gallop for the horse your actually engaging different central pattern generators and those central pattern generators always have a range of speeds that their happiest o function at with the metronomic for for speed purposes what you do is you can you can basically bring the activity of those central pattern generator into their upper upper range and may be even extend their range and there a fascinating biology of how central pattern generators work together there is coupling of central pattern generators et camera to in order to achieve maximal speeds and et camera it is a topic for a kind of an advance caption still loves the topic you just park and loves is much embarked again in any event the metronome is a powerful tool again for more advanced practitioners or for advanced intermediate practitioners but om it is interesting because it it brings back the point that what we put our attention to while we are skill learning is important to the extent that it is on one thing at least for the moment or trial to trial but that what we focus our attention on can be external it can be internal and ultimately the skill learning is where all that is brought together lit is talk about were skill learning occurs in the nervous system and then ism going to give you a really o what i think is a really cool tool that can increase flexibility and range of motion based on this particular brain area the tool that i used and when i first heard about i did not believe would work ut is not a hack this is actually anchor deeply in the biology of a particular brain region that we all have a which whose meaning is mini brain and that mini brain that we all have is called your para vellum the sarabellum is called the many brain because it is in the back your brain t looks a little many version of the rest of your brain sin absolutely incredible structure that is involved in movement it also has a lot of non movement associated functions in brief the sarabellum get's in put from your senses particular your eyes and paysitinto were your eyes are in space what your looking at it basically takes information about three aspects of your eyes and eye movements which are occurring when your head goes this which is called pitch i this pitch for those you listening ism just nodding up and down then there is yaw which is shaking your head know from side aside and then there is roll which is sometimes if you see a a primate a marmoset or something they will roll their head when they look at you shall the reason they do that is it helps generate depth perception it is a kind of form of motion parallax if you curious why they do that it is not to lookout they do it because when they do that even if your stationary in their stationary they get better depth perception as to how far away from them you are you have got pitch yaw and roll and as you move your head and as you move your body and you move through space the image on your etna moves pitchy roll and some combination that information is relaid to your sarabellum it is rich with visual information there is also a map of your body surface and your movements and timing in the sarabellum it is an incredible structure that brings tog ether timing of moments which limbs are moving and has porperaceptive information it really as a many brain its just the coolest little structure back there and in humanszactually not that little it is just a incredible structure now all this information is integrated there but what most people do not tell us is that a lot of learning of motor sequences of skill learning that involve timing occurs in the sarabellum now you cannot really use that information except to know that after you learn something pretty well it's handed forward and of handled by your sarabellum but there is something tat you can do with your sarabellum to increase range of motion and flexibility much of our flexibility believe it or not is not because our tendons are of particular length or a elasticity although that plays it someone it is not because our muscles are short i do not know what that would even mean someteole have have longer muscle bellies or short er muscle bellies but your muscles always essentially span the entire length of the of the the bone or limb or close to it along with your pendents but as to do with the curl innervation of muscle and the fact that when muscles are elongated there is a point at which they will not stretch out any longer and the nerves fire and they shut down that you actually have inhibitory pathways that that prevent you from contracting the muscles or exon from extending them from stretching them out any more you can do this right now if your driving do not do it because unless you have a self driving car you will need take your hands off the steering wheel but because of the way that vision and your muscles are represented in your sarabellum it turns out that your range of visual motion and your range of vision literally how wide a field of view you take impacts how far you can extend your limbs so a we will talk about this in a second about exactly how to do this an explore this but as you move through space as you walk forward or you walk backward r you tilt your head or you learn a skill or you just operate in the normal ways throughout your day driving biking et camera your eyes are generating spontaneous movements to offset vision visual slip in other words you do not see the world as blurry even though your moving because your eyes are entering little compensatory eye movements to offset your motion of i spin we could do this experiment there is a fun experiment we do with medical students om where you a spin them around in a chair with this eyes closed and then you stop and you have them open their eyes in their eyes are going that i i stages i do not suggest you do this experiment ah when we were kids we did a different experiment which was to take a stick and to look at the top of the stick and to spin around on the lawn looking at the top of the tick than put it down on the ground and trying jump over it you end up jumping to the side you miss the thing entirely the reason those two quote quote experiments which i hope you do not do we are for somebody else to do the reason they work is because normally your eye movements and your balance and your limb movements are coordinated but when you spin around looking up at the stick what you are doing as you are fixating your eyes on one location while you are moving and then when you stop those two mechanisms are completely on coupled and it is being at that thrown into out or space there been our space but probably something that gravity's zerogravity if you spin around in your chair with your eyes closed you are not giving the visual i put that you are spinning and then you open the eyes and then the eyes only have the the a what we call the gesticulating your eyes holding back and forth bagforth again these are not experimenting you to do cause i just told you the result however if you want to extend your range of motion you can do that by these things always look goofy but at this point ism just con used to doing these things if i one extend my range of movement for want to measure my range of of motion ism trying to if your listening what ism dong as ism stretching out my arms from a a tee far on either side and ism trying to push them as far back as i can which for me is you do not feels it is in line with my shoulders and i cannot get much further ism not really superflexible norm i particularly a inflexible at least a physically what i would then do is stop i would move my eyes to the far periphery right s ism moving maybes all the way to left while keeping my head en body stationary ism trying to look over my left shoulder as far as i can then off to the right si awkward to do this then up then down but ism mostlygana just focus on left and then right now what that is doing is its extending a signal to my sarabellum that my field of view is way over to there and way over to there member your visual attention has an aperture i can be narrow or can be broad and have talked about some the benefits of taking a broad visual aperture in order to relax the nervous system this is just moving my eyes not my head i just did for a second from side to side now i can retest and actually you get about a five to fifteen degree increase in your range of motion nim doing this for you can say well you known he gamed because he knew the the result that he was hoping for but you can try this oi and you can do this for legs too why you can do this for any limb essentially and that is it is purely clarabella and it is because the proprioceptive visual and limb movement feed back converging in their in the ways that we control our muscle spindles and the way we control the muscle fires and the tending and since toucan get bigger range of motion actually will warm up before exercise or for before skill learning by both doing movements for my body but also moving my eyes from side to side in order to generate larger range of motion if range of motion is something that ism interest d and that is a fun one that you can a play with low bit am and it is purely sarabellar some other time will get back into a sarabellar function there is all sorts of just incredible stuff that you can do a sarabellum ah i talked in an earlier episode on narrow plasticity about how you can disrupt your vestibular world in other words by getting a into modes of acceleration moving through space where you are tilted in certain ways it can open up the windows for plasticity in yet other ways am you can check that out odds one of the earlier episodes on narrow plasticity everything's time stamped but meanwhile if you on expand your range of motion before doing skill learning or afterward this is a for one it is also funny neat because a i have this kind of aversion to stretching work it never seems something i want to do and i always put it off if i start with the visual practice of expanding my field of view to off to one side or the other side or up or down then what i find as ism naturally more flexible am not naturally more flexible what is happen as eve expanding my range of motion let us talk about visualization and mental rehearsal been asked about this a lot and i think it relates back to that kind of a matrix hollywood idea that we can just be imbedded with a skill although in this case in fairness visualization involve some work and have talked about this on an earlier episode that some people find it very hard to mentally visualized things and some people find it very easy there was great work that was done in the nineteen sixties by roger shepherd at stamford and by others looking at people's ability to rotate three dimensional objects in their mind and some people really good at this and some people or less good at this and one can get better at it by repeating it but the question we are going to deal with to day is does it help does it let you learn things faster and indeed the answer appears to be yes it can however despite what you have heard it is not as good it is not a total replacement for physical performance itself gesso ben going to be really concrete about this i hear all the time that just imagining contracting a muscle can lead to the same gains as actually contracting that muscle just imagining a skill can lead to the same increases in performance as actually executing that skill and that simply not the case however it can supplement or support physical training and skill learning in ways that are quite powerful one of the more interesting studies on this was from rang ganathan at all forgive me for the pronunciation a this was a a slightly older paper two thousand for but none the less was a one that i thought had particularly impressive results and included all the appropriate controls et camera and what they did is they looked at thirty subjects they divide them into different groups a they had one group perform assenciaa finger flection as i usually the sort of the imagine if you are just listening to this the you no come here a finger movement am they also had a elbow flections us or biceps coal type movement and they either had subjects do a actual physical movement against resistance or to imagine moving a their finger or their a rest towards the shoulder meaning at the bending at the elbow a towards actual resistance ut just to make a long story short what they found was that there were increases in this finger auction strength abductions gives me strength of about thirty five per cent and the elbow flection strength by about thirteen point five per cent which are pretty impressive considering that it was just done mentally they had people imagine moving against a weight a very heavy weight or a had imagine people moving their rest towards their shoulder a against a very heavy weight but again they were not doing it they were just imagining it other experiments looked at the brain in what was happening i the brain during this time a will talk about that a moment but essential what they found we improvements in strength of anywhere from thirteen point five to thirty five per cent however the actual physical training group the groups that actually moved their rest or me their finger against an actual physical weight had improvements of about fifty three per cent this repeats over and over throughout the literature mental rehearsal can cause increases in strength it can create increases in skill acquisition and learning but they are never as great if done alone as compared to the actual physical execution of those moments are the physical movement of those weights which should not come as surprising however if we step back when we say well what is the source of this improvement you might not care what the source is cause i could tell you its one brainarea or another rainier what what difference would make but if again if you can understand mechanism a little bit you are in a position to create newer and even better protocols what mental rehearsal appears to do is engaged the activity of those upper motor her on that we talked about way back to the beginning of the episode memory of upper motor morons that control deliberate action you have got lower motor morons that actually connect to the muscles and move those muscles an you central pattern generators mental rehearsal closing one's eyes typically and thinking about a particular sequence of movement and visualizing it in one's quotinqumind mind's eye creates activation of the upper motor nor on that very similar if not the same as the actual movement and that make sense because the the upper motor irons are all about the command for movement they are not the ones that actually execute the movement of remember upper motor irons are the ones that generate the command for movement not the actual movement the ones that generate the actual movement are the lower motor neurons and the central pattern generators visualization is a powerful tool how can you use a visualization well in this study they had people perform this a five days a week a i believe that a it was fifteen yes it was fifteen minutes per day five days a week for twelve week that is a lot of mental rehearsal no it is not a ton of time each day fifteen minutes per day but sitting down closing your eyes in imagine and going through a particular skill a practice or moving a week a maybe it is a plain keys on a piano if that is a your thing or or strings on a guitar for fifteen minutes a day five days prior twelve weeks is considerable i think most people given the fact that the actual practice the physical practice is going to lead to larger improvements greater improvements then would the mental training would opt for the actual physical training but of course if you are on a plane and you do not have access to your guitar and your certainly not can be sprinting up and down the aisle or you are very serious about your craft and you on to accelerate performance of your craft or strength increases or something that sort then augmenting or adding in the visualization training very likely will compound the effects of the actual physical training there are not a lot of studies looking how visualization on top of pure physical training can increase the rats of learning and consolidation of learning et camera it is actually a hard study to do be as hard to control for because what would you do in ex place you would probably add actual physical training and then it that is always can a lead to greater effects the point is if you want to use visualization training great but forget the idea that visualization training is as good as the actual behavior you hear this all the time people say to that if you imagine an experience to your brain into your body it is exactly the same as the actual experience absolutely not this is not the way the nervous system works ism sorry i do nomen to burst anybody's bubble but a it your bubble is made of myths and the fact of the matter is that the brain when it executes movement is generating proprioceptive feed back and that appropriate sept fee back is critically involved in generating our sense of the experience and in things learning i do not say this am because i do not the idea that visualization could not work in fact visualization does work but it does not work as well it does not create the same milieu the same chemical million the same environment as actual physically engaging in the behavior the skill the resistance training et camera and i be willing to wager that the same is true for experiences of all kinds a p t s t is this incredibly unfortunate circumstance in which there is a replay often of the dramatic event that feels very real but that is not to say that the replay itself is the same as the actual event and of course posting is to be dealt with o with the utmost level of seriousness it should be treated a in fact my lab works on these sorts of things but my point about visualization and imagining something not being the same as the actual experience is grounded in this idea appropriate caption and the fact that feed back to the cerebellum the cerebellum talking otherairs of the brain are critically involved in communicating to the rest of ournervous system that not just that we believe something is happening but something is actually happening and in the case of muscle loads muscles actually b feeling tension the actual feeling of tension in the muscle the contracting of the muscle under that tension is part of the important adaptation process and a future episode will talk about hypertrophy and how that works at the level of upper modernerons lower mornerons and muscle itself but for now just know that visualization can work does not work as well as real physical training and practice but on these effects of thirty five per cent or thirteen point five per cent increases are pretty considerable there just not as great as the fifty three per cent increases that come from actual physical training for those of you that are interested in some of the skill learning that more relates to musical training but also how cadence and metronomic and tones et camera can support physical learning f your interesting that you phisionatos the there is a wonderful review also publish in the journal neuron an excellent journal by herholts and store that is h re h o l z and store z a t o r r e that a really describes in detail how musical training can impact all sorts of different things and how cadets training a whether not with tones or auditory fed back thinks that sort carries over to not just a instrumental music training but also physical skill learning of various kinds if you want to do the deep dive that would be the place are you can find in easily on line its available as a complete article free of charge et camera many of you are probably asking what can i take in order to accelerate skill learning well the conditions are going to vary but motivation is k you have to show up to the training cession motivated enough to focus your attention and to perform a lot of repetitions in the training sequence that is just a prerequisite right there is no pill that is can allow you to do fewer repetitions and extract more learning at a fewer repetitions it is actually more question of what are the conditions that you can create for yourself such that you can generate more repetitions per unit time i think that is the right way to think about it what what it are the conditions that you can create for yourself in your mind in your body that are going to allow you to focus and have talked about hocus and plasticity in motivation in previous episodes please see those episodes if you have questions about that i detail lot of tools and the underlying since for some people it might be drinking a cup or two a coffee and getting hydrated before the training session for some of you it might be avoiding coffee because it makes you to misery in your attention jumps all over the place is on a very tremendously there is no real that there is no magic pill that is going to allow you to get more out of less that is just nocking a happen it is simply not in a happen you are not going to get more learning at of fewer repetitions or less time however there are a few compounds i think worth are worth mentioning because of there ability to improve the actual physical performance the actual execution of certain types of movements and some of these have also been shown to improve connive function especially in older population i be re miss give i did not at least mention them i'monly con o mention one to day in fact the one that is particularly interesting and for which there really are a lot of data is alpha p c and ism going to attempt to a pronounce what alpha p c actually is its alpha gleicero phosphor coming right alpha p c alpha gleicerophospho coming see if i keep doing i over and over repetitions alpha gloserophospho coming ah there i made an error o k the point is that alpha p c which is at least in the united states is sold over the counter typically is taken in dosage is of about three hundred or six hundred milligrams am that is a single dose or a have been shown to do a number of things that for some of you might be beneficial am one is to enhance power output if you're engaging in something shot put throwing or resistance training or sprinting or something where you have to generate a lot of power maybe up doing rock climbing but your working on a particular aspect of your rock climbing that involves generating a lot of force a lot of power well then in theory alpha p c could be beneficial to you for the connive effects the dosages are much higher a unto twelve hundred milligrams daily divide into three doses of four hundred milligrams is what the studies that i was able to find show or used the effects on connive decline are described as notable notable meaning several studies showed a significant but modest effect on in offsetting connive decline in particular in older populations and some populations even with some a reported nor degeneration power output was notable how notable what is that mean notable am a study noted a fourteen per cent increase in power output am that is pretty substantial in a fourteen per can it if you think about it but it was not a doubling or something of that sort believe it are not the symptoms of alshimers have been shown at least among the neutrosuticles of which alpha p c is to significantly improve cognition and people dulcimers now this episode is not about connive decline and longevity we will talk about that but this is a so called another effect of alpha p c fadoxidation is increased by alpha p c growthhormon release is promoted by alpha p c although to a small degree as you can see things alpha p c in particular when they are combined with low levels of affine can have these effects of improving power output can improve growthhormon release can improve autoxidation all these things in theory can support skill learning but what there really doing is there adjusting the foundation upon which you are going to execute these many many repetitions ski the something would be said for fine itself if that something that motivates you and gets you out of a chair to actually do the physical training then that something that can perhaps improve or enhance the rate of skill learning and how well you retain those skills now on a previous episode i talked about and this was the episode on apinefron on a adrenalin i talked about how for mental for cognitive learning it make sense to spike epineferon to bump eferaneferent levels up a arena levels up after count of learning for physical learning it appears to be the opposite that if you are if affine is in your practice or if you decide to try alpha p c that you would want to do that before the training take it before the training use it its effect should extend into the training presently throughout and then afterward if your thinking about fallowing some f the protocols o we discuss to day that you would use some sort of idle time where the brain can replay these motor sequences in reverse and then of course you want to do things tho optimize your sleep a lot o the questions i get are about how different protocols and things that i describe start to collide with one another lets say for instance you go to bed at ten thirty and you are going to do your a skill training at nine thirty well taking lot of affine then is not in to be good idea cause it is going to compromise your sleep ism not om here to design the perfect scettual for you because everyone situations ovary the things to optimize are repetitions failures more repetitions more failures at the offset of training having some idle time that can be straight into sleep or it could be simply letting the brain just go idle for five to ten men me not focussing on anything not scrolling social media not emailing not ideally not even talking o somebody just lying down or sitting quietly with your eyes close letting those motor sequences replay then we talked about how one can come back for additional training sessions use things metronomic were your cuing your attention to some external cue some stimulus in this case in auditory stimulus most lucky an trying to generate more repetitions for unitive again its repetitions in errors that is key and then we also talked about somethings that you can do involving cerebellar neurophysiology to extend range of motion if that is what is limiting for you or to use visualization to augment the practice or let say a your particular skill involves nice weather and it is raining are snowing outside and you cannot get outside an thunderstorm then that is where visualization training might be a good replacement under those conditions or in most cases going to be the kind of thing that you are going to won to do addition to the actual physical skill or strength training session done at least in the study that we describe for fifteen minutes a day five days a week over a period of ten to twelve weeks or wholly that makes it clear today we have covered a lot of mechanism we talk much about the different motor pathways central pattern generators you now are armed with a lot of information about how you generate movement and i to think that you are also armed with a lot of information about how to design protocols that are optimize for you or if you are coach for your a for your trainees in order to optimize their learning of skills of various kinds to day we focus almost entirely on motor skills things musical skills a physical skills these have some overlap there partially overlapping with neural plasticity for learning things languages or math or engineering or neural science for that matter before we depart i just want to make sure that i return to a concept which is the up trade in cycle all train in cycles of these ninety minute cycles that we go through throughout sleep in wakefulness that are optimal for learning and attention in the waking state there they are the stages of a in which of sleep in which we have either predominantly slowly deeper remsleep some of you who have been following this podcast for while might be asking well should a physical practice be ninety minutes that is going to depend because with physical practices offer times for instance with strength training that might be too long you are not can be able to generate enough force output for it to be worth while for golfing i do not know of nerve playoff though my friends that playoff they disappear under the golf course for many hours i norther's lot a walking and and driving and other stuff even here that somebody carries your stuff around for you om some times not always but you note it is going to differ an a four hour golf game you are probably not swinging the golf club for four hours it is going to depend i would say that the altradian cycle is not necessarily a good constraint for skill learning in most cases and i should say that for those of you that are short on time or have limited amounts of time ten minutes of maximum repetitions maximum focus skill learning work is go in to be very beneficial whereas too hours of kind of haphazard not really focus to work ism or where you are not entering very many repetitions was you doing a for few repetitions than your testing on your phone or pay intentions something else that is not going to be beneficial it is really about the density of training inside of a sections i think you should let the outwork toward maximum or near maximal density of repetitions and failures provided their failures you can perform safely in order to accelerate skill learning and do not let sum arbitrary or in this case the all trade and constraint a prevent you from engaging in that practice in other words get the work and get as much work done as you can per unit time and based on the scents based somethings that have seen based nothings that ism now involved in with various communities you will see the skill improve vastly at various stages sometimes it is elicit stutter start it is not always a linger a improvement but you will see incredible improvement and skill if you are enjoin this podcast and your finding the

stagnating in the poles jobidon turns to the race card to try to get out his political fun the left con sides another round of covered craziness and deal trumps canary six trial date is set for the day before super tuesday ism been spare of the sis ventupuro so tachosponserbackspesspe plan thousands o my liters have already secured the netrickday to join them express giant calm sleshmon people really really really are not interested in a job in donate trump match up for twenty twenty four by every available pule and yet that is likely beyond likely at this not to be the actual matchup going into the twenty twenty four election and by the polling at u people really do not either one of these candidates according to the associate press president jobidon is old and confused form president dona trump is corrupt and dishonest those are among the top turns america use when they asked to describe the democrat in the wite house and are publicans best position to face him in next year's election the zenuwpooll pole from the associate press and arced center for public affairs research for bison of larges share of uusidells mentioned his age at eighty bison just three years older than trumpet also looks hes half dead trump meanwhile has been eliciting words at corrupt and crooked fifteen bike fifteen per cent bad another negative comments about eleven per cents lie an dishonest eight per cent bout eight per cent offered generally positive comments good the general break down here is that when it comes to jobidon twenty six per cent a respondence use words old or outdated to described bison another fifteen per cent mention things slow or confused another ten per cents gave generally negative comments about the president six per cent used words corrupt and crooked only six per cent offered words president and leader and five per cent strong and capable even among democrats twenty eight per cent mentioned his age significantly hire than leadership or strength and capability trumps negative comments according to the any sent are not on eye ut on his moral standing and conduct along with things loud mouth which was six per cent and angry crazy and dangerous six per cent narcissist six per cent five per cent used words strong and capable sixty two per cent of america say they've an unfavorable opinion of trump which is not a good recipe flinningan election fifty two per cent say the same thing about jobidon also not in a making stop for wining an election once again we are going to run a couple of very very unpopular people against one another in the odd belief by both sides that the other guy is anymore unpopular than their own guy and therefore your own guy really don't matter and you cannot lose but here is the problem for jobidon hoiden candlers if jobidon were somehow to lose to donate trump it would be the single worst defeat for democrats of my life tin and worse than twenty sixteen when grumpy tiller canton because nobody artily thought tramples gan a win that one but now every understands the trump can win that one bison somehow loses to donate trump post canary six post is twenty twenty feet post all the rest of the stuff there be the single most humiliating defeat for democrats in my life time and probably ever which means that jobidons in a little bit of trouble caveman if you look at the real clear politics pulling average in the trump verses bison race and again it is very early sot's not as though it is definitely can be true for bison but you have to look it the fruit runners for not parties right now right now jobidon in the real cobaltic polling averages of just one per centare point just one according to emersion trump is actually up two points forty six to forty four now do i believe that it is actually quite that close i do not the reason being when you look under the top line of these staffs very often what your seeing for examples stay yesterday came out that show joining tor sixty one per cent my north support that is not going to be the actual number when the election comes round no democrat has won less than seventy per cent of minority support for probably four decades but with that sat is a selection too close for comfort for jobidon doubt green john per was asked about this going that i showing that even democrats to think that jobidon is old slow and not with it here is her answer er we you ja will i predate the question i get i get it often as and toe what i would saying i send to many times an many of my colleges a sent this the president says this if you watch him if you seen when he is down e last two years this is the president has had a historic administration in just two years if she look cant the thirteen poi thirteen point time when the thirteen point cimomilion jobs that he is been able to create if you look at how he is been able to turn the economy around at it works for middle class america yet avoid the question avoid the questioncause she cannot say he is obviously vigorous s that is obviously untrue but she is pointing to quod quote the accomplishments well the truth is that that skin the matter as much for jobidon as donate trump's accomplishments mattered for him in twenty twenty donate trump could have pointed to all the amazing things did over the course of the first three years of his administration before twenty twenty and he did some of that but in the end people youbasically voted in a rough random ondonald trump as a human and the same thing is going to happen to jobidon and while she is out there saying that jobidonis with it everything is fine job is coughing into his hands and shaking hands with people and getting weirdly close with teen avers in being general lies elderly weirdo cooking in his hands s caukinoer anger never i manage s keeps si shaking hands with the folks erase must be very word about covet by the way that is that is something elegit will get into in just one second meanwhile the hundred questions are not going away the while houseman continued to i more them green john pierce she am she was asked about hunter widen again because remember the pleadyold broke down which means that now presumably there should be an investigation into were hunter bison got all of his foreign money and whether he violated the foreign agent's registration at if there is anybody work their fault in this prosecutor's office which we will see i have doubts then they have to ask the pretty obvious question which is he was selling access to job what kind of access was that it'll green john praising an answer that question meters an fifteen dow now mut mow to spewing you hunter widen in to span initiates enter bis for refold a to per t t gown b nor o o get is bar m in r wen or hunter b represented no real r or g jobmbittis treeing er her fry none i an n r hunter banjos no it inn it is a question for job suggest con continue not answer questions about job e being tools for the job and to capitol bad at it the woman answering questions about the fact that hunter bigness pretty obviously money wandering in it is prettywhen you are selling paintings for five hundred thousand dollars apiece and the people buy those paintings are magically getting appointments to daddy's administration that is a little weird is it not a little but we but you not answer any questions about that and is can get worse for jobidon before it gets better cave my earthy apparently is no launch in impeachment inquiry in september according to brightbart my earthy as initiated strategies to opening sweeping in preachment inquiry intone to uncover the depth of his involvement in his family for in dealings going multiple republican sources they told saran tic earthy previously demanded the biding come clean about is involvement the current has continued stone long lie about is family's business over sixteen times going o the house overset committee none of this is going away and by the way september is next month we are in the middle of it right now ore about to hits in just a few days all of this none of this is very good for jobidon and he is pulling out some old stand by strategically speaking we get to that momentarily first you have probably the had a hard go of it if you bit spall business owner since movement it is been pretty rough m between the federal

a gat when cursed by an unpopular candidate democrats go back to the well and in that play book over the past several years they have had two big played play number one all of our opponents our races they are now attempting to use this playbook with regard to this terrific shooting in jacksonvill where a a person was on a seventy to hour mental hold a couple of years ago ivy somebody with with some prate significant emotional problems and also happen to be a neonatal i put a bunch of suastacas on his gun and then went to a dollar general and shot three black people horrifying story rondasantis showed up in town in order to pay tribute to those people and pledge to help out the local community and all of the rest and the democrats an immediate immediately sponson to get another story of evil republican white races says he is people rondo mantis who cause some nut job to pull the trigon black people steeve peoples who is the chief political reporter for the a who she should be fired for the sweet honestly legs if they have any level objectivity whatsoever he should be fired for the sweet quote rondossanti scolded when the en doubly p issued a travel advisory the spring winning black people to use extreme care of traveling to florid just three months later to mantis leading his state through the aftromathfracis attack the left three african america dead black leaders in flora and a cross the nation say their outrage by his actions and medic ahead of the shooting my story with tendon farrington o get this absurd coverage that is absurd coverage because rondo mantis and his schoolyard said that they were put together in educational curriculum free of critical race theory which is not in fact history it is a bunch of anti america propaganda and because they did that apparently there is a neonate who shot three black people in the state of florid and rondissantis responsible for that according to stove peoples and the associated press which is an insane take but at all it is also the take that democrats are going s are using here is the endoblast p jacksonville president i say a drumlin saying that do the whites precisian flora is palpable that is way you see trump flags any state america that voted for trump apparently is a a hell hole for black people jacks most pacifically is a breeding grounds of neonosias that they have been tracking that an seeing the i mean what can you tell me and tell us about the climate there in jacsonvill ism with his harpoons i thin a on on an an just power going have the good god on an o an n at tin that a when do you think routes is this o we see a veter fin wet we the trunk fin a ha them way or o street a the if we know from that then fit ta o its hatred an o we do not going you the doing the got away get ism that is am that is amazing if you see a trump flag anybody who voted for trump who has supported trump is obviously tracks a the how chobidin is going to run whether against to mantis or whether it is gain trump the the rip is always and forever going to be that if you are not in line with jobidons political priorities with political primer is e left then you must be in favor of black people getting shot charlemane the god who's a some sort of podcast do matronly know so particularly living s the breakfast club is that is that chairman anyway i he also is is doing this routine suggesting that rondosantis fuel the anti blackness out have ane evidence of this of course not they do not need evidence the just been the accusation i you no wo terms antianything b your on t thinttha try fun o lot of anti black an food oyer ye deserve the look this me he deserves a lot of that smoke has onto mantis thous responsible for all the give a question when ut rat blow to black people get shot every week an in chico who is fueling that use fueling that do we talk about that now we shouldn't we poison talk about any of that because some black people getting shot is useful for the media narrative and some black people getting shot is not useful for the media narratives wo only cover the shootings that are useful far manufactured a media narrative where by the way we are a right side of this men it again name me the main street politician anywhere in america who is in favor of black people random my getting shot on on the basis of race it is totalling in san accusation but again it please back in to how biting hopes to win in outsize share of my north voters particularly black voterswillget into that momentarily first my very crave to nice barbecue meal with the family is the barbecue all the time a head on out there in the evenings fire it up there is nothing worsethan yo start to fire up that barbecue and your propantank is empty it is sucks there is wore cinch comes in

you must live within a inch service great o redeemed is it cinch dot come slash offer for s details o ka again this allative in to jobidons reelactaffer yesterday he a spent an awful lot of time sounding off about white supremely is the greatest a threat to the america home land which i got a tell you white to premise is tremendously evil i know becks i receive an enormous number of detracts from people ore white to premises because ism an orthodox we and the fat has literally arrested people where white to promises for threatening my family also the notion that the greatest terrorist threat to america is isolated white to premises is is lunacy interns what the federal government can lick what exactly is the federal government also supposed to do about that presumably the all tied into a broader at a a genditem for for biding as will see in moment you es get by the way he was also i jabbering about do his history with civil rights which is a little et more checker than he likes to make it out to be i but ti here he was jabbering nonsensically by hi got strong torment to not for the civil rights act which his weird since he was twenty one when civil rights act asked and stromthorman i believe delivered the longest filibuster to date against the civil rights it at the time with strange strange story here from in addled old man i count things a change ti was a won lira a to strong cermboden tear e story tax e cry de i cot wo may be er got caress or a never die it just die an aery's talking tout but all this is tied into the broader biding a agenda of equity an everything her is top bin invited stove benjamin yesterday his senior omicron director of the office of publican semen talking the equity is the sense of everything by demonstration does when they say equity what they really mean is rather preferences the administration has day on since he present on sin his verses tekeborder on making orangy don poison on equity in this administration it is som at that that is part of the broader a ended him now the real answer to what happened in jacks will actually comes courtesy of a democratic odjactionvill cot councilwoman namedjocoby pitman we talked about her yesterday she is the person who got up when dis hands has got good for visiting jacksonville and she listen bullets don't have parties on them absolutecorrect here she was yesterday saying ti basis was not invited but there is no reason for him to be booed the governor was getting heckled and you stood up to essentially quiet those people down yet councilwoman there critics who say that florist's governor has not acted policies that created an environment that aloud this kind of attack to take place whether on guns or on race what is your response to those critics first of all let me make myself clear i had no idea that the governor was coming and i just want ism to make myself clear i wanted the patience to come down because i want it come to sit down and i want it it to be the that that was for the residence and the community that had come together for unity that is what that of that was about not e governor get what she is right about that and his hance knew that too i mean that would be the proper response to a rather shooting where everybody of any sort of good will is on the same side men again ism who is arguing in favor of the shooter in this particular situation answers nobody but the media have to manufacture some sort of narrative for hoiden to run on and that the narrative of the day is going to be republicans our races you knew it was going in the resurrection meanwhile democrats a actually going to try to run on covet again this is starting a new which is amazing covet is such a devastating disease that derives ever election cycle it is pretty incredible yesterday coreenschom pier she pointed out that we have rising cove numbers by the way those rising cove numbers are not resulting in mascot across the nation those rising cove numbers are largely resulting people getting colds here she was suggesting people continue to be vaccinated with their ninety seventh buyer shot we are going to encourage america to getter updated come nineteen eaten in edition at to their annual hotshot at more agnates ainwortan when america to gan and an are insinuation for people over sixty under n speeded something that were going to continutcerycleryto america across across the country yet really this is what we are doing this for gin again the ans are apparently is yes according to we was news as doctors worn covet is on the rise some northern californium hospitals are bringing back in old covenineteen requirement mask mandates the cure spent is being blamed on summer travel with more people staying indoors to avoid theboral heat nowadays very few people where mas but now apparently their bunch of health facilities that are going to put the masks back in place in californium have seen some universities across the country already establishing mask mandates for peoples return to school all this is crazy meanwhile then your times is suggesting that in order for schools to reopen pesto in stall some sort of clean

because we have seen a blatant and bad faith rewriting of history on this issue from a lot of people who should know beta and i thing this to day for you are about to watch is one of the most important deep dives have ever don on the show because the myth about children and bovid the kits outbreak harmed by it the school closures were a massive and avoidable mistake that they cols learning loss and mental healissues tosmyth and they allmyth dangerous myths have endured for on become son grain evasive that then want just something for you is believe ism foreman if you want that home of sadly come to accept many of these myths as true it is a myth guise everything about the learning loss nodmyth were mentlhile promise of kits were staying how nodmyth ay all all that is a myth according to mat e fossa get ready for it the as covet of ties going into the winter you gin a watch some democrats come out again for this sort of thing which s the healtthing to run on on a run basely twenty twenty back the a run on loved knockdowns and there gin run on race good luck to them on that that does not seem a winning strategy to me a meanwhile on the other side of the isle the democrats in the judiciary are doing an amazing job of setting up the calender in favor of donate trump apparently the trial in the canary sixth indigent in washington d c is slated to start on march forth that is one day before super tuesday i that is weird it is superweird trumps allies lambasted the timing of the trial which you just district judge tonic cut can announced after recreating both an expected time line from special council blacksmith and quest from trumps less to delay the trial until twenty twenty six o you sendergty vast up tit is strain up election inter ferine as your starting the trial the day before thebiggest primary day it is called super tuesday for reason it is thebiggest day of the primaries that when you start the trial trump said that he is going to try to appeal on the basis of this it is not clear if he is going to show up to court the truth is that this is probing n ta boost trump because if the dynamic to the race far our reflection what is can happen in the future every time trump is targeted in court it seems to boost him elect today but if you look at how this calender is setting upright now it is pretty wild gan right now you have march forth the day before super tuesday for the for the trump canary six trial and then you have the fraud suit brought by near a turn general it is shames thetsconglor trial this october second then you've the defamation lesson that is going to go to trial on canary fifteenth twenty twenty four that is the dates of the sorer publican presidential laughs you got the hush money criminal case front by mankind d plan brag that is the garbage case in manhattan about stormy angels an such that is going to go to trial march twenty fifth that is the middle of the primaries and then you have the document's case against trump in to of date and to of his aids that is a is sat to begin mad twentieth in flora there is bunch of primaries right around that one and we do not know when the georgia case is going to come to trial either ye i mean is just going to be trials from here on in it is can be trials from for for the rest of the election cycle president trump has responded howdyouhave an incitement that is based almost entirely on the findings to the canary sixth select committee on marks us famous in political had when he same motives who have been caught lying for years about russia russia russet you than can yo crane fast and he fhigtosia an for purposefully and i legally destroy hand's leaded all the evidently findings in proof of the manual six committee when we will to ran blacksmith criminally charge the committee we ye gain that is not going to happened but he is not wrong to complain about the dates is any of that going to help trumpietan general election i keep asking this question because this is the question for publican primary voters not are you more warmed to him now that he is being on fairly target by lawn foremen ism more warm to hm if he is being on fairly targeted by lawn foremen but that is really not question the question is whether this going to help trump it an't general lection trump meanwhile is focus lever lake on a rumor about onto mantis by rumor we mean r o of m e r i i do not in the now its happening right ow rumor a strong in political circles that run to tanto manas this president yo ran is i shampoo is palling numbers absurd crash pitting him third five intend states wiki draping out of the preset enturdays in artederan an frae gain's it is got for sedan now that is an interesting can is not it he put that out on truth social yesterday i had not heard that rumor r o o m r had not in fact toad that rumor because it is not true but if this is where republicans closed ton to this is where he want your focus all right yet him scout who i think his going o be out the race fairly soon because it does not have an electricity he does not have any base support is nimby momentum but e said something true yesterday he said listen tough and loud is not going tore enough to win a general election that is true i i think sometimes people mistake decent see and kindness for a lack of resolve sometimes people can huge fighting would be cruel is there a place for a happy warrior warrior in modern a politics can you be a rule floor a be fairing your commit o still be successful a politics the absolute you cancel as you know at i group it some red tough neighborhoods you have got to be tough to get out the neighbors that we up and the rustic up asking myself the tough enough and for the republican part of the and is really clear we have lost seven o the the last at n taste elections and went then to was a disaster if tough and loud was enough we would be winning election after election after election but i results have unfortunately been exactly the opposite he is right about that which is why i think actually again the lid people who rote off governor to mantis for dad in this national race i do not see the evidence that he is tad quit yet the late pulling shows nomad trump in the republican nomnadingways dropping now below fifty per cent in some of the numbers a latest insider advanageple for example has trumpet forty five and to want tat eighteen and nobody else would an even remote spitting distance tiresome other pulls that have trump up near sixty messenger a herisacks which has been o pull its very very warm tor trump colonelcy has trumpet fifty nine and to mantis at fourteen overall trump its ahead of the field by forty points at else happens to be a very fragmented field but with that is that to cantus if what you think is the tough and loud is not enough but you you junkie tough right and you junkie to be able to kick back but you'll isn't he would be able to govern the sans is going tout an opportunity to show that off this weekend it is a terrible opportunity obviously there is his hurricane that is about to hit the panhandle of flora according to latest reports that hurricane could come in at possibly a a cat three it did maybe even even maybe maybe even a cat for a my wether medeoralgust are reading a all ye as he three on the real impact skills for hurricanes right now and tod officials have issued mandatory evacuation orders for parts of panels and hillsborough county in flora because the life threading conditions anticipate you anas hippie storm serge and all the rest well this is one aria were to santisactury thrives is in handling crimes in his home state we seen it before here was governor to cantus doing his job yesterday talking bout the approaching storm tropical storm i day continues to gather strength it will become a hurricane to day and it is forecast to reach landfall as a major hurricane a cat ivory three i they get's important o point out if we were sitting here three days ago a lot of people thought it would end to being a tropical storm then they said one may be a category one than yesterday was may be it a hit too and now there really does not seem anything to prevent it from continuing to strength and and we have seen this before with something hurricane michael that continued to gather strength this is going to be a major impact and flurrying should expect that that this this storm we'll be a major cat three plus hurricane ye the truth is there was de basis crisis leadershipturn bovid that was really really excellent he seven even example of how to do that i was some this week and this week and yesterday is also perfect example of what the basis does really really well at o de cantus was asked by reporter about climate change which is always the go to for idiot reporters who do not know about hurricanes and and how hurricane targets have now changed case the lot more people living the path of hurricanes and all the rest of it and and they keep suggesting hurricanes to more common because of i again not a lot of evidence to suggest that there is some evidence o suggested the hurricanes may be more powerful now because of the warmer water that they're using to turn essential but curious to cantus being asked about climate change on the hurricanes and he knows what he is talking about this is what this is where de cantus as y unique character and very fluid he was truewith bovid i remember the first time i talked with governor to cantus id talked them the his congress personal news governor was in tune of twenty twenty and he called because he want to lay out his bovid strategy and it is fluency with the numbers was obvious he would actually pent a lot of time with the data here is a perfect example of him knowing things for tat i a ana i i i eight en you o unfortunately i may i see a lot of parallels with hurricane michael hurricane michael if you remember for few days before we knew there would be a storm nobody was saying that twas going to be a category five stor i man that just was not what people were saying and that an intensified and that it delivered a major major impact to to north west florid at that were still recovering from a gan he he then went into a longer speech going through it the history of hurricanes this the thing the de mantis good at his the actual governing we that can make a difference in the re publican primaries unclear whether it should absolutely he is the not win over democrats in in dependence it turns out being goody or job

what what come on ammine em he is ridiculous ridiculous graphic he speaking of other ridiculous crap o pope francs a terrible pope justcon put that out there he is really bad the hoping now soft have any stake obviously in mum in the catholic doctrine of of pope francs as big fan of benedict i thought bend was an excellent pope because i do have a stake as a citizen of the western world in the catholic church actually standing true to its historic religious principles when it comes to morality and ethics because the have shaped billions of people over the course of history pope francs is a liberation theologists pretty obviously he he is a he is a person with a marks is orientation toward economics and a real a real disdain for serve traditional catholicity intros the social areas i mean i cannot tell yo hammy times at this point pope francs has said something that is invitation of church doctrine historically with regard to say divorce or gay marriage or any of that sort of stuff and then his team comes o allhusmis interpreted just do not speak italic well well at a certain point you got to a mansion that maybe he is just the guy we all kinthink he is which is lithe left is very warm toward pope france to made a couple of big booboos over the last forty eight hours first he a was speaking by video to a gathering of roman catholic use in saint petersburg and he urge them to follow in the catch of peter f the great and gathering the great whom he called rulers of a great en lightened empire of great culture and great humanity which is a weird take since both peter and gathering were w told territorial expansionists it is what they are known for and they are also the two figures that gladder putting most sights as sort of historical inspirations for his territorial aggressions this of course has ticked off pretty much everybody in u grain leg nicolenke is spokesmen for the cranial for ministry call the popeswords imperialist propaganda of the kind the kremlin uses to justifights invasion of u crancrope it is a shame that russia great cower ideas which are actually the cause of cassia's chronic aggressiveness are voice knowing they are not by the pope the leader of the crane's green catholic church major arc bishop is the talon she chuck sending a statement the popesworse had caused great pain in the church hierarchy and great disappointment in you cranial civil society the pope's remarks drew angry reactions on social media from a wide variety of sources and then the and then of course the had can tried to walk it back as they have had to do with with pope francs multipletimes the rejected suggestions the pope francs mighthave encouraged young russia catholic to draw inspiration from historical russia figures known for imperialistic and expansionist ideas and actions the negatively impact ted neighboring populations including e cranial people francs has had to criducrann suffering put he is not condemn moscowth for the war of been very careful not to condemn mascot for the war and by the way it is it is worth while noting that his relationship withe catholic church was pretty fraud peter the great his relationship i the catholic church was actually fairly fraught it was not the easiest relationship that is boubonumber one for the pope who were number too is that apparently the pope has now blasted the quote backwardness of some conservatives in the us catholic church saying they have replaced faith with ideology he is want to talk meanseriously onestogod you talk about a pope who has replaced faith with ideology he hives writing in cyclicals about how we have to stop hurting mother earth while the same time proclaiming the doctrine of social liberalism in very soft form francs commons were an acknowledgment of the divisions in the us catholic church which has been slip between progresses in con sedatives who long found support in the doctrine are papers papacies of saint john pal the second and benedicts the sixteen particular vanish is abortion an san expertly even the agents ya conservatives to pal john fault and benedict sixteen the are those guise because they actually hewed to historic catholic doctor on morality this guy he is creative when your barakabama's favorite pope theirs something wrong many conservatives of blasted francs emphasis on social justice issues such as the environment in the poor while branding heretical his opening to letting it divorce an civilly remarried catholic receive the sacraments which am that used to be called just the doctrine during a meeting a portuguese suit told francs he had suffered during a recent spatial year in the united states because he came a cross many catholic including some just bishops who criticized franc's tenor papacy as to day as well as it is results the eighty sixtrald archentene acknowledges pointing there is a very strong organized reactionary attitude in the just church which he called backward he said doing this you lose the true tradition you turn to ideologies to have support in other words ideologies replace faith the vision of the doctrine of the church as amoralist is wrong when you go backward you make something closed off this connected from the roots of the church wait hold on when you go backwards you are disconnecting from the lots of the church i noise that when you are reflecting the political priorities of far left figures in satin america as well as the united states you might be moving away from the roots of the church he says i once remind these people backwardness is useless i got at tell you for the pope to say when s his backwardness i some what he means is the history of his church which his supposed to be the rock of faith correct again not a catholic but pretty sure that is what it is they must understand there is a correct evolution in the understanding of questions and faith and morals oh interesting there is a correct evolution in faith and morals which is ism which is that else did was an honor to be attacked by america at some point yah ism you by by the way worth noting the only segments of cathalisism on planed earth that are growing right now ire not left leaning catholic churches they are all right leaning catholic churches they are people are traditionalist it is the satin mass catholic churches they are still full

he is saying stuff that is perfectly obvious to anyone with the functional brain that it is beyond dispute the fact that it even remote the controversial intodasdan age is absurd o say other things that i hate i joke tapper did new or youth christy crispy the other day and christy has been ripping on other republicans for saying that nay binary election between bison and trump they would vote for trump and tapper then asked him a question that s i a lot of people in the left leaning media are constantly asking which is two re publicans have an authoritarian probnow let me first explain authoritarianism is not with what people left me to think it is they think authoritarianism is dona from tweeting things or dona true making efforts that are then stepped to change the results of an election they are many forms of authoritarianism in fact fascism is an element of both left and right it is not merely a right winged thing authoritarianism can just as he easily be done by series of executive orders that go outside the constitution radically redshift the balance between people and their government jobinon does that with alacrity here is joke tapper's answer that ja tapperasking the question and a christy christy you actually kind of gave not a horrible answer actually here you do describe the conduct have dona from trying to overturn the election as i as as reprehensible you u do condone the ut many people in your party and ism not just talking about people running for present or on capital hill but i mean voters republican voters do not seem to have a problem with it an ism wondering do you think that your party has an authoritarian problem that they really honestly do not have a problem with violently trying to stop i free in fair election from going going forward your cake absolutely don't i that we have that problem either got we have is a thought of group problem ad that right now what is gone on is that people of you those true synonymously with the republican party and that if you oppose trump that is somehow favoring bison and many republican's tot wanted through that for very obvious reasons gat when y that last part dresser's garbed but that last pare what he says which is dona trump is seen a synonymous with the republican party and if you tell people is eitherebidon or the republican party of course a lot people can vote republican that part is true but what is insulting to the intelligence is this generalized narrative the themedeor constantly drawing in which they suggest that fascism or authoritarianism or tyranny is an element of the right and the the left is completely free that his hands are completely clean and obviously not in fact we have a you tuvidio a latest episode in our facts series talking about whether fascism is right saying one of the roots of fascism the truth is that fascism as an ideology is closer to the america left than it is to the america right fascism is an ideology was generalized i response to communism but it drew from maxim intrude from hegellian politics it drew from progressive era ideas which is why many of the early supporters of muslin were members of the left including people who had worked in would to willow administration who'd go on to work in the it yard ministration an gait this ortomedia lie which is that the right is universally authoritarian an the left is for freedom

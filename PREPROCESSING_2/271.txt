do not open the cupboards n the nil usually get t a bad rap pimentalizing your feelings keeping it all inside e any things never happened these are not signs of psychological health there sides of is ta out hat if you do this things spasicly you are in a doubt is being in a doubt means seeing tot getting not with it going to work even if you have a cold began you are in a doubt you do jab an e landing in fact it ais entire show was a defense not thinking about it the not now the fence and short i ignorance i three very different stories you can decide how convincing they are stay with us at on but you don't nous lulu was has this case study of people not admitting the truth when my grandmother was diagnosed with stage four long cancer she was given three months to live she was eighty years old and my family for reasons it'll get into in a minute decided not to tell her i was boldly against this when i heard the news i wanted to talk with my grandmother comfort her i wanted to grieve with her in the way that seems natural when some one you love is dying but my mam she is the one who called me to give me the bad news quickly inform me that what i wanted that what i thought was the right thing to do would not be permitted and that i would have no say in the matter i was stunned my grandmother or my i as i call her lives in china a long with a lot of my other relatives my parents and i live here in the united states i really close to mining at two years old i lives with her and my grandfather for a year my mam could work my nah is five football with a full head of primed white hair she is small but when my in i walks into a room every one lis i was not the only one who felt weird keeping this a secret my at thought about going to his mam and telling her she was dying but douwhat i could not take care er because i my won family bayou li sac i i mas yo her i then i will yet would to take there is thoussfully he fearlessly my mom it is true my dad was not the one on the ground looking after nine he let china when he was just a tea nature his older brother has lived in japan for twenty four years the person who was on the ground was not as younger sister you not a tat how did it bean i a a you do not you hanging i ow her tanner now this is her my nine sister my great ant she look almost identical to nine in chines i call her sale i which translates to little aunt grandma but it'll just call her little nine for this story little in i lives in the apartment ride upstairs from in and their very close she was the one who picked up the results of annas physical it is customary an china for doctors to give bad news to family members rather than giving it directly to the patient especially if the patient is older in as doctor recommended that nine be immediately hospitalize for treatment wat e an e o at marry de wonder up wit a she saying the doctor told her the cancer was very advanced do not hospitalize her would be irresponsible of course in order to hospitalize nine it means they would actually have to tell her she is sick what o e ala we a ne e day a a you pul ye deli a a e a can ado damn ani you donor little in i told the doctor that non is too old that she could not handle of blow life this it is not just that little in i did not want to upset her sister with a news of her death she actually believe that not telling her was a way to prolong her life knowing in as personality little in i worry that her sister would get overwhelmed with fear and depression she would stopped eating she would stopped sleeping she would lose interest in life the chines believe that mental an emotional health are completely linked to physical health a what are your you your yo o mi damn she tells me there is a chines joke she people go get a physical one of them is healthy and one of them has a terminal illness the hospital gets the results mixed up the healthy person gets the terminal prognosis and vice verse then the healthy person and of dying while the sick person and up living we she a see wash men the say to day i ma to scuta that is me asking little nine is that really a joke it is not very funny ye a or a day a she assured me that it was my family got a second opinion and then a third same prognosis three months may be less little in i knew she needed a vague medical report to show nine she went to a print shop they told her we cannot create a false medical record if you one a make something up we could photocopy it for you little in i whited out the real diagnosis and wrote down words that sounded vaguely medical but on alarming something about the in shadows my family built on that lie with and even more elaborate one we realize we had a problem how wire we all going to manage to see nine before she die family from three countries needed to say good bye without laynnii know we were actually saying good bye this would require more than white out my dad had an idea si si a i a w your uncle may be we can just yo stage your sis a er won ye r are you proud that you came up with this idea o you am to am y everybody can teetered me is to you the lats e your refer a ma tears wee this was our plan a giant good by party disguised as a giant wedding banquet this is a why that everybody agree to we and she's how it was can go down my uncle hymen's son daily had recently married a japan's woman they plans to celebrate in china the next year that now it would be in two weeks and it would bring together family members who had not all been in the same place for twenty five years my at told nip that the wedding banquet had to happen immediately because that was when the groom gallant could get the time off work how did you feel that lying always try her cat this is a lines the us ye ere her lies that i you don wat be is si go sits you gat gegeyou yo wager that lie you gey li o big ye get us the way gator every you do not what an that the way a i suppose but that was not the way i wanted it or thought it was supposed to be and i still was not convinced it would be what ani wanted i was emotional that my mama said maybe i should not go that i might cry and blow the cover i was afraid she might be right but if i wanted to see in before she died i had to go and i had to be part of the lie saw this is from a bite i took i sort of filming as soon as i land i brought the camp quarter with me to hide behind hoping it would help me to see it together it the arrivals say i heard i i shouting my name through the crowd she wasn't difficulty spot a squat figure waving a can hanker si from the front of the crowd she was at least a foot shorter than every one else and her white hair stood oud oh my granddaughter she cried she looked me up and down you are not very skinny she observed your mama says you would been very busy with work i thought you would be skinny but you are not that skinny in i did not look or a some one who was sick at all i asked her how she was feeling and she said she was doing well she had some kneepan from the years she marched across the country with the people's liberation army when she was fourteen if it were not for my bad need she said it'd be perfect my parents were delayed an banging that night but the rest of the family gathered around nine's dinner table little nine held her little white dog on her lap a dog they call even they named even after an america exchange student who had stayed with them e one trick that she can normally do on command everyone here is yelling seeing fallen saying sing and then finally after dinner uncle ha being walk me to the near by hotel where i was stand uni is in one of the older neighborhoods in the area there are still unpaved paths and small food stands but her street is being slowly engulfed by shopping malls and high rises nine is very sick uncle said as we walked she took care of you when you were little she loves you much he kept saying things i ready knew things that felt he was trying to provoke and emotion out of me you have to be very careful not to tell her he said you'll feel very sad but you cannot cry looking back i wonder if he was really just trying to coach himself you have to be happy he insisted i know i said as i stared straight ahead at the brightly let billboards across the street i most events the emotional protocol is clear you smile at went ans you cry at funerals the confusing thing here was that this was one situation masquerading as another in china you are actually expected to cry at a funeral a lot as a sign of respect people judge you on how well you cry and how much you cry my uncle understood this protocol and my grandfather year his funeral in nineteen ninety four uncle bean was tasked with the duty of performing a cathartic chines ritual to demonstrate his great grieving as the eldest son this was his designated roll he stood in the aisle in front of the coffin and raise the clay boll over his head while crying loudly he smashed the bowls of the ground shattering it into countless starts my mother hates these kinds of huge emotional displays by the way at her father's funeral years ago her family criticized her for not crying enough the people over there they the expect you just fan the for and the the greasy people and the shout he and cry this is china part of you little her tradition the people thy they hire the people an ye you will have money you'll hire a hundred people come here was cries the en to see cry and the wen of see tat i hate that the next morning my parents finally arrive when o a'mvidio taping as i i greets my dad at the door asking him all kinds of questions about his with about a recent gentle surgery he had the rest of the family hovers close by and i can see that my do is emotional that he cannot say a single word he cannot even looker in the eyes he tries to be playful and takes off her hat than fiddles with his own sun glasses trying to distract himself later i was finally able to ask him what he was feeling when he walked through that door well you now us just like now every or u no thinking that your to than is ti an you cannot tell and tow thinking that these tee probably the last time that you see u all the harness is a on you everybody say and everybody knows was on except you except o mom i was afraid to say something than the yo yo yo you genu cannot hopeless or is a cried right you to say someday but a little with us it is it just no thus no worst to choose from at one point in i asks him what is wrong even though he does not respond it is she can feel the weight of his grief and she just starts sobbing no i wondered if she knew why we were all there or maybe when you are eighty this is just how you great your son who live far away on there are other relatives around and my dad walks away from that night to get some space on the video you can hear my mam and her at her voice up be trying to light in the moon he to ye a after a while i i takes her usual roll as the matriarch and gathers every one around edit w charge o she reminds us why we are all here the big event a lady and his wife's marriage yes my elm's wedding is the big event my at confirms quietly we all urged in to relax but she is busy getting everyone is or priorities you check on the banquet hall you guys see to prepare your wedding speeches you need to get over your jetlag to veneer angle yank hall any ha toehold ye seeing ani who ye probably should be in the hospital yet worked up over the phony wedding banquet while we stood by and watched it felt cruel i went to myna's niece what call guru with my concerns guru lives close by and also helps look after not i i asked her what if anna has things she wants to take care of what guru responded i said i do not know none of us do that is my whole point no guru said she does not have anything that and that was the end of the discussion the wedding celebration was held in h banquet hall of a newly built hotel heal had on a black suit with a pale pink tie his japan's wife wore a blue chiton dress with a floral shop guests approach nine to congratulate her smiler a politician at a press event ani smiled back she shook hands she kissed babies when it came time for the speeches uncle hyena my dad's brother took to the stage first he fumbled a while with a microphone before looking up it is a rare opportunity for us all to be here to day he started you all new lagan as a young child before we left china and now he is become a man he is brought a wife back with him from japan uncle motion to seaman's wife who could not understand a word of chines i think we are all hoping that next time they return they will carry with them a baby or two the room chuckled then translated this to his wife and her face flushed there is just one more thing uncle said his voice starting to quiver they say that a mother's greatest joy is having her children by her side my m has sadly not had that fortune he meant because he and my dad lived far away she is lucky to have all of you to care for her he stared at nine in the audience and then as if in slow motion tears began to stream down his face i thought of uncle hybrid a yes funeral gripping that clay bowl over his head as every one watched anticipating the explosion into a thousand pieces but this was not a funeral i was a wedding no crying only happy he had warned me himself just the night before they were all watching anna was watching there was no turning back everything i am everything have become is because is my ma this release is the dam he begins to weep uncontrollably on stage his shoulders strain we to ma were the desk mam in the entire world i looked over at pain who dabbed at her eyes with her handkerchief was she moved was she suspicious looking at her i could not tell after the speeches the brain groom moved from table to table making toast it did not take a mine reader to see that in i did not the new japan's wife i think she is quite dumb ani said she does not understand anything that is b because she does not speak chines i reminded her no she insisted it is because she is dumb the rid in groom were not use of the heavy drinking rituals of the northern chines and got drunk fast i mean they had to drink at every single table daman the groom constantly look he was about to cry and after drinking he could no longer hold it in he started to ball until his face turned bright red his wife's eyes were wide with panic as she scanned the room for help gugumotion wildly to me from across the room as we all swooped in to try and form a barricade around the sobbing room we told in that tana was probably just too happy that he was crying tears of joy the night after the wedding we all went out to a restaurant after a massive feast who played a drinking gan y y in i laughed hard that she cried and then laugh some more it was hard to distinguish which smiles were real and which ones were faked for nine's sake while i struggled with the grief of saying good died uni focussed on the future a future she assume she would be part of when you get married she told me it'll have an even bigger wedding banquet for you she also asked when it have a baby saying that she was looking forward to holding my child i had no idea when any of that might happen but i played along we planned what my wedding banquet would look and talked about how to balance my career once i had this hypothetical kid lying made me sick to my stomach listen my mam tried to reassure me your nine would appreciate that were lying to her otherwise why would she have done the same thing to your grandfather this was the first time it'd heard of this i was only ten when yea was diagnose with livery cancer as it turns out no one told him about his condition either as his wife nine was the key decision maker in that situation he had severe john's and was barely looked when in i finally gave him the bad news in the hospital i need to tell you something old timer she began he so dumb to the cancer three days later i ask my at about this and he said in truth yea knew no one told him but deep down people can feel when there really dying they knew and he knew but every one pretended not to know they could all allow each other to save face did nine also know was she also lying to us later little nine told me that there was in fact a secret that nine ha kept from us one i a hay diteyou oh no the shape what mom noble dread that is the sound of me being totally shot she tells me that in two thousand seven six years before the lung cancer die noses nine had been diagnose with breast cancer not unusual for a woman in her seventies but my a did not know my uncle did not know i did not know she had stack to me and she would been wearing a prosthetic breast for nine years nine concealed is from our family and uncle's family not because she was ashamed but that we would not worry all this time that we were lying to her to protect her she had also put on a show to protect us after i left china i immediately swiped nine from home i love you she said in english the few words that she knows a ma wish to find time to skip with her every day just a checking at first she seemed to be doing fine and had bosom terms then one day she started to cough and my heart sank i just have a bit of the flue she said it is nothing when the cough would not go away she suggested going to the doctor's office to pick up some medicine little in i panic and immediately talked her out of it but then a few days later in i stopped coughing three months came and went and in was still just fine every one was baffled eventually i could not keep up with the daily slype calls and it dwindle down to once a week and then once a month a year passed in i said she felt fine she just decided to skip her annual check up that year and another year passed during her two thousand fifteen check up the same doctor gave the same diagnoses and prognoses stage for lung cancer very serious no more than three months this time little in i did not even bother to mock up a phony document she just told in i that she had lost a test results but that everything was the same everything was fine it is been three years now since in i was first nose little in is certain her big sister is still alive because of her decision to lie to her because we gave nine joy instead of worry my mama told me about an old chines belief called phones ton means to ring out and see is joy honest is the belief that you can wash away a misfortune with joy even though this term was never use while planning the wedding that is essentially what we did and by the way every one in the family has their own idea of what saved tat night gone thinks it is partly because of her weekly prayers at the local dawns temple my uncle cried it is nine i survival to some expensive miracle probiatics he boughten from japan since one i seemed to be doing fine my parents suggested getting a less expensive bran of robotics and uncle my been freaked out if we switch it an she dies then it is on you when this whole thing started i felt the only rational person in my family the lone restorer to fending my grandmother against old rationed beliefs as it turns out my mamma agreed with me but she and my dad just understand both sides i pretty sure a lot of other america would feel the way that i felt that it somebody is get a die it is their right to know ya and the by we does sin that tat your business you will not you will not leave wits her an the o e but did you but you understand where i was coming from do you understand why i was conflicted ya i know but that is china that is at see fer in the world o hey people g to funeral and you will have to hold a peel around the house street see times and insist canthi you'll do not do that ray you will you either yous your counter toll you'll oh to them this make chaos i wonder now if my major dad was diagnose with something terminal and i knew and they did not what i lie to them and if it was me out i want know whet my family did was kine and it worked maybe ism reminded of a joke about a physics visiting his colleague needs bore and express surprise at finding a good look horse she hanging on the wall surly not superstitious oh no not for says but ism told at works whether you believe in it or not i know that does not seem a joke that what ism saying e e a a a anal aqua is a to maker the first feature called posthumous comes out this summer coming out the stuff that all of us do not know we do not know scientist actually tries to measure it the sent of of tit for chico bobagradio when our programmed continues tismerican my from mar a class to days program in defensive ignorance stories making the case for not knowing the case i admit you do not hear very often we arrived at day two of a program at two ignorance for dummies the first half of our show we heard a woman who as kept in ignorance by your family in this half of the sheulgan a turn to people who ware just ignorant they just do not know stuff they do not know what they do not know which hello there out to be all of us shall call has details and e musical data there is the story about ignorance that avid dunning really loves he is a psychology professor and he is even cited it in his research it is about a my name to macarthur wheeler who in nineteen ninety five robbed a couple of banks and pennsylvania and did not wear a mask and he was arrested and the police a basely said what we have you on the surveillance sales and he said dodo do not and they showed him the tapes and he saw his face went ah he stared incredulously and said abut i wore the juice i wore the juice the juice yes apparently a macarthur whether was under the impression that smearing your face with linen juice made it fuzzy er invisible to video cameras o toe his credit he had actually tested this theory he took is self but i think he sesame the camera the thing about m farther wheeler was not just that he was an idiot it was that he thought he was doing everything right which made avid dunning thing when people are wrong or when there performing poorly or for lack of a better word when their in competent do they know their incompetent and he had a guess which was no they do not know their incompetent it we decided to a do some experiments and find out now this may not sound something you can easily test for is trying to measure the height and weight of somebody is in security but professor dunning and his grad student partner just in cruder figured out away to do at they got different groups of undergrads together this as a corneal university and gave them one of three quizzes one was on grammar another on logical reasoning and another wearily on humor which one of these jokes is the funniest an a panel of comedians rate the jokes ahead of time and at the end of the quizzes they asked each student a simple question how well do you think you did or more specifically in what per gentile did you land that is what percentage of the other students taking the test do you think you beat and then they gathered together all of that at a and ran the numbers and i still remember looking at the first grab a to this day and the big finding is we took a look at the bottom twenty five per cent of people in each study a these a the people who had done the worst there scores are falling in the eleventh the twelfth the thirteenth percentile another words really low scores but they think they're performing the sixtieth the sixty fifth the seventieth per gentile among the better percentiles that is right they think that they ah beat out a majority of their peers one way to think about it if you look at people basically where about to get easy ass with the examly've just handed ain they think they are getting be plusses with the example just handed ain in short there seems to be a direct correlation between incompetence and in overweening sense of self confidence it was not apparent in every poor performing student but it was in the majority of them most people who did badly thought they did just fine or even great they had no idea no anybody who's ever gone to school worked a job or known any other people knows this phenomenon is that guy or lady whose copy and yet has no idea what their doing and it is infuriating that here in dunning lab it was not just an annoyance it was a repeatable finding they did this experiment four times with four different groups of students and it happened every time bottom performers thought they were at least above average and in nineteen ninety nine dunning in cruder published their findings and a paper called unskilled and unaware of it and their conclusion was this when some one asks how do you think you did and you open your mouth to answer your drawing on the same skill set to answer that question that you used to answer the questions on the test that is the lack of skill mean that only a good mama to off stakes but it also be you not can beagle to catch mistakes yours ore anybody else you are going to think often that bother sain is absolutely reasonable ah this is the double curse it is not that your ignorant and also happened to be over confident you are ignorant and it makes you over confident on the other hand students who scored well really were in the higher percentiles they tended to guess that they scored a little worse than they actually did and for kind of an endearing reason they figured most of the kids around them knew as much as they did in other words they were not mistaken about themselves they knew themselves pretty well they simply misjudged other people thinking probably as smart as i am over the years dunning and other researchers have run the same experiment in different ways over and over again and the result was eraser competitive debaters who were doing badly did not know they were doing badly people a chest tournaments trap in set shooters when there quiet on unsafely medical professionals medical professionals you will find for some procedures a for example that the interns atherinszation procedures exactly ah of them think they know the signing well they can teach it to other people whereas zero of their instructors agree in fact fifty percent of their instructors ay know this person us still to be supervised whenever they do this i go felt ye and all psychological phenomena this one pretty quickly grew a name dunning was insistent that he and cruder had nothing to do with the conning of that name the name the dunning cruder effect you few ah for example go on twitter and type donning drug you will see it the effect mention several times a day several times a day several times a day why have a computer in front of me going to twitter we just put n donning cruder ah oh here we go tramp is a static display of dunning cruder in effect ah where did you get your biology p h t dunning cruder university your clueless rants merely reenforce your ignorance keys soap very happy to get a mean out there in the world unhappy that it it yet somebody people sit as at epithet that is your name thatheire using t exactly is just become a scientific way of calling somebody stupid which i guess we were sorely in need of but i think the thing that a people in general miss is that a were we are not going about the brain of the incompetent were talking about the brain of all of us because sooner or later we step into that group ah sooner later we become the poor performers we all have a a specific pockets of in competence and we know some of them but they're lot of them we simply do not know and once we step into our own in competence a we do not know we have made the step this is really the disheartening sooner insight of this research if you think you are doing well it means one of two things other you are doing well or you are not doing well at all try not to think about it too long really avid doing who has thought about it more than any one says it is made him particularly vigilant about the things he says and does how he acts i trying to catch a handed glimpse of yourself in a mirror this one time for instance he was teaching a glass giving them an exam and at the end of it he asked the students the doing broker question how do you think you did and sure enough when he looked back at the tests he notice this one kit in particular got one of the lowest grades in the group and raped it himself in the any at the percentile and i decided i who am you a pique at the name because i i just have a suspicion ism going to see this person aid my offinceand indeed when the test was headed back you did come into my office ah because he did want to offer me a chance graciously to admit that the answers that i had designated as correct on the exam were actually wrong ah ah and he is really trying to hard to be gracious i could see some vibrations of outrage ah in his body and part of my brain is going and watch this analyze what is going on what psychologically happening they we got another part by brain and going are you sure mut to you a you sets because i think it would be embarrassing a for a person who has propose the funny cook refrain work to ah actually publicly displayed onion crooked ah but the sad sad truth is what i dearly love a would be a to be able to see me in this circumstance ah to be aware of o ka ah he i am having at any broker woman at according to my own theory it'll never have it that is because other people can see when we are doing the doing crooked dance but we cannot which makes you think why does not anybody say anything when it is little stuff your lies down yet stuff in your face your real friends and even some strangers we will tell you but somehow when your blowing a huge word balloon full of wrongness that is when the rest of us decide to be polite to go along cause to correct that we hardly confident know nothing jerk in the office just seems mean it is your place but maybe it is manor not to correct him the real sadness for me is that often people are going to suffer for their mistakes ah but they are never going to know it because if a person is a jerk in the office ah what happens is all the parties they are not invited to aah the wonderful social interactions they just do not get to experience and it is likely that they do not notice the absence of this you do not know you are incompetent ah you cannot finger it out in your awn and the world is treating you by been silent well how do you improve yourself under those conditions i should say the dunning and cooker's research has been criticized over the years other researchers have tried to punch holes in their conclusion even going far as to publish papers with alternative statistical ex plantations or doing in broker's finding and doing says he and his partner have responded to those critics in bring and may have convinced some that certainly not all of them which he actually takes to be a plus because the critics they have not convince are really confident in their opinions and doing an cruder are really confident in theirs one or the other is dead wrong and just does not know it o shall call is one of the produces of or show a three forget me not i frog them to days about ignorance of course a huge part of all four ignorance is the stuff that we used to know that we have all forgotten all our lives there is huge undergo of forgetting that sucks old classmates names into the abyss the french that we studied that we never used in pots and was of favorite movies we used to love that this of course see this is a curse coding stephany for i have several large unwieldy boxes stacked in corners of my apartment i almost never open them tut have slept these boxes to the twelve tiny apartments have lived in in the past debate they are full of no books external hard drives thousands or sheets of paper photographs we best tapes full of all my memories starting journals i wrote when i was five years old the idea that there are whole weeks even months of my life that have just disappeared into the miss of forgetfulness is horrifying to me if i cannot take these memories with me to the rest of my life then what is the point of even living them in the first place to hold on to the past a couple times a month it'll sit in my kitchen table one in my apartment and it'll just start recording these long soliloquies about whatever here is one actual recording from february twenty fourth two thousand fourteen eleven p m a six pack of corona and pacific as eleven dollars which i thought was superchurchous and i tried to buy whatever a for pack of cans of corona cans an he as a that is nine dollars that is well i might as well just by the loan six pacts causensure in the year twenty thirty that memory can be how all this is say that my obsession with my ever fleeting memories is what made me really excited when i heard about this condition called h s a m it stands for highly superior autobiographical memory tune tenth two thousand six tell me what was the weather and what day was that jo tenth two thousand six was a sturdy and remember it was a nice sunny day because i was outside for graduation party i was actually dang the party that was one of my aparttin jobs in college jo de grand's is one of only about sixty people in the world who have bee officially found to have h say and by the way i checked it was a sturdy and in jigsaw falls oho sunny job remembers very specific details from every single day of the last twenty five years of his life ism sitting across at table from hm when i ask him these random questions he was not crapped on any of them he is not using his one to look anything up when were the stars in nineteen eighty nine the askers in ninety nine were on sundae march twenty first i avowals i think we will be goldbor costed at that year him o k which episode is the one were rather quit o k i the first few seasons of friends more than the others i think that that was season three i on say remember twelve ninety six was people would ah say do not remember everything in their live can and their memories can be fraud and by is just every one else but they remember a whole hell of a lot more than we do and our particularly good at remembering things the care about people with h say who left sports hent inside repeat acknowledge of scores join really good wichcseive he shows and he tells me its kind of all the memories are available at any given time for him the sort of scroll through for for the for the shomadman don am is pitching i i think coda and he see sat talking about the i the projector how it is sort of a care sell of memory and it si it is not spot on how i remember things but it is it is pretty dam clothes farewell of memory yet it is and i think that the words ism trying to re call exactly the voice over for this si for this teaser of something there is a rare occasion when the public can be engaged plan there is that see there is the rare occasion when the public can be engaged on a level beyond flash it is no stalker tistalger delicate wit potent it it takes us to a place where we long to go again takes us to a place ay cagoyou know and that is exactly how i feel when i think about my memories is ye want to be there sometimes i am there whether not i choose to how rebook gives you notifications about what you posted a year ago to day joey to grandad plays that game in his head all the time he tests friends on a regular basis saying hey you moved to new york three years ago to day or hey six months ago to day we went carry yoking in that little basement bar his friends tell me they enjoy the updates it is having your own personal biographer of your friendship but having h say is constantly scrolling throughout facebookwall twenty four seven and just any sort of late night scrolling it keeps him up at night when joy lies down he just arms remembering to much lately he thinks over and over about a guy he dated which seems normal except their whole relationship only lasted for a couple of months an it ended two years ago but joy cannot help but go through their whole relationship in incredibly minute detail on a regular basis march

course my heart o three so ills cause ism a that this must be next day he takes ane picture of his cat and it was march twenty ninth that next week was the first time then we has a sexual count her and that was really satin for me because again this was just more confirmation of the fact in marines is something s aril nineteenth and is which was he is to regain twenty fourteen everything us can went down hill an a then at all sell part that is the problem how do you get over someone when you cannot forget the what the way i explain it is how you have got and i your baggage i got a steamer trunk jill price also has h say she just turn fifty and says she is got fifty years of stuff and the steamer trunk is he congas we shifting metaphors a little if you were you have a every day is a bag of garbage and then you go to sleep and you wake up the next day and it is a fresh day and you can fear that garbage bag out from the day before i i do not have that i got mass of amounts have just piled up garbage bags everywhere jill is an fella and she is worked as a script supervisor on sat her h say was really useful cause er job was to make sure that continuity was preserved throughout the film that some one's hair looks the same from shot to shot that a table is set in exactly the same way and of course oil remembered how that table looked even if the last shot happened weeks ago i called her up because i wanted to find out if resentment about the past is a sit effect of each say for any one other than jo short answer yes ism still pissed about stuff from when i was five and that is ridiculous oil says she cannot forget but she can never forget but maybe not being able to forget sort of hinders her ability to forgive as well as the rest of us she told me she still angry about this thing that happened in her first year college three decades ago oil a this calendar that she would used as a diary writing down details about each of her days and cramped handwriting manysculleit is barely legible i written all over i mean everything was on there nine ay three was a really important year everything was on there everything you could imagine whet could be the weather could be what you mean she's the you talk to what what is at every yes everything oil left the calendar at her mom's house for a few months while she went back to school and the next time she came back the calender was gone i cannot find the calendar it'd looking everywhere i hysterically go running through the house trying to get my parents to understand what just happened how important this was where is my journal wat at inhere went no like and i remember they had somebody at the house they were talking to t was i was interrupting some sort of business meeting but i was all freaking on i did not really care and even to this day just recently i said to my warm you in i brought that up i said and you did not youyou really had no idea she thought i was rehashing things i why cannot you just get over what happened when you were five what what is this she could not understand why i was bothered or upset about things that happens decades ago where to me it was yesterday why why is it supertragic that hat you do not have that calender now well i a i do have it because i then went back couple years later and i rewrote the whole thing i mean i could not writ every single thing but i tried to go back and redo the entire calender that was how important was to ma ye and if it is all in your head it is saved in there anyway then why bather writing it down because if i did not write it down i would have fifty years of stuff just constantly swirling and writing it down just sort of relaxes it and it is makes it that it is it is it is there it is happened and it is put away was that make sense ye it makes the lot of sense i talked to a number of people with ah say and it is seems their days are filled with random memories showing up bees buzzing around their head until they can get swarmed by writing the stuff down jill manages the memories she is taking them one by one cataloguing them and putting them into a filing cabinet there is a link between obsessive compulsive disorder to s d and h say maybe having the power to remember much makes you want obsessively do it all the time or maybe it is the other way round desperately wanting to remember everything give certain people the ability to do it phenomenally well either way researchers say they seem to go hand in hand but a your to have ago at i really bat break to a and one of the ways i got over my ex was by managing my memories which is pretentious by to say i told myself he was the duck bag i dwelled on all the bad parts in the relation ship all is irritating qualities but recently i was slipping through on entries in my journal from a few months before not bad not for fun for this story not that far gone in one entry he intuited when i was feeling low and send exactly the right thing in another we went to a perfect dinner were we got free desert restaurants were constantly giving us freeload we could not figure out why but eventually settled on the idea that people liked us because we just look happy i had of course blocked all of these memories out because they did not find of the story i was telling myself and i did not want them back it had been good to forget and the difference between me and people with h say is that i have the choice to stop reading the diary to just walk away jill does not have that choice it did not paralyze me until my his band dived that his death has really paralyze me how was it paralyzing because i will never ever ever ever forget that of course no one forgets their spousetine but for jill it is different i am still in march teth hast infixed when he died yet not every minute but i could really put myself in that week and feel it and it hurts it it happened yesterday yet now the the feeling that i was nock on a survive i do not feel that way to work use i have survived but a how often do you think about that it'll one ten times stay even though i get up every day i feel ism still standing in the same place it is it is really being stuck it is being stuck in a moment that you can there is no escaping do you wish that you could forget it yet or or or or remember it the way normal people remember it how do normal people remember it i do not know but it is not i mean i do not think that somebody would be sitting here eleven years later still like feeling it the way i feel it see i wish you could understand and i wish i could understand what it is to be able to let things fade and or or not let just that is the way it is jullsays it is knowledge she is only reliving bad memories she likes to go back to one of her favorite afternoons october nineteenth nineteen seventy nine in the ninth grade when she had a bad day at school in her mom surprise her with whole when she got home but when the bad once come on she cannot help but get emotional and they come on all the time if you did not have each same how do you think your life would be different to day i i think that i would have been able to move forward i think i probably would be married today i do not think i would be scared i would be able to just we walk forward instead of constantly looking back o was lit it pit its its reverse this that you may be you understand your boy friend you guides broke up yet how l on were you upset about it or in tell the point where you felt you can move forward without thinking about it all the time or move forward without it ripping your heart out oh god three months i do not have that luxury and are you jealous of me no no because i i on the lipide of all that i cannot imagine what it is to not remember my life i really cannot understand how nobody does even though it is tormented me it is just everything was just important to me that i just i hold on to it tight that i would not want a not be able to do that ism not jealous of hurt either ever since talking to these people with each say for the first time in my life i actually feel just find about forgetting i know that sounds it is

the venthvir showsponer baxpressvy plan protect our alpine pray today express vepiantacam slashed the first rule of politics is this never run directly into a tree while kicking yourself repeatedly in the nuts republicans in congress seem to have for gotten this rule two weeks ago represent machetes of flora wo on with limelight seeking compatriotslike represent of nancy mace decided it was times to get rid of speaker of the house coven my earthy sure my earthy ad only been speaker for proximately five minutes and sure in that time my earthy had defeated jobidon in a stand off over a continuing resolution and was preparing to pact concessions out of sent entemocrats that amounted to a cut intiscressionary spending plus border funding but it was time for mac earthy to go why because of the establishments that is why now you may be asking what is the establishment it towns bad well apparently defining the establishment it is a little asking someone to capture the wind in a bottle or to trap starlight with one's hands sometimes the establish means republicans ho are in favor of fiscal responsibility that establishment tody poleyn sometimes the establishment means republicans who ant to stay the size an colic government that establishment rhino gorge shall be bush sometimes the establishment means republicans are socially conservative that establishment stage mac pens sometimes the establishment means republicans are socially liberal that establishment open sedan collins sometimes the establishment means people who are hawkish on for policy that establishment does line ram sometimes the establishment means people r dovish on foreign policy that establishment duffs john huntsmen well the turn establishment used to have a meaning it used to mean a present with power who is too conciliatory to left wing positions but during dona frog's presidency when he was the astral president we learn that power had nothing to do with it daeltrum the most powerful person on the planet was not the establishment during drums presidency we learn that friendliness to left when positions did not make you establishment either after all it was done a trump who declared that entitlement programs the single big strikers of america that we are off the table for discussion what makes some one establishment to day the answer insufficient poster that is it that is the whole thing pestering see the only way to avoid being labeled establishment these days is to get nothing done but to yell really really really loudly particularly about the establishment to be anti establishment it is to complain about losing elections while doing nothing to win them it is to start that the game is rigged while refusing to even en gage in the game at all being anti establishment has turned into just wining it is about showing what you are against by postern and then telling your audience that if you posture theatrically enough waver hands around lot your opposition will just surrender passing legislation now recognizing reality doing any of that is surrender to the opposition hell you can even vote with democrats to take down a republican speaker of the house with no back u plan and you will be considered anti establishment all because you yell about the establishment now here is the thing that is fun and games in the commentaries after all in my industry it is easy to remain ideologically pure the beauty of what people me do for living is we can speak i what we wish would happen what the best of all possible worlds would be we can point out where our politicians are falling short of our principles we keep pressure on the politicians that is our job when it comes to congress purism is a recipe for stagnation and is aster that is because believe it or not america expect that budgets will be passed they expected legislation will be crafted and if you do not do these things america will put you in the minority status in the halls of power permanently now because re publicans have to deal with a very seem majority in the house a democratic content and democratic president any speaker of the house we will have to fall short of perfectly performative opposition being speaker of a fractious caulis faced with a minority position in the upper chamber and white house necessarily means cutting deals not just pestering that was true for ckevenmc earthy it would have en true of steeve scores it would've been true of him jordan to if mandates suddenly skim speaker it would be true for him as well our congress though has now been filled with people responding to the intensive structure created for the commentaries get a tension and money for posturing not legislating you yell about the establishment i eat any one who does anything in congress and you win points according to machetes even my earthy was the establishment and that meant he had to be d fence started in favor of well some one or no one or maybe some one who is i no one we do not actually no actually yet hell we do now is that the speaker will not be cevemc earthy he one the seventy eight per cent heritage action score and will note be stove scores he give the eighty two per cent herbage action score or him jordan who has the same eighty two per cent heritage action score maybe's be toneme who also has an eighty two per cent herbage action score but probably not and probably will not be iatric my henry who also has insight two per cent herbage action score at will not even be backdates who has in eighty four per cent here actionscore actually it will probably be no one for a good while longer meanwhile jo bison we will work to ram through one hundred and five billion dollar fence package that includes sixty billion dollars for you crane and ten billion dollars for goa all will take is peeling off a few republicans to vote with the democrats again now who could have helped stop that who could propose sake a single issue spending bill on for policy e speaker of the house but we do not have one but at least the establishment was stop that is the important thing and there is good news if re publicans keep losing the way they did in twenty eighteen and twenty twenty and twenty twenty one and twenty twenty two then i can have to worry about being establishment because they will not have any power at all note that none of thus has anything to with principal it has nothing to do with conservatism or victory it has to do instead with applause and cash and fame but for many people in the republican party that is apparently good enough ice should not be re publicans can still win they can still push the ball ford for conservatism but to do that they need to think about how to win not merely how to poster and yell and get on t v they will meed to stop running directly into trees if they do not all they will lend up with is a minority position in congress a democrat in the white house and a terrible terrible ball ache in just one second we will get to tom my clinic tomb flintlock a very conservative member of congress now written open letter to the people who defenestrated my earthy ask them exactly what their looking for gets that momentarily first i want a talk you about daily wares most trusted privacy parked and promise sponsor of the show express i v p n you feed me talk about

for free that s e x p r s s v p n dot come slashed express v p n dot come slash ben to get those three extremes for free aga old con sedatives in congress are very frustrated with the spectacle be on fridge him cordon he stood for a third consecutive vote on his speakership and he went down in flaming defeat not because jump join is bad got but because this calk is is unbelievably fractious it is very difficult to attain two hundred seventeen votes when you only have two hundred twenty one all takes is five people to peel off and gran stay an fun rays in order for a speaker to become in possible to republicans hoe been operating without a speaker for the last three weeks now the problem with that of course is that it makes it very difficult t consolidate against robin's positions to take a quick examples i mention before join is now proposing it one hundred and five billion dollars supplemental defense package that defense package lump together a bunch of things that are not alike at all it lump together some border security which is good and some time want security which is good ad some israel security which is good with sixty billion dollars in u can security which is n and ten billion dollars in funding for twomanitarian concerns in fossa which is super duper bad now if you had a speaker of the house because bills generally are supposed to initiate in the house you could split those apart you could force demicrests taken up or down vote on fourteen or twenty billion dollars for israel and then force them taken up or down vote on the sixty billion dollars the join is asking for are green you could force them to take a border a for vote just funding the border alone at least get them on record is to whether they support that or not you might dun up with a craftsandwich but at the very least you get people on record as to what it is in the bill they actually support be republicans cant do that right now because they do not have a speaker and this is now irritated tomiclantock who again is one of the most conservative members of congress from californium a super immigration hawk by the way tomiclintock and a here is what he wrote is a letter to the eight republican to voted two get rid of my earthy and they voted with all the democrats to get rid my earthy for some unspecified reason no one can can understand heres ready wrote quote dor wayward colleagues your letter of october twentieth and which you graciously offered to martyr yourselves as long as you can get your way is perhaps chemist selfless act in america history they they all offered that dome they were going to vote with the team but only if they were willing to suffer censure suspension or removal from the conference he says this i was certain our republican college who refuse to vote with the republican majority would have been inspired by your stirring example of party discipline and loyalty to vote with the team as you eloquently phrased it i was frankly stunned when they did not i do not understand why a handful of our fellow republicans could not see the simple fairness of the principle to which you have been unswerving in your devotion heads i win tails you lose we should have been moved by your willingness to suffer censure suspension or removal from the conference to enforce your personal preferences on the overwhelming majority of your enlighten colleagues we should have appreciated how you and two hundred six house democrats saved us from a republican speaker we truly do not deserve you but says tomb clantock to again he it's rang this letter to and he begs can buck to circuit you can machetes bob good nancy mates mat rosendale healthy people who voted against my earthy the first time to take him deep i say yours sir tomclantoc says your sacrifice is not in vain you have succeeded in replacing the outdated concept of majority rule with an exciting new standard that a speaker must be elected by ninety eat point two percent of the republican conference some day i mashie will be born onto who can achieve this miraculous threshold and on that day your judgment will be vindicated and you will be hailed is the geniuses that you are i think we were all truly humble to learn that your quote fidelity to republican virtues and principles remains on wavering who could not be moved to tears to read that you offer your self sacrifice sincerely and wit the hope of unity with purpose with this in mine i modestly suggest yo planner martyrdom in the only way the truly matters to have the wisdom to see the damage o have done to the country and have the courage to set things ripe before it is too late i in closed a proposed resolution that perhaps one of you can offers who begin the fourth week of national paralysis as the world burns around us your secret ad mirror day and again the basic idea that tomiclan hes in what that hell is wrong people why did you do this the is no purpose do not machetes for his part he is notary why should packages be sorry why not why lake really he is making more money he is reckoned in off the fun raising he says the he says the establishment a lot i dot that term he loves it he is at lot well yesterday a piece of the walls journey by molly ball says quote wit the capital an chaos and the speaker's position going on as third week of vacancy represent of machetes survey the consequences of his actions and declared had no regrets i have extreme confidence the float a republican said that we will have an upgrade at the position while ism ism sure he is confident that that makes perfect sense any majority poverty is bound to have division says the pastry journal but the upheavals that have rack the house chyopieace since canary our less a reflection of any to here ant faction and one man's singular will gates does not have a pussy his not a member of the freedom coccis his anti maccarthy grates have not been joined by marjeric chador green only half the members who forced who joined him in forcing almacarthy were members of a group he assembled to blockmacarthy nine months ago it's many republican is the heirsheld gates is personally responsible for not only sparking the corn was but setting a destructive president the continues to hobble the body a small minorities as stumbled the block any speaker from being elected but he insist he is about outcomes not headlines he says he has received a flood of approving fee back from conservatives across the country was does not scar me america decline does you wrong on social media late thursday now again you gates suggesting that he hate as i sedbefore using your power in order to leverage concessions from a party in favor of conservatism ism fine with ship boy used matgatesis pseudo rebellion back in canary in order to do that yet a bunch promises from ma earthy many which were good that is was happening here mandates is simply playing a game and the game is you become more famous your not we more and you raise more money and you raise your profile more if you yellow establishment really laud run into a try and this has consequences this is not a good thing by the way there nine republicans tore now running for house speakers this slogan go grate they include tom amen of menisoda already people gates have said their not con vote crammer represent of kevenhern of oklahoma who chairs the republican study committed a bunch of the called moderates in the republican casks probably will not vote for him he voted to overturn the results of the twenty twenty election a bunch of new york republicans are nock on vote for him because of that represent of pet sessions of texts who charged the house rules and national a house rules committee and the national republican congressional committee he said that he would be running for speaker as well he also voted against certification of the twenty twenty election again that is can be a big split because for a lot of republicans in order to demonstrate felt to donate trump yet to vote against certification but for a lot of republicans wo are in the purple districts you need to win in order to maintain a majority that do we really want a speaker who is on be saddled with that represent of busting got of georgia emerged as a surprise speaker canted at last week he ran against german in a conference wide vote and got almost notes represent of baron donates of flora who is a relative he is a second from congressmen he is become famous mainly as a as a trump alkaline and he he says that began is not toligen at present all the rest this again our moderepublicans an vote for baron donates i my gan i a lot of these congress people ism jobs pointing out though when you have in extraordinarily diverse clacks which is what the republicans have and by the way what republicans half yo have an order to maintain a majority the speaker position cannot be a purist it is not that it is not in the operative incentive structure of game other names include represent of jack burglar of michigan represent of ma johns of louisiana representative can muser of pennsylvania represent of derry palmer of albata do any the people actually think on on me

continue to happen over the corse of the week en comes in the gossisstrip they decided they ware going to make a piarmove now this pair move was design for to purposes one is to try and by time to stop and his daily ground invasion into the gossesstrip an trying at the media back onside the media have been itching itching to get off israel side after largest masker of since the polices and get back and to the well moral pare cecal of violins comose really does have some legitimate concerns train likethey want back on that train bad that can tasted and comasnows that that is purpose number one purpose number too is that total which is a regime in the mileage that is very heavily aline with on and his sort of a terrorist home base for negotiations the usually put the political wing tin stars o for example when the united states was negotiating with talisman they were doing it in total total has a home base for tomato is malaria who the political leader of comas hes staying in a fiesta hotel in star while gaze is getting bonds he is over there is a cottar we started get significant outside pressure as they should to turn compass over to the america and to stop playing footsie with terrorist groups and total is making the claim that they are the home of negotiations and the negotiations will only be fruitful if there sort of left to their own devices come this a bi of a favor to solar which makes sans kaskozar also passes money to tukomas and i and commas released two america hostages over the weekend they do this late on fridge afternoon the to america hostages happen to be lip that when i say happen i me the they released partially because of this a related to reporter for en b news which again is a way of trying to buy off the medium here was them here was the ten b c coverage of the release of the two posture member there till two hundred an twenty two of them remaining including babies on money the group postedividio of a woman and made an offer to release foreign hostages ut senor humans official then told and be sinews the group is willing to release all civilians and a duel nastrais that with the condition her o all of the civilians including the usually civilians ism sorry if are you could i just clarify this you say you are willing to release all of the civilians including the usually nationals if there is the stolen s and what you asking for in order to do that do you want the air strikes to stop as that the condition that our our viewers might hear that and say that this offer does not mean anything that if you are not willing to carry it out then it does not mean anything or you could just release ell the hostages right now by naan envy see news covers it and then israel will not stop the aggression they will not sun's really israel fault of the hostages i bring how that hamasnos exactly what it is doing commas not that if it releases a couple of hostages every often they got two hundred and twenty two of them if they release a couple of hostages every often then maybe the world will hold israel back from going into the gazistrip now as we will see the buy administration is sending mixed messages on all this and the par war is part an parcel of all this commonage commas committed the work tetrosity in decades and now they are trying to buy all of that back and make everybody forget about that because here the ell even they release all the hostages to morrow there r still fifteen hundred deduces we are butcher and mutilated babies murdered in their crews and all the rest of it and commassibasiclly expecting that the world will then tell israel to stop that is the matier and compass is trying to run para the para is we will release horses ever often and the the world will to presser on the is release you stop and leave us in power now by administration for its part is sending som me signals is on the one hand they are correctly suggesting that the compass terra have to release all the hostages on conditionallist that is what blincoln said yesterday well first crista we have been working on this from they not i engaged with son different partners in the region an sending clear messages about the need to immediately and in conditionally release all of the hostages and it was gratifying to a to see that don juts an artily on on were released yesterday i had a chance to speak to them as well they were a they sounded don a the strong of mind strong spirit but a there remain many others and we are hopeful that that more release but the bottom one is this they need to be released eachn't every one of them now unconditionally at that is the right message obviously but even if all the hostages are release compass still has to go and that is the game the compasses playing right now now reason comasshas to go of course is because what there a tempting to do is obscure what just happened a couple of weeks ago israel has now done something that it has never done they have that they held a press conference to day where they had all members the median the room and they showed them the full go propose footage from various compass derris showing exactly what they did to rally civilians on comber seven and it is terrific stuff i mean truly terrific some of it is been described to the general to the general public here to kanaka is a their first responders in israel here the aka volunteers recalling the atrocities that they saw on the ground when they went into these is rally areas tat had been ravaged by compass way the r hows we o the a to we the a o or the o a had has a a ala we a solo boy o i we a thighs we the as can a we o or why wo own who's cops or who i is wo oo i is lo er i s ha the o o the is o case these descriptions that they they just go on and one eyes torn out fingers torn t all the rest of this sort of stuff israel has a forensic pathology center and they they have gone through all the evidence now they m open to the media and what they found were people with charred hands of mars revealing where the victimstands were bound behind the backs of metal wire before they were burned alive one of the images in the slip shows a completely charred mass of flesh which a first glance could not even be seen as have their having belonged been belonging to a human being whose only after the set stand was dawn of the charred flesh that experts could see what exactly they were looking at and it was a parents any child bound together burned alive by comas terrace two spinal columns were in the see skin one an adults final column when a child's spinal column tear bound the other by metal wires in a final embrace before they were set on fire according to when and doctor ten come whose the head of the national center for forensic medicine in teloveve he said the proportion bodies re receive toward chard is high many of gun shot wounds in their hands showing they put the hands ups their faces in defend many were burned alive in their homes they are burned lie because their suit in their track yarn their throats meaning they were still breathing when they were set on fire come explained that the age range the victims hands from three months to eighty or nine years old many bodies including those babies are withoutheads asked if they were decapitated cudgel answered yes although he admits that given the circumstances difficult ascertain whether they were decapitated before or afterheat as well as whether they were beheaded by knife or had their heads blown off by are g which really the big question your being this from the holicoston car tody well what were they really bead with a nifhno of their publicist alive if they will not bet if they were just if there was a baby at its had blown off by an are g obviously a very different story the reason then bringing this up again the reason israel also is bring this up again is to remind people that even if the hostages are turned over comas has to go israel has to do what it has to do two get rid of comas and as well see lest is already sending mac signals because this is what many in the west do they refuse to see the evil in front of them and they refused understand how the middles works which is that if you do not obliterate the evil to day it rises up and hits you tomorrow israel for its part has ben intensifying the bombing multiple fronts and preparing for this goal grounds operation there still significant disagreement apparently within his rely circles over whether to going on the ground right now or whether to waited out to essentially keep facilitating movement of rosin civilian south said they can then hit the tunnels because the last thin israel would to do is put two thousand soldiers in harm's w ay in a in a high lee dens urban in firemen that looks much moved is according tote waster eternal israel ramp up its coming of carton three fronts including a rare air strike in the wessbank as humanitarian aid trickled ins the gosh strip in a international effort to ease the hardship the conflict has wrought on the two million civilians trap their not again one of the things that truly amazing about what is happening in the gosistripr now is that i have never seen in my entire life a war in which the party that was a great against is now responsible for the civilians of the party that is that is the aggressor party during world war too you remember a lot of conversation about german civilians and how the air that how the allies had be very very careful of what they did in from of killing than posies in terms of german civilians thetas not a lot of talk about that was throne talk about that after nine eleven you remember all the talk about we see to make sure the we have humanitarian convoys getting into cobble during during the postpone eleven period i remember that either when it comes to this all the sudden its israel responsibilities deal civilians that are really under the species of comas that again is a game that is being played by the international community in order to i would assume attempt to smuggle in more resources to comas which has been stealing these resources for literally decades at this point international efforts according to the later vernal remain under wash to free hostages and gowan prevent the fight from osculating into a regional conflict as will see the the united states is trying to do that by both bribing and also by threatening in northern israel a bunch of northern is daily towns have been evacuated cry ochemona which has twenty twothausan people was fully evacuated in the northern front because o the possibility that husbela tempts to getting the war and start firing rockets into the north of israel that of course would mean a major escalation israel also is taking the gloves off in a way that it should have for the last several decades is taking the gloves off with regard to terror sites for example over the week end israel struck a mosque compound in the west bank they did that because they knew that weapons were being hidden in the most an a major hardtack was being planned from theirs the it themes this of course is the reason why placing in terrace to hide in most is then they had de claim the israel striking religious sits is the very favorite thing to do meanwhile again the united states is is sort of sending a little bit of mic signals tony blink sectary of state he said were concern at the possibility that eonian proxy to can oscillate the war against the united states whether is the reality they should be a lot more worriedabout osculating he war against the united states then we should be worried about the escalating the war against us yous to be purely frank about this if they fire on it on america worships every one his below will be dead n the united states is not a power to be trifled with and the fact that we are constantly and pussy footing around this we all well what we are worried about a eonian proxies escullatin against us they should be a lot more worriedabout of escalating against them considering the united states military is most powerful fighting force in the history of the world bar non tax a military budget that is the rest of the world's combined times too they if usual old besides that they want to get it on that bytheway this the message you should be conveying them is you want to do this do you really want across that lone do you really wants you that because it will be a giant's foot against a mosquito man here is twenty blinking thug again the mexsignals here are are pretty pretty re remarkable tension is very high in the region are you changing your security posture are you pulling any you ask personal out of the area margarita we are concern at the the possibility of baronial proxies escalating their attack against our own personal our own people we are taking every measure to make sure that we can defend them and if necessary respondecisively i mean ism glad if necessary response et again this very easy the present united states in his laspeece you should have said we do not want you t escalate you should not want you ascent is viewuscalat you'll be dead in that that is how works in ththeleast and pretending otherwise his really really really done by the way israel is is saying some of that sort of stuff near bar not who is a member of the the government renew is israel minister of the economy he warned iron that if they get directly involved israel q cut the head of the snake off which is what is real has to convey if they do not convey that then upon will in fact get in and it is worth while moving here that there is in fact a a common interest not westerly among iron but but even among e on and not osculating this thing right now the math is this iron has much proxies those proxies include the who these in yeomen include husbalon the north of israel include the syria government include the lebenees regime chichis cobalt and the incluecomos commons was not suppose to succeed this way the entire goal of this terrace attack was probably kill fifty using cannapfive and instead of kill fifteen hundred news and canna two hundred and because of that commons is now an existential danger and iron would prefer not to have the night on its chessboard knocked off the chessboard but that what is going to happen and gonna has to consider whether it prefers to lose its night in the gnosis trip play another night in northern israel slash southern lebanon in herbal cause if it escalates that is where this is going or whether it just concedes the loss there grant they are desperately trying to spend their way out of compass losing control of the gossip trip and the only question is why the west is con t prevent israel from doing what it needs to do in the gnosis trip i think have fat of the united states not kin to do that because again i think everybody has an interest in seeing commasfall including by the way egypt how do you notice because it actually over the we get the idea accidentally hit in egyptian outpost and egypt immediately said we get it it happens father war for all the talk about how the entire aerberald is united against israel that is not really true easily of the baronial proxies who are united against israel the sounds tear if common gets taken out whereat we cannot stay that we are happy about it but we are pretty happy about it were we are pretty much o k with all of that reunited states is seeking about another way which is by off moss i try and try and pay off thou's get now this is a strategy that is doomed to failure is a very due strategy yuyuyou cannot buy off iron you cannot buy off come ass you be giving the money they will use it for the worst possible purposes and yet and yet your seeing again this attempt to win arab support by somehow looking is though your putting clamps on the state of israel when in reality wat the united state should be saying to israel is you do what you need to do and we will push everybody else off the ball but if you a pure to be holding israel back if you appear to be no trying to tell israel to back off then what your really doing is your providing fodder for the called arab street if you keep saying to israel over and over and over you got do not do not violate humanize do not hilt then you are playing directly into the narrative which that there is some sort of human rights comparison between the state of israel and its enemies will get to that momentarily first everybody knew its life in turns just an important thing to have have lots of insurance me my life makes me feel a lot more comfortable o human being that god forbidsomting happens to my family at least

full size are sharable micro gressionsizes perfect for giving out to friends family and neighbors time is running out to day is the last chance to stop up now in time for hollowing go to enemy's chocolate do calm to day again the west is sending these mine messages and attempt to sort of contain things now the way thou act contain things in the leases you say if you step over the land it'll hit you hard that i will bomb you ford into the stone age that is what you actually saying the at least if you wish things to remain contain because that happens to be the reality and this has been true for literally all of middle eastern history force and threat of force are the coins of the realm in the mat least they have always been that and the west is too shy these says in the less like well what a fleet what i fleet told about human rights do you think the comas cares about human rights you think a on cares about human right for that matter even the countries that work allied with do think out your abet cares deeply about human rights i think not i thing not the car about realistic interests that care about what they can do that is were they care about and yet your seeing can of this weird push from the west all about human rights and encouraging israel to follow the rules of work understand the entire basis for the terraced opposition to israel is trying to get israel to quod quit obey the rules of war and weighs that no other country wood while violating the rules of warriorself this is the way this works jo bison again it is the sort of stuff fit it it is why having a a tottering president his not gan again again biding has not been horrible on the situation thus far but he is just not good at this mean he is not with it over the week en he was asked whether israel should delay the ground invasion as the is walking up the stairs two force one trying not to trim and and he said yes which judge that is a confidential military dis cushion that you are having with these really government that's not something you should be spilling to the press this is buying time for compass obviously but no no i know is rs laver grand nation in sing anal the hostage now er a case of then they tried to walk back what the president was far away he did not he the full question the question sounded wouldyou to see more hostages released he was in commenting on anything else hell maybe that is true because i mean the guy is city or maybe he should shut up when he is walking up the stairs me go going quietly he is perfectly happy ignoring most questions as he walks away from the press why this one tony blincon then tried to walk that one back again these sorts of mix signals do have ramifications in real bloody terms have you asked this rally government ti delay in order to give you for time to proper the release of these hostages first s step back for a second because it is important to remember what happened it is incredible how quickly that get's lost because it was only a couple of weeks ago that mamas invaded israel with ah it is terrace fighters and slaughtered and i use that that were very deliberately slaughtered many a people again then women young children babies told people a you name it and they continue to rain rockets down on israel what i was there a few days ago we are in the but we were we had to take shelter a couple of times because i the satrockit is from mama's my boat is this no country no country can be expected to tolerate this out to live with this and as we set from the start israel has both the the right and even the obligation not only to defend itself but to try to make sure that to the best of its ability this cannot happen again now problem is the de opposing point of view the sort of what is it but hazing in cycle mot that point of view is incredibly strong the states men much that blincon had have a listening session with all this little buddies over the state department as morons i which an amazing thingies firstmall what is a college camp kept have listening sessions with your employes not having e listening session my employ yes of whether disport terrorism or not that is absurd it is absurd his a bingo tried to walk it back but then you have the miss message that is coming out of he bone administration which is but there are many good people on every side ism but booth s to mad they are good people on on both sides you might say laid listen these secretary defense who is been very strong is thing israel would able to defend itself then he keeps adding this tag israel has to follow the laws of war you knowhow knot a noticed i noticed that the invasion of a rock cost hundreds of thousands of civilian lives hundreds of thousands if not a million civilian lies i noticed and there was not a whole whole of lot of talk about the sort stuff and a rock by the way had not committed a direct terrorist assault on the united states of america but here is laid often lecturing these rallies about how they have to be if to follow the rules of work come ass literally slaughters babies in their crews and then takes other babies captive but it is its israel that has to continually be warn about following the laws of ward this tenant this canon languages nonsense to your point each traded tin as to be that a less the carefully assess and we need do everything we can to make sure that civilian a not a not the injured at then an the right thing to do is to make our that a we account for civilians at our planning that we prove carders for for they movement out of the battles face that we are not tat that destroying protect it tat an property and tat that we are possible tan i think there's rails shave been doing this sat for something again they are professional force and we will incur continue to encourage them to make sure that they are doing change ti an costs let the law war now they everybody looking over their shoulder and telling them to do things in accordance with the love wore that is the wakening this sort of delusional cycle of violence israel has to be encourage to do the right thing meanwhile they face down a murderous terrain group that et calls for the genocide of all use all over the plane that sort of stuff has consequences joining did a lot of this last week when he gave his address re talk to how these really had to be warned over over not to take revenge nine eleven now that they to be warned about the the the mistakes of nine eleven the israilies have to be told about human rights that is to be lectured small school children about human rights meanwhile the people that fay saying are raping women and take them captive biding over the weekend he treated out a that this is the the western at tempt to go back to sleep the testate solution is dead the reason the testates solution is dead is not because israel wants at dead if israel could have hands it over control the godestript to egypt would do it to day if israel could hand over control of gonna to joint would do it to day israel has no interest in governing these areas because israel is not one govern these areas they are violent and very difficult to run and yet the reason the prostate solution is dead is because of that it is because these areas are very violent and very difficult to run because they keep electing terror groups for example and have heavy levels of support for the terrigrupe we can all pretend away that the civilian population in the plastic into areas of the west bank that these are full western liberal minded people it is a lie it is not true you'd pretend that about the people the godship also a li also not trends when you say there ought to be a peace process with cone quote the paladin in people the only people you can negotiate with our the representatives of the palisonian people far in history they've had the following re preventives the palsinian authority led by over aright followed by the palsonian authority led by the holicosan iromachmobas is loricae hot natural terra group and comas in natural derris group that is there entire leadership class what dor you jabbing about two state solution for will gets ta the wages of that in women es again it sets up this false binary that makes i possible for israel to do what it heads to do to preserve its own security first have been talking about my helices mattress for years have had that relics sleep mattress for what a decade at this point it really is fantastic i sleep great on it y wife sleeps great on it and now helix is introducing their newest most high

nothing to lose had above to relics sleep dot come slash ben to day and get twenty per cent off all mattress orders plus two free pillows for my listeners to get started get what should have happened with the comas attack is the west waking up to what the threat is and how have a bunch of consequences in terms of middle east situation it would remind the west that the called free palestine movement is in fact a pro terror movement that hates the west and seeks its destruction that is a reality you pretend that away or you get but it would mean that israel would the far less pressured to make concessions to terrorist groups in terms of what the west would do would mean that the westward serious my thing bout restricting itsimigration protocols mean the number of radicalized is comic immigrants from northern apricot in the midst over the course of the last twenty years in rope is astonishing which is why you are seen in giant rallies o cross the wrestles this are million thaws are not mainly left wing people there some left doing hangers on where two stupid to recognize that the first people get beheaded if the racamoslemstake over are them but the reason the you are seeing for example a one hundred thousand person process rally in landed that is not because you have a bunch of people in onion who are modern muslin char just a little upset about the human rights situation in the mildest as he as you have imported hundreds of thousands throughout your millions of radicalized psalmists who hate the west i mean that that that is to reality ne to pretend again you can pretend that away but it is really stupid to you to pay the price for it in here is by the way what the idea look from onion and me onion covered blanketed hundred thousand people protesting in favor of compass according to the guardian hey said thousands but look the ice of this crowd and it is astonishingly large the metropolitan police estimated a hundred thousand people anticipated the age the sins that say free palestine by that they mean by the way all of israel should be obliterated and m again hes are not all u nice left wingers who just went to the wrong university a huge presented to the people are new immigrants from the middle east and from northern africa who hate news really really ha news and that starts in the mat least and pretending that it does not is a serious mistake jobidon or example yesterday he treated out and strategically he is trying to he is trying to have it both ways hi trying say israel so defenditself but also the people that it is fighting with very often the very nice people there said to every one's nice if we could only just come together see treat out israel has the right to defend itself we must make sure they have what they need to protect their people to day and always that should then the tweet that would be but it does not at goes on for two more paragraphs quote at the same time pri'ministern internal when i have discussed how israel us it operate by the laws of war and the is this lecturing lecturing tone here if we do not tell israel to stop this then they will be horribly genocidal that means protecting civilians and combat as best they can we cannot ignore the humanity of innocent palistonians who only want to live in peace that is why i secured an agreement for the first shipment of humanitarian sister's for assistance for palstonian cavilling and goa and we cannot give up on a two state solution first of a that is a wild sons equites tithe the end erases we cannot give about us with whom your tong at obligee obliterating come of a terrors croup what the cellar you talking about that is far as ignoring the humanity of innocent innocent palistonians who only want to live in peace they are two thingstat are happening they are one his thrusting the responsibility for civilians and gossip not on the legitimate government of goa the come ass right i if the united states t attack by form power the ruffians you knows responsibility it is for safeguarding the civilians in the united states america our government that is t our responsibility is our fustian's responsibility we would hope that they follow of the geneva conventions but we have to assume that they might not and stood be our job to make sure that our civilians are safeguarded that they are provided for that is what any legit that's literally the job of the government but n the gosistrup apparently does not apply you get both ways is be a terrorscroup and u have no responsibility for your own civilian population also the suggestion beneath all of this is that again commons a few bad apples to few people who are bad apples that there is no action which is why a two state solution is possible after all if it turns out that commons of few bad apples and the placing an authority is a few be apples and is homage hot as a few bad apples that then really and lions tend is a few bad apples and has be laws if there just a few bad apples government yet lot of them but but the really just a few bats peace is still possible just in trudge a more on he treated similarly along these lines he he treated out quit that's members of the pain and arab an black communities gathered for par yesterday wanted them to know this we know your worried an hurting we are here for you we will not stop advocating for civilians to be protected an for international law to be upheld yes that is i can think of a few civilians who are where er in fact i can think of civilians were burned alive baccamass i can thing of them but this sort of moral equivalence language is what people are comfortable now i shorn a point out here that these called piece partners here are not piece partners both govern mentally as well as yes the civilian population injured and maria in thewless bank there is no evidence whatsoever that they are seeking in negotiated piece steal in which the state of israel gets to continue to exist the evidence does not exist for that it is literally non existent the same thing is true in the goes trip here for examples of placing an authority minister yesterday oke at the pain authorities are the call moderates these are people that joins calling up this guy is thread of the military wing of the palsingan authorities whole fat and here he is what he says an english in the name of the path movement we only want national unity they would be national unity with commas by the way here he was yesterday w of er they seem superpeaceful i feel the two state solution is imminent do not you meanwhile by the way again the lie that rosin civilians are entirely dis connected from comas this does not mean by the way that israel should target civilians they are not it does not mean that they shouldn't attempt to minim civilian casualties which thy are that is why there pushing people south toward where the electricity and water are still running by the way shops are still open in soother gossip but what it does mean is that this this lie that basically it is a few people at the top where the propmen the rest the population they are just western liberal we can either import them into the west or we can forth israel to make concessions that ends of the palicinian stakes apteral are not we all the same underneath it is a lie it is not true for example this is video from the gonna the the camass attack from madam on the is rally mochovian these are is killed fifteen hundred jaws and this video you are going to see a lot of civilians it turns out it was notches card carrying members of compass heavily armed and uniform it turns out is a carload of civilians here some f the radio sure people walking around by the open bortagasapasa the these areal the a dozen civilians they will civilians ah they are sell it these are members of camass and civilians o are riding on their trucks people celebrating next two members of compass civilians some of them are on crutches going into juisharias to steal things many civilians people riding bikes kids bikes directly out of the perish arias stealing things these areal of the uninvolved gaze civilians again the the this sort of attempt to greet a hard idea logical distinction between the got and population and commas is ridiculous the idea that again there is an idea logical distinction that can be made such that israel must make concessions and that is really what needs to happen here an that and again that the west should accept hundreds of thousands of pain refuges for example that is can work out well for the united states or for rope that is ridiculous by the way youknowho place this for all it is worth members of compass for example this is a video of me these are female members of comas and due this is a the first is from october seventh celebrating the massacre yous are two women in a comaskiere celebrating the massacre wearing full on comas gear and carrying weapons and firing into the air and in the second video below you'll see the acting for the cameras when the is really boys fall on goa this is the of coursethey know the game it is called civilian on civilian off civil a civilian civilian off when it is time to celebrate rockets falling on his rallies civilian on throw on t throw on the civilian garb the minute that the western cameras arrive out that them celebrating as and just are murdered and down that this them is them weeping weeping we law cannot believe these really atrocities all it is let tons of is this emerging from goa runs of them an no another one there is in here is another one the dozen civilian shouting alahuokbar as the rockets are fired from goa into israel and then crying because of the isralies fighting back a ala a gates very happy about the our rockets being fired into israel and flash forward cannot believe the atrocities they're taking place i just i cannot believe it its just an it devastating this is the guy they show on baby slam there's the kind of person the show babe my crying from the inside a hospital whet the don't shows the first off re celebrating the rock is being fired into israel this sort of double message is what continues to allow the west to blind itself on a routine basis just constantly blinding itself by the way while we are trying to get the the humanitarian eight into goa it is worth noting here that commas is literally literally right now corn dance blinking preventing america citizens in goa not the not the kenaf grab america were in goa commas is trying to stop them from leaving we are smuggling them aid and the same time of compass is trying to prevent the america civilians from leaving but do not work these are many many wonderful people in terms tot what is happening in gaze i know there are inascimated five to six hundred america there is there any chance israel let some of those america out or egypt about smiles america and you are exactly right and to at at least mamas has block them from leaving showing once again it is total dis regard for civilians of any kind a who are who are stuck in goa well and me there is a shock there is an absolute chapadory guys having really the two o the peace process to two states solution buskins of is now surf's then we send that mixed message to the western public the public gets the mi message the public gets the mix message and by the way they are constantly being told things that are untrue about the nature of of many people we immigrate to the west just you take a quick example there is a poll from an organization called signal the this poll pulled america on wide variety of issues including the palcinians and one of things that a found is that four example muscle america in the united states according to this pole have a plus sixteen that favorable favorable rating four palsinian authority president macuadabas and a net four per cent favorable rating for the leader of camass america by the way are forty seven points under water on the leader of the the compass terrorist organization but muscle america are four points over water on the leader of comes also it turns out that muscle america unfortunately a majority of muslin america according this signal pole are not anticamass which is unfortunate apparent apparently a majority f muscle america have a positive view of gassy not only thou it turns out that a majority of muscle america is agree that israelshon invaded gossip a majority a large majority fifty eight per cent muscle america agree that commons was justified in its attack on israel fifty eight per cent when it comes to again the lie that all human beings think the same way and have the same values that is wrong and it is a stupid stupid thing to believe but america are insulting it which his wive for example there is a new pull from the lost journal and what it shows is e twenty twenty two survey twenty twenty two survey seventy five per cent of america have a positive view of the is rely people fifty one per cent of america have a favorable view of the palistinian people om ism just wondering what that would be based on here's a you can have an unfavorable view of people and also not believe that they should be mistreated or harmed it anyway but what it is that separations this idea that again everybody just wants the same thing everybody just w love to have the she we all agree on all of these things by the way this new pole from the waste journal shows that if your under the age of thirty a broad majority do not support israel in its war against comas the this statistics among young people by the way are just era stating because again when you indoctrinate people in a post colonialist idiotic wile left wing wretched of the earth mine said this what you went up with there is polling data than now shows that young america perticcarly are heavily sympathetic to actual terrorism according two this poll from hazard derris the but this hazard hairs pole shows that here is the question do you think the compass killing of twelve hundred is rally millions in israel can be justified by the grievances of palistinians or is not justified the older you get the more manual on this question if you are above the age of sixty five ninety one per cents they not justified if you are between the ages of eighteen an twenty four a majority a major fifty one per cent f people aged eighteen twenty for believe that compass is justified in murdering twelve hundred civilians justified fifty one per cent if you are between theater twenty five and thirty four barely minority forty eight per cent believe that that is still justified that is insane by the the same the same exact pole says do you think the attacks on hos were genocide in nature or notcenicidal eighteen to twenty four sixty two percents a genital which is wild sixty two per cent of young america eighteen twenty four say that the attacks by comes were genocide but fifty one per cent still say they were justified which is nuts which is nuts but again this is what happens when you indoctrinate people into the belief system of mufti culturalism all cultures are equal all cultures are equipment now a gain this has wages and effects into the west when you import hundreds of thousands o people who believe this sort of stuff things ten to get pretty ugly and the wive seen mass protest not only in onion but mass anti israel protest in york city mass antiseptic protest in yoursaty hears what looked over the weekend is in bookman people i they getting rough wot the police officers but you of robot deal because there they are the right political persuasion at very wisps free press very of course is a a arsonist and in new and at her office is t the free press somebody came by an an greeted outside the offish f news the obviously people who lot t they have territorial disputes meanwhile a a a woman who is a defrost jewfish community leader name mate wool was murdered over the weekend the police have yet two established who exactly did it but they are the they are jumping to the conclusion that they know the motive which is interesting ism we'll find out whether that is true or not but certainly tensions are running incredibly his according to the washington free beacon and it is rely harbor business schoolstuden was a costing harassed a mid a gassy die in on campus here is what that looked w d it ta the thrown t he the also in smoky smoky is most famously the site of a no noisy march in which the left suggested that one has right for speech an a the rest but y the nunionats he is the neonionatzes i they arrived in smoky as well they are supposed to hold their protest actually and i in downtown chico and then they saw that the news were going to hold their protest in smoky which is a heavily jewfish part of chico my grandmother you live there and i sin of smoky pretty well and i very very jewfish aria of chico naturally go or the news are m if you want taiga news is where you go two people were taken into police custodian sundae evening after one man electorally fire a shot in the air you are demonstrators why do that happen apparently his car was surrounded he is rally flags on it and people started ripping the flag apart off the car and surrounded the cars who felt scarcely got you the kin fire to shot in the air he was arrested i but him the fact that they are going to jewfish arias meaning the the antisimies are going to jewisharias an ore star trouble bat of course is a not a shock heres wat it look this for lumber have proms of war but this cover is is is good and necessary and again they went to the jewfish aria that is the whole point i love the palistinian and here supporter shouting shame on you after e massocerringyou know twelve hundred news come of tan that that next present sotenshens are high the good news is again when you cultivate not only people who are tear supporters in the west but also a bunch of useful idiots in the last that is very helpful the your times of populated entirely by useful idiots this is how you have useful idiot shell golfer writing an entire column called it is impossible to know what to believe in this hideous war a no i actually now what to believe in who to believe in this in the hideous war rashly i actually that i love the throwing up of the has i do not know i do a ism sure mishelgulberg they know they know that if if you if you accidently finder self we gocestrip they will know to do with you becauseyour last them is golfer it turns out obviously it is too much sous just us notably or you've nick kristov we must not kill open children to try to protect israel children no one's killing got an children except for compass which is putting its children in in the way of bombs but nicholas crista again looking for that moral equivalence that very comfortable luck warm soft embrace of moral equivalent the crisis in the police is a nutty test of our humanity asking how to respond to a grotesque provocation of which there is no good remedy and in this last we in the west are not doing well the acceptance of large sell bombing of gaze and a ground invasion likely to begin suggest palsinian children are less er victims the valued by their association with about no it does not it assumes that the only way he governs take can protect its territories by taking out terrace o mudra citizens that is what it assumes that is that is literally the untirething but again that soft squishy moral relative smash everybody's favorite and then you have people who are we have been hinting at their anticenatism particular with regard israel for quite a while have she tell comes to one now everybody including me was willing to overlook his space news routine in which he suggested that of course the news where the big colonizer is in the middle eased and he basically merited all of the anti israel antisoninists antijewish nonsense that has been promoted around the left wing for years and weasand in one o his old specials and account look the other way and as i all cay whatever you know is comedian apparently he was sort of standing forkomasand of course calling israel human rights violator at one of his shows last week and bunch people walked out he suggested israel to giant human rights violator and all the rest of this and you can always count on holliwood to contribute it is bit moreonsin hollywood now all all all the best people it all of them all all your moral exemplars everybody from malisamalano who took a break from standing for abortion to stand with terrace apparently she likes dead babies across the board see got a lissmalana you have avid cross if people hassle mintage recently spotted falsifying many of his personal stories about america anti arab sentiment enemy strong who is a is far up his own rear that he a he has become totally familiar with donkcolan christen start macklamoar mark buffalo who in by the way i would trade any of these people train of the hostages and got right now at all see how they enjoy it over there ran cooler thedirector of black panther sudan surannon no shock there runimara john start who is it just ta despicable human being wandasykes rosary basin cape blanket drew airfield maharshaa all lee america former recently the star of baby waken phenix all these people signed t e letter and what is the letter say the letter says that israel must stop it must stop you must leave the terrain place they were letter to the president quote is your president we come together as artisan advocates but most importantly as human beings witnessing the devastating loss of lives and unfolding horrors in israel and palestine we ask that as president of the united states you call for an immediate deescalation and ceasefire and fossa and israel before another life is lost there is a zero mention in this entire letter of camass there is zero mention of what let off this conflict this is the way by the way that moral morons do what they do what they does they just ignore the beginning of everyway it is really it is it is it is a fun way to again escape moral culpability and the fact that you wed in fact a a fellow traveller with commas to do all of this stuff makes a really easy yous ignore what started the whole thing they doing this for twenty years come ass fires much o rockets at is rally's villain centers israel retaliate ho the violence must stop sang ghat what what let the violence if you can ignore it then you can just move right back into that warm bath of moral equivalence but here is the reality the moralcolans does not exist and guess what realities gin to you directly in the face if you continue with this nonsense the west has a choice that neither wake up or they can continue to to facilitate moral idiocy in the name of tolerance it is not just can be just pay the price for that

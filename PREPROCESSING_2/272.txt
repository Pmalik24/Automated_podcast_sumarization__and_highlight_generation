b b easy chico it is the samaritan life from i glass and will not tell you about two police investigations one of them as done inspiring well it is the detectives in it are detectives on a television show smart and resourceful and great judgment and just police at their very best the other case the same crime lots of the same facts is the opposite goes terribly and reinvestigation that goes wrong goes wrong in a very unusual way it is a game of telephone where one misunderstanding begets another misunderstanding begets another until something that is not true spreads to an entire community of people and somehow hardens into the truth and happens incredibly fast and happens in just three days and just tin on front of this the crime that going to be talking about the sour is a sexual assault if that is a trigger for you consider this warning and one f the first phone cause in this chain comes right after the crime this is back in august too thousand are a woman named shaman was standing on her balcony and see outlet supper when she got the for call was from an eighteen year old she knew name marine who told her she would ben weaken up in the night by a stranger he raped her and i you know ask her are you say and she you know said she was a can that she was going to be staying i think with er frond that night and when my husband got home i told him what it happened but i said i do not know that a happened there's something about how she said it that just made me question whether not she would actually been raped it was that told of her voice there as just know we motion it was she was telling me that she would made a manage i just made myself and chicken swine shanny felt awful doubting marine we now marine for years marine was a foster child who stay with than an her husband very briefly just a couple weeks when she was younger and that all hit it off an she stayed close with marine even after marine went to live in another foster home they hang all together cooked together they give up cars together for a few weeks shaman gloved marine she saw herself in marine they were alike and lots a was there is actually part of her doubt mark was emotional she did cry wat change if i had been mara i would have been hysterical i a been frying were used as i was actually ones is a child anna was actually assaulted has not salt and i never told for her sent meets and when i did tell some one i was hysterical ho mom in crying ad shame betchanna was wrong about marine marine had been raped who is proving later beyond a shadow of a doubt and the way her case went wrong we have all her stories about police not believing women who come forward and say that they were sexually assaulted but in this case the doubts began not with the polices but with people much closer to marine people who love her and of the best intentions towards her bet cause wrong in this case of something personal it is people exercising empathy and getting it wrong and then that mistake spreads t officials and friends and acquaintances until it is impossible for the latest to the truth even when new proof comes to light give one it is all right there in front of them a reporting today is a partnership that the martial project of propublica the first part of the story takes place mostly in pinewood washington near settle martial project investigate one reporter ken armstrong and one our producers robin simian will explain how all this unfolded strutting with can whole explain a little more about marine marine gets a l on with people she is good at it it is important to her she moved around a lot when she was a kid in the fosterage system she thinks ten or eleven different families not including group poems but she did well in a group looked forward to high school larger classes to ho can go to the beach with her friends really got into photography at eighteen she was proud of herself for surviving the foster care system got a job at coco her own

piggy lift close and on the morning of the assault piggy was the first adult married called this is piggy it was early in the morning i just left and i drove over there immediately the police were there and mark a siting in thou thing i sat down next to her and she was telling me what happened and i i got this ism a big a woman r er fan and i got just got this easy feared feel was the i felt she was telling me the script of the old la order story she was detached detached and mostly detached same what she was saying it felt that just what is this drama going on it that still there was a prime that as i gone god i mean if it is real ant o respond remember being shock and shaking and blanket the corner a they they asked me a few questions about what had happened that i had told them ad left my door unlocked in that some one had broken into my apartment and raped me again this is many she is twenty five now a quick working what she told police is difficult to hear and define not forbids here is what happened mark was home by herself she was awake all tight talking on the fountain with her expo friend jordan ah my on off the those and went to sleep a reopen my eyes and the was somebody in my house a if in his hand and the lying a mast he blindfolded me and gagged me and tied my hand fin my back he raped her he went through her staff he took pictures he knew her name mark prayed he would not kill her and then after was done with everything he said si left my door unlocked a i vessels i must have left at unlocked the slighting glass door ami just said that he was sorry and the wall looked better in his head than wont he did it to me he sat if she went to the police he had put the pictures he had of her on mine when the police arrived at marries apartment they did what she ad expect they processed the crime scene ta crime seemed technician snapped photos of the place i did not look much and eighteen year old tidy backbones apartment a sofa a bite a death topped computer on the floor in the corner the bed was unmade green comforter on the floor a messy she mire w s blindfolded interattack her worm mask there was not a real description he wore gloves to avoid finger prints he wore a condom but there was physical evidence the police got finger prints off the slighting glass door just beyond the glass door on the back port it looked some one had brushed off a dusty reeling while climbing over it police collected the bedding hoping for done maybe fibers her hearers there was a rape kit in a report noting bruising on both of mare's wrists plus other bruising in a abrasions consistent with sexual activity when police searched the apartment they found the things marine had said the man had used the knife the make shift blindfolding gag the shoelaces used to tie her up with that is when marine realized that all those things were hers to begin with the knife was from her kitchen the shoelaces came from her sneakers out in the living room piggy remembers hearing about the shoelaces and adding them to her list of things that just did not make sense an i just i just that the whole thing with the shoelace es i was lie first of all is a shelly strong enough to ti somebody is miss with for piggy this behavior if it into a bigger picture she had of her foster daughter the many was attention seeking loud you the not caring or not being aware how she was coming off in public at the grocery store writing round in grocery carts with her friends begin merely silly piggy said piggy was often telling mark tone it down be aware of how people see you piggy saw this as part of her job as a parent to teach this to many part of her and o is to be really really outrageous and to say things that make people reaction this picnic that we want on there was sodden guy that was watching her because she was being outrageously flouncy flirty and i tried to have conversation with her about tony at down little bit because you are t drawing a lot of but attention to yourself frighten i told her think it kitchen in trouble too said piggy marine calling everyone she knew and saying hey i got raped did not seem it to her she wondered was this rape story one more way to get attention many meanwhile says sure she was calling every one she knew for what she thought was a good reason i think i did that because i did not you no want to happen to anybody else i sane to let people know that there was somebody out the hurting people it was not the first time i had been raped was little on i was living with my malm i never told anybody about that stuff that had happened to me when i was a kit i just held it all in did my whole pretending stuff did not happen and don't know if that guy ever got away or and in at hurting other people cause i never told anybody never talk to anybody about it but i didn't want this time to be that i wanted to be able to try to talk about it get it out somemari was calling around and later that day or maybe it was the next morning piggy made a fond call of her own to cannon the other main adult in mare's life here is piggy i just said i do not know what the hell's going on i i cannot tell she up as lit go my god she is telling me that she got raped but but i felt i just felt horrible i felt horrible that i did not believe her and i think cannon must a just picked up on that and then she she was piggy or not the only one that does not believe her she is acting very strange she is tell in everybody about it she is call everybody that she knows and telling them this don't seem what you would do she anal remembers that fancy with piggy too well piggy also did not believe her looking bat we may have fed on each others doubts about what hid happened the day after the ride she had not held marine move out of her apartment price case manager who was helping her transition from foster cere was also there and she had says that whole day she kept noticing these things little things and each one deepened her suspicion marine would not look her in the eye she would not hug her she did not want to talk about the die instead she was giggling rolling around on the grass being flirty as she an saw it with the case manager for me the thing that we mental my doubts was she was given a a a visa card to go pick out new sheets and bedding because the police had taken them for evidence we went back to the place where she would gotten the original ones and she was furious that she could not by the same sat cause she really liked at ism thinking why would you want to have the same sheets and bedspread to look at every day wool you would been raped on this bad sat i said why would you want to have those sheets to remind you and she gas cause i liked them i just thought i was such a strange response that was the only time i saw her get mad the whole day de think you were starting to look for things that did not ring true do notknow if i was looking for them they just kept popping up i meant i flirting with the manager and rolling in the grass and giggling she had not confronted marine about what she saw as her odd behavior i did now is i told her that i had doubts about her whether or not sis telling the truth and how did she react she would get up sat and she would say ism not really a liar who what i lie about this thing here is what i thought again this is piggy piggy had her own theory for why marine might be lying about this i thought get in my mind marine got herself into trouble she got carried away with some kind of sexual encounter and she let somebody take pictures of her and now they are going to get out on the in an end she is trying to back track and maybe i did not trust the police and maybe i did not think they were understanding the nature of my daughter's personality i mean it is more a its strionicsena histrionic personality it seem her her next tactic to try to get my attention one day after the rate piggy called the lead detective on the case detective jeffrey mason she asked if she could a meet with me in person and i agreed i went to her residence met with her am she was having questions about the story that was being told wether i was a truthful or not she see yow sincere she was trying to pass on information that am and maybe maybe sincere not the the crept terminology but i mean she was just she expressed m a lot o concern m and and caring for marine but also ad a lot of questions on whether she was reporting the truth or not sergeant mason did not have a lot of experience investigating sexual fault marine was only the second or through case that he would worked on how touch went did you give piggy's opinion of marine credibility er or of the ad did the central truthfulness of what arisen had happened i gave enough wait to steer the investigation tower i need a talk to mark former was there anything thatyou were using that is evident spaced to get you to this moment of wanting to talk to her again about her credibility know sergeant mason says there were a few other elements to mark story that it cased him to question her but it was really the call from piggy that changed everything he talks to his partner in three days after the attack detective mason calls marine and they said they needed to say me and i just all the send output like my in trouble i was my first for i said anything else onto am i in trouble one of the first things she said was am i in trouble and that just well in in the twenty five years am in lonforsemen an my experience has been people to ask that or usually in trouble they combos stranger to come into the police station mason and his partner detective jerry ritard took marine back to a conference room to talk her was a very different conversation from the first time police talk to marine now it was an interrogation she says the first thing they did was tell her it spoken to piggy and the spoken to her expo friend jordan and neither of them believed her about being raged piggy was one thing but georgia was a friend he and marine spoke all the time talked about me be getting back together and he would been supportive and sympathetic about the rate marine suddenly had to try and finger out what these detectives meant the police for very closed off on telling me anything that piggy or cordon set the would not tell me anything that they said a s he wanted me to tell him and i could not a he was just ya is there any reason why he would not believe you and i said i do not know we talked to jordan and he says he never doubted marine and he never told the police he did in any case both detective throughout in their reports that marine seemed unsure of her story detective ritgarne wrote that he found marine to be making quote deceptive statements to include that she thought certain things had happened rather than she was positive this happened ricgarn noted that she did not quote take a stand and demanded that she had been raped detectives made it clear to marine they needed to be convinced years later there was an outside review of the case by a police investigator e sex crime specialist named sergeant grey grant his report said quote the manner in which she was treated by sergeant mason and detective ritard could only be labelled as bullying and coercive detective ricgarn declined to talk to us sergeant rent has review went on quote if this had not been documented in their reports i would havebeen skeptical that this actually happened the victim's credibility quote became the focus of the investigation and all of the strong evidence that pointed to a serious felony crime was completely ignored here is marine there is the really some guy out there that we need to be looking for it yo just makes us up the is start asked me all these questions in this grilling at me and i just crying i was crying and i was upset i an't understand was going on really o i just an and still an shock they did not believe me i ad was mad too at it pound my hand on the table and stuff that and the only way they'd leave me alone is is i wrote a statement saying that did not happen she did she first wrote quote i dreamed some one broke in and raped me the detectives then insisted that she recite it and not right that she had dreamed it but that she had lied there lots of reasons a victim of sex abuse might consciously choose to say something different from what happened shame fear of retribution but marine says that is not what was happening with her she started having moments where she actually could not tell if she ad been rate and i was trying to be really honest a about everything and possibly maybe i had dream that stuff that first statement may be that i had dream it up and that it maybe did not happen and stuff that and those doubts were coming out when i was talking to them and they started disbelieving me even more and then all the sudden i just started thinking i was did this did this really just happened to me an the soul thing in my mind i was second guessing somebody coming into my house and doing all this t stud is it possible that i just imagine that is why would something that happened to me i random marine describes this not being sure herself that the assault happened by an expert on sex assault drama and how it effects the brain she said that this kind of cognitive separation she called it will not comment does happened that it is directly related to the sheer shock and assault has on a person for example being awakened by a stranger with the knight and at people who have been sexually abused before marine ire it a much higher risk for this happening ad foster care to that and the risk is greater get the end of that day i was just slight to find it did all did not happen because now i have nobody that believes me is wanted to be over with marine did something familiar to her she has a way to deal with terrible things happening to her that are out of her control which she calls flipping the switch that feeling switch in side just i turned it to not really caring about the emotion ti was turn off that switch it'll have to deal with om right now just i want to get out here what is it look one you kind of decide to flit the witch and stop caring much what is that how does your demeanor change when your speaking to the police officer well ism not crying any more looking at them when ism talking to them when i think i was giggling which is something i do when ism nervous i just just pretended that din just really happen ye none when in bathroom after that and cleaned up and just con acted it was fine both detectives noticed the switch ritgarden wrote quote her visual appearance and body language became remarkably different she appeared less dressed stopped crying and even laughed a little marine wrote her final statement for the detectives at their insistence quote i made up this story she wrote to o tor not try riels polygon then would now say a woman who claim she was sexually assaulted by a stranger made up the story this new were boring one day or after remit with detectives and auto statements earlier this week the eighteen will told e sect as a man had broken into her apartment raped her and then stayed for an extended period of time but upon further questioning the woman admitted the assault did not happen detectives did not know why she made the story up at least three other stations and similar stories reporters chased it li i had to hide i i had to where let sher over my face an snake out of my apartment seer is many hosting yard the backlash was immediate marine got hate filled my space messages anglophone calls one of mare's best friends from high school put up a web site attacking marine warning people she was a lie et had the police reports with the statement head written about making up the store it had her name and her picture for marine it was too much police did not believe her her foster mams did not believe her and it was all over the news it felt the world had turned against her and remember she was eighteen years old trying to figure this out she wanted a lawyer and she hade sports sister that could have helped her find one she lived in her own apartment but it was subsidized by a non profit that helped than waters marine transition out a foster care project latter it was call they taught life skills how to usocredic cart how to shop for groceries they were there to give her a hand she asked them to help her find a lawyer instead her case manager called the police who told him there was no evidence that a rape had occurred they did not get her a lawyer then they set o chlordan to go to the place stationican to tell them that your going to tell him that really did happened to be honest when they got to the station detective mason the lead detective in her case was not there he was out that day detective rickgarn grabbed another cop to help out here is marine i told him that i wanted to recant that it really did happen they should be out there looking for a rapist rickgarn did not believe her the other cop did not know the case and which his following ricgarn's lead marine says one of the detectives told her that if she kept insisting she was raped she might have to take a polygraphtest he told me that a i took a li detect er test and it came back that i was lying that he was going to take me to jail himself using a polygraph on a rape victim is a mistake a big enough one that the federal government can withhold money from states if their police departments do it detester seen as a deterrent to women coming forward to report sexual assault cluster famously unreliable especially on some one whose aromatized rickgarn's reports as it was actually marine who brought up the polygraph not the cops but what is not in dispute is that once the idea of a polygraph came up detective rickgar used to to threaten marine its detective police use when there interrogating some one they suspect in a crime detective rickgarn told marine that if she failed the polygraph he would rest i men she lose her housing assistance n get jail time well that scared ma side in want do that an sales can ever mind early did not happen ani want go to jail that night the project later managers call the meeting it was just an emergency meeting and he don't tell anybody why in tell everybody got there this is elizabeth another farmer faster cad in the project later program she was there at the meeting along what is nine or see others muley girls and the program managers sitting in chairs in sell marine remembers that is the louis mama of this hoarded thou in time she thought about fireside tan here is elizabeth a marine sit a an she is crying and she said that she had lied about what had happened to the group to the group a everybody i mean it just felt she was just forced just say that and that it was she i mean there was nothing in in her words or actions that she meant i mean it was more of if defeat is what it sounded just kind of giving up of trying to prove herself she just seemed eff estate and lost actually sounds really confusing from mere perspective were you wondering why's she being made to say this i mean i i really was cause i did not i did not know her and i i mean it first i did not really know what to believe its just kind of an odd thing to say oh while i made it up i think make my own personal experiences kind of came through when i when she said that and and i kind of what kind of personal personal experiences i have i mean i ah was sexually assaulted and i mean ah being afraid of of saying anything n an and the not having anybody believe you and then just kind of trying to forget about it i guess trying to re you move on move on ye elizabeth felt for marine she says the were a couple others who looked they did to but they were in the minority mainly marine says people are angry there pretty bad about it one of the girls she was calling me and making a threats at me thought i was a letter and basically mental you for making up something that i spoke to one of the meetings angry girls she did not want to be interviewed but she told me she thought marine had lied and it did make her mad but she also said and elizabeth told me this too there is something obvious and transparent about the premise of the meeting was a message to everyone we are making her tell you this none of you think about doing it if you do you will lose your housing elizabeth described the woman running the meeting as a fuming we reached out to the project later managers but they never replied elizabeth stuck by marine and one other friend frundwise that was about it elizabeth says marine was avoided the plague ya i mean that is exactly how it was people treated her she was they could not get far enough away for her a people they were very cruel to her of course the phone calls and nasty sufferance from media i mean i i even believe when we would walk through the parking lot or we would go somewhere somebody would say something er calling her or doing just a lot of really horrible staff i mean i even remember reading one of the comments on the it was it was on the entries but i do not remember what exactly page it was or anything that this bitches the reason that nobody believes when women say they get rat well yah i mean there was a lot of that even henna who meant the world to marine she told marine that she could not spend the night at her house any more because her husband worried she might make up a story about him and if all that weren't enough about a week later marine received a summons in the mail police were charging her with false reporting the false reporting charge an the mark's rape case would be officially closed the physical evidence police had gathered at the scene was do strayed except for a single finger prank card that was left behind everything else the rape get the bedding the danaslabes they were never even tested in a krimlat never analyzed further evidence that could have been gathered severest two months after marine was charged with false reporting season was sitting at home watching the local news with her husband when on came a story about a woman in parkland another settle suburb who reported being raped by a stranger who broke in threatened her with the knife you shoo laces to tie her up and who took pictures and threatened to post them on the inner net right away i thought i won she id i id back told happened she was right cause this is too similar i immediately wen in and called the kirkman police department and ask to speak to the we detective on the ripe case and i explained the whole situation about what had happened to marine and that the linen police did not politer but it was just too similar and it did just happened i asked them to call the lipoid police then he got back to me and said he did talk to them but they had determined that she had made the whole thing up in the case was closed and that was it and was over i talked to the li detective that she hand spoke to and to another kirkman detective on this case both remember talking to the liquid pee but when they learned the lipoid police did not poleaxe their victim that was at they did not look any further one detective said she figured the lipoid police knew their case best she trusted their judgment even one thing they both told me they were surprised by was that the in word police had gone far as to charge marine with false reporting one detective remembers hanging up the phone thinking oka hope that works out for you guise shaman grew up in a police family she usually figured police knew best not this time i was upset id i thought there should have been more investigation that it was just too similar she amen thought something had to be done she thought mare should get in touch with the firkin police herself she told marine if it did happened then here is a second chance to go talk to the police about what d happened to you because this just happened to another woman that she would not go and that than mad me doubt again why would not you want again involved to try an prove that she was innocent marine did not wanted talk to anybody else about the rape especially not police again the very thought terrified her what she wanted more than anything was to put this behind her in march of two thousand nine seven months after she was raped marine went to court to except o plea deal on her false reporting charge under the deal to get the charge draped she would need to meet certain conditions for a year she go on supervised probation pay five hundred dollars in court costs and she get mental he's counseling not for being raped but foraying about it i not the was burn was about two police investigations of the same crime the second investigation were the police do a stunningly great job in a minute when a program continues this march lie from o glass to day's program anatomy of doubt we are the story of two criminal investigations one goes great on goes about as badly as i possibly could we now turned to these successful investigation it happens in a suburb of denser called golden colorado the we detectives in this second case were very experience versistly detective in the first case when we had done one or two other rape cases this was stated earlier but it'll just repeated here the contenplaty's program probably is not right for little kids here kenarmstrong and robin simian two years later canary two thousand eleven detective stay galbreath got a case a grad student midtwentieth had been actually assaulted in her home rape did got point to covers tracks her attacker took her sheets with him an made her shower to wash off any dean and when she went to interview the victim detective galbreath said the victim remembered an unusual number of details about the guy way more than any other rate victim she talked to before the victim had basically chatted him up and he told her things he spoke four different languages and she was able to can rattle off a few of those he travelled a lot he talked about math he told her that he has no problem with finding girl friends or having girl friends i that he jest doesn't the consent lastnect the girlfriend relationship the victim had a good guest of his height and wait i knew that he had a distinct mark on his leg a birthmark she told detective maltreat the size and shape of an egg he had a camera with him and she remembered the color and brand of the camera she described it as a pink money detective galbreth noted that the victim was not crying should not seem upset she was very can a stoic hin her report of this incident you could even say she had more of a flat affect actually was there anything unusual about the very unusual typically i mean i encounter somebody say in the hospital or on a seeing that i crying upset much more i would say visibly aromatized than than this victim was she talk about this guy and the horrible my word is horrible things that he did to her for a number of hours and in relation to other victims they probably would have said horrible they would have band ism revealing the horrible side of the things that they would don she i remember we were walking outside for some reason i do not know why we were outside and she was talking about an that he was a gentleman a calm mild maned nodi just reemerges thinking how can any one after this happen call his person a gentleman detective galbreath at this point had worked dozens of rape cases maybe fifty she admitted she did not totally get her victim but that it did not get in the way of her investigating the crime detective galbreath talked to her husband about the case that night and her husband a police officer in another town remembered a case just it in his department in westminster the detective galbreath contacted westerns repeat the next morning to look at their case file details mist identical the lead detective on that case tan a hinder shot says there was one striking connection in my assault make victim was the victim of a theft also of a pink son caber shot camera that was stolen from her and ism stay knew that herd victim was pholdographt using a pink son caber shot camera detective tender shot also said there was a third rate in another town near by which made them think their could be a serial offender the the departments did something that does not always happen with different police departments they started meeting working together each department had come up with some kind of tracery ane associated with their victims not the definitive kind that can positively idea suspect but not nothing either the samples were tested for similarities and the results showed that they were connected paternally meaning a three dona samples had to be the same guy or men in the same family about five weeks and to detective stay gallrests of investigation there is a big meeting federal state and local investigators er there and a fourth local department too and in that meeting some one new to the group a female crime analyst stands up she done a search for suspicious vehicles in the vicinity of an attempted rate detective undershot says at the very end of the meeting she happens to mention just the group knows i came across this most e true that was near this crime seen just the group know what when stay here is that stack's wait a second what did you say i tell him is said that is a truck on on our surveillance radio that was not very relevant until right now it just all came together one second it was just at detective stay galbreath had only seen the truck on a fuzzy surveillance radio but this analyst had the make model and lichen's plate those registered to a guy named markoleary detective undershot always reluctant to get two ahead of herself remembers thinking well that is a pretty big piece of evidence potentially but they needed now was a dona sample for markoleary to see if it tied him to the crimes of buy agents stake out mark's house the plan was to wait for m delete then they would split up have a few agents follow him while others put up surveillance cameras outside his house while he was got hen mark leaves his house agent's trail what they did not know is that mark learn had a brother who lived with him in the same house the guy they were following was not mark at all but is slightly younger similar looking brother when other agents go to the apartment and nock on the door expecting it to be empty the shocked when mark answers the agents think quickly say their informing people in the neighborhood about a burger even have a flier with a phony suspect foot to show the conversation ends marks inside meanwhile mark's brother is eating in a diner and when he is done agents sudden to get dona off his glass which brings them closer to their answer but still not all the way there because while done from the brother does link the brothers family line to the crimes does not tell them which brother committed them here is detective galbreath this point warlike crap it could be either one really we need at see the lag of both of em for a birthmark they need to see that birthmark two days later detective galbreath in our team go to mark's house and mark comes to the door and we have weapons out i tell him that we are search worst for the house and i pat him down to make sure does not have any weapons he is got roe baggy clothes on when he comes out and when ism pat him down and lifted at both pant legs i saw the mark which you think we sold the work he is he is the guy ne needed to be in handcuffs he was a very surprised he went almost blue she arrested him gallery says it is the most satisfying case she ever worked on when the police searched the house they found so laces and other bindings lock picking tools a gun the pink son camera and stowed away in the back of an amplifier underwear he collected from his victims also computers hard drives them drives media cares which produced hundreds of images photos a victims detective gaubreth went through them all their pictures of women from the towns and colorado and a picture of another i woman with it washington drivers license on her chest that was gagged and bound it was marine this thinking thank god i do not have just an unknown victim here that i may never know who she is i know who this is let me ism thinking he probably did that as a form of intimidation to her i know who you are it'll have your name in your addrassan but it helped as actually detective gaubreth contacted the liquid p d hoping to wrap up their case she had the case file facts to her but what she remembers is the cover page of that facts which read false reporting my heart sunk and i was shocked i was you was word because i knew the was wrung after police filed their false reporting charge against marine march dearie went on to rape at least four other women the three women and colorado plus the women he raped in the little suburb near marine he pleaded guilty to five or apes and over twenty other felonies he was sentence to over three hundred years in prison and a pose sentencing interview with police he admitted locking victims over time sometimes breaking an entering an the weeks before an attack to plan and make sure a woman who was living by herself did navadag he also said he knew police departments were not great talking to one another he planned his attacks deliberately indifferent cities in march two thousand and eleven two years after partook a pile deal for following a false police report she got a visit from the head of the liquid poise criminal investigations division commander steep rider who riveted in no told me who we were they asked if i had somewhere quiet this cud you know talked me en i just remember it not none what ism going to say as much as i i thought about this moment i dodo not i don't i say this do not new the words i use they said they found the gat they have this little piece of evidence they said that they had found a picture and the picture they foul was with my idea and i just broke down they paid me back the five hundred dollars and told me that they were to get my record expunged dis she just looked tendon we were tendon who was he was hard i did not really say much after that i just i did not really have much to say after they told me that they were just we are sorry where deeply sorry about what it happened to you did not mean much to me at all sergeant jeffrey mason the lea detective in the case and thought about marines case in years he was sure she would lied we just moved on and then he got a for call telling him that a serial resist had been arrested in colorado that marine had been reaped by this man that marine had been telling the truth yes is drive into my office it is one of us times that you are not enough for get it was shocking the oh this has been a the one thing then yow right seriously step back in oh question that u i shoe continued to in at undoing marine requested a personal apology for mason and she got one in the same police station were two and half years before she had been interrogated as a criminal suspect instead of treated as a rape victim marine says he seemed sincere and ashamed he rubbed his head he looked a lost little puppy as how she puts it and then there were she in in in piggy the two adults who muttered the most memory as at tea nature they are both still in her life to day the sheshenin it was very complicated join he'd caught in at the same moment knowing that it did actually happened that she was equally brat and nobody believed her as pesky the people in her life that ad been supporting er and had been taking care of her and trying to men to her and help her and we did not believe her and i told her that i did not i did not ane is it was sorry over the for that i wanted to yo would imprison she came up and we went for a walking it is to her shoulders an i a one a look in your eyes and tell you from the bottom of my part an sorry i do not in to la to believe you an we an support you and she said that was okay it may be come again and i was just short that she who people leave to forging for that was it was such a huge thing went on for long that worst horrible part of this whole thing for me is that i did talk to the police and i regret that of course this is piggy cannon and piggy have thought a lot about what happened and the rolling it they doubted mare because of something normal and human they trusted their intuition about some one they knew really well it is hard not to do that they ha had got feeling that was round but felt utterly trip the drama works and complicated ways he cannot tell if some one was raped but how they are acting they can be subdued and detached but they can also be hyper and laughing then go back and forth sometimes they tell no one what happened sometimes they tell a lot of people sometimes they are not sure if they a sal actually happened it this point piggy knows that but even now she cannot shake the feeling she had that letter to call place in the first place obviously we she had not but on the other hand either as all these other other things i mean the police and the way that marine was acting an men i i she on some level needs to take responsibility for that too ism sorry but that is true and what you mean she she needs to realize at some point and i think she does now that i he i hate to say this but ism i mean can now is on sound really bad ism blaming the victim it some one n the way that she was acting was part of the reason why it had the outcome that at did and i am not the only person that did not believe her that also it sounds everyone who as doubting er did not have much information about the way that rapetroma conjunction and is this about the way that she acted well it should not be about the way that she acted but i unfortunately the reality is that that did influence an tat at sounds really harsh for me to say that it is not her faults because i think it is a totally a product of what she went through but on the other hand i d i do not know what she does now is that she never expected her feelings to derail an entire place investigation she mad place let that happen detective mason takes full responsibility for what happened command a writer mason's boss head of the criminal investigation's division calls marine case quote a major feeling on his department things of often he says the detectives should never have given piggy's call the weight they did the find would police departments own internal review of the case said the same the reports at the call quote calls the detectives to change their focus towards investigating the victim for false reporting no one was disciplined in the case marine sued lyndwood in its police officers and wont upsetting for a hundred an fifty thousand dollars she also sued the project latter managers and the non profit that oversaw project latter cocoon house cocoon else issued o statement at the time saying quote our hearts go out to marine in her family we strongly believe that cocoon house in its implores acted appropriately on behalf of the client the client meaning marine cocoon house settled the lawsuit roses her conclusion and her advice to any woman who wants to report a sexual fault bring proof i just thank that all of the facts and everything needs to be laid out that they cannot go back and find something did not tell the i know bat you are not on trial i know houri ism orally sure how to answer that just just seems that is how everybody is

young people who believe intensely in democratic ideals and yearned deeply for the basics normal elections free speech and are assembly though just in chelas feel weeks since we got to hon long we watch the situation changed dramatically it is gotten much more violent harshly measures by the government this hour we have the story of the change that we witness what we think it might mean if you have not been following the story at all may be been setting this one outwork in a catch you up on what you need to know we have all sorts of people from all sides of this that we want you to me he be as chico its this america life this wee over sees with a lot of people w have some very america values stay with us on the cursed generation e case o what politicize thousands s thousand people this

maybe its hundreds of thousands or years to for starters connivers twenty two which mans she is part of a special generation an hong long an for i hong sonny nice i sea right before the hind over and here is a protestor were calling alive and ism foin in nineteen ninety seven here is her friend t a long tiffin ism also boy nine ninety seven you can collie you and i born an nineteen ninety seven nineteen ninety seven i a year when honor was headed over back to china for the brutish he a lis just pause on these twenty two yearolds for a minute for some quick history as you may are may not know honking sits on the edge i main land china i and was a brutish colony for a really long time starting in the nineteenth century and the finally nineteen ninety seven the brutish got out he handed it over to china and the idea was these can be a fifty year transition period after fifty years china wild fully be in charge but during that fifty years hon long would be a democracy now ho cold people o to union to that is the last brutish governor of hang long during the hand over ceremony in nineteen ninety seven that is the comes and that is the unshakable destiny and to be queer honking had not been a democracy under brain but they're going to transition towards it of we bunch of years and the hope was after fifty years in twenty forty seven the chines government let them stay a democracy which it the time did not seem a crazy idea chine was opening up in all kinds of ways there was not square how this was on to layout and at the end of the day after fifty years in the our twenty forty seven china was going to be able to do whatever it wanted in hon on these are the children born the year that cock started ticking and if you heard of the phrase curse generation yes sir it whats is job amity nineteen i seven people it was he was pretty much a joke or pretty much a funny thing to us was wen we firs joke about at at fairly pro a schools but at has dragon es just foin joking our all those years i registry the joke had to do with the coincidence they were curse cause of some weird bad lock during some big childhood milestones say went through together the year of their kindogarden graduation the says virus had honking and city shut down graduations were cancel six years later when he should have had their elementary school graduation same thing happen again but a swine flew and genital remembers that a friend joke the when they graduated high school it was going to be a bola and that is when they started using the word cursed i think that was the time around the time the ja a rain well reporter and the cist child ye many of us alter the curst a always say that we r the chosen the as hirepote was to shows hit all of us let his mote we always a were the chosen when we have to face something byshowin er life or we are the curst to on we have to facesomtin at or face something significant genies says i chosen one side of things did really kicking till their senior year of high school terms twenty fourteen they were seventeen the seventeenth year since the hand over and the your people on hon conger still expecting that marlin china was going to let them start holding full on elections with they could choose their own waiters as promised back in nineteen ninety seven and that year china announced it was not on taka glad to a movement called the umbrelamivemen handed by young poteen ages we worked to politics in this publischool classes that all these twenty two year old talk about is being instrumental on he thinking classes the began part of the hand of er call liberal studies classes ut explained among other things promises of nineteen ninety seven hen the rights as honor cities ens t for t street molten for the first time demanding the road carrying umbrellas thousands of people in a vast procession down the street and pro testmovement that was almost entirely peaceful and they let did not get the boat after three months the protest ended alive works for a moth national company in an entry of a jaw about a college she is management trains she was she went to some protest back then out a solidarity with her peers i was just amazed by the other students but she de many get all the politics a change his tune when on long introduced the bill that would allow gangland china to extradite people from hong long to be tried and punished in china under chines law this was sene is a new and very menacing en coachmen on the rights of hong long citizens since intern ninety seven they have been ruled by hong long gas and hon long courts everybody's presumed innocent with the rights we know in most democratic countries now anybody could get thrown into the prisons and courts of communist china i say that that that was the time when i first feel awaken when ism truly understanding what happening when i first go to the much of the no extradition bill and i was very very emotion nail at that time because there is only around seven million people an hong long that one million soon the street with the same de most with the same wish as hoping hon con to remain it is current day whetting honking to stay like it is with its on laws separate from china a week later too many people came out at the time i was killing very on my go is is touching likewise feeble united and then the next second the germen just declares that oh we heard your voice that were we will be continuing on the bill on today that was a really big contest and in the morning you see how peaceful things we that and i you see to polis coming out and stopped brutally hitting people i was i it was really and forgettable to me because that was the first time when i witness with my real ahihsdat the polisitis chasing people they are chasing students who did not do anything and stopped to bid them and arrest then other twenty the year old also told us how radicalizing its ban to see place her messing and beating peaceful protesters and this point i understand this before we got to hong long a lot of the emotion driving the protest it is just about the police because the government is departing them to do such things and there is no penalty pal them even if they are doing things that are completely and susceptible to every one beef course nobody knows the this is gong to we by twenty forty seven when china fully takes of her hong long but for genifering lots of other people her age things were starting to feel pretty minis was on con going to become just any other chines city run by the communist when your fifty what do you pick sure life here will be i can take chum that i will be superdepress cause i supervise common on political thine i really cannot imagine the day that i cannot speak freely on internal that wiping i have that freedom of speech anymore and i cannot imagine that that will coma day me an my francs commenting on the gamesmen wild become e crime and you think that would happen yes i do when lie all the things that is happening manage human now especially i will say in wheres sin tan shins can what is happening inti yon will happen hon on shestaking about in turfman camps

surfifin in the society we we look for rights and freedoms and human rice but the mina china they ignore all those things they just think having a staple life having kits having food a good place to live it is already happy enough yet and the change she says she seeing it now in hon on she is upset et all the manlanders moving there in her neighborhood and university student said sh an her friends in cautery college many man under she says i i i just feel really we was i i am rowing rain hon con a goats a local school tut then i have tod be surrounded my alter menders as a bather you to

is over a million calenders since nineteen ninety seven rule forty five thousand a year but stopping to because i do not know how your feeling about gender but this was a point we came to in a few interviews with these twenty two year old when you got them under the subject of mainland's get ready for a wave of totally bigoted opinions i especially i live in new her series a the people surrounding you here rendering and then you start to see those last educated people they squatting next to streets i did witness and mind lands lady having her children pe at the roads and i always here tan then people yell long shouting out for nothing in them all and i always they jump into the lying everything to bother me flat squatting what he means squatter and i do not know they just they just squat on the roads to waiting people hey just didn't equation and wait your nothing they can what for an hour peep went on con don do that we do not has who was what at the road why you don't us start we you conscious seat they wore comfortable it it just does not look good it does not look good it just look civilized for all the alarm the gender in the first generation feel about the future the parents re often not is alarmed about china taking more control of on con a about what the islands going to be in twenty forty seven i titan's parents they hate her going out to protest every pecan may ho our parents they li we really has some were sinless fight and they they think wed just china take over hon long it all be fine i tho our parents soothe all our geteaton just do not been a they are not ready enough to open up their eyes an see what is actually going to happen they just seel they then not the anything wrong a my ten not the anything wrong an e thin fine it is calling about this for tifhany is that she feels she is being the responsible one fighting for everybody's future and they are telling her not to protest she was maybe of for parents had done this themselves years ago things would not be bad to day li i twenty two years ain't the pass we lost danger they've never stood up li us all fight i asked the as a what they are promise in not have the serenity is funny when you talk about it you your madam your parents a i just feel li i mean i do not understand why they will not want the rights o why they do not think that som bat is goo to happy in the next fifty years if any in gender and many others they have count have given over the lives to protested they work during the week protest on the we and hey say there aren't much time in the lives for muchelves bout it is interesting is they nothing is going to work most of interview is told us that they do not think china going to give in again here is gander i am pretty much pessimistic actually an do wish that one day we old the see we wan on do when crank con combe now i just do not see away out i it is been three months we've been trying each and everysthat we have broke into the let static counts we have more than a thousand people got arrested tut the government is still trying to ignore all of this if if you feel pasimestic about the results why a still girl why you stop going out every week an at least the government see that we are not that how do we say we we are not that obedient we have to continuously tell the government that we are not satisfied with what they are giving o we have to do it again here is juice i think even we if we have to lose we need to were are true thoughts in history will we need to at the people behind as knows that with tried twenty forty seven is coming and this a very grand thing to say but many of these cursed generation kids feeling they have a special destiny hale revere to speak to us through an interpreter she's from my protestor builds barricades it is been rested om one to to ho one no got the con is at the high whole i think were a shy lucky o betas we grow up with people who told the same way and we realize that when we turn fifty its the end of our freedoms twenty to now and i imagine that when om twenty five fasteraty half away until the bomexclots o and if we dare not do any things i by the time we are fifty years old it would be awful i do not want our children to have the same battle and then when were i people look back in and thing that we don't do in of our birthday is a count don to the end and more than other people at you my generations we have it dun y a onto do more pul see only o seemincome again here is genifrem if we were born early a probably i would become my tatami and if i were one later i would probably we come those little kiss became mentoring better than continues i am happy that i am morning ninety ninety seven we are in the needle we have the chance to know what

region as well the newspapers sad accounts of six of them beating up a middle age man kicking and shouting at i this she fire to it subway station they do that a lot this lots of protests the common subway the em t a colludes with police that like genitor prefers the bus have not less convenient every protestor we interviewed supports the violets they supported because they feel they have no other options that is the only way them get the government to respond to them f you told us back in tune they march peacefully against the extradition bill got nothing then they got violent and the bill was withdrawn it worked a violence is become away to defend themselves setting fires and building barricades slows police who were coming after them they support the violence are they lase understand it manual talked to the about that were t at three of our shell an civil disobedience here is manual when i started asking protestors about violence a couple of them said we are not violent america our tolerance for it as much lower getting to this point to being o k with violence is in something we did lightly and allow of them explained to me that they i noways think radical tactics for oke what change their opinion was the way police responded to peaceful protest that being shot out with water canes cur last seeing them in knocked unconscious beaten of the tans hin coffee and kicked groups of thugs beating and attacking people with hammers clubs and knives watching all this and being subjected to it that is what got a lot of people on board with violence now some protestors through a molatov cocktails thendelins buildings and chase police is sticks and rods ire and i talked with one protestor you en do you think would be acceptable to the protestors to kill police i hope they do we do i do if police died what do you think what happened next we will die too poles sol i to and if things get that violent between the protestors and the police and protestors are being killed do you think hon long will get democracy i conto at the molwogs many people we talked with expected some one to die a protestor or police officer most thought it would help the movement put pressure on the government this has not happened yet but destruction and violence are giving way to bazaar scenes throughout the city my coworker dial and i went to this protest in them all when a many and honor sometimes t entire city can feel one giant shiny shopping m a connected by someway the stores are all open them all is full of people that not many people are shopping the entire premiss of this protest is to go to them all and not shop the mall is five s tore each tear has railings that look out over a central atrium they are families kids older folks some people are in black others are just in the regular dailies they chant they seen the protestor an them glory to hon con over and over at one point some onestartaining out paper n soddenly hundreds of people are folding paper cranes then enact of gentle vandlesem there is the machine that prince our reservation reseats for the restaurant call jade garden the protestors high jacket forcing it to spit out hundreds over states they tape the receipts together and string them from one end of the atrium to the other and back again a few times they target jade garden because one of the companies founders has a daughter this supports basing that is how far things have gone an hon con there missis are label t either yellow or blue yellow for the ones that support the protestors blue for the police and government there is even a guggle map that tells you if the business is one or the other soon things in the mall start to shift dial and i watch a group of about a dozen protestors enter a pooching bakery owned by the same company that own shade garden they start taunting the staff i at baa that i blacks e a deli e a a i a nap a ya a a was the was a manage the a a a we before things can early any further the workers force the protestors out close the storeys and barricade themselves in a restless energy takes over it is the protestors are looking for something to con front something to de stern but the thing their finding against is the eccestential thread of china and that is not really in them all they march to more pooching business is in them all the alarm starts going off and i p announce went see the mall is very crowded please be careful then word comes police or on their way an some mood that feels a mix of fear and a denalan fills the space notes tors begin to build barriers tat whatever not nail of the ground blocking doorways prating opposticles they on stop the police from entering from the someway and france of them all it is bothering case cans down thasplaters e group rips the six foot to screen out of a wall to use the part of the blockade the p announcement remains the same these be careful the mall is very crowded they open an emergency fire hose someone brings giant jugs of oil which they add to the water the tile floor of the mall lobby is now a little lake that police will have to cross a woman slips and falls and while all this destruction is happening the shoppers the older folks even if we families they do not love there on the upper levels of them mall looking over the railing the watching a sporting event or something

smoking gas off through n be work and many in pardon one of the malls of the levels giant statues of lines and copermenpati along with dozens of shoppers and protestors and lying out door balconies all watch the confrontation between police and protestors in fold below m there is ta thing that protest or say to each other never seventies sometimes the even say never tater ties even if there and new clear explosion thecetly if another protestor does something you disagree with say last something on fire heed som one up he do not criticize them or cut them off my coworker dial saw an extreme

here lot really allow to all to the press peters retired but still very connected to the for before the family all sat down together i asked peter to get together with me and my producer manual i had not seen him since i was twelve back then people call me young which means fisher because the canines to fish sounds western a you and because i was fact i will not recognize you on the street i will not i will not her sirs after o e all right i i guess as a compliment that es we recon i have is were a fat as a kid i liked peter he take time of work to stop y during recess and bias chips another snacks my friend jonathan would have his burthen parties at the police station which we loved big barbecue or the policemen around peter was the cool that people in hon con trusted even revealed the police fact then one of the most popular o the shows was a cop show shorten steer were the police for heroes new peter's her is gray now he is tall athletic he plays tennis by my nickname in tennis i soft know why by nankin tennis the federal better better meter roger eaten i don't now why maybe my skill ananototonewhir ester likes is that jokes i cannot imagine peter ever doing what have been seeing in these videos eating up unarmed protestors kicking people on the ground i thought surely he would object to some of those things and that his views would be complicated from what you have seen in resent months has open anything that the police o on tat you think you would disagree with nothing is perfect be s as a ho in general i seen the pours at doing don a pretty good jo if it is in a the police force in other countries i just look at the varsities look look just look at the column of fatal numbers it will not it will not be zero i asked him about different situations to police having criticize as g i even show him videos of police brutally arresting people things i think are clearly wrong but he always seems to have a justification for the way police behave he says young judging the police pas on what you see in these clips that is not fair you do not know what the officer was ratings the social media only show the part the police hiding people but one minute a go they bet a check by loss of people one minute later the great to to the to the mob in attacking them hat you can see is one minute after but you deed not see the full picture he is not conflict set about police and he is not very sympathetic to protestors he this the protest of destroying hong hong the expedition of this o ka he does not think china pul and free sfeecion hong on and protesters fer of china is way overblown and i eve hon con be par of china come on big up people big up i sis the far where the china is good or bed hon con is par of china if you do not it those people waving the nests fag waving the you din neck far if inland ties to oven goo t you in goo inland in go to order good califonia ego go if from into deco it'd already been worried how this family conversation was going to go hearing what peter believed did not help peter told me he understands that jonathan goes the protest but does not ask him about it because he does not want any details jonathan said he does not ask his tad what he thinks of the way police beat in you gas protesters for the same reason it is if he says something she ever something that complete does extend to me i brings him down in as s as a person it just i would the uses yet not not who i thought he was i in it let gas you tell think that can be ye come this family does not talk about the protest at all tennis yes sacker yes pat great but no politics till to night this agreed its to had the conversation they been avoiding after thins jonathan'smarn hours or wachesst the dishes he i recognize the song right away ism surprise she is homing an in front of peter its the protestors new anthem glory to hong hangs than is on jonathan sine was she works with lawyers including som in the protemocracy camp it i ask if peter knows what that song is she says maybe yo in go that is kind of how its been going between her and her husband no real discussion but the occasional passive egress comment while they watching the news or some passive a pressie coming during dishes this is another reason jonathan avoids bringing up the protests he does not want to stor the fight between his parents a worth worse scenario be som i moving out i guess yo because the consented any more ye i i guess living apart would be the worse case henry i believe just that bi sort of and officially means that you no longer to get u yo that cold be his man or his that or him we all sit at dinner table i do not know why they agree to talk about this maybe just because have known them for long an i ask or i hope maybe part of that wanted to talk and i was just a good excuse peters facing me and jonathan and altar are next to me you no jonathan has their talk hokey am not of the mongol character on his lag i tiger am point the conversations tong es with all of them saying in different ways it is fine that we do not talk about this we all have mutual respect in wet the metal respect the are till o evil instead of talking to each other or looking at each other the talking to me or looking at the dag it feels all very careful proper and calm or this continues for half an hour then everything changes when peter uses the word on compromise aid compromiser call he hi compromise tit basically the government line rings that is what honor's chief executive carry lamp says that the protestors should stop protest thing and after that the two sides can talk mi ataghan an jonathan hear that is meaning the protestors should back hour they both lay in sir peter tell a sera yards range compendia ran i tomato eaten tat a a saliva jonteincin do o alpha says the police a the once who need a change they have to calm the situation peter says the police are doing the dhobi do not know why when the police ares people for fighting or breaking stuff is treat us heard it is a legal sell a rested no pro a people a an the bodycoa go gob tanvacabody of false an jonaphan says of yes arrested tut how much forced us the place need to use sometimes the person just asks the police a question and they still get a rested or beaten o people who are already on the ground neon subdued they still get beaten w a than peter does not respond ts then they argue openly argue for the first time about one of the protesters man the monssomething the government refused to much one star and independent investigation into police behavior consider a but be tore dilated e the peter keeps repeating the same thing over and over heaven back in to a corner that there is no need for independent investigation now's on the right time ma o tho as a forty tatsograsy a the she cad already has a system in place or who investigate complaints about the police coming which ill on you on my to to to d they talk a little longer but it does not go anywhere lava tells me later she had other things she could have brought up but the sided against it she did not want her husbands a few traps the word she used was say a which translates as that corn no place to go preserving the family was more importance to her than trying to win an argument later jonaphan told me he still loves his that but he is given up hope that his father could be a reasonable human being at least when it comes to the police when i staugtsof this i was kind of me i thought may be jonathan and his mother and father people who actually want to understand each other could talk about this in a productive manner in that if they could maybe they was hope that the rest of us could but now i do not have a lot of cane is normal reporter for the be which we what show the pus at five shot to china what about you the people living in poncing who have no problem of china who china this at of them and they hold their own demonstrations which are pretty small far

ant them get the to see old y e i t a i it is a little shaky the guy leading it told me he just learn the words a couple weeks ago most of the people here best as i can tell are not manlanders who grew up with the anthem one they talked to were all from condone being this into china is new for them something that only happened when the protest got bad end that they found themselves rallying around this new flag and it is not always comfortable am getting on the boat with dance the guy who was raping about being tries when someone puts a heart cheep staedrinaa the say is not a shiny i i is i ilia yes ten a i feel the fringy about this a we i lis i to tat hat company you not e e yer tot that test get t red whin t h crazy on box of the honconcrotest fer first to being pro china stairs is blue for the government and yellow for the protesters dance almost did not come this morning actually it is not really his seen he sees being this patriotic about china is kind of donkey moreover el ways mu friends wen there on o i in china it course there is a nothings in china that a i can a sat if i was wo e torso it in china the two things he panic see that we end of talking about are the lack of free speech and sensors access to the inner anatomy but the truth is i given honor and i get to remain my almost on chat freedom with when my years and is such as sweet hot do to hon con people and waited out to him that after twenty eight years it is very possible those freedoms would disappears free and he had the same response that i heard from other people who do not the protests us he was well sure of maybe we i yes si you talking me to to we she the to e us pes pet i but ta a but in the change for the freedom that the fie for the recon have it and there the train long over and we and the balance is not worth it year if i pul a shoos between this if chaos i e most a on order i fly to sacrifice if we in the sin much ace we would have in ho to i less at the t this is unacceptable the whole a login times eyes revolution an the have the the o on ones comply unacceptable i will give up the freedom the the way they do in china to sakis it is a big cham from i could never live in china too i would sacrifice my freedom just get the start the intensity of the protests and his frustration was what here experiencing in the city have driven him that least try on this extreme idea angel's party marksman fans he lived in the last for twelve years he s a foot ruffian ready for the chico bears as he likes the relations ancients he says he was not politically involved in for all best wen to one of the big peaceful protest last bring maria watch than to peticipaon but that changed one day when he was watching alive stream of the young protestors storming the legislative council uncles he was surprised how ferocious they seemed sow even the police officers looked a little scared that at that moment i somethey realms we truer close to the revolution that could happen just never occur to me the hon con with go through that this both stun and ansirey about an know ans did think things can change abruptly if the resent a revolution this can a force to hand of the chines government to crack down on it violently o and that anything can happen but i i could lose all the privilege i have is on coincides protection of communal freedom oft speech but also freedom just speech protected by common law and nobody that enjoy these freedom but if the gest two my a if it gust trust to important we can lose all of these privileges which our treasure he woke up the next morning to see that the covering was wall to wall about police brutality to dance it seems every one was leaving out the fact that the protestors had started at which seemed deeply unjust to the police and tan that when the tot at the turning blue when the when i felt that the police we me unfairly i to by si i chose to be on the police sit other people sited against the protest for different reasons e big one i heard was the destruction they cause the security guard told me he had to transfer four times to get home one night because of somewayshot downs he women trying to get cash out of an team that had been destroyed by protesters said if you rat of the government take it out on the government there only hurting people me a man said to me sadly hong long is our home why are they destroying yet the crowd on the boat finish belting out the national and on the second time when suddenly every one rushes to the realize everyone crammed together on one side in a position that a little precarious that kind of angel's were and right now he felt pushed to choose e team it are not these are his new people he does not think them exactly but he feels more alined with these chines nationalists on the pout waving at the police then with the angry protesters paying up on them even if those protestors ultimately on the same thing he does to preserved the freedoms in o ho o thing on the upper duck of the sat and this was actually the first time dance had every sung the national can them in panic he told me later how as he sang he was surprised to find that he feud command we is the managing et it ovoursel and she as has one more story for us unmet us at the sup it is act six of our so at six two weeks later soctumber first was just a big day for supporters of manna china if anything i think it was even more anticipated by pro democracy protestors the new china did not want to be embarrassed by demonstrations in hon con on that day such a beganniversary and in the weeks leading up to it several of them told us that they were worried what can a crack the almost going to come on october first i may be in the days before it withe government try to shut them down i torn off the we an before october first there were tuns of police under cover cop's posing his protesters surge in arrest and or noctober first something happened that several friend views

empty a only because she was in a big rest to meet me afterward on gan a very long it it it is a really sat her after yesterday she stalking about the protestor who was shot it actually happened just ta shartwalk from where we standing the last few days of protest had been especially bad janitor was in the middle of the crowd when dozens of special tactics police officers exploded out of a hidden door sprinting after protesters and tackling them to the ground people had not seen this before it caused away with panic every one flood in terror including manager her phone was flooded with images of arrested pro testers pinned on the ground by rind police face down with their risks tied behind them later she met her friend the one who went to the protest with era in her and found out that in the rest she got in trapped she came really close to getting arrested out if say that everything was close to me a fer we a fen o in near any getting a rested and all the peers an foodagous i could see after to say everything just was was just too much for me i to plus yet janitors deeply fearful of getting arrested remember it could mean years in prison after all of that on october first she

lake we brought an made firecracker and we wanted to detonate it in the shallow water where we used to swim we were eleven and it was late fall of nineteen seventy seven we were visiting a place called freedom new samphire a small town of a few hundred people just across the border from man my doubt had volunteered to do some maintenance work an a summer camp had once on to my brother penny best friendyan and i went along we would been in separable growing out but now penny had started hanging out with an older crowd and it'd been seeing less and less of then since it'd just transferred to a new school i was in a funk about losing touch with penny anear and for me the stakes for the we end were a little higher than usual in normal times we to go shop lifting or set things on fire that hollowed we taken hands of d forty and gone from door to door spraying it n the mouths of jack lantern still flames burst out their eyes and they blew up in balls of fire this is my brother penny he is now thirty seven and he is a scientist mi think means mom i you to worry little bit aback you spending to much time with us or being brought under our bat influence cause i think we tatty in about a in a throwing worships tat cars we tatty in about unfolding paper clips that you could shoot them at people and on we were wandering around looking for something to do and we saw the house it was gray weathered and leaving precariously at one end the windows were boarded up from the outside two old cars probably from the thirties sat in the yard one of them had a tree growing out through a hole where the engine had been at the back of the house we found a window that was broken and i remember peering in into need darkness zeros kind of u a day count of thing that is my friend en tit was one of the lies where we just would say ism down that house would not you then you would say id no crop going that house an penny t would say ye that house looks on none of us really want tod go houses we are all scared but we do can was the skinniest was decided that he should go in first he slid sideways through the broken panes we would not get cut and disappeared after maybe ten seconds he scrambled back out clutching a newspaper it was brown and i remember it crumbled in our hands the headlines had something about notes invading that was all we needed one my one we climbed into the house it was dark inside the only light came in through little cracks between the boards that covered the windows the floor felt soft underfoot and as my eyes adjusted i could see that it was covered with a lair of filthy clothes junk was everywhere actually we could not walk around on the floor because you could not see the floor in must place es it was just jane wit worse tuff than you could live with some number the a couple of rooms y you you you could not go in to for for how much up was jammed in there i was careful to remember how w e got in in case we had to find our way out in a hurry we were all very quiet we would seen enough hormones to know that joking around could get us into trouble here is the and did not spread out we stuck probably almost git to hit in our backs for bloody each other and kennel was may be looking the other way his back was it is a criterser little star of people walk through the house and penny is one of t the worst people to go into a situation that wit we have you n because his his frigitery and he always look in a mumble about may be with the worst thing might be a might next had you don't you not i that is som he's gong to come out of that closet o non some rooms were untold disarray we things strewn about they would been rummaged through but then there were these little areas where things were untouched in the kitchen dishes were stacked on open shells pots and pans cluttered the sink and the pantry was stocked with can food i picked up a container of harsher syrup and it felt heavy a salted pepper shaker sat on the kitchen table the main sense i had was of disaster this is my brother penny as if people had been could of tootling along in there everyday lives and something terrible had happened something catastrophic had happen to the people in the house catastrophic that no care had been put in arranging or sorting or wandering any of the contents of their lives and there was a feeling as we sat there that this time case had not an opened in fifty years hanging in the kitchen was one of those calenders that give out a gustations it was dated dismember nineteen thirty eight in the bed room was a pile of shoes may be thirty high that id fused into one mass on a night stand i found a pair of eyeglasses folded on top of the man's wallet and i slipped them both into my jacket pocket in another room was a bureau and tucked in the mirror frame was an invitation to a dance at the town hall pin to it was a rose that was completely withered penny open the closet door next to the dresser and hanging there was a rotting white dress we began to fabricate a little scene a teen aged daughter returned late from a dance with a rose she pins it to the mirror and hangs her dress in the closet and then something horrible happens and that is when time stopped outside squinting in the bright daylight we raised back through town kennynean were kids coming off a roller coaster but i had the sense of doom about the whole thing it'd heard about the king tut exhibit that was during the country i wondered if we would be cursed the guise who would found king tut's ton also i had much wallet in my pocket i took it out and showed penny ne inn inside was a bright green one dollar bill dated nineteen thirty five and a driver licence for a man name virgin mason that night roller dad drop is home i put on the eye glasses it'd found to make penny new and laugh but then i felt bad about the joke i did not know anyone who died before and now i was pretty sure i was carrying the wallet of a dead man the next day my brother would be going back to his high school butties and my best friend would be going back to our old school it'd have to face the kits at my new school where i had not made me friends and it seemed everyone was named dug and played recross had always ben a moody kid but it was an unfocussed sort moodiness now that all this was happening in my life my gloominess took on a new focus i brooded about the mason house my home room teacher had been an instructor for outward bound throughout the year he made us go low in the woods around the school i spent hour sitting out there alone with my journal on a flashlight brooding the winter passed and the only curse i suffered was great seven that spring my parents went back to do there volunteerstint at the camp this time i brought a new friend named avid i knew it impress him we got up early and packed flashlights in our book backs i think we even brought a canteen of water it was raining as we climb through the window of the house nothing looked it to change over the winter and just the first time i had this acute feeling of being watched as we moved from room to room touching things opening up drawers climbing up into the attic saved felt it too all their personal wings were right there they felt close and i remember walking through some of these dark rooms looking round you noway you will being afraid of perhaps noon covering something some evil scene worse discovering that they were there is very good they ad died there i member thinking that we were going to find it a bodied an closet at any moment i remember there is some some closets and cowards that we just flat out did not want of or even open up the the on d i you just afraid you might find something in just did not want si you member the basement i do not remember the now i do not remember the basement did we ever go down we did go down into the basement eventually did not we i still do not member the basement did you go down the young g on the basement we never went into the basement then her is why the door to it had been blocked shut by a couch that was propped on its end as if some one wanted to keep something down there from getting out i remember uncovering finding a small doll his face had been burned off and i remember being terrified in that thinking this must have been some scene of some horrible ritual avid has a really strong memory of a doll with its face burned off to remember that oh yet absolutely that wan carry the the intention that have got have got the image of it om i made the something creepy about a doll that is kind of been mangle i remember discovering that there was these her sneered testes are of we know or smeared there was either animal or you man or we could not finger that but the poop on the bed that was carry too it make you wonder n at what the out is going to in here i think it the time without a you making people were crashing out here an that fit into whole story about out some some fugitive on the lambs from justice who's hiding out in ow abandoned you sir the town out thehalllike who used to crash out there after a range o thing us take the strange part is do people just pick up and walk out of front door one day a love letters that art credibly personal e this these were importantartifact to their family if they did leave for some legitimate reason can move to pack up you move you do not leave things lot a wallet with money in it or or your address boy that has the birthday is written of your family members and why why you want yo leave him in that how could you we had a mission the mission was to find out as much as we could about the family who had lived there and all over the prefer letters and pieces of paper and each one was a potential clothes a an we sat down and the dingy had a musky house and we started to read nonmember twenty ninth nineteen thirty three dear mister mason i have checked up your case quite thoroughly and find that you have already had as much if not more work than most people i find also that you were working a car and a truck and that your son has a car and a truck also that your team is working calling cot lumber long as a man has anything at all he asked to use it as we have to give work to the people who have nothing at all under these circumstances you did not qualify for work at this time signed the office of the county supervisor of relief dear mamma ism staying over to night and go to the dance artier and i have had a fight he thinks ism going out with any i may i do not know i do not want him to know where i as at do not telling come over to the dance and bring my shuts the blacks once now come over mamma and do not be mad do not even tell p t now mamma please do not be mad at me mister jacks is ugly to day be sure you get dad to come to the dance there is a ball game to night over the next two years i returned to the mason house for times in all and each time i came back with more clues about what happened i read these letters over and over trying to decode them convinced that the answer about the family's downfall was hidden in some seeming e trivial comment or offhand reference this note is written on school paper by a young girl and was probably my age at the time dear slide i wanted a boy friend i thought i would write to you darling there is no other boy around here that interests me as you do slide darling call me up lied darling when i saw you last night over at pinks i thought i would go crazy because i love you from your girl friend d we had to take things that could help us unravelled a puzzle i man right i do not think we even thought of it being private property at tat at the start be was it was just a abandoned a no one cared about it we read notes from doctors and found bills from creditors we scanned library past due notices and studied postmarks and came up with lots of ideas about why the place had been left we started to think she may be these people had their house for clothes and were thrown out by bankers because it does seem as if somebody might have been shut out of the out with all of them all of the a objects inside one of my favorite theories was that you a the father die at do the same times the sons at to go to for is word looking at papers a talk about worst a nan found thinking about how a couple of of dance with old father and a couple of sons could very quickly finish the family i remember finding on information about bedding i think we saw i think they were tickets or a scandal of a dog track or a horse racing track and the story we made up was oh these people had lost all their money gamble we needed to find someone who could give us some answers a person who knew the family or a distant relative freedom's a small town some one must have known what had happened but when we would go ask down at the general store or the post office people gave us the cold shoulder this confirmed to us that they were part of the conspiracy to bring this family down or at least part of the cover up in retrospect i realized the adults may have brushed us off because we were twelve years old time was day wo found the break through clue a matchbook matches an tact soiled but legible it said stop an shop at mason grocery freedom side near effingham false bridge we rode over and ditched our bikes under the bridge there were two or three houses on either side all big old victoria buildings but it was obvious to us which one was the mason grocery there were couple of ancient gaspomps outside and arresting foxy soda sign a rope held the door closed but we were able to squeeze through the first thing i saw when we went through the door were the boxes of cornflakes that lined the walls the mason grocery was a completely intact perfectly preserved store from the nineteen sixties with products still on the shelves by the cash register there were magazine racks and rows of candy there were glass countertype displaying fishing year and stacks of can vegetables corn and green beans some of the cans at exploded from years of heating an freezing which we thought was cool upstairs there were a few rooms that must have been an apartment being in a store all of the sudden reminded us beg know a we are breaking at entering in a place that is got candy there was a small safe under the counter and when i turned the handle the door swung open inside i found four silver dollars and three kenned half dollars i also found a five dollar gold coin from eighteen ninety two i took the coins a i spent the eighth great kind of detached from school i stare out the window at the falling town and think about the drifts that must have been blowing through cracks in the house or it'd lie awake at night and imagine ow still in cold it would be in there instead of doing home work i spent a lot of time reading through my box of mason letters drawing up a family tree from the clues we would found every reference to new hampshir became relevant to the mystery i sit at breakfast and stare at a tin of maple syrup and think about the masons i was pretty sure that if there was some way i could support a family researching abandon houses that it would be my vocation in life i was thirteen years old and it'd a crush on a house i had not told my parents much about it i was afraid they would shut us down over fears we would get hurt or arrested but i remember feeling that i wanted a grown up to see it to confirmed that we had an imagine the whole thing i started to tell my mother about it but i could see i was not getting in across how amazing it was that spring i led my mother across the field of weeds and watched as she climbed through the window of the house i was little applaud more than apart when i went inside it was much more i much greater disaster than i hadn't imagined also much greater mystery net i had imagined and in many ways much more interesting for that reason my man proved to be quite a south she drove me to the town cemetery where we found plot after plot of mason graves there was venison died nineteen forty three bertha died nineteen sixty eight virgin whose dollar build on drivers life since i had died nineteen seventy for and jess who died nineteen sixty nine there was another jess willing who had a birthday but there was no date of death our theories of a car carrying the whole family into ravine of the war of sudden plague of the whole town rising up against the nations and massacring them these no longer made sense whatever had driven the family from its home had not been sudden the circumstances were more complicated than anything it'd imagined that win her i had my first nightmare i was in the house rummaging through things and the nations were there in the walls watching me and they worked friendly the next year i did not go to new samphire it'd started high school and was finally making friends there was less brooding in my life and what brooding was left had to do with girls my mother went up on the semi annual work we end at the summer camp and she brought my sister along when they returned they told me a story that made my blood run cold tell me about the time h you went up with care what happened that was a big mistake i think we were woe very embarrassed weembarrasse er we both ere inner no ye i felt i was angry you were angry i was now we blew it we blew it sort of in a sense what happened was this my mother had brought my sister into the house and they would seen a child's crib rotting away in the attic and they decided to take it they drove my family's bright orange valve station wagon up in front and went in to get the crib there was no way one could bring that crib down the stairs and finally a i pes of rope somewhere tied it o we lorded it to the window outside the window now outside the wind of the house i now swing an boy was y and saw it we saw him see it we saw him see it and we realize ah the boy returned with two women who told my mother and sister they had no right being in the house my mama argued asking them why if someone somewhere had an interest in the property they were letting it rot the women said it was none of her business and that she would better leave i felt betrayed the seen my mother had described the orange car the dangling crib the confrontation in the middle of the road people in freedom had a word for greedy city folk from massachusetts and elsewhere who came to town plundering for antiques they called them mass holes that is what we would become and i felt sick about it i collected all the objects and letters it'd found and put them in a small wooden fishtackle box i ad found in the nation grocery store i tucked the box up in our attic and i never went in the mason house again three years later i took a trip through new inland with inn and we decided to take a see tor to freedom i stopped the car where i thought the house stood even remembered it being further along we parked and walked up and down the road but the house was gone all the remained was an outline of the foundation in the dirk we drove to the bridge to see if the store was there but it was not we could not tell of the buildings had been torn down or if they would burned but they were gone as was i thought any answer had ever get as to why they been left in the first place i was having the nightmare regularly now each time it was the same i was in the nation house for some version of it but now undead nations for leaving their hiding places in the walls and attacking me it as a terrifying dream and i had it many times over the next twenty years in or c there is playing here the summer i went to visit my mother and looked through the box of things had save from the mason house all the years i had spent away from home she kept the box carefully labeled in stored through formoovs era yet remember that yes they wouldn't box you see thus the wooden box that i remember and i think it has things in it should the box was as i left it a little make up case with powder still inside the eye glasses some children records an the coins photographs of the family the letters and there were newspapers right on top was the one been found that very first day on this newsprint is very old boson today go blink after marching history after marching into the rest of chikaslovaki an march it in chamberlain exchanged speeches not stayed there and chamberlain said he mustn't do it again aril sixteen ninety thirty nine and my yew my grand parents were already in expelled ten was of this taking of chips legacy when my great grandparents fled their home in check lavacya the left furniture of paintings letters all very suddenly and ever returned my mother tells me that all those things probably still exist somewhere wet that in mind she could not bear to see the mason things sitting away they had my here is spoon it is all very melancholy on the coroner wise and melancholy the abandonment the abandonment is melancholy why in a way it is worse than throwing away much works i can understand one family being obliged to flee or in or abandoned but that nobody else care that it was overwhelmingly abandoned by everybody that nobody had cared to solve something to resolve something that was very offensive to me that was i was leaving a corpse you leave corpses and that is a little bit the feeling that i had that here was a carcass a carcass of e of the house of a life of a private inner nobody cared to pick it up and giving proper buried thought that it was important an somebody shoot cere that somehow somebody was leaning over these words reading them unfolding these matters that somebody had on to write and it really did not matter that it was an elevenero who cared objects have lives teethe are witness to things and these objects were that was in a way glad that you were listenerthere was one letter in particular that my mother and the could not get out of our heads it was different from the others and it'd kept it separate in a plasticcept lock bag it was mildish and barely legible aril eighteenth nineteen forty lacuna hospital my

into town i stopped to get directions from a woman working in her front yard she is wearing a weather that says mason landscaping demand had told me that the masons either did not know what had

details about the past digging around for more details ism apprehensive about what kind of reception it'll get i arrive in freedom august second and a pride is marching through the center of town it is old home week the annual home coming festival and event created by the governor to combat problems of abandoned homes and farms in new samphire all the way back in eighteen ninety eight after the civil war young people had left the state in droves for better land and opportunities they notice elsewhere it'd last visited in the nineteen seventies and a few things have changed since the towns only store has been replaced with the shop for tourists selling doilies pandipped candles on beans babies farming is pretty much dead and city people have moved in because they love how charming it is the place is self consciously quaint that you feel your on a move set about a small town tidy with just enough dilapidation around the edges to be rustic the parade moves pass the old town hall the one shop across the towns only intersection to the cemetery then turns around for another pass the theme for the parade this here is we are freedom when i marched in the parade is a kid the theme was freedom of the press i dress as a radio reported and pretended to interview the spectators and irony bazaar i do not really know what else to say about it that afternoon i check into the only place to stay in town i bed an breakfast called the freedom house it'd been concerned that some distant relative of the masons might own it part of the rough crowd i should not have worried the owners of new yorker there is princess die memorabilia in the library and my rooms painted bright pink ah in fact it is been called the la room hat thee people from parts her katmateds that la la but anyway

whatever i could about them tricks learned a lot about the history of the town torso i ask him about the mason house he does not know anything about it but he does say that a mason's cousin named rather muley once on this very building and that she lived here and died here i believe i think that rather stop house have had a few guests tell me they for it seen walking the second floor i do not know that she will hear at but i mean i have heard people down an the anions agley do not tell them but she was a little old ladies youmight hear a little slipper feet and had a few things with lights

my there if we walked to the beach and went pretty fast to get by that house why no gently i think the firemen burned town for practice session what was the status in the town were they were the risen i i do not know anything about that and i do not know the whole family set up but there one of them was in to are passers and made quite a lot of money i think and raceme ask he was coming financial hardship bout the family town but she cannot confirm anything about nineteen forty something they built a by pass that there main to twenty five did not go through town any more and then the town

see she tried that they had decide off an give him the authority to dispose of that some of them would not doing what not not that is direct if the terrible thing to say but they they died of one by one by one it made it easy but it was not even settled when this person who was a charge settle these day he had died an still it was left and then the widow was paying the actions all the she is and she said belong o en continued to pay in hope i mean that i think you were one or two of the family life and they did not wane o pay them she said detective that ism not into for the tot rocket palaces in to i figment to the town and i dad you now tat the fine habit i built a new how the people over there paring around i said they guldstup on a nail a glass a wire and and so it is not posted i did it not of be burned i was at my daughters and i was in her kitchen the day they would burning we could see the flames an everything we are remembered i remember the fid about coming in burning

store in efingum falls there is a old oh yes i silly did yes and birth i had the store right in even am falls no i was still free to greater wat do youremember about the store ell i know i did quite a business and it a lot of be and they had candy yes they we and la o a they a about very store which just packed with everything you could hands get through a i out jest as yet that would only just was that disageous had a lot of ton he was a keeper of everything do remember when it clothes to one they both a died a know the is one to run it i a family leave all their things o these these precious things not not out of value but if gran own know sh i ever send a mental that you yet i never really thought of it but it seems rather tragic and way ane not was a large family i mean how well do people how how many of them were interested in no one and the house an the store or abandoned because the kind did not care in some ways this was bleaker than anything i imagine back when i was eleven i d seemed a murder or an illness or an accident caused the masons to leave all these things behind something out of the family control but in fact it was the opposite the family made it happened they did not care about the stuff or they just did not care to remember et you day we yer to tell you they were carriers rented nice people but they were a breed that had to find well they would the old school eat t night they were and they made everything do they would did not everybody then that was on the good old day en i gutted when every had everything but money yes u get sir at who i admit for the mersadins but to e horse you would not a place for a pony by the members of the mason family would declined to be interviewed on tape confirmed the story n upland have told me yes seemed berthanason lived in the house until nineteen forty six ask when they open the sterner lingam falls and moved to the apartment above the store they took what they needed and left the rest in the old house using in a storage and keeping open a possibility that they move back some day when lessee in birth a died the fight over the estate began immediately their kids there were nine of them locked up the store until it could be resolved the house stayed pretty much as it was after eleven years the fight was settled the property was auction the money was split and the buildings were raised to the ground i asked an elder mason why they did not clear out the precious things in the house and she said what precious things it was full of crap and i mean crap as for the woman in the letter that my mother was never able to forget no one knew anything about her or her baby avid label told me this just figures in a little town freedom y you kitting honk it that polite an explained that o just like eery a cow thin e their all a little yeletans in the to anal bed room i there tat no i a a a main ani give i all town rite it is all bi got that a a all ye within retrospect i know it was little much my obsession where the masons as a kid i found the stuff in their house precious i soon they would too but of course the relics in their house worn about my life they carried no memories good or bad it is possible that for the masons they were reminders of inheritance dispute or other disputes that they just as soon forget when i was talking to my friend avid about the mason house he told me this story hits wife's father had recently and suddenly died and left behind a house that no one in the family wants avid and his wife sudan now find themselves in solved in fingering out what to do with it i feel it is on the cusp of being advanced no one's living there it is ripe for being bathe lies and what do you do with the house that and now it is it is strange i mean it is it is tied up in this weird world of legal probate where you cannot really do anything with the property just kind of have to maintain it until some future court date it it the property's become a plantain and sun's in interesting thing wasn't you knot gosh i i wish the house just burn down no saint gosh well why would you wish the house to be burn down it is partly it is it is a this lot of memories tied up in the house and the motions tied up between her or down and symbolizes by the house but the something about it is the tell fit i wanted to show some ant of the spot where the house had once stood in the early evening we walked through town and on to loonlake road we crashed through the bushes for a while hoping that we could find the old foundation or something but there was not a trace in fact the very land where i remember the house was gone the soil had been hauled away weeks before by builders constructing part of the new freedom elementary ye i mean that pleasure i a i there i ye have a go long later when i was packing to leave town i found a small scrap of paper on the floor that had fallen out of the box of mason stuff there was not any writing on it but i actually hesitated at the trash can it is not that i missed my box of clues it'd felt relief handing them over to somantha in fact i act my felt lighter but i was glad to have a remnant however small of the masons i

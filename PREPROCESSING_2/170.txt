practicing care affection recognition re spent commitment trust and open honest communication there is love even in an economically poor environment salon but talk on a mark i found myself thinking more about what love needs to survive what conditions can make the act of loving easier or more difficult to sustain mark felt lucky can compete because of money and he was right not every one has equal access to love a fireman a i simpecericly i li river your shave to car front of you you oka a missdosomentito in the year since i left alone i had fantasies about the lives of people back home our country had been ravaged by years of war that left the lot of heartache suffering and poverty in at wake but i believe that through all of that people had each other that they had this unbreakable

love it was not just mark almost every go talked to in freedom told me the same thing if let there was this hopelessness among the men in salon every time i raised the question and i talked to a round

lovely alimony in a salon cash when ask my friends in america the same question about finding love without money they say sixty to eighty per cent if love was everything else the gas could for it i salon if it really was a luxury it made sense to me that they thought the best course of action was to look for it abroad it was a way to solve too problems at once they could move to a country were poverty was less rain and true love was more accessible but i wondered about it where would it lead them for mark it let him to the place most of us turned to for finding love these days the ever net let me see the first message sent this person t is as one is really long die can margin on face book and he taught a sliding into as many dos as possible he did not care about age or race or religion

connections but most women were not interested in a long distance relationship with a guy all the way in west africa mark struck out again and again it's one signify can de i found lati he found lofty lets deck was let rebec basely she is my fan s she is man galore gowan we do not get matetiche had coyote distance she is did a mega a mi africa lot rebec measly was a black woman mark met through

woman was not out mark expected most of the gas of the gem who would been successful had ended up with wives closer to their own age but while mark had been casting a wide net in such of relationship that could changed his life he was also open to meeting a new friend he did not over think the aged thing with lot i she was come about it too in her very first message she roasted him about how young

as a friendship was starting to grow he saw potential for romantic relationship the lofty struggled to see it even though he felt she wanted to the age difference was too much mark has most people feel that way when you take whenever you tell people about lofty but yer relationship with the oi do not be we few dis division disks come lis no made oil people gat den tout to get on thinking an life people mas to tidying in stop sic he live if she still bad to distant to everyone it a that flats toast in w you will even a chip you don't he will give him defy i got to say when mark first told me about lofty i had questions too like o wondered was my friend at now ammonified romance scamperer something because it is true that the way that he was looking for love gave him the silhouette of a romance scammed stammers asked people questions about their personal life send sweet messages the try to earn trust before stealing your money and disappearing but what mark was telling me about his relationship maybe believe that this was not that mark never asked for money and he was putting in a lot of time wit lofty then she is in hospital de i night sat cocoa coldasil i ye will fan distant a y close to my hat a ism ye win for you dead night o weak seen cost and lad to to her do de i cabo ha the tat cola de i woke off on avecof om sleep the cocoa a i down how's a head now months passed and mark a lofty kept talking developing a love ethic where they both showed up for each other at one on chapman say did you did you i i fun is one did you breakfast this morning a at is lot fast a sad what is trust i you a a fasselke i the do i do a imply as a just cretin as tat he a to go of wit fast is the policishat with we dance put i to chaos fesnidy a tat sometimes wen i look up in one a at do not it full even test fun title pe em wat the gula to that evening you c knot lot ask about wheremark stay and he told her he shared one of room with three other people and most nights he would have to stand outside the house to talk to her he would not disturb his room mates this is common most people in salon live on roughly two dollars a day mark had been making a little money playing soccer in some local leagues but it was not enough to get by hearing about how mark was struggling made toddy upset she decided to start sending him money two hundred dollars covered rent for the entire year at a place all his own she also paid for his grandma's funeral it was not a huge amount just what she could spare here and there but it made her feel happy to help hem the ten you gents u takes to could not as at he ad lit yes ye that we did you got fast a is no i tea tat gat fast just law late i lie at the wat a tat tat ta when at pas mat i just think ten she is in fluency of what do you think you were providing her would you think you were giving her how were you li contributing to the relationship because she is contributing money and she is contributing mi financially what do you think you were contributing to the relationship love love an call we a aga see that a lot of relationships involve some kind of transaction each person brings what they can offer to the maxes with lofty it is money at least partly and with mark it is his time and care wont i think about the contours of their relationship the fact that they have never met in person and live thousands of miles apart not to mention the difference in age and experience it makes me a low uneasy did you gas talk about sex like i you talk about sex evereveryting tell ago sax what eve giving how did that how dies that if you do not mind me asking ho how do you won make sexton the for yards you gotta lose onset at we take an lardon clement maces lake i a count got go up was something the oke diet me ask you this question actually d do are you attracted to her ye she what about what about her you attracted to what what turned you on about her even in she say it has o sestet lav back aba set just a think you man locate reneges e you think when you and her me in person you have no issue having sex with er have issue what if from being real my worry for mark is in just about whether or not he is attracted to body this a darker place my mind wanders off to it is hard not to see their relationship in the context of the exploitation that happening in west africa right now sexual tourism has been a grown problem and the gambia for example older women have been resending on the country and spending their money on sex with young african man the phenomenon is remain the gambling government stepped in demanding foreign visitor stop this practice but is still continues i do not think that whats happening with mark an lofty but there are enough similarities here to make me question and if half of me worried that my friend was being taken advantage of whether half worried for lofty because mark talk openly about what he hopes to get out of their relationship what did you about her whited what did you feel doesn't that tie i ad that i thought's o accomplish my dear ti got to looking to as tits oh you that is not that is not feelings you have for her that is feelings you have for your dream those are two different things yet then if if if she is going if if she is e one lis gin to take me from yet then then then the feelings for your dreams become your feelings for her i have what it is said lest you take me out of yer taste thou mut that i different as sot to my life will be to get since god send to one home you told her you told her if you take me out of here it'll it'll love you for ever basically s she she knows that you there is something that you want she she knows that there is something that you want beyond a beyond her yes shell have been reaching out to lofty for weeks a no luck to get her side of all of this then finally early one morning around three i m all hold all she call me back and we talked for a while i didn't know what to expect but lot was very open about her life she told me more about her work caring for the elderly the grand son who put a up in her own apartment when she got older and then of course we talked about her feelings from mark i no o no i n i o o o o i a o a no yon a a an loti can be a little heart to understand sometimes it is because of a not since lobation she went through years ago but have to say despite that she does not come off as a kind of person who does not have agency over her life it seventy three she can clearly hold her own an o a i o you o i no i yer car unit o a i o my mother deathonlly taught me better than to common on a woman's age but i will say and lotto's profile picture she has a very youthful energy about her and a conversation she confirmed to all of what mark said about their relationship and how in ten her connection was from the start i a i an any i in i me o o i o i o o e o a well when you mark that id not hurt year or what was going on your lie o i i a we no o i a e o o oi an o imam a o o yo i am we o o i i o i a i o o i ma o o mini o i o a o a ut you you real you love you who you are yam little said that had been a while since went her age gave her a chance it had been more than ten years since her previous relationship and with mark she felt she found something real but some of the think she told me about her life were had penni she told me about a violent fight with one of her a dull kids and how in a suppurate incident in two thousand an two she was convicted of child abuse an was sentence to two and a half years in prison it made me worried for marka little bit does he really know this person when i told him about what lofty had said he told me he was not aware of any of that stuff but he did not find at alarm i he said after all the good she is done for him he is not on a turn his back on her now after six months of a long distance relationship and countless mention for sessions mark got what he was looking for lofty agreed to marry him the initial plan was for her to go to salon but her doctors told her the travel would be bad for her health instead they decided to bring mark to the states hears mark she even what dealing what everything to but everything for to read she even just my best men a we the did cousin demon the dutch yes a e one e one was within for for for do not yo witness is mailed mark wont ahead an applied for a visitors visa to the guess and lottery wrote an official letter to the guess embassy in salon inviting him to come next up was an interview with the woman at the america embassy she sat tom what did you am i for he my am an who is this to as i she is mar love the interview were asked a lot of questions carefully grilling him about every detail of his plan mark was nervous but he was prepared he knew lotto's address by heart he toe lucked answered every question right until the end when the interview ere looked up at him sad we ism so betta look next the she said that she said better luck next time ism a commas is jest bettelok next to haw did you what did you say back tell like we has s ta that foin do ma my eyes what ye touted crying right there e the a i made bat w i was not surprised that mark did not get it it is always hard for some one mark some one without a job or a house to tie them to their home country to get o visitors visa to america officials are afraid that people that basically poor people will not have her reason to return it is must up and i feel for mark in an instant all the physical and emotional labor he would invested to get to this point was rite the way erased by stranger behind a desk have known a lot of folks in salon who have been denied a via and mark responded to his rejection the way they all eventually do with optimism because what other choice is there in a situation this that's the poppies moments for me that official thing was very official yet forming to nobody what can till make him as you o ant yo missy for inside well even if even line do not she me she a ism stabodat ism happy it is how's me what is at him him ism happy cot ta dint ye for ins got to touch her piece of america ant it is gillylylya lesson to me after the failed interview at the embassy marka lottery tried to regroup and come up with the different plan but her health worse then one day last year lofty did not answer the woman mark called for weeks he could not reach her until finally she messaged him on face book she told him she would been in the hospital at one point her heart stopped it took them eight minute to revive for whet she got out of the hospital mark was she is more isolated than before and her life felt more difficult tin safely hat for her what i she is all along in in ma house people do not come to he sometimes that cities for her its is really piling me i p fiftempse evrideapi for it anabas talking a mark i can tell that hes generally troubled about what laddie's been going through it is also true that since the downturn in her health his circumstances have gotten worse he tells without the money she was sending he got a evicted he does not always have money for food but he insist even though lofty has stopped supporting him he still feels responsible for her then she also whats an event she was she was cash was not si now if she is in is difficult team she is not even walking i think i should beta to and a man my duty to look of to her nothing does not be love don to still because i love abgavoeis to i love late holy lisionship i love the way mark is talking about lot here it reminds me of a business person talking about some cost some one who is reluctant to give up on something they have invested in for a long time it brings me right back to my initial worry what does mark actually feel and what is he convincing himself he feels there is a part o me that believes you but then there is a part o me that sit this does not is is mitt is does not look this does not look right it does not feel right a letter little it look it looks yet looks your using her and she is using you it looks she is lonely and she want some body to talk to she is using you for that and you do not have money and you need somebody to find you and take you out of this place you are using her for that is it looks you got er mutually using each other and yet you got love each other you could very much love each other through that but it still looks very obvious to me what is happening here it looks very it look very clear for me that is you day us on the set back to use you and i i just one o i just want to know what what you think about that what you think about me saying that and an nobody's not using any one bit you me on latest not you glad deandyat is it i the abulias hemin the billions of people wen no one sees me here only late is seniti as or on sees me it is really blessing for me the you best population is actually in the millions but you get the point when i talk to lofty she also seem to question how to think about the relationship you no he la you lo yer er yer yo an y lo ne you i thin he love you yet i got the sense that a lot of people wen her life have asked her the same thing for years and honestly it was a hard question to answer i a i take mark love you ye way you love him i ta make her it did not make sense later she asked me again very nan i i the same question lot i a can question up let down right in an anas yet and ism not only ism not going any you i did not believe either beta the different because he cultural different brother e diet did i did not believe i bat o e e in e he e than we up and down a he love you i can have no for but to believe him do you think he loves you i o a an n a me a ultimately i do not think it is my place to decide whether are not too people love each other that is a call only they get to make the way every one else gets to but i do know both mark and lot have been through plenty of hart bring and i know heart break is just love without a place to call home the fact that to black people wit struggling to find that home on damn near opposite ends of the earth both from too vastly different cultures and generations is a lot about how hart it can be for black folks to love and be loved in this world for us there is a whole whose of historical political an economic forces that can send our search for partnership down wayward pass and after years of wandering marka loti felt they would kindly landed on something but what i want for them is what i want for a lot of us ease mark deserves to be in a relationship that is free from people's judgment maybe that comes with a partner closer to his age in alone or in america and little deserves a relationship where she does not have to worry about whether some one's using her and whether she is loved what they have now is not simple it is not easy but then again when his love ever been that a to young homes junior his host of podcast resistance history's produced by we people have dinatara and a love that dare not speak its name that is in a minute icogabove a radio when our program continuous to smack in life my glass to days program close and yet far straps to people who feel near to each other and yet are kept apart and before he move to back to we heard but one instance of this kind of thing and stay take offer heart stared in the website gothemest at was my what

welcome to the hubermanlaconcans n just science science ace toe for if i man do supermen and om a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine my guest to day is robot green robot green is an author who has written more than five best selling books including the forty eight laws of power the laws of human nature and mastery he did his bachelor's training at the university of californium berley and the university of wisconsin at medicine robot green's books are both unique and important for several reasons not the least of which is that they explore the interaction between the psychology of self self exploration and the psychology of human interaction all rooted in history and modern culture and at the same time in a way that curtains to everybody i first learned about robot's work from reading the book mastery which to my mind is a brilliant exploration and a practical tool for how to think about and pursue one's purpose whenever out mass for book suggestions i always include mastery in my top three recommendations during to day's discussion we cover a wide range of topics including how to find and pursue and achieve one's purpose we talk about the selection of a life partner as well as romantic and other types of relationships we also discuss the topics of motivation and urgency and this concept of death ground which arose during our discussion of robot's recent stroke robot stroke rendered him certain limitations but also has allowed him to explore how to write how to exercise indeed how to interface with life in general in new ways that allow him to continue to expand his sense of purpose ism certain that by the end of to day's episode you will have gleaned tremendous amounts of new knowledge that will allow you to navigate forward a long path to your purpose perhaps find your purpose if you feel you have not done that yet as well as to greatly enhance your relationship with yourself with others and indeed to the world around you before you begin i liked emphasis is that this podcast is separate from my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my destroy effort to bring zero coss to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is rock rock makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are the absolute highest quality have spent a lifetime working on the biology the visual system i can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of challenges in order for you to be able to see clearly rock understands those challenges and has designed their eyeglasses and sunglasses accordingly that you always see with crystal clarity rock eyeglasses and sunglasses are designed with a new technology called float fit which allows them to fit perfectly and not move around even when you are active in fact whenever ism wearing my rock eyeglasses or sunglasses i usually forget that ism wearing them i happen to wear rock eyeglasses at night when i drive or if ism reading at night and i wear rock sunglasses during the daytime if it is very bright especially film driving into sunlight if you to try rock eyeglasses or sunglasses you can go to rock do come that is a o k a do come and that there the code superman for twenty per sent off your first order again that is a o k a do cold and enter the code supermen at checkout to day's episode is also brought to us by aulic sleep relic sleep makes mattresses pillows that are tailored to your unique sleep needs now sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance when we are sleeping well end enough mental health physical health and performance all stand to be at their best one of the anythings to getting a great night's sleep is to make sure that your mattress is tailor to your unique sleep needs relic sleep has a brief two minute quiz that if you go to their web sit you take that quiz and answer questions such as do you tend to sleep on your back your side your stomach you tend to run hot or cold in the middle the night may you do not know the answers to those questions and that is fine at the end of that two minute quiz they will math you to a mattress that is ideal for your sleep needs i sleep on the dose to you as k mattress and when i

dock calm slash superman from to three hundred fifty dollars off and two free pillows to day's episode is also brought to us by waking up waking up is a meditation a then includes hundreds of meditation programs mindfulness trainings yoganedra sessions and amnesty a non sleep deep breast protocols i start using the waking up a a few years ago because even though have been doing regular meditation since my teens and i star doing yoganedra about a decade ago my dad mention to me that he had found an a our not to be the waking up a which could teach you meditations of different durations and that had a lot of different types of meditations to place the brain nobody into different states and that he liked it very much i gave the waking up a party and i too found it to be extremely useful because sometimes i only have a few minutes to meditate other times have longer to meditate and indeed i love the fact that i can explore different types of meditation to bring about different levels of understanding about consciousness but also to place my brain and body into lots of different kinds of states depending on which meditation i do i also love that the waking up a has lots of different types of yoganedra sessions those he do not know yoganedra is a process of lying very still but keeping an active mind it is very different than most meditations and there is excellent scientific data to show that yoganedra and something similar to it called non sleep deep breast or antiar can greatly restore levels of connive and physical energy even with just a short ten minutes session if you would to try the waking up a you can go to waking up doc calm slash superman and acts less a free thirty day trial again that is waking up dock cam slash superman to acts less a free thirty day trial and now for my discussion with robot green robot ism happier here ism really happy be and you thank you much for inviting me a short story in twenty fifteen i was teaching a course to undergraduates this was a big course four hundred fifty students as the this was when i was a professor at university californium sanding was about to move back to stamford am but the course was entitled natural circuits in health and disease but there was a final lecture where i would do a lot of cane with the students about science about careers about career paths and what i found was that many of the students had questions about not just science but about how to learn and forage for information and i recommended three books at the end of the course every year that i taught it i taught it for four years and one of the books was the book longitude which is a wonderful story about discovery of time keeping devices at see am one book it'll leave as a mystery not to be not to be mysterious but because o it it is a science book it'll just tell you what it is its am a principles of narial science i thought i do not know that yet a its it makes a better a door stop a for most than than a book but it it is a wonderful resource am if you want to learn about narolscience and your book mastery and the reason i recommended mastery is because these students were soon on to going to the the great jungle of ye post undergraduate education and an for me i found mastery to be an absolutely transformation book in that it taught me much about how to learn from others how to expect certain types of interactions when one and of a science themselves to a enter am and vice verse a and it talked about some things that will get into in more depth to day but not the least of which is about identifying that am unique seed that exists within all of us than can guide our best decisions in terms of finding our purpose and it and i usually end with a great debt of gratitude and i probably do that again again but i want a start with a great debt of gratitude you think a mastery transform my entire life and an in many ways this podcast probably won't exist were it not for mastery because i it really embedded in me this idea that we all have a a deeper purpose and it explains how to go about finding that purpose i tell you that and i also will use as a seaway for ism asking you now since ism sure people's ears are pricked up to this scold how do you find y your purpose am could you share with us what it is to find one's purpose and how early life events perhaps can cue us to what that purpose is for each of us well thank you for that that marvelous introduction am almost blushing that is that is fantastic story i well being a human being is not easy is supposed to an animal because we are born and nobody gives us a direction our parents might be a little bit in our college teachers at camera went towards but generally were on our own and it is a very very difficult process you wake up in the morning and you do not really know what your what you can do you could choose twelve different path can be very confusing and very overwhelming when you find that sense of purpose when you find what i call your life's task everything has a direction everything has a purpose your energy is concentrated it is not your just going down a single narrow pathway it is not life becomes boring and it is just about discipline and solving problems it is actually the most exciting thing that can ever happen to you because you never have that lost feeling you wake up in the morning you go ya this is what i need to accomplish people come at you with all kinds of distractions and boring and irritating things you are able to cut it out it is just the most marvelous piece of internal rate are that you can have i genuinely wish that everybody confined that kind of internal made are and it is not easy and i understand that there is no instant forming that because we are all about instant formulas it is difficult and i want you to know that it is not sober can give me the answer in three minutes know i cannot but there's a process involved it is not it is not a mystery you cannot follow a very singular process and the idea is you're talking about childhood the way i to frame it is when you are born you are a phenomenon your unique your done has never occurred in the history of the universe going back billions of years it will never occur in the future your life experiences with your parents and everything that you experience in your early years going on up is your unique it is yours you are one of a kind right that is your source of power to waste that is just the worst thing you can do in your life and what what the power is is finding that uniqueness what makes you you and how you can mind that and i can go deep into it and use that to create a career path right and i tell people when you're a child when your four or five or even younger you have what the great psychologist mallow called impulse voices there little voices in your head that say i love this i hate that i this food i do not when mommy moves this way i when daddy comes from here your very cutin to who you are in what you in what you do not and these voices kind of direct you in certain ways right and when your very young they direct you towards intellectual mental pursuits as well and there is a book i recommend for everybody i it is toward gardeners five frames of mind it is help me immensely the idea is he talks about five forms of intelligence our problem is we thing of intelligence as mostly intellectual but there are many forms of intelligence there is the intelligence that has to do with words there is abstract intelligence has to do with patterns and mathematics there is connect intelligence has to do with the body there is social intelligence he has five of them and the idea is your brain naturally years towards one of them you can hear towards two of them that happens but generally one of them kind of dominates right and it is a grain in your brain that is going in a certain direction you want to go with that grain and cause that is where your power will lie when you are young if you go back and think about when you were four or five you you can maybe get a picture of some kind of direction or voice in side of you that was impelling you towards this i know for me it was words i from i can remember an ow six years old i was just obsessed with words just the letters in words almost an almost slightly skits of frantic way i would spell words backwards i would take them a part i would do anagrams i to palendrums right i had a thing about words and language it is very primal some people alert cysteine when he was four years old his father gave him a birthday gift of a compass and he was just mesmerize by this compass the idea that there are invisible forces out there in the cosmos moving this needle and he just the idea of invisible forces stove jobs when he was seven or eight or maybe younger in burlingane californium his father they passed by his store with to technological devices in the window and he was just hypnotized by the design of those devices in the glass tubes in everything he wanted to go in that direction tiger woods saw his father hitting golf balls in the garage and he was just screaming with joy he had to he had to do that right i i can give you a million different examples of this of course these are people who are fame as obviously we can go back and find that it easier but what happens to you and please cot enough of ism going on to long or a place go what happens to you is your seven now you are getting older and your starting did not hear that voice any more you are hearing the voice of your teachers telling you you are not good at this field you need to get better at math you you should not be interested in these sports are a you going this drat your parents are starting to tell you this is the cruel they want ye are the direction they want you to go in right you start hearing that more than your own voice d as you get older it gets worse and worse and worse than when you're a teen age it is all about what other people are doing your peers what is cool what is not cool and that kind of is more all of these noise enters your brain and you cannot hear that any more you do not know who you are and you go to college you kind it may be choose a a major that seems practical that your parents want you to go in to maybe you kind of wander around you are not sure and then you enter the work world without that inner rate or that ism talking about and you brother your lost right where should i go well i need to make money right and you make a choice based on the need to make a lot of money some not everyone but some people do that and i understand that need we all need to make a living but that can set you off in a very bad path because you are not connected emotionally the thing is when you figure out that primal inclination that grain that is inside of you then you have the the energy to to do to be disciplined to go through boring tasks to learn you learn at a faster use you are emotionally engaged when you're emotionally engaged in a subject the brain learns twice three times four times as fast as when you are not i always give the example in college i studied foreign languages which was kind of a passion of mine for three or four years i studied french and then i went to parts and i could not speak a word it was it was useless cause it did not teach me anything practical right i was totally confused and then but i was in parts and i and i let in i want to live there right and i had a girl friend on need to speak french to her and i can tell you in one month i learn more than those four years of university because i wanted to because i was engaged my emotions were there it was i had to survive to learn french whereas most of us we do not have a need really to learn this subject we are half were paying half attention but when you find that thing that really connects to you you are pain deep attention you are emotions are engaged you are learning at a much faster rate get and the thing is how do you find that when you are older when you are twenty one i i i give people a lot of help and it is usually not difficult we can go through that process it gets harder when you are thirty and you have been wandering round but it is not impossible i did not really but start find my exact path until i was thirty eight thirty nine to beans there is hope when you get forty and you get fifty gets more and more difficult right and it is very sad if you wasted that seed of uniqueness that ism talking about and i tell me whether our ways of going back when we go through a process archaeology we have to dig and dig and dig and find those bones from your childhood that indicated what you ere meant to do but when you find your life's task everything opens up it does not mean you figured out oh have got to aim for this particular job when ism twenty eight that it is not how it works it gives you a sense of direction you can try different things you can experiment you can have fun when you rein your twenties your can a learn you can learn skills but it gives you an over all frame work instead of oh all this confusion this chaos social mediately inter net i could go here ere here you are lost at sea it gives you a very important sense of direction at compass as you describe this i have this image of a you mentioned animals am that presumably do not have a lot of flexibility in terms of the niches they can exist in but the way i imagine this process is that is a human were plopped into a environment and here amusing analogy where am we do not really know if we are in a aquatic animal a terrestriaman or a or an avian riorphibi or an amphibian for that matter am and to make the wrong choice to be an amphibian who is trying to fly although them sure their out there am in the animal kingdom a it it is not just a waste of time it is probably deadly am and not to overdramatize that the failure of finding one's purpose but i see it that way whereas a perhaps we could just say that the process of finding one's purposes to to realize i e ah am ism an amphibian i can go in and out of water whereas a bunch of other creatures around me stop at the water's edge i right and this is really cool and a bunch of these other things these flying things that they cannot ashy even go in the water some of them might n be on the surface or dive into it but they they cannot do what i can do the process of self discovery it sounds its about a restricting one's choices to a a a a sort of wedge within the full landscape of options an am for me i can certainly recall after reading mastery it helped me recall some early seed emotions that i experienced as a very distinct sensation in my body on it'll describe them ya am wet without making it to a specific to my my unique tastes young as a kid i loved am flora and fauna i love learning about biology enough surprise there am but animals and how they move in particular and fish and going to a a proper aquarium store for the first time for me and going snorkeling for the first times how and is even as i describe its almost my body floats i feel it in my left arm of all things and it feels there is something to do about it it is not just that ism an observation of things that delight me is there is something there is an activating state created within me i got to do something with this and typically it is tell everybody about it until they will not listen any more am but oftentimes it is to also draw those things to think about them and i just delight in them it is a constant source of delight and seeds such as those and there are few other things in that in that landscape of flora and fauna and learning about animals and biology including the human animal and then organizing information feels satisfying to me it is a drop that i and i just felt feels this eternal spring of of life right and for me that is what it was and to and in twenty fifteen when i was teaching that course the course i loved but i was feeling a little bit astray an my scientific career and then i read mastery and i realize yes i love running a laboratory i love teaching but there is something else for me and it has to do not with a pots and even on a podia i probe i knew what a podcast was i was listening to podcast a that time but but i was not on social media id know with thoughts of having podcast but what i wanted was that feeling in it is total number of forms that's the gold get that feeling in as many forms as possible is that is that about that is it is that is absolutely perfect because the connection to what ism talking about it is not an intellectual thing it is i it is visceral it is emotional it is physical right and you feel it in your body and when you are doing it it is it is at you are level s you are swimming with the current you feel that things are easy everything clicks together there is a delight not everything is going to be delightful there is going to be tedium involved there is going to be moments of boredom but you are able to withstand the moments of boredom because you feel the deep over all connection yes that is precisely what ism tog abut i mean it is for me it istle little it is similar thing is i said about words but the other thing that i was obsessed with when i was kid was early human ancestors do not ask me why i just was obsessed with our ancestors millions of years ago and how it is possible to be living here in the sixties or seventies with cars and everything but to come to where we are now and i wrote as short story when i was eight years old about a vulture it was written from the point of view of a vulture watching the first humans kind of emerge on the planet ism sure was absolutely awful dreadful but the weer thing is ism writing a new book and all ism doing in that book is going into ear into early humans and i feel a kid again ism excited ism happy i can very much relate to your story you mention these five different forms of intelligence or frame frames of mind thou referred to them i and ism certainly wear that i lean towards him were intellectual interests although as you pointed out the the excitement the delight is visceral and the actions are actions there over the body ultimately i one has to draw speak right books et camera i to transmute that excitement into something real for people that are not as intellectually tune but maybe are anesthetically tune for instance i i can only wonder what that is not completely uncoordinated but i do not think i have a kinesthetic a tenement a ere frame of mind but have for instance m had a podcast listener mention that they think in feels that they literally experience fought as a secret as sort of a patchwork of a bodily sensations i and that thought for them is not of the stuff from the neck up but only from the knockdown which to me was really intriguing and i only raise this because a there have to be it as you point out there is an infinite number of different sort of a orientations based on our unique dance and experience but what do you think explains why these particular seeds or as you point out that the the direction that the grain runs in the brain am and it is it is partially can be nature it is going to be dance am but we we are talking about this as if there are some exciting or all inspiring or delightful thing that captures us can it be the other way to can it be one has a bad experience as a child in an intellectual environment and then besides it's going in the things of the body feel good if things of the mind of intellect feels bad and does it matter whether not we are drawn to our purpose by recognizing what we love or what we hate am or are both useful oh they are both very very useful am a lot of intelligence is is not is non verbal we think concerns of images were were very much infected by the emotions of other people i know for instance a my mother is very very interesting history she obsessed with history and i probably absorbed her interest in history i do not think is a genetic a gene for that interest your eugenol absorb things from your parents as welsh it is not all just genetic but yet what you hate will pay a big have a big thing but the problem with doing that is if you go into a direction in your er and elementary school et camera and they force you to learn math and you hate it what it tends to do as it turns you off from learning in general think i do not want it i do not want i do not want to bee discipline i soft want to go through anything because it is painful does not dead anywhere it is not me at frustration it turns you off from learning in general it is really really important for a child eld to have the love experience as early as possible that they can know what they hate and why they hate it right and then they can rebel and they can go into that field as supposed to i hate learning i hate discipline i hate studying i hate trying things over never again if your can aesthetically oriented and a part of me i understand that because i love sports is you have to you have to practice it is going take a lot it is not your not can instantly be good at something right and that is going to require a love of it right but if your math experience i hate learning shit you are not yous going to transfer to sport your gain i hate discipline in general as very important for parents to let that child have at least glimmers of that love moment i know for me when i am finished college and i enter the work world i had to get a job i got worked in journalism i hated it i hated working for other people i hated office politics i hated all the egos i hated the smarminess i hated the lack of quality was all just about making money in getting things out there and then i worked in hollywit i hate hollywat i hated working in hollywood that formed me very much maybe go in the direction that i wetland but only from the basis of i knew that i want to be a rider that is very important that it is not just hate it can form you but there also has to be that positive deep emotional love of something that is also is grounded in you in some way what you just said really highlights the fact that energy and motivation can come from either either pressure you desire for something or desire to get away from something and am earlier when you were talking about how we are much more engaged and driven towards things that stir us emotionally and and actually we know based on the borrow science as to ism sure that only by the release of certain our chemicals in the brain and body would our brain have any reason to change right if you do not feel agitation and you can do everything that your thing to do of course your brain when change why would it right that agitation is a is a signature of the nerchemicals that a saying hey somethings different now right you might need to do something different including require yourself right and that can come from positive or negative experiences ism obsessed with this idea of energy and may we all wont t have more energy and focus and normally we hear about the concept of energy in the contacts of colonic energy what shall we eat and when and how much and we need to get sleep but what you are really referring to is normal energy i get the engagement of ourselves that is a sitting there ready to be engaged but it requires the right experiential macro nutrients right the experiential micro nutrients i suppose to of course we need good nutrition but that is not sufficient it is necessary but not sufficient a would you say that when u we are let let ay since a good number of our listeners are in adulthood you an from our twenties on that the things that excite us as adults that really generate some feeling a readiness or or grab our attention are still informative toward guiding our decisions about best life and life purpose well a what what exactly do you mean by that i mean because there are things that excite you in a kind of a quick way were you have to relieve some mention and there is entertainment than there things that kind give you pretty immediate gratification than there is the larger depicture of something that will give you fulfilment over years to come you can feel that when you are older and you can pay attention to it but a lot of the time is we were paying too much attention to the immediate pleasures of life to what goes this instant gratification and that is what we are graving for this is a much more kind of deeper process that involves that digging that i was saying it it is it is deeper than just kind of i this i do not that kind of thing it is it is more it is more something marrow than than just just that and when you are in your twenties or in your thirties or in your forties you want to be paying attention to yourself and the problem with people in the world to day is you are not paying attention to yourself your not inside your own head you do not hear those voices you do not hear what you love what you any more because as i said there many of these other distractions going on and you are always a tune what other people right because you are in social media this is what people are followings is what they are interested in as opposed to disengaging backing off from that and looking at yourself and going through the process of that is not me actually i do not really that it is of what you are talking about is i think very profound is levels of frustration or anxiety are of definite signals that you must pay attention to that they're telling you this is not a good direction for this is a waste of time for you and in general i tell people self awareness being able to hear those voices to understand that your frustration is telling you something and sometimes you you just act on it without understanding it but understanding why you are frustrated why you do not your career why you are not happy about where you are going is the key to everything it will open up it will be actually be able even in your thirties to return you to that childhood inclination but if you cannot listen to where those emotions come from than they are useless there not teaching you anything as we all know quality nutrition influence is of course our physical health but also our mental health and our cognac functioning our memory our ability to learn you things and to focus and we know that one of the most important features of high u amity nutrition is making sure that we get enough vitamins and minerals from high quality unprocessed or minimum process sources as well as enough politics and robotics and fiber to support easily all the cellar functions in our body including the up microfilm now i most everybody try to get optimal nutrition from whole foods i really mostly from minimal processed or nonprocess foods however one of the challenges that i and many other people face is getting enough servings of high quality fruits and vegetables per day as well as fiber and robotics that often accompany those fruits and vegetables that is why way back in two thousand in twelve long before i ever had podcast i started drinking a g one and am delighted the a g one is sponsoring the hubermanlabpodcast the reason i started taking a g one and the reason i still drink a g one once or twice a day is that it provides all of my foundational nutritional needs that is it provides insurance that i get the proper amounts of those vitamins minerals robotics and fiber to insure optimal mental health physical health and performance if you would to try a g one you can go to drink a g one doctor slash supermen to claim a special offer they are giving away fie free travel packs plus a year supply of sidemen d three k two again that is drink a g one doom slash supermen to claim that special offer sounds one of the goals is to engage in what it'll just call for the moment unadulterated self referencing unadulterated in the e all senses of the word because am as a child as you point out a at stages of life that are before puberty there literally presecual um which i think is important right because am puberty to me as a gerbile gust you start off as a developmental nerbiologist i can tell you that puberty is the most profound transformation that the brain undergoes florin the entire life seen there is absolute no question about it everything is different after puberty because of all the new relational dynamics that become apparent an our potential involvement in them it is just it is it is not talked about enough how dramatically puberty changes the brain i may we are different people before and after prions ere suddenly raging the hormones are there and it is not just changes in how we view the world but changes in how the world views us yean not just through the lends of sexuality but also a expectation of what we are capable of what we are responsible for or not responsible for our learning capacity aminpubrity is this it is also the most rapid stage of aging in our entire life seen i just give the good for summer and then come back like shaving thee i i observe alate i was not late bloonbrid along protracted puberty but i remember those kids ism sure we ought we all remember those kids ism everything changes and i think prior to puberty the seed says you have described them of of delight or of resistance to things think there are in adulterate they're not contaminated why the voices and expectations of others and i can see the challenge of reaching back to those as an adult ism i wonder if this relates to ism something thati've heard you talk about before although perhaps not as much as some of the other topics you have discussed publicly which is ism the real verses the false sublime oh ism could you perhaps just define for us what sublime really is what a sublime experience is and and the distinction between real and false sublime experiences because i i feel this relates a reminding that see right it is bit is about finding authentic seeds of within us i supposed to went emotions can be distracting an misleading oh i never thought never made that connection and it is the book that i am writing wright now thank you for that i have to think about that ism actually am writing a book on the sublime and i i have several ways of kind of i writing i generally to use a metaphor and the metaphor is that being a human being being a social human being living in a particular culture means that you live inside of a circle and that circle of that time are the conventions of thinking of ideas that are acceptable of behavior that is acceptable this is where you where you can go mentally where you go physically all the codes and conventions that circle for ancient egypt and for twenty first century america they've obviously very different but it is the same circles the same limiting factor you're not supposed to go outside of it these are thoughts experiences behavior you're not supposed to do the sublime is what lives just outside that circle om the words sublime comes from on the threshold of it is here is a door and the sublime is literally at the threshold of the door your looking out into something else right and the quintessential sublime experience is a near death experience your standing on the on the doorway the threshold of death itself right and in my book i am illustrating the different kinds of sublime experiences that you can have in relation to the cosmos in the relation to thinking about being alive just being alive is the strangest sensation you can possibly have i have i know that very personally after my stroke i go into child chapter o childhood and how sublime your own childhood was i go into animals relation to animals i go give a chapter about the brain chapter about love ism working right now on a chapter about history obese but what i am trying to say is the human brain is wired for these experiences is wired for transcendental experiences that take us out of the narrow little realm that we live in because we are aware of our death is the only animal truly conscious of its own mortality and it frightens the he od of us and the idea that we can see something larger than than just the the the banal parts of our life is a doorway that open allows us to kind of transcend the moment to feel connected to something larger to feel connected to some power in the causemost to evolution itself right and we are wired for that and ism writing a chapter now about forty thousand years ago at the moment where i think the sublime was born is a story that ism trying to illustrate right now an with our upper paleolithic ancestors it is deep in side of us we need it we have to have it and the twenty first century we have very few avenues for it any real avenues religion used to be the main kind of wave of accepting this and because it is deep we reach for false forms of the sublime that give us the sense that we are we are transcending but it is not at all because sublime has to come from within it is an experience that you have that you are generating in your own mind in your own experience the false sublime comes from outside it comes from drugs it comes from alcohol it comes from shopping it comes from online rage it comes from joining a caused just getting out all your aggression and violence right it comes from cause as it comes from a diction it cay it gives you a sense it calms you down and makes you feel there is something else going on in life besides your job that you are your sick of but it is not real it is not lasting it is false it is an illusion it is not base anything real it is not connecting to that deep part of human nature that is wired for these experiences what happens is you have to have more and more and more and more of it you have to have we know more of this rush you need more of the drug any more f the also you more of the section you more of the born it is never going to satisfy you but the real sub me you do not have that feeling it is it is transformation whence you feel it it last fore for the rest of your life it is what mallow again called the pique experience that is the difference between the faults and the real sublime i have not quite connected it to what you would saying but if i think about i think you are on something very interesting maybe the connection i was trying to draw was a does not hold but y for me a those early experiences of seeing things that just delighted me in a way that felt that not only is it wat that the the thought process s long time ago when something oh my goodness i cannot believe this exists this is cool this is the coolest thing and cull clearly create an activations state within me but then there was also a thought and a feeling of generates is or are of proverb it is not truly preverbal i could speak at that age but it was am that is of me and ism of it right there is a connection there and then it was there is something to do about this the activation state created in the body was it i i need to learn more about this i need to tell people about this i need to think about this i need more examples of this and see whether or not there all this you know et camera et camera am certainly it meet some of the criteria of a sublime experience and i knew again when i was in graduate school in again when i was a young professor about to transition a ten sure that i new was ongoing to do something different was as if i was on the threshold of something whet i didn't know what that next thing was but i could trust it because of that early experience of knowing that is the thread i ism an amphibian this is my environment and you are an amphibian too and we are different amphibians but began to amphibians together i and then and there is a permanence to it that it does seem to transcend time i m ism obsess with time perceptions oi out to be careful not to go off on a tension aha but at the human brains ability to find slice or maker slice time is incredible and and it is been said of am not just a diction but also interactions with toxic people that they murder time but that that humans have a i think it was young i all look it up but ism one of the great psychologists said something to the extent that ism addictive behaviors thought pattern substances are humans attempt to murder time that they do not have to address their mortality e and that is always made a lot of sense to me i always the kill time is or expression kill time through passive engagement but also kill time through ism trying to get overwhelmed or overtaken by an experience or a substance i suppose to when you are truly connected you have that sense of flow and three hours can pass by and you not even aware of it time is a totally subjective experience it can be extremely slow and tedious and feel very depressed or it can pass by but that passes by without you even noticing it and it is a wondrous experience when ism deep in my writing ism not aware of the time passing ism involved i immersed it is a deeply deeply pleasurable experience of time it is sublime and yes i agree with you i think your distinctions very interesting ism eagerly awaiting your your next book but we will not rush you well ism ism immersing that i could i could talk for hours as i also have a chapter in there about what i call the dame on which is that voice inside of you that speaks to you an ism writing wold chapter about how sublime that is when you connect to that voice you have spot on there is something very much connected to mastery in this book but it is the next chapter that am writing fantastic cannot wait i cannot wait i to shifts lightly to a topic that you've written extensively about which is power am and not just power but also seduction which you have written extensively about and of course you have written about finding one's purpose tell me if the framework that have just given myself liberty to create is an accurate one and it if it is not am hoping that am it is not in perhaps some interesting ways to me you talk about and we will talk about power as as a resource it is it is something that a it is there is a resource hat it could be used or not used am and i think of seduction as one form of exchange between individual there is a verb associate with seduction power ism thinking of more is a now in this context you are the word guy am and then purpose is a is really about finding to what end or ends one is going to a devote power seduction and the other forces that allow human beings to interact with each other in the world am but power as a resource that can be expressed in different ways and access in different ways may we could just explore that little bit because you when we hear the word power i think a lot of people con brace themselves at here we go ongoing to try to have power over me this is about manipulation and on and forth but i learned pretty early on that every every career endeavor there the power dynamics there's mentor mestee their teachers and their students and both have power am in inter in romantic relationship there is a power exchange their messes and their knows there are maybes there are am a covert and overt contracts it'll do this because i want to you will do this because you want to great sounds great over contract there also covert contracts well i do not feel safe doing that what it'll do as it'll take something on them the interaction that you are not aware of that i can sort of emu ease my sense of danger and make my give myself the illusion of feeling safe and all sorts of kind of complicated human dynamics that have to do with us having this forebrain thing that can do all of that gymnastics may we guy start very simply by just say how would you define power in terms of its a functional definition an inn interpersonal relations and then why do you think power s essential to all relationships that is really what id to get to why is it essential why could not it be something else well the way i define powers i try and take it away from that kind of negative contacts that most people have that you that you brought up and i bring it to something very primitive and very primal the way the human being is wired the feeling that we have no control one our environment and in the earliest period it was literally over our environment an wild animals tan nature and and climate et camera but now the sense that you have no control over your career over your children over your parents is deeply deeply immigrating and it compels us to act in certain ways either attempts to find positive ways of power or doing what you call covert ways of getting power passive aggressive traditionally passive aggressive means is deeply wire in us to want a degree of control over the immediate environment and immediate events we can never have complete control and the idea of having complete control is nonsense and it would actually be very ugly because you want a degree of letting go and letting circumstances come to you et center et camera the sense of you you want to feel with other people and relationships that you can influence them that you can move them in a certain direction either to get you to love you and treat you better or either to stop annoying cirri eating behaviors or either till wake up an an fine n do productive activity that is your children et scenery you want to have the ability to influence people to move them in a certain direction either in your interest or in their interests right and once you have that need and every single human being ever whose ever lived has that need and we often do not recognize hit because we are embarrassed by we are embarrassed by our desire for power for our need to control every human being has it right and it is not easy because human beings are complicated they do not if you say do this you talking to your son he will do the opposite or all do something else you cannot just force people in a direction right by being overt in telling them this is what you need to do you create resentment you create an enemy they mayst they may say yes yes daddy yes husbandi'll do what you say but the the thing to resist you deep down inside right people are tricky they wear masks they pretend to say one thing and they do another they have their egos and you inadvertently wound their egos or trip them income wight and they react in a way that you do not expect and power is this kind of invisible realm that envelops society where people are continually battling each other an struggling in it but no one is talking about it no one's being overt about no one saying this is exactly what am trying to do and when you enter the social world in the career world your not expecting these battles you do not not know one's taught you no one strain to your parents do not train nobody trains you and you make mistakes and you realize how political people are if you are a shark character in the there is the send percentage of them you realize wow i can deceive people i can manipulate that i can get what i want i can pretend to love them and they will the fall for me and i can do all this other stuff but f or most of us the nineties five percent of us who are not sharks and ism am including myself in that category it is is it is very very disturbing to suddenly enter that world and see all that invisible power games on that is no one's giving you any advice for helped you and take it out of the realm of it is just about trying to dominate the world and manipulate and exploit and an abuse it is something inside of you you have this need and you are suppression of it will only make you come out in passive ways and you will not be able to control certain things if you want to move people if you want them to follow your ideas if you want them to be more alined with your politics or your ideas you have to be subtle you have to learn psychology you have to learn certain aspects of how almost move people without them realize against and certain directions which just the art of seduction and if you are not interested in that f you are just going to tell people what you think of what you are can do that means you are not interested in practical action you are not interested in results you are just interested inventing your own frustrations or your own anger learning the subtle little dynamics of power its extremely essential because we are a social animal it does not mean that you are going to get dirty that you are into suddenly go out there manipulate the hell out of people most of the forty eight laws of powers about defense but how to defend yourself from the sharks about there ow to defend yourself from making classic mistakes outshining the master talking too much arguing with people instead of demonstrating your ideas on and on and on it is not an ugly thing it actually makes you a better social individual that is how i i to frame it very interesting i think as a young guy growing up it was important to me i to know where i fit i n with my friend group and i did not think of it much as a hierarchy nor when i was in my academic states did i think of it as a here even though it was clearly was i u much as it the goal was to figure out where was my unique slot that i could u do the most good for myself and others a kind of finding my spot i don't say on a shelf cause that it it gives an image of something vertical but in the let us make it lateral a lateral arrangement of different people with different strengths different life purposes try to figure them out it whit where should i be in order to express that and also feel connected to others and and in order to do that i did have to i realize now last on your answer i did have to figure out u who is trying to have power over who is pretending that they do not want power but sit actually exerting power these sorts of things and there is an incredible peace that comes from knowing that one is in their correct place both profession inter personally in relation to oneself but also in the contacts of one sure pure group is kondnon yet this is where i belong because trying to gain power when one is trying to move to a position that is not right for them or in a way that is not right for them just seems energetically costly i thing a waste of a life frankly into trying to gather resources simply to to have them to give the illusion of power but then being afraid of losing them just sounds a recipe for for misery as he pointed i know where as figuring out where am i most powerful in the benevolent sense of the word that that that seems a good a good pursuit was connecting up to to mastery again in finding your life's purpose i knew when i was young that i could not exert physical power because i was a skinny little run and i was i was not bullied hat people would kind of pick on me et camera et camera i hear towards intellectual pursuits where i could have power and in the end you might have been a jog and you might have done well and high school but how had look at me now ism not saying that it is a beautiful thing that that is but that is part of human nature that desire to actually you knowprove yourself and find that nice that you that you belong to you do not have that kind of hump that sense of inferiority which altered addled the psychologist describes very eloquently a lot of it is kind of compensating when you are a child for things that are your weaknesses and finding what you are good at that you do have that power and people cannot bully you right in you your you are now a famous narrow scientist whereas they are who knows what they are doing kind of thing power definitely to is connected in some way to that inner sense of what you ere meant to do and you feel it with with the ease and the connection that comes from it right i can honestly say that my dislike of working for other people and office politics and egos i now have of an existence why do not have to dead with any of that and ism blessed and i wake up every morning and i pray to god thank god i i found this because it is it is the perfect life style for me and you are or can be accurately does cried as an intellectual beast it is and in which is a a compliment or am we her there were beast an we think a a ferocious beast trying o her other but hasty being a beast you know it is i think finding where we can be a beast an and for some people that is painting or or gardening or whatever it might be on i think it is again ties back to the these issues of for this quest of mastery seduction is it also a very loaded work right even more uglier than because the auction right seduction kind of drips with a the idea that somebody is tricking some one else into doing something that they otherwise would not want to do but seduction is both our propensity to do it and to have it done to us is hard wired into our nervous system and has allot to d with the hypothalamus and a much other air is that i will not for us with the nomenclature but a seduction to me implies some sort of exchange suppose we could seduce ourselves through denial or convincing ourselves that of something but more often than not wen went i about seduction we are talking about and interaction between two or more people am what are some of the quarter principles of seduction and and fou care to play a anthropologist a bit a and enrol scientists i would invite that why do you think we have neral circuits in our brain that allow us to seduce and be seduced well a i do not know how if if ism if i being kind of an armed chair intellectual here but by my theory is some of it has to go back to social a events long in our prehistory which have to do with taboos and society was initially kind of organized by series of taboos right most notably the taboo on incest and what happens is just not my theory its the theory of the malanowsky malanowski said els a is at the moment a taboo enters the human brain you not supposed to sleep with this woman the desire arises inside of you to actually sleep with that woman then the defense of no since it this is prohibited stirs the desire stirs the contrary impulses in humans and we can be very a what is the word perverse creatures right if you have ever tried to suppress a thought you realize the it keeps coming up keeps coming up you cannot suppress it do not think of an elephant answer what ever you o do not think of an elephant you are thinking of it because you cannot help it right the idea that you are not supposed to desire this person stirs that actual desire i believe the sense of something being taboo and transgressive is the ultimate kind of origin of our desire for seduction but seduction involves vulnerability it involves somebody gets inside somebody gets under our skin right and to do that we have to let them in the person being seduced is in some ways to a degree complicit because if you just put up a wall and you said no ism not going to be seduced nothing will happen but you have a vulnerability your letting that person into your psyche into your inner space the paradise for that is early childhood i from talks lot about this won enough people still believe in front any more i a certainly to coquet absolutely a yougenius have both psychology and physiology wrong about a lot of things did a lot of things he should not have done i let us acknowledge that think everyone would agree that sleeping with your patients and being a cocaine attic bad ideas but at the same time he had and absolute mere supernatural levels of insight and brilliance into human nature sleep with his patient i believe he did om but if i just as he had i just threw that to him without him doing it then i for he certainly had emotional attachments to his patients that he should not have had i do not know if he let with them he very well might have but his idea was that the child is seduced by the parent you are an extremely funeral position right your life depends on them and there seducing you with their energy your letting them in right and that kind of creates a pattern for the rest of your life and f r instance the feeling of being carried by your father and just being taken around physically is a form of seduction because you do not know what he is going to due to you you are very excited you want that surprise right and to me it is related to the seduction of a story stories are very seducing to us we do not know where they are taking us we do not know what the next chapter is what is going to happen to this character or not the surprise lowers our resistance and opens our mind up to what is going to happen next is a form of seduction fairy tales the stories you ware reading as a child your interactions with your parents they are deeply deeply ingrained in you you cannot be seduced unless you are vulnerable right and i to switch that around and get out of the negative connotations being vulnerable is actually a positive trait i think a lot of people now in the world to day because things are harsh and invasive that people h become too invulnerable they do not want to let anything in right and this now infects their relationships with other people they do not want to be influenced they they want to be strong inside of themselves they are afraid of giving in to the other person of surrendering to their influence but it is actually a delightful feeling to surrender to the power of another person and then reverse that charge and have them surrendered to your power when ism reading a writer and sometimes a they completely seduced me frenetic niches one of my favorite writers i let go of everything i let him enter my brain and ism completely seduced i let him lead me along but then i encounter writers that i do not at all it'll mention one if yell know the prime not a good thing but stepped pinker i do not stepped pinker if and am really annoying coquet a but i force myself to try and find a way to be seduced by him to let him into my brain to see where he is coming from to open myself to the possibility that he could be correct vulnerability letting people into your mental space is a form of intelligence its is the kind of an emotional and an intellectual intelligence and forgive me for interrupting but i think it also implies a level of confidence because empathy or allowing oneself to be vulnerable to the point where you are seduced by something i by definition if you are choosing to do it a implies that you also have the confidence that you can get back to yourself a actor worth right they you are not going to get lost of growing circumstances they are not going to be high jack to the point of no return right or in some way that is detrimental to you that i it is it it sunny really nerd he hear its it it is collinear with with confidence in many ways sure take my mind and take it where you will because i know i can come back at any time right right and the same thing in a physical seduction in a romantic sense right you are opening yourself up to the charm to the energy of the other person but if they start i plain dark energy and you see that their abusive or something is wrong you have the ability to retreat ah well there gets trick you get i very tricky it well because the attachment systems which are also rooted in childhood i i oftentimes can overwhelm one's ability to recover oneself i mean to serving how many five a dollar for every time some one in that i knew my life saying i know they are bad for me but i just cannot think we just cannot seem to disengage that you hear about that all the time i mean you see court cases about this that are public and yous go why don't they just walk away from one another well cause once those attachment systems are locked in it almost becomes in and her metaphorically speaking a parent child relationship you cannot surely decide your parents were not your parents simply because better now you are for ever stricken with the reality that they were and they add an in fluency and i think that that attachment system is is it is a force that tugs pretty hard ye and a a lot of women have written to me since the art of seduction sort of saying that they boyfriend or husband was applying some of these tactics on them and it was very painful and they were kind of a little bit angry at me for for then the kind of realize that they it was not they did not learn really from my book of as very kind of wired in them but that reading about these tactics in these strategies actually help them to recognize what their husband or boyfriend was doing to them the manipulation and the games that were being played do men write to you and talk about the seductive adornments that women have used to to a bring them into relationship as followers are youtipically hearing from women i mostly hear from women complaining about men and and and how they have abused them and how they used i some of these some of the strategies i don't i do not den i have a slightly nefarious edge to them because i did not want to write a book about seduction that does not have that taboo element because i say seduction involves the taboo and i did not wanted but in want of sensor myself but female to male seduction clearly also exists very may's o la oft i acknowledge that it is a less often is it physically abusive am but right i mean from an early age both boys and girls men and women are coached by society on the sorts of a seductive tactics and and adornments write him in everything from make up perfume hairstyle's cars watches jewelry a expression power displays of any kind a i mean that stuff the world's filled with that stuff yet but men are generally kind of happy when a woman seduces them right they unless they were after their money or something that which happens but generally the sense i talk about this in in the first chapter about the sirens which i says the quintessential archetype of the female seductress the the kind of ha human have bird creature on a rock singing beautifully that you have to jump in the watering they kill you and the idea is that men want to let go because men have to be control powerful they have to project this image they have a secret desire to let go and be almost dominated by a very powerful woman a lot of men have that and i talk about some of the most powerful men n history juries cesar mark antonym a jo de magic who all these men very masculine men who fallen for very feminine siren women and been completely dominated by them and they actually kind of enjoy the process cops its a sense of i can let go i can enter this totally such sensual physical world and it is it is extremely pleasing it is another realm outside of my kind of cold masculine world i do not really get men complaining too much about women who seduce them honestly it is usually the other way round i to take a quick break and thank our sponsor inside tracker inside tracker is a personalized nutrition

calm slash supermen to get twenty per cent off any of inside trackers plans again that inside tracker doc cam slash humoral have heard before and i promises is not an original idea that i am pretending to have heard elsewhere that my friend asked me to ask sort of question that in all sexual exchanges there is a power exchange evenly maybe could elaborate on that u because as you were describing some of the seductive power dynamics that exist a phrase that have heard before i came to mind that at first made me chuckle but then made me think quite deeply about this issue of the relationship between sexual and power dynamics which is this notion of topping from the bottom if one is giving some one else the impression that they are more powerful by virtue of the word giving they actually hold some power right power is can be given or taken but oftentimes a seductive exchanges and sexual exchanges in romantic exchanges in particular are about both people a buying into a the la a temporary illusion let us pretend that you are in charge when actually ism in charge one but i know that you think that you are in charge pellets just pretend none of that exists and just do eats right and i think this is another example of covert contracts and it is one that actually can potentially create a lot of problems postal right but i think the relationship between sex romance and power is an impordinary to explore in the context of thus well i wrote the art of seduction with the idea that it was an art invented by women it was invented by women who had no power essentially socially politically in any sense of the word iindomestically right and but the one power that they could that they could wield over a man was through sects some physical attraction and they developed this art of kind of luring a man into their world through various theatrical effects cleopatra being kind of the archetype of this and then luring the powerful man into this world he has the illusion that he is the one pursuing her but in fact she is the one controlling the dynamic oftentimes the person who appears to be the weaker one in the relationship who is not doing the pursuing is actually inviting the pursuing is actually leading the other person on there is a lot of kind of appearance games going on and you can never really figure out who exactly is in control of the dynamic cause one person is allowing the other person to lead them on but the fact that you are allowing them is a degree of powers a degree of control right it is very hard to figure out and sect in power and romantic relationships are very much intertwined in us physically emotionally neurologically you can avoid it right and i think it is kind of dishonest to say that that none of that exists that it is that there is some e egalitarian paradise out of there when it its really not wide in us for that kind of relationship there is a recent scientific publication slash fact toy that i want to share with you in this context sled your thoughts on it a avid andiron who is a phenomenal nubile just he has been a guest on this podcast before he is a professor at calpac studies basically the functions of the hypothalamus o things a aggression mating and things of that sort and does it it with great detail is a virtue or of the hypothermal and he polished a paper two years ago showing that indeed there are neural circuits in the brain of animals and presumably in humans as well that control sexual mounting behavior but that there is actually a separate circuit for purely nonsexual mounting and physical power over that is expressed in animals and anyone that is ever owned a dog and gone to the dog park we will see same sex mounting between dogs or mounting between dogs that has apparently am no sexual and point and in exploring this literature and some talking to avid about it is very clear that they're nor circuits am that have everything to do with sensual one animal of a species getting on top of the other animal usually from behind oftentimes scuffing or biting the back of the neck and saying i control you it is t it is often done in a playful context especially between animals not always aggressive but there is a certain element of progressive to it but it is sensibly says i decide whether not you are mobile or not for this moment and that it and is is very important one emphasis this is a circuit that is entirely separate from all of the reflexes associate with sexual behavior in males and females i find this to be fascinating a and because we here about power over writ and we here about power and we think about physical power over but the idea that something as primitive as mounting just something as primitive as biting or as striking has its own unique set of circuits in the brain i think substantiates never everything that you put in a in your books about power and maybeven seduction as well as i just cannot toss that out there for consideration i i i wonder if you have any reflections on it if not am feel free to just say i do not but of course but to me this was a really important discovery because i think everyone looks at mounting behavior and says oh that has to be sexual and sometimes its i but but it is not that there is a there seem to be a host of curl circuits in the brain that are a really about defining who is on top literally has nothing to do with sex ye ism sure the shred ever have never i never read anything about that but i can say that u i wrote a chapter in in my new book about love and that is a different thing than than seduction and i was trying to come up with an idea of love that does have an element of equality that does not have this power dynamic going on in it total of the and am kind of the antithesis of my art of seduction where am almost contradicting myself and i was going into the into the biology of tan even into the physics of it there is a famous a french biologist whose name escapes me sorry i cannot remember from the twenties and thirties a and he was studying paramecium and he is found that he was studying them eothetein these pawns et camera and he said that they was these moments where these single sealed organisms were suddenly coupling they were all joining together just one to one and they were absorbing the membrane of one inside the other and then they would goth in once one couple to that all the paramessieems started joining up together than they would sink to the bottom of the pawn and paramecium do not reproduce through secs they reproduce through dividing themselves right self reproduction and he was saying that the desire to couple to to to connect to some one deeply where you absorb one is absorbed in the other is biologically wired into us goes back millions an millions an millions of years and it is a desire essentially a biological desire for love right and it is an energy that permeates all allot is it is not just about power and hierarchies and that he was showing other creatures that had something similar going on and you knowing physics we talk about entanglement and we also talk about on matter if matter is it bsistam opposed by a lot of connect energy it joins together i mean particles join together to form matter et center et camera there is something in the universe that is trying to connect things to each other there's is this kind of energy that exists in the world where we have a deep need to connect to somebody with outside of those power dynamics right where there is a degree of equality where we are drawn to each other and we let go of the ego games we let go of the playing we kind of surmount our own is theology our own hypothalamus and we engage in this i call it love sublime and it involves the physical part the sexual part is the trigger for it because when you have sex with some one your body is suddenly permeable to their energy in a way that you cannot control it it releases all kinds of of chemicals in the brain that are very powerful and oftentimes that sense is a too powerful and you react and you are afraid of it and you pull back but if you do not react and you go further than the mind also becomes permeable to the other person and their energy and their desire and then it concretes a spiralling effect were the physical and the mental connection reaches the state that i call love sublime now it is an ideal it does not really exist that much out there in the world to day but there a e stories in history that illustrated and i believe that is a biological necessity for us to feel a deep deep sense of connection we normally ascribe that to religion to god et camera but i maintain the essence of love the model for it for love is between two human beings straight or homosexual does not matter and that feeling of surmounting our own neurology our own system and an entering the down is deeply deeply satisfying we all wanted and it has to involve letting go of the power dynamics letting and everything being equal is not tat the other person is exactly you you recognize their difference but but as far as being worthy of attention being worthy and respected you leave all that other stuff outside there is a on that is possible that is outside this power know t that we are talking about ism excited that your writing about this this is for your next book ye ism very excited i could not help but think of some of the parallels between what you describe and what we are observing nowadays in the landscape of politics and social dynamics where clearly am there is no setting aside of egoist people feel it both sides feel attacked everyone and between feels confuse why do i have to pick aside am and there seems to be no hint of a future where people are setting down their swords i which means if we were to go with your earlier definition which i a lot that am nobody feels safe enough to be vulnerable enough to a to allow the union of of people to occur which is just a o way of rewording a bunch of other things m and not nearly as eloquently as as you described it but if setting aside of power dynamics and making oneself vulnerable is the key to access in love in the romantic contacts surely but also in the am social contact mean what are the channels for that i mean i suppose there is the argument not mine that everyone should just take a boatload of psychedelics and see the interconnectedness of things but that seems an unrealistic rout i ad just do not see that being on o a twelfth great graduation am c aciculum nor do i think it would be healthy i to be clear i think that you we end up with a lot of expression of of problems there but short of a magic substance that could increase feelings of a connectedness among everyone simultaneously how you get a save humanity robot well cause i ism concerned about young people in particular with hook up culture with pornography et camera et camera it is kind of rewiring the human brain and were losing what i was just describing and i see oprticly a lot of young people and i do not blame them because they have grown up in the world that is very chaotic and very hostile cousin could i say i think it is and not to be nitpick here but i i love what you just said they in my mind it is high things that are high jacking the hard wiring of the brain o and i you it's o i no o no i gan tororgive me my the eyes is folly going i really real wire the brain that i think we can expand and rewire upon our hard wiring but much of what you you talk about in your books is about finding one's essence but then also what i love about your books much many other things is that it is about that dance between the hard wiring and and the possible of through efforts anyway forgive me for er o o overt that is very after a u eat how do you get us out of this we if you are putting a big burden on me a but i think got up to it awe i try to do it in this chapter because i wanted to seduce the reader into the idea that this is something extremely pleasurable and extremely healthy and the feeling of being vulnerable is a very positive attribute that will infect not just your romantic relationships but will infect you mentally creative people are extremely vulnerable they are extremely vulnerable to ideas they are extremely vulnerable to the environment and closing yourself off into your own ego into yourself of the chapters called escape the or son of the ego and your tine of trapped inside of yourself and your own thoughts and your own desire it is a prisoners inclosing you when you want o escape somehow and you escape through drugs you escape through porn but it does not lead to actually escaping you want to be able to let go of the self and get out of the this prison that you are in right and it is a desire that that we all have and i wanted to frame it as this incredibly positive dynamic that you can engage in and the ability to be vulnerable to other people to open yourself up and to say that yet they might hurt me but ism strong enough to take it and if they hurt me it'll learn from it and it'll rebound and i know that a bit naive on my part but i want you tot least have that feeling because a lot of young people rite to me and the say i i cannot fall in love any more i cannot i do not that feeling have t makes the loss of controls too much and and a lot of that their behavior patterns are in creating this sense of control which you can have when you are locked inside of yourself a hence over indulgence in pornography ye and masturbation et camera a as a way to avoid the the understandable fear about integration relational dynamics ye y when your young your idealistic or least a lot of young people are and you have these dreams and these hopes and to let go of this possibility which is deeply pleasurable and deeply therapeutic to the human animal as a social animal is the highest form of interaction that we can have my strategy in that chapter was to paint such a wonderful portrayal of the pleasures that are awaiting you by letting go of your defenses of letting go of all of your natural resistance factors and opening yourself up to other people is is at he to not just a romantic relationship but to career success to mental energy to creativity to being open in general right and i do not think i could have a we a huge impact but will see when when the book comes out but ism advocating that sense of opening yourself up to the universe to the cause most itself as an energy that permeates the world and that you do not want o the feeling of being closed inside of your ego inside of your yourself i want to make it you feel the pain of that because you do not really feel the pain of it you feel its comfortable for you but i want to make a clarity that it is not comfortable its deeply deeply painful and its disconnecting you from some of the best experiences you can have in life i have that strategy the only other hope i have is in the human spirit itself a lot of this is being caused by social media i believe right a and and the instant and the kind of immediate gratification we can get in many ways and my hope is that young people get get up and get disdisdisgusted with all this disconnection and alienation in their life and that they hunger from actually something more communal more interactive more real i as supposed to virtual and that the human spirit cannot be completely squashed technology et camera i have that hope because we have gone through these cycles foreign history where people have become very invulnerable and very locked and closed and suddenly there is an explosion a creative explosion in the nineteen sixties in the nineteen twenties an eighteenth century rope with the casino in the where seduction reached its kind of pity et camera it has con of swung back and forth between these moments where human's getting credibly closed in bitter and partisan everything's conflict in everyone is device et camera and suddenly goes in the opposite direction i i have hope in that possibility and i structured my chapter to perhaps sweep that a little bit along that time see if i can have any effect i think what you just described in conversations it in that stem from it are likely to have a tremendous effect i think it is exactly what is needed now and certainly it'll be i to amplify that message i i agree with everything you said and not just because you are sitting here is a get a on this podcast but because it is clear to me that while power dynamics and seduction are wired into our human relation since the beginning of time that we have reached it at a very challenging period in our history u it is somewhat of a relief to me to know that it is happened before but in a very different context we hear a lot about the swinging back and forth of the pendulum a someone in fact a peter area on line a physicians a brother actually said i shall credit him he said no it is not it is not a pendulum that swings back and forth unfortunately now it is become a wrecking ball it is swinging back and forth in doing damage as it as it reaches its it it is extreme and i think that i also look forward to a time where people acknowledged that the injustice is around them and and that have been done to them and others and but somehow are able to transcend that and the word that i to pick up on there is the word justice u it was pointed out to me a by some one i respect very much that having a sense of justice as it is a wonderful and important thing and as humans it is important to how we structure society but i do think that a lot of the negative things that we see out there nowadays are have something to do with the availability of a ready availability of pornography he hi den city gallery food et camera a bunch of things that but that one of the issues with social media cause it does have its positive aspects but one of the negative issues in my mind is that it is a steady flow of am examples of injustice all day long you are us seeing things that that piss you off and that piss other people off and for different reasons but but what was pointed out to me is that one of the key things about a sense of injustice is to be able to determine whether ore not there is anything that you should do about it and i think that everyone now feels a bit high jacked by all the injustice as we see because we feel were suppose to do something about it but it may be that while we cannot let every injustice pass that being bombarded all day long with things that upset us is high jacking our creativity it is distracting us from our deeper purpose it is preventing a sense of vulnobility that would lead to a sense of deep love and on and on i do not think it is just about the the lure the tantalizing lures of of sex food and and looking at body is in hearing voices on social media i think there is me validity that but that it is also that there is just ample opportunity to go down the gravitational pull forces of injustice ah that is restring why are they doing that a man catch myself doing that talking to to workers when i walked in about did you see the thing this is crazy what is going on with a they are crazy when as opposed to thinking about anything else in that moment and i try in yank myself out of that but i i think that a you are not can do it alone but i think you will play of major poland saving us from this because people i do i think because people just need to see themselves through a different lens and realize this is distract me from whom ism supposed to be well a lot of what what modern life should involve is the bill to ignore certain things for instance i doorknob the hap next door oh right i used to have it but then i see all that the packages being stolen off my neighbor's churches in garland and then i started enjoying living in oaken less and i love the city of garland got it is problems i know i has is drams but as an was take it and when to school out there and i have deep love for the east bay in it is always had those promise but when you see stuff being stolen on your whole in the mill the night when you wake up it creates a sense that they are out to get my stuff right terrible right and i have it in my spam filter but i look at it and and every headline is people stealing somebody broke into somebody is house this per dog bid me this is rabid domain men there is this homeless person that is yelling and attacking people hon or nor non i feel ism living in this neighborhood it is brood or something in the nineteen eighties i cannot even walk out my door i just got i do not look at next door any more i just ignore it i do not open it ever because i know that that they design algorithmically to put that in front of you every single time that you click on it because that is we respond to that kind of stuff naturally we cannot help it you have to be able to shut that stuff up and look at what you can actually control in your life have have this visceral dislike of what is going on in you crane because i was in you crane recently and i feel if i identified very strongly with their struggle right and it just i cannot that outrage feeling just every time i read an article about it it just tries me crazy the only things i stop reading as much as i can i read things that are kind of rational and and intelligent and i send the money and i i do not at as much as i can and i help them practically but i do not allow myself to get that kind of outraged feeling all the time somebody has to write a book somebody has to instruct us and what to ignore and what to actually pay attention to there are things that you can control injustices chatter out there that you could control by voting by certain by amassing a movement by in no dealing with climate change not by trying to recycle every little thing in your house but actually doing something really much more maker in the world you know joining a cause there are things you can do and that is positive and that is a way of channeling that kind of dark energy in you for a positive purpose but it is totally disruptive and it totally distract you and weakens you and drains you of energy to fall into those rabbit holes and let them and let yourself fall into them you have to learn the art of what to ignore and what not to pay attention to an understand that you are wired to see those kind of red alert buttons on face book or on next door wherever they are and it it is just it is its negative it is a candy rush you have to avoid it and it is taking us away from our purpose which we each have i wanting to me that is that than most did tears asked unless unless your purpose is to organize and be an activist people ask me i wrote a lot about in my human nature book about the shadow side of human nature right and we all have at we all have a dark side we all have hidden aggression we all the feelings of envy we all have feelings of grandiosity we all have aggressive impulses how do you deal with it and i say the way deals to channel it into something positive and pro social and that can be putting it in your art work venting that anger in that outrage in something that people kind of can identify with or it in be an organizing something that could be your purpose in life and actually doing something positive that is the only way that you could actually use that energy for some kind of actual life's task or purpose you discussing lately a bit on some of your channels about masculine feminine what is ay roles and crises of the masculine feminine dance as well as the crisis of masculine person he crisis of feminine person do you care to expand on that a bit i think u we could probably take three four hours to explore all this in full but i was struck by some of the things that you said because i agree completely that just as we are not given a road map when we arrive in the world as to how to find our purpose i think there is also a very conflicted road map that is thrown in front of us and indeed conflicting multiple road maps about what it means to be masculine or feminine or some commination of both which of course everybody is some commination of both just a varying degrees well yes men have a feminine sight to them which if you try to repress it will come out in other ways and women have a masculine side to them i think young described this very well with the numb and the numbs which i think is is extremely real u it is very very confusing times for both men and for women right now we do not know the rules that that the the everything is just fluid and it is very very difficultparticulary if your young young women are getting this idea that everything should be equal and that women should have and of course it is right should give be paid the same i should have the same career opportunities there should be no prejudice or harassed an or anything but at the same time an social mediates all about looking perfect and looks are are incredibly important if you are not hot your in terrible trouble and a lot of young girls are extremely confused by this there getting mixed signals right and boys are even perhaps even worse circumstance were being masculine is seen as something negative we do not have any ideals out there any more of what what to institutes a good positive form of femininity and a good positive form of masculinity in fact we even think at there should not be anything that there no such thing as being masculine a feminine whatever it is very very confusing and i think of of of masculine traits that i think our very positive that should be out there to kind of counter act the sort of drew take seduction that a lot of young men are falling for and it is a kind of an inner straight where your sort of control of your emotions you are not invulnerable et camera et camera but am you can take criticism you can take p you can have moments of failure and your bounce back but you have a kind of dinner rasiliants and a kind of inner straight a kind of a quiet calm that i think ours to be exemplified in move icons a marry cooper type thing right and that kind of sense of inner calmness where you are not hysterical you are not getting upset about everything that happens when you have a kind of inner strength and a confidence and you can withstand kind of what ruin holiday talks about lot about with stoicism you can withstand all the hardships in life but you have that citadel within you is a very very powerful form of masculinity as opposed to it is all about sleeping with a lot of women having really fast cars being abusive and being a bully et center et camera these are signs of weakness of insecurity and to be masculine should be a sense of security and inner confidence and inner straight right and that is what we should venerate in our culture we should have icons that get a it does not mean that that there is no roll for men who are not masculine or wo have more of the feminine virtues that is also this definitely a role for that and we see a lot of that in all sorts of at a rents of life and then there should be a positive model for women where instead of their appearances being judged by their appearances in having to conform to ideals of what is hod or not it is about being incredibly powerful and competent and and have experts in being really successful in your career and and as supposed to been continually judged by your appearances which is very damaging these are terrible times i mean i i feel fortunate that i grew up in a time where there were these kind of models for me to go by and i think of my father who who was a very quiet man and he was he was just a middle class salesman is basically what he was he just sold for all his whole life he sold chemical supplies for one company but he was very dignified he treated people well he was very come and very quiet but he also was very empathetic that was my rule model for what i think is a good masculine energy and i think a lot of people just do not have that n their very lost and i do not know what the answer is that i cannot really produce that out of thin air but i wish i could certainly nowadays there many more in it is a examples and options of masculine feminine qualities out there for observation because of social media and because of the internet and as you point out before a key feature to becoming a functional human being especially nowadays as learning what to ignore there is an interesting idea in the circles around a nutrition in health that you never before in human history have human beings been able to access such a wide variety of foods that are differ from what their ancestors at and i do not even mean ancient ancestors i mean if you grew up in the bayard as i did in the nineteen seventies and eighties there were a few ethnic restaurants but we ate the same fifteen or twenty foods over and over again and then eventually that exploded into dozens of options in more and fusion foods and all sorts of things and there is this idea in the nutrition communities that we are not hard wired to a think about and discern many different food options that no that is a and to taste many distinct flavors whereas before people one portion the planet or country ate generally one way an a given season if there seasonality et camera et camera in a similar vein a we are now and children too are now a overwhelmed with the number of different options of how to express oneself both masculinyan femininity but a generally speaking and the question is then how does one house right how does one decide what is what is functional what works what is best what is me right every one asking themselves who am i right i think all tea angers i find this fasting ask themselves who am i adults do not tend to ask themselves that question to who am i still o ell that is good should ask myself that more often but am i think that we clearly have gone over a cliff with the stuff i do not think we are still at the point where a what kind of wearing towards the edge of of confusion i think young people are really confused because the moment one assumes a one clear and let say balanced mask said of masculine feminine attributes or maybe views a bit more masculine a bit more feminine it is a there are million examples telling you that that is wrong know and then sometimes has the tendons my to anchor to well know no ism right because this is this is who i am and then all a sudden your ear n a larger battle a yo merry cooper's great love his movies a but we are we now have a million variations on merry cooper a that do not look anything the marry cooper you and i are talking about in lot people when oven know who were talking about i do not you o ram i damper no a dines i perhaps it illustrates the point no it'd not that your dynastore but that there is no single or even i sad of masculine or feminine ideals it was picking roll models i something that i really truly internalized from your book mastery you know i there were a lot of lonely years for me and i will not get into the stories of distwondering why what am i into do you on thirteen my home was completely broke and no semblance of the reality it was before whore that the males in my life ism going to orient to and fortunately for me i signed mentors to me whether not they knew it or not that really help me along and i changed them up as you recommend there was not one am i understood there was a breaking up process and integration process combining and threading together different things i think i truly believe that that is what is required then a does not have to be one hundred per cent marry cooper it can be o ten per cent robot green ten per cent some one else the i know five per cent this and creating a pie chart of sorts of who one wishes to be in a given context n that takes work it takes a bit of work and discernment but gosh that is powerful i and really credit goes to you because i you ere a mentor mind you did not even realize it in the way the you forge and organize information and there were others and but mastery is where i learned to do that and this is not a podcast at a assails bitch for mastery but gas really taught me o say have a graduate adviser she was wonderful and brilliant but she did not know how to explain all lot of things to me it'd find some one else for that i and some one else for the other thing and some one else for the other thing and together create a patchwork of of really excellent meters that made a lot of cense to me i i i think there is a a roll for that process that you spell out in mastery in the larger contacts of the cute become as a person in that includes masculine and eminent ideals ye d it is an ongoing process throughout your life who you gnomon too when you were fourteen or fifteen will change when your nineteen i had a series of people your talking about my high school english teach you had an enormous impact on me who taught me basically how to write i internalized his voice when i went to berley i had a professor there who became my kind of surrogate father at berley who i deeply admired for his level of scholarship he became kind of an intellectual role model later in life when i finally wrote my first book i met a man boss telphers who is a book packager who understood the business et camera he kind of saved me he was sort of my went or for the next phase in my life on and on and on i found people but they have positive qualities qualities they admire they are not perfect every one is flawed and at some point may be you see too many of the flaws you go on i need somebody knew in my life but there is nothing wrong with that it is not your your your violating any codes or hurting them you move on to somebody else but the sense of finding people whose qualities you admire we do not learn from people just by following their ideas we pick up their energy their spirit now you did not severely pick up my energy or spirit from reading master though maybe you did i do not know but when you injureacting with that professor at standard or whatever is not just verbal there is kind of anonverable communication going on you are internalizing some of the positive qualities that you saw in them and finding these series of mentors cause i call it surrogate parents you cannot choose your father and mother but you can choose these ideals for you can choose these motors in your life you can kind of real right your family history and find that father figure you never had by glomming on to this person but it has to b e the right fit has to be some one that you connect to emotionally an intellectually and that has the positive qualities you wish for yourself ell embarrass you perhaps by saying that a since i was a freshman in college which is really when i turn my academic life around and really my life around have man tain the same note book with a list of names of people that i admiring who ism am you do not try to emulate in some way not in every way certainly and that cart names have been crossed off but am most of them have survived and and certainly after reading mastery your name made that list and a and and ism not being crossed office no not at all not not at all d through reading mastery there were there were additional names i had the the great misfortune of having all three of my academic advisers die suicide cancer cancer which sounds tragic the joke in my feel as you do not want me to work for you everybody that whatever one says but by being essentially scientifically orphaned as there is a strong mentor monte relationship in science and progression through the career a track it forced me to go out and find other people and also to learn how to couldn't quote mother and father myself in the contexts of profession and i got a lot of help but am i i cannot emphasize enough how valuable that practice is and when one looks out on the landscape of social media options these are are literally just options of people to and we call it following but it sh up probably lot be called something else a because following is fall short of emulating or attempting to emulate but i think that in the contacts of masculine in feminine ideals this is critical butts the buffet of food is enormous now right i you've got every quinine on the table and thy were not you were not wired for that no and i know personally i i could very agitate an upset if i go to the market and i have to choose between thirty gloms and i have no idea what i want it makes me really crank an upset wheres if i know o kat i cannot have this food can have that i only looking for this o cay it is easy does not take too hours and waste my time too much choice is very detrimental to the human being i think and that is why we going back to what i originally said when you have that sense of purpose about your life about what is important it does just as infects your career but infects everything you do eating this food is going to drain me of my energy that i need to create this thing that means much to me and energy and feeling my my brain active and alive is increditling point value a right ism not can eat all that sugar because it is bad for me right it means ism not going to get outraged by these things on the intent because it is a waste of time i cannot do anything about it is just feeding on my on my i forget the part of the brain that that is the misdeal or whatever right no i do not want to go there right and on an on and on all these things and social media some of its good some of its interesting i can follow antrum superman's podcast and i enjoy then i learn a lot from but a lot of these podcast are useless that not helping me in any way it gives you this kind of filter and this had are to cut out those a hundred different choices that drive us absolutely crazy and i know maybe ism partially i maybe ism a little bit i do not know i say i may beunpartaly on the spectummer some but i cannot grant cannot stand too many choices it completely drives me nuts i always have to kind of fun on my energy into something to things that are productive and having a sense of your purpose whenever you discovered in your twenties hopefully gives you that ability to say these are the positive role models i want my life these are the went tors and the thing about following people an social mes it is easy as just a click does not mean anything a mental relationship takes work it takes courage because you have to actually go up to somebody and physically ask for their help and a lot of people write to me say ism afraid of asking this important powerful person to be their monte right it involves a sense of social courage where you have to literally engage with another human being who you admired you think is powerful it is building your social skills et camera but it is a skill you develop you cannot just follow some one you cannot just watch their lectures you have to engage with them and you have to get over some of your fears in your anxieties in the process and i might add to it think everything the says absolutely true and i think ism engaging in the the various tools that they recommend is immensely helpful i think yo are hearing about a book as great reading a book as even better ism thinking about a book as even that you read is even better than that and then a writing down your own ideas and writing a book well that is that is the big wind write and that is what the world i believe that is what the universe wants from us not barely to write a book but you do not translate what i just sad any number of different endeavors you want to be able to think for yourself right you are not just absorbing ideas from other people in kind of mimicking them and kind of just learning the exteriors of their ideas you want a kind of digest them and then have them slowly become your own ideas by interacting with them and by creating ti putting them through your own lends some day it is it is a book stirring in me is the art of thinking and how to use that kind of process and go deeper into it and i talked a lot about it in one of my podcast which might be the seed of a book but it is it is the the difference between dead thinking and a live thinking ideas can be either alive or they can be dead and n alive idea is something that enters your brain from an external for use a philosopher an article somebody you admire somebody you hate and then you absorb it and you think about it and you decide ism going to turn it around into this and ism going to make it alive can make it something that is part of me another part of an alive idea is you have an idea that comes to you about a book or a project or something about the world and you go maybe that is not actually true maybe the opposite is true and you go through a process and you cycle through it on an known you reflect on it and you refine this idea and maybe it turns into its opposite and through the process of reflecting and correcting and revising it you turn it into something living something alive within you right noon and what prevents people from going through that process which would be the subject of my book is basically anxiety because i think how you handle anxiety is the most important kind of quality and livable determine whether you will be successful whether you will find your career path or whether you will not be able to i do not if you can follow that idea at all but anxiety is a signal to you that you do not understand something that that there is a problem out there that that you cannot resolve and what happens to most people if you are insecure is you glom on to something instant an easy to get rid of your feeling of anxiety i do not understand this proof it must be a mu a must be the answer because this person said that right and you do not develop the atheability to think young felt the filing to go to the next level but if you take that anxiety and you go right maybe e is an answer and then you start going through and then you go no maybe eh is not the answer maybe be is the answer you are able to surmount your anxiety and go past further and further for you do not rush for the first available answer that is out there right you are able to go through a process of refining things and in your career if you are anxious for success if you are anxious for money you are going to make the wrong choices but if you are able to deal with that anxiety and say maybe ism have to think more deeply about where ism going have to come up with other alternatives then you can make a much better choice on and on and on how if you deal if you are creative perpend it is very very challenging to have that blank piece of paper before you that bookthat you have not written that film or whatever you are filled with a lot of anxiety and you have to deal with it and if you are able to turn into something creative and productive then great things will happen you will create masterpiece the ability to deal with anxiety and not give into the most instant gratification you can get is to me a market of somebody will be creative and will invent something i suppose to people who just recyclable old and dead ideas amen to that i was once told that you anxiety makes children of us all and not in the positive sense of being child i know it it regresses us to a mode where we feel a complete lack of control and i completely agree that being able to manage anxiety and and work dance with it as we cannot rid ourselves of it no perhaps nor should we right because it is a signal as you point out that we do not understand something that there is there is something to get curious about right a process or something out there or both i think that really resinates yet think a lot of people will benefit from from hearing that because i we hear the word flow and we just all imagine i even catch myself imagining that you know when robot green sits down to right it is there is a blank she and then he just gone to meditates and then boom outcome these books ah but i you gonif i get realistic for as can ism sure that there is a lot of inter turmoil and anxiety you have no idea a my process is is ninety five per cent pain and may be two and a half per cent ecstasy and i do not know what the other two and a half per cent would be but ism i write a story cause all in my new book in most of my books i always begin with the story from history et camera it is bad i just cannot believe how bad how flat it is how it sucks ism embarrassed i hate myself and i go in a good dig into an i start changing the words and it i start making a little but better the second version it is kind of palatable but it still sucks it is if i let it out o the world be very embarrassing i work i it is anti anxious and my wife can tell you ism a miserable being when that happens everything looks black to me at that point and i push through it if i gave in to my anxiety and this happens with a lot of books and writers i would just put out that second version which is not very good it is not very strong it is not thought through because my ideas when i look at them the first time ago that is not real that is not the actual thing that is going on here robots you have missed the mark you want to it what is actually real in that story you have to go deeper and deeper and harder and harder and harder i do not just give up and go here is the chapter it is got to be better it is got to be better until finely after two months of struggling it seems it is it is gone to the place that i want it to be in right but i i use that anxiety to keep improving and making better and then when i reach that point and the story is good enough and i can let my wife read it and then my editor i feel great i have that two per cent moment of joy but it came through all of that anxiety but i can tell you the feeling of fulfillment when i finish a chapter is pretty damn great when i finish a book it is better than any kind of drug experience any one could ever have to such a wonderful feeling of accomplishment an pushing past all the barriers my process involves a lot of anxiety and d you think that is why i am talking about in why what to ride a book about it thank you for sharing that no ism attempting to write a book and have been for several years and now i feel little bit better but clearly i need to watch it down harder am but in other domains of life i i am familiar with the experience of tons of anxiety and just reacamana just get to this one milestone and then it'll figure out the next milestone but even that process of saying look gagmen to break this down into milestones itself is anxiety provoke up it is just the but some point it generates enough a near yuathey just sort of stumble forward into the process and the i keep going saitranito bloody oneself there too much i think a lot people benefit from hearing about that and infant ism certain they will speaking of anxiety you have a clip on the internet that we will provide a link to in the shownote captions which i think is absolutely fabulous about how to find a romantic partner and or get more out of an existing romantic partnership i do not even remember what i said you u have to remind now it is good a one point in particular e that i remember am that i think is oh true is that there needs to be at least one and probably several a points of real convergence in terms of ones interests or likes that go beyond what food somebody likes for what time of house they want to live in but that actually traces back to these early forms of delight and you mention a that for you and therefore presumably your partner that a mutual love and respect for animals happens be one of those things within the contact of your relationship right that not that or love for animals is required from issues a right the exactly never go out with a woman who did not love animal i my sister used to tease me that ism if a woman gave me a birthday card or a card that had a drawing of a particular animal which i am particularly fond of my sister use give an older sister an she used to say o now it is over he is gone you know that i wat t ism fortunately it it is not that simple but i there is sumptuous to what she was saying i it is certainly a it is necessary but not efficient but nan you could elaborate a little bit on this notion of am conversion interest and contrast it with a lot of what people tent here an say about what is important in partnership because i think this is something that a lot of people grapple with both in terms of finding and partner and in terms of building partnership well i after there is you can there is different relationships you can have aging do you want a one week a one month relationship are you looking for something longer more satisfying that will entail may be years of being together and a a people can get very boring very quickly right particularly if you cannot have a conversation with them about subjects that interest you and you mention animals animals is very good example because it is not ism not saying that you both have to be democrats or republicans that is too ban an superficial but the love of animals reaches into your character reaches something deep insider or your dislike of animals that happens to be the case but it signals something about it that is primal that is connected to a child that there is going to be a deep connection there and saw you have to both love cats which is good if that happens to be the case but just animals and gene you love their energy you love the fact that there that there innocent in their own way you love the father they are not playing games with you you love the kind of instant love you can get from them kind of thing and you connected them on that level is a very very positive sign because it goes beyond just intellectual things into something emotional and vicarial really the emotional connections the values that you have together are very important money is another one that is extremely important if one of you is incredibly material oriented and its all about money is is is power and success and comfort and the other is it really into it is underspending money said her lot of people have endless fights or something money right where that thesis no convergence there and money signals a deeper value about the person ism not saying this anything wrong if money motivates you are not moralizing about it cause that can signal a value that maybe you grew up without it and that feeling comfortable and thing you do not have to worry about something is very very important to you and though not being interested money reveal something about your character ism telling people you want a look at the person's character and see a kind of convergence there and something that can last and i remember i was reading for one of my books about franklin demeanor roosevelt and elevator roosevelt and the thing of it was franklin decliner roosevelt was his incredibly handsome vibrant young man before he got pole very active very athletic very handsome all the women were after him he was the perfect match he was wealthy and elevator roosevelt was the ugly duckling she was not very pretty she was kind of socially awkward but he saw into her character he saw that intellectually she was a match for him he saw that they had kind of similar interests on that level that ism talking about the go beneath just the surfaces and he chose elevator and everyone was shocked about it nobody was was trying to court elevator ism are her last name at the time i should i think she might have been been to roosevelt ism it was very shocking he said i looked at somebody who i could last with who had some qualities that were much more important to me and entered at being a very satisfying relationship course later on he had his dalliance it was not perfect but it was very it was a very positive relationship seeing your values in life when it comes to money when it comes to career when it comes to comfort or lack of comfort some people not being comfortable they being on the edge they want challenges they want to move from city to city kind of thing and if you partner with somebody who just ants to live in the same house you can have conflict after conflict after conflict the sex might be great and that might be good for a month or two ounce i have nothing against that ism not going to judge that either but it will not lead to a long lasting relationship sports and athletics ore another thing is a someone that likes the outdoors or that someone whose ajar born has to be in in a time square in a pent house in manhattan kind of thing values that reach inside of a in character that are deeply in grained that you can almost not change you cannot control there is a convergence there on several levels is a sign that you can have a deep connection with that person n it is very important and if those connections are good and there is a physical attraction because if without the physical attraction it will kind of is aloud you have got the recipe for for a credible success for something that can really last and having a lasting relations i as have had is is such an anchor in your life me for someone who works as hard as i do and hopefully for her as well it just grounds me and it makes life much simpler and easier and and it is not just simple and easy this a lot of love and a a great deal of of a deeper emotions involved but having a long tern relationship if you can have it is something that pays off in many divide ends being able to find that kind of convergence when i first met my now my wife i had a cat the time it'd always been a dog press but this is a cat i had and i love that cat cat i cannot believe he was such a wonderful cat i brought her over to my apartment on the first date i wanted to see her reaction to the cat cause i generally and iknowpuil misjudge that women who do not cats i i do not cannot get along with right is there something feeling in the feminine nature that i love she loved my cat boy that was the best sign of all and things just lost and she loved me for loving a cat there was a great convergence right there that we saw right away then there were other things but that was the first one i love that story and everything you just said suggests i believe that you n order to find the right partner and to build an existing partnership that hopefully feels at least partially right to people that it requires at least some knowing of self because unless your character or one's own character than it is impossible to really i determine if somebody else is character is going to mesh well with it or not self awareness is is actually the most important quality in life for all aspects but yet i mean if we go by social pressures a man will choose a trophy wife who of sexy and hot and will impress all his male friends et camera et camera you go by the things at culture tells you that these are the right images for you right and then there will not be any connection to u because you are choosing for purposes t do not connect to who you are and you have to know yourself you have to know what you love you have to know what you hate i think most people know that they love animals or do not love animals i think most people know that they stability or they things to be kind of slightly chaotic i think you have to go through deep levels of introspection but what you have to do is when you are involved in a relationship you have to think that those things matter that is the problem you tend to think that those things may think that sex matters more than anything physical attraction matters or you think that the person having a lot of money matters et camera et camera you do not think that this other aspect is important if you value what ism talking about then yourself awareness i kicking cause you really basically know these essential basic parts about your own character think people sometimes get ism distracted by admiration of qualities that they might find admirable but that do not mash with their own character have seen this many times before where well i where some one will say it will that some one will start listing off the positive attributes of the person that they happen to be dating he does this blank blank and blank she does this he volunteers et camera and that is all great i mean volunteering for good causes ism algin support of that but then what they are overlooking often it seems is whether not that is for value for them or whether notes just something that they admire i here a lot of admiration in the early days of relationships that later i hear about failing i am what you are talking about is something deeper more a lined with one's own sense of self and it is almost e leads me to use the word you n a sort of were about and your keddah sit is merging of people's energies which sounds very new any and am that is not my intention but but i think it relates to something that we do hear a lot about and i think it is valid which is how it feels to be around somebody in different contacts do we feel at ease do we feel likeness and ability to express ourselves and to and do we enjoy and admire them in their expression i suppose to just admiring what they do they have accomplished blank blank and blank i say right they a manifest these qualities that i wish i had right you hear that and an aspire to have which is very different than a mashing of of energies also other couple other things you have to understand their character as well and people can be very deceptive and very slippery and can wear masks one telling sign that have noticed in my own relationships in the past is that the woman would be a certain way with me that i thought was very good and i liked and then the moment we were with other people she acted in a way that was very irritating is a different character and i really kind of fell out of love with her when i saw her in social interactions she revealed with me she was almost wearing a mask an playing game but the moment she entered a different circumstance i saw other aspect to her character you also have to be very attentive to their character what lies underneath that they have some of these values that they are not just trying to when you over for whatever n ere playing along with you the other thing that is very important is a sense of mystery a partner can become boring very very quickly right after a year every single thing about them right there can say the same things the conversations go round in circles it just you have reached an end there is no surprises there is no mystery you want somebody where they have c under that you do not really see at first that they surprise you sometimes suddenly there is a quality that you hadn't suspected before people who are too obvious who ere too familiar who show everything instantly there can end o boring you right but people who have a bit of reserve ism an i ales is may be ism projecting my own values on the world but people who who kind of entreat you that you do not fully understand that make you want to know more and if they can be that after two years or three years or five years while that is fantastic but the sense of i know every single thing about this person they never surprise me any more is what kind of breaks the the the enchantment and leave to the end of the relationship for the idea of more to learn about somebody am perhaps also suggests that they are continuing to evolve into forage in the landscape of life ye other they are not fully baked the eye that which i think is a an interesting idea in during the for episode series that we did on mental health palcontias echidna said that a a matching of generative drives which he defined as the desire to create something in the world of one's own expression is really critical in relationship and he said it matters last weather not one person likes classical music in the other person rock and roll provided that their relationship too music is similar or something of that sort that it is about a drive to of a certain sort to engage in the world one person could love music the other persons not into music but the way that they approach life is one of perhaps mutual curiosity desire to find out et camera and that that is exists on a continuum i curious if seems to give with what you are with says but the only thing i would add is if you love classical music and they love heavy metal music you are going to be driven crazy pretty quickly its conn it is not going to mesh with you and i know i would have that p you will both be in headphones a its the fact that you both have cause music is animals in a way i agree completely with what you say but i would say may be music is in the best example because music is something very deep about a person right there is a ism not say one is superior to the other but it reveals something that is non verbal that that kind gives you a window into who they are if they punk roc you do and i grew up on pink rock there is a rebellious thing this to this an anti authoritarian quality it is very strong you get you get to see that through them if they mod sard and soft strain quartets there is somebody the kind of value softness and tranquillity in peace and you are not that the music kind of shows you something equality about their character that can be very telling me be very eloquent and it does not mean that you both have to love the clash or the dead kennedies or whatever showing my own generation i but that you both have that rebellious street and that rebellious street could be you there is classical music composers who can be pretty damn rebellious and angry you don't i act kind of them that convergence i think is a positive one i thin but in general i agree with that curious about the non verbal communication component of all types of relationships but what stay in the landscape of romantic relationships for the moment maybe include professional relationships too because what you just described is really about a residence around the non verbal stuff amen it can be articulated with words ye i love animals i love this music that is the best song did you see that otters are amazing right this kind of thing but language is just an attempt to place words on a feeling in those instances it it can be classified as tat nonverbal m with respect anon verbal communication o i you have written verily extensively about the fact that people often communicate with their body and facial expressions ism certainly familiar with the somewhat if not very very sensation of somebody smiling an touchy smile and then it as they pivot away that smile gist dissolving very quickly and u you do not have to be a cool scientist or psychologist or realize at likes there were something quite false about that experience or that this person experiences emotions step functions on off on off which is not how most of us experienced of motions most of us experienced motions with some pervasiveness i was happy walking in the door because of something happened before and some one o smile while ism walking in the door i see something shocking and dismaying of course cumin a frown man a wipe away that smile but those are rare instances us talk about the mouth the eyes the face the body in the context of communication what it what some important things of h than tho d i have gone to go back on as far as convergence is simply f humor as extremely important right some you both the same commedients but if one person likes concha humor and the other person does not that is that is a problem and also the fact that the person does not have a sense of humor or does it make you laugh is a very very bad science i wanted to add that one composed in there ism glad you did a someone who can make me laugh has a necessary but not sufficient but boy it is a approaching sufficient ya o when it comes to the art of seduction the art of seduction is a nonverbal language that you must master it is ha language of the gifts that you give it is a mat it is a language of of how you smell it is ha language that you grant that you communicate through the eyes et camera et camera and the thing you have to understand about the human being is that we evolved for much longer period of time without words then the small forty thirty five thousand years that we have symbolic language during that vast period of darkness for we did not have words we were non communicating non verily w were picking up signals from people we were watching every little detail of their behavior because we did not have words to decipher it it is wired into our brains to have an amazing sensitivity to people's non verbal communications we can almost be telepathic that way if we learn that language the problem is we have the capacity but we do not develop it at all because we are word oriented you are just listening to people if you are even listening to them at all you just hearing the words and you are thinking that the words means of the words are sincere which they're often not at the same time that you are listening much to words people are shuffling in their chair their kind of looking away their looking at other women or other men their voice is kind of trembling when they say something that when it should not tremble their eyes are dead the smile is kind of i you are not watching any of it the most portent thing innonverbl communication law number one is pay attention to what continually develop the practice of shutting off the words and watching people almost as if you took the tell of in and muted it right and just watch their behavior it is not easy in it is not natural because it is the words the words were words we want want a focus on them right but you are ability to turn that tell fish not to mute it we will suddenly open up many things about people they reveal much things sigma for it that people are continually oozing out all their secrets through our nonforbehavior you can read them an open book if you master this language and i have the laws of human nature i describe the story of melton prison i learnt if you familiar with melton perigon perhaps the greatest modern master of nonverbal communication he was a an amazing psychologist he sort of am is the inspiration behind am an what is the called help me out here narrow linguistic oh the an able a man tie as cut up a bastardization of his ideas but he is he critter hypnotherapy he is the person of great hypnotherapy i i hypnotherapy as as a valid psychiatric practice en its excellent clinical data well melton ericsond had pole when he was nineteen and he was paralyzed his entire body was paralyzed he could not even move his eyeballs right and he sat in bed and he had a very active mind and he was going to die from sheer bored him and what he did during the two years of being paralyzed that was just watching people's anonverble communication and making notes in his brain and learning every single he learned the twenty different forms of yes the hundred different forms of no right every intonation how serenbody entered the room how they left the room how they looked at him with the pity or amphitheor tax he mastered it and then when he became a psychiatrist and he treated people they thought he was psychic he could see everything into them it is because for two years that is all he could do was observed them he could not speak he could not do anything could not read a book you have that same power but you do not have polo obviously but you have to first pay attention to it right its an amazing thing dance you do it is a lot of fun actually and i tell people go to a came w one day in your city wherever you live and just watch people cause you cannot hear them their refuse tables way watch their nobble behavior as they interact and see if if you pick up fused from them and there thinks that are signs of genuine emotions for instance an exercise you can do is you go up to somebody from an angle where they cannot see you coming up to them and you surprise me go hey hey mike whatever they turn for that second their expression reveals how they really think about you you will detect if you can pick up micro expressions and and you can they are only one one fiftieth of a second but they are there you express a kind and they smile you can see the little disdain in their eyes right then the mass comes on right or your talking to them they are looking at you but their feet are facing in an opposite direction that means that they are dying to get away from you kinnothy these are signals that you do not necessarily pay attention to their posture will tell you everything about their levels of confidence right on and on and on the fake smile if you can just master the ability to detect the fake smile it will go wonders for you because you able to see what you really want to do is to see the person with a genuine smile particularly in romantic relationships some one whose face lights up a real smile lights your whole face up it does does not light your mouth these parts of your face go up your eyes get alive there is there is a a narrow thing going on in your brain that is changing your whole facial expression and it means that some one genuinely likes you their genuinely interest in you their genuinely laughing or connecting to you man if you can see that it will help you much in their romantic realm and the it will help you get away from those talkie people that are continually faking interest in you because a narcosis toxic person thrives by deceiving you with a charming alluring front they makes you come into their world then they can hurt you than they can do something to you red than they have you in there in there in their trap right being able to see that they would not genuinely interested in you that they are faking it will help you avoid very toxic relationships and as they said to you i do not if we were honor or not but deep caresses have dead eyes they they almost cannot help it they can face the smile they can fake everything else but the eyes you have to be able to read it because you say what are dead eyes you will know it when you see it there is no life in them they are looking through you they are not looking at you they are looking through you what can i get of you you are what they call a self object they are an object for you to use and that is how they are looking at you they would look at a hammer or something yet they concept of dead eyes and also alive eyes is fascinating because am as audience of this podcast will know that cause i said it too much but it'll say it again that the eyes are the only two pieces of your brain that are outside the cranial vault ma an they are literally two pieces of brain lining the back your eye an the dynamics of the pupils those changes of course reflect how bright or dim it is in the room but they also reflect levels of a royal that shat on the mill second timescale as one expresses words of a of glee that the pupils constrict a little bit believe you are not i excuse me dilate a little bit i got it backwards there for a moment and vice verse as one feels u less less excited sort of moments of despair expressions of despair the pupil show get a li but smaller because arousal is going down and i think we pick up on these things that a unconscious level we do the deadness of the eyes as is kind of the the the the conclusion that hat pops out at us if we are paying attention but the problem is it leveregisters unconsciously but we do not give it any value to it we trust our words we trust t our rationality is supposed to our intuitions about people sometimes when you meet a person for the first time signals go up in your montbrin something is wrong about them then you forget it because you do not trust those initial unconscious signals that your brain is giving you right you have to we have the first kind of trust that ta that these intuitions are very valuable the other thing is pay deep attention to the tone of voice the voice as actors will tell you is the hardest thing to fake right it is very hard to fake excitement your voice either has it or a dozen it is very hard to fake confidence and you can i mean books have been written about the cancan go into all that the details about it but the person will reveal much of their emotional of the emotions at their experiencing particularly levels of confidence and a trembling voice or something or a booming confident voice which some people can fake but often is very difficult you can still see through it and on the level of seduction women men are very very tune to the voice of one but were not aware of it because the voice of our mother had an incredible impact on us in early early early childhood her singing her the tone of her voice that was probably the first seduction that we ever went through and a woman's voice has tremendous power over us right and hearing a voice that kind of grater irritates you is is something that it's a bad silent echos deeper than all the characters that we were talking about but a woman's voice that kind of reminds you of that mother that sing song ye whatever feeling was that is that is somebody that can very easily seduce you there is a am there is a place for a naming this of it is subcritical courtship h no you do not below the tarmac as i hae the general scientists myself say y getting down below the quartics with all of this stuff convergence of of real a loves and desires i mean t we express with words we sense the world using a course a cartels but really tell you no getting into the the subcritical stuff that is the stuff of our history the stuff of our a hard wiring and our unique our uniqueness i could not help but think about the fact that earlier we were talking about than now you infinitely vast number of choices of things to engage in people to engage with et camera but at the same time as you were now talking about a the michroinflections and the subtleties of voice and bodily communication that whether or not it is yogis or people sending filtered images or the default to text message communication that is prominent now it seems we now have more choices a more input but the sort of qualitative differences between the inputs have been bend into a couple of simple bins as if it is as if we have a regress to primary colors only a but the canvases huge or may i soft off that analogy works but yet you you get the idea because ultimately in order to develop good choices about profession romantic relationships friendships you need a lot of examples and a lot of information that allows you to glean the subtlety abut as long as it is movies and filter pictures taken at a particular angle usually from above ask for the picture head on and below send me a picture of your worst your worst expression of all of that a it seems that there is now increased opportunity for deception and i do not just mean people misleading others i isn't mean us misleading ourselves i oh my goodness how could i be disappointed yet again about particular landscape of life and does not just have to be romantic interactions it can be other landscapes how could i be fooled well your fool because f it the a the inputs were deficient not good data as we say well the thing is if things are er your immersed in the virtual realm it is very very hard to master the nonverbal communication aspect which is important if you are dating from an a and your flipping through and then you find that person you have missed out on the greatest experience of life which is actually having to go out to a bar or go to a restaurant or go to a social event and have to literally encounter another person and deal with looking at their that their behavior and kind of accessing who they are it is a muscle that you have to pay attention to nonverbal communication and if you are just going through the movies or going through the tinder as that muscle completely stripes you have no power you not able to decipher anything and that is what is happening with a lot of people who are using these as a social skills are any skill at all they you have to develop them it is a muscle you have to develop and you have all noticed this probably in your own life if you have gone through a period where your kind of retreat you do not want to be around people and you spend a month that and then you go out you feel awkward it takes you couple days to get used to being around other people you say stupid things your body languages awkward but if you are in a situation for months where your constantly interacting people yare and a films in day and day out dead that skill starts developing but you have to be out there in the world you have to be interacting you have to be lo king at people's emotions you have to be gaging them in real time we are not built for virtual in counters were creatures of human of flesh and blood and we need to be looking at each other in the eye and paying attention to all these little details these new dances that you can only get in person along those lines o what are your thoughts about a eye and how that is going to shape our ism sense of self sense of others and relationships as if that is a topic that could be a covered in a a series of minutes but what at what er am what your top contour may be even deeper thoughts about a i well ism going to a pul epistolot of people off but ism ism kinder concerned about it ism i mention before about anxiety the rule that anxiety plays in thinking you come upon an idea and you go yet that is a good then you go to the next level and becomes better than you go on way be that is not good then you go to the next level you a to level three and it gets better and better you have anxiety another aspect of intelligence is self awareness right the be to look at yourself go i have braces i have confirmation bus i have conviction by us i have recency bus i have to counteract these things i also have a dark side i have aggression i have to be aware of how they color my thinking my emotions the third quality that goes into a tell ism going about now intelligence not artificial intelligence the real to deal anxiety and go to third level intelligence s the ball to look at sit of yourself and see your own braces and the third thing is the ability to see a whole fistic picture the kind of a haw moment that scientist have were you accumulate all kind of data points and the out of nowhere an image comes to your mind of yet there is the answer you see the whole thing you see the whole stall right demon vile compared it to i a a a square cube you can only see a cube from one side or you a never see us a a square cube you can only see a side of it if it is rotating you still only seeing sides of it only in your mind can you picture the whole thing the mind has to go through a process to have wholes stick thinking if they can invent a machine that can deal with anxiety and has anxiety and can go to level three if they can make a machine that can be self aware they can go the people who program me have braces therefore i have braces i also have a dark side because people have program you have a dark side if this machine can also think wholistically beyond all the data points and all the mass of information that is combine in can have that a haw moment all right i can see a human consciousness i can see creativity there the other thing i would say is when i was the student at berley going away back i was nineteen years old i decided one summer is is a big paradise ship for me i may take this class an ancient green in six weeks they teach you a year of ancient green that means every day you have an exam every fridge you have a final exam eight hours every day of a dead language i thought this to be the best discipline for me after some one who been do not been doing too many drugs to be once with you heard finely at one point they give us this paragraph of the hardest ancient green rider of all to reed this was near the end facilities or thug kiddies as they say i stare so i had i had the whole night to trying translate one paragraph i could not figure it out you have to understand that the weirdness of ancient creek all the endings the weirdwayst of thinking the whole picture that a hawmoment was eluding me at one point i thought i got it and i translated it and i gave it to the teacher next day i remember hos this kind of hippy that you have a berley penis classics professor but also a hippy if at the an new is first name is very i not only remember his first that den his ye said robot i can see your thinking but you need not go to another level you missed it did not have that a hommomet you did not put the whole thing together you were close but you didn't you have to try harder and that struck in my mind for ever light whenever i have a problem i have to think harder i have to go to that next level now what would happened if i had pulled out mi translation of the cities and just copy that out right o what have happened if i put it through chat g p t and it gave me the translation that muscle in my brain that i have developed for forty years that allows me to write books would never have developed and that muscle is i do not know the answer here i have to go to another level i have to try harder i have to think i have to think have a that engine whirring around right but if i just great for chat b t it is deadened and they you can have a whole generation if people who stopped thinking who do not go through that process you have heard doubles hoshdetter i thing he said people train to go to mount severest it takes months physical exertions painful then they climb out ever they see the top who what a great moment you said catch b t be thequilling of taking a hellecoptor to the top of mount ever without any of that training and having the same moment it is not the same right you need not go through that process you you o go through that pain and if you just and the thing of is chance be the me think we are modern and sophisticated but really were just seduced by magic you put it in there you see sorry wo it is magics a magician but it is empty it is not your brain functioning right it is pay it is the pagan part of us we that kind of magic i supposed to actually having to go to the thought process itself ism unfit against having tools i use tools i used the internal i u school i searching for some fact toyed from my book i find it i use that i i it but have also learned to develop my brain to think to get that engine constantly moving and ism deeply concerned about people who cannot learn to foreign language who cannot master anything who just immediately grab the first answer that it generates et center et camera i have concerned i am too and i was thinking a moment ago that some people might hear what you just said and say oh well the same thing was proudly said about the automobile how many amazing a experiences of walking from one place to another are going to be lost when people start driving from one place to another but i think a key difference and this certainly lines with everything you just said is that what your talking about is not just arriving at the same destination your saying the destination itself is different when one exert some effort and experiences some anxiety to get there it is not the same as automobile verses horse verses walking virus as airplane it is fundamentally different because the the journey transforms the outcome eyes have been agreement with you about many aspects of a eye am also excited about it in the contexts of certain things and agree with you it could be a tool but are we operating the tool or the tool operating us is what ism talking about i am concerned a bit to especillying the context of what we have been talking about for most of today's discussion about a avatars replacing our online personas too much am the avatarization of ourselves has already taking place through through filters through a reduction of emotional expression to memories through reduction of of language to a diminish number of words to explain one's feelings yo a prior guest on this podcast a least a headman ferret who is an expert in emotions talked about how the moment that a culture has a word for particular subset of anxious feelings for instance she taught me that in japan's there is a word for the sadness one experiences when they get a bad haircut i no and that normalizes the feeling and leads to feelings of less despair as supposed to what now many kids especially grew up learning whats ism anxious ism sad ism depressed that in since we say there are lumpers in their r splitters and they have been arguing for years about as that one brain structure will fin name those two things next to each other to different things not only can i name one after myself which is what tends to happen to speak but when you have too many lumpers or too many splitters things are either overly simple or overly complex that of course the right answer that the the best use of naming things arrive some place in the middle that is how a feel progresses cause if you if you lump things together too much a feel cannot progress i you give the yourself the illusion that it is progressing but it is not progressing but if you split things up into a million different subcategory just even the word a franklin is also called apineferon and that is that to do with easily people arguing over who got credit crazy and it is confused people for fir decades ye and there is there is another story there that i not know far too much about the scientists involved and that there was a love triangle about naming of certain parts of the nervous system oh at people sleeping with other peoples partners and love triangles have have created more drama a coming later in science i could do a ho hour on this a in any case i what ism hearing from you is that we cannot afford to lose our sense of new aunts and also because that sense of new aunts taps into what were really experiencing and e i threatens that that we can become avatars of ourself look it it this way we we worship technology it is our new religion out and we worship cagipits if it is a god seriously there is religious elements going on here well we reallyship worship is the human brain which is the greatest creation in the known universe i am afraid it is the most complex piece of matter in the entire universe the number of francs the number of snaps as the number of possible connections between anurans is infinite practically infinite it is a wondrous instrument it is powerful we were fairly scratched the surface of what we can use for it let us worship that brain that is in your head you only have many years to use it you have a many used to develop it it is wonderful and powerful that can bring you such pleasure much power in life tools are fine we all need tools we all the me hammers we need nails we need saws et camera but the real thing is the hand that uses it the brain that connects the hand to the hammer that knows how to hit things i think of the of the a the great painter senior the nineteenth century he had a a stroke or something than the last years he could not move his right arm which w she painted with it was disastrous what he did is he put the brush in his mouth and he painted and he painted some beautiful paintings that way because his brain had mastered the art of painting not his hand but his brain and mastered well that he could actually paint well wit the brush in his mouth because he could direct it he had the knowledge of how to make something perfect the brain is absolutely incredible the plasticity of the brain which i am discovering after my stroke is absolutely a miracle i do not know is professor schmaltz you we a la who is studying o c d and how he was able is kind of cure people of o c d through certain plasticity exercises that he had making them aware of their kind of brain lock et camera and getting them out of it the that plasticity of the brain is far far the greatest miracle of all and head goes on into your s sixties in seventies an on onward let us all get down our hands an knees and worship the brain and if we did it would create a complete shift in our values and we would not be instantly seduced and enamored and worshipping the technology we would worship the brains that create the technology instead of the other way around certainly got a fan of brains and their a potential for plasticity sitting over here a i have the benefit of have my g scientific great grandparents are he won vessel who won the noble prize for her pastose during the critical peris that gan my scientific great grandparents are avid hull and torn some vessel davit's dead tornstanc live hes ninety six and they won the noble prize for essentially discovering the critical window early n development where plasticity is especially robot they did other things to they should have won two bells frankly a for their other work on vision but am one thing that they missed however was something that you mentioned and is worth a highlighting again which is that the brain maintains the capacity for immense plasticity throughout the entire life spend plays absolutely clear the conditions change from early to later in life but your specific situation really high lights that and it is something i really to a talk about for a few minutes if if you are willing am as you mention you experienced a stroke am and perhaps a it was aware to some but perhaps not to all especially the people just listening to this podcast and who are not watching on video that om your shirt while very nicely designed in in its original state also includes some unique stitching maybe you could share with us a what and for those listening there is a there is a jagged a line of stitching that a extends from a robots a left short sleeve to his midline to where the buttons on a shirt are and from the from his right short sleeve also to the midline offset from one another these am this is the sort f stitching that looks perhaps i had been at the sowing machine om and not somebody wit a skillbody they did a gad job basically putting back together why are those ditches in your shirt tell us about the stroke and let us let us talk about serow plasticity it could also seems a fashion statement but it really it is not am well it was made of twenty eighteen it was my birthday and my wife gave me this shirt i have a love of plats it is i do not know why i just love patterns and plats must be some scotch part of me some ancestor thing but i love plats can i interrupt you just briefly forgive me ever once when to get upset the interrupt do that there is a fundamental circuit in your visual tartar designing to detect play t patterns no i did not yes and we yon talk about what that is it is tightly tightly linked to your ability to perceive motion really again we can go over it some other time but ah ye well to me mi just as a cut o a get bad to your birthday she gave me a pitcher knowing how much i loved it and i loved this shirt i left the colors in it et center et camera and then two months three musthsletter august seventeen twenty eighteen i was driving my car she was with me i was pulling out into traffic at ort of driving and suddenly she say pull over over pull over why why i can drive ism fine and then suddenly everything started getting really strange everything looked strange my voice did not sound the same and she was freaking out but she was actually fairly come which was amazing i was undergoing a stroke i had a blood clot that was blocking the brant the blood float in my bran i actually one pone got out of the card i was i do notknow what the hell i was thinking and then she pulled me back in than the rest goes blank and i had some weird sensations that still remain with me because essentially i was on the verge of dying because blood not flowing to your brain is base fly the end of you right unless something happens very quickly and she other that or you can get severe brain damage she called mine when one right away she recognized something my whole face was looking funny and they got there i was unconscious and essentially they took this shirt and just severed the thing in half and took it off my head and then they intimated me i believe in my herbaria to get something the blood clod was in my neck and they were able to free it up and they rush me the hospital and ism unconscious and then i i wake up and ism in a gurney in the hospital and i do not for a moment i think may be ism dead because ism lying in a turning and almost lie ism in a coffin i do not know what is going on and i have all of these weird sensations and i i tell people we are curious about death we think about death to lot and is it final what does it mean we really should pay attention to dying dying is actually much more interesting in some ways than death and people who have died go through a process if if it is long enough and people who have had near death experiences i do have gone through that process of dying and have come back to life and in the process of dying strange things happened to the brain right particularly with a stroke or something that where blood stops flowing to your option stops flowing to your brain you have kind of visions and things that you might think our hallucinations but that later seem actually you are actually glimpsing the reality as supposed to the illusion tot the brain creates have written about this in my new book but i my idea of the brains that it creates endless series of illusions for you it are ate this seamless version of reality the sense of a self the sense of a continuousself through time right it creates a linear sense of time progressions it creates consecrates a world that visually you can seems familiar and et camera camera but it is all illusion it is all a construction right images come into your brain and they are not organized in any way and the brain organizes in a way that you can understand it well when you are dying all of that scrambles up and your actually or seeing something elf i saw for instance that i really do not have a self that it does not really actually exist that i and the image that came to my mind cause it was in sitting in that gene was the weird feeling of i can almost not explain it but it is as if you took an image of something real in the world and you completely scrambled it up and it was all wavy and you could not see what exactly it was tell me that was the image i had of the self they are fifty different selves inside of you that are all competing and you think there is just one and you think it is consistent but there is not it is an illusion the self is literally infusion that your brain constructs when you are dying you see these things when you are dying you see other things that you see that time is something very weird i had experience of when i got out of the car nag pulled in i thought ten seconds an past my wife told me no those just that was ten minutes i had no sense of time everything was scrambled and it was very very eloguut taught me much things that i can i can barely even express now ism always now thinking of strange things that come to me because my brain was damaged it made me realize that the brain creates everything i cannot communicate with my hand my fingers i cannot communicate my brain cannot communicate with my leg right you think that walking and writing and handling things is just your your body operating certainly it is your brain telling you how to move these different things when that brain stops functioning you realize how much your brain determines everything it all starts there and when there is damage to your brain your whole thinking alters et camera not to mention how you look at life itself after something that it was a terrible experience it is ruin many things that i loved in life but it is given me an awful lot as well in return that i could go on for hours and talk about because it was the most powerful experience of my life when you were going through your reemergence to consciousness in the hospital did you feel as if you were observing these multiple versions of yourself maybe different way to phrase it is did you feel you were for behind the circuit board that is your brain observing how you normally function and you could see multiple versions of self or was it something else where you serve outside of your body and brain i think it was more outside of my body and brain i also had this other thing that happened were i do not sometimes you cannot reset your memory might be playing tricks on you have also have to realize that maybe ism not remembering exactly what happened or that have since translated in a different way that is a cannot here and ism aware of it but i had this vision that i was dead eat first when i first became conscious and that i was up in the sky and i was looking down and my mother and my wife were talking and like over my grave i suppose and had this feeling ah everything's o say ism gone but life goes on there they are doing fine it is say right i do not know about that sense of self whether it was ism aware of it happening but i have a feeling it was something from the outside i do not really know the answer to that because it is very confused the other feeling i had was life when i a having the stroke was life draining out of me and my bones getting softer and softer and softer and i cannot really logically explain that the feeling of bones softening up and dissolving but for weeks and months afterwards i could access that feeling of my bones dissolving at federal t was a feeling of all your energy draining out of ruin your dying literally reading books about near death experiences as a lot of what ism be part of my next book goddess is fascinating i many interesting things to go incase it teaches us much ism glad eh you survived your stroke be that your mental faculties not more grateful than i i probably not but still very grateful there just am illustrates how grateful you must be am be that you have maintained if not grown your mental faculties o many seem extremely sharp i promise you you are not missing a be a one always wonders right i that one of the most common fears people have as that somehow they are losing their mind or their memory and people are and they are not aware of it i here i family members who have asked that if they ever start to exhibit signs of severe to men she that i well put an end to them which i will not am that is not my place in this world a but i think it is a common fear among among people but your still extremely sharp and thank goodness for it and and you mention that where you have lost certain abilities that now appreciation and new abilities have surface you perhaps share what some of those are and and what the mean to you u because i think that when one hears about somebody having a stroke we tend a focus on what is what is lacking but clearly this has been a transformitive experience also in positive ways well i had to confront some of my own demons i had to confront the sense that i expected things out of live and here ism there taken away and i i'mi'm kind of ungrateful for being alive and here ism pistol that it takes me ten minutes to time my shoes and i cannot really butt in my shirt i had to learn but really matters and to have patience and stuff the other thing was i used to love fighting as very physically active and ism sitting at my window in my office and see people running up and down circling walking their dog god ism envious if i had if i could walk a dog right now i be the happiest person alive but then i go through a thought process which maybe is not completely healthy which is they are not aware of how wonderful it is just to walk a dog but ism aware of it when i go out in my back yard and i cannot walk and ism seeing i knows it is going to sound really treacly and set to mental but i see butterflies or things in my garden ism was that is incredible thinks that that i i could not appreciate before because ism ism sedentary and i cannot move i have to suddenly pay attention to what is around me not take it for granted and fine and suck all the pleasure out of it that i can now when i sit at my desk to write my new book it is four hours as it is all i can stand maybe three sometimes those four hours are such bliss for me i truly appreciate it now because i know that my brain was almost gone right it means much for me and it just be alive is is is is this s a wondrous experience i have a chapter my new book called awaken to the strangeness of being alive and it is about the fact that if you think about it and how unlikely it is that we humans evolved at all even that we even exist all the bottle next revolution that we had to pass through including the disappearance of the dona sort in the emergence of mama's but therefore twenty other huge bottle next throughout the history of evolution we had to pass through all of those we nearly went extinct eighty thousand years ago from some virus that infected there only eight thousand people humans on the planet all these different things and here we are with fume meetings et center et camera it is the strangest story you can ever it is beyond science fiction but nobody thinks about nobody sits down i goes god ism alive if you went back to the chain of people that had to connect and have children leading up to your parents the unlikeliness of you ever being born is astronomical an unless my science is all wrong seventy thousand generations of people meeting et center et camera finally yo ending at your done i mean to unless i missing something it is it is pretty unlikely but nobody thinks about it wile i certainly think about it now because i almost diet i have nothing else to think about uts i have to entertain my brain the way melton prison had to entertain himself by observing people it is taken a lot away from me i cannot swim ism writing my my recumbent bike which i love and eight year old grandmothers are zipping by me and got how awful i envious ism my insecurities all well up but then i is hey i i i on a boat ism sailing it is wonderful ism outside u know i have to go through these processes but i think it is develop me in some way that is ten in the end very positive till think you have had to adjust to a new frame rate on life that the the old move had a certain frame rate this move has a certain frame rate but that within that frame rate therefore gifts to be had that you certainly missed in your prior version of self that that ayah but also i tell people this i totally took my life for granted i i was swimming all this time i was fantastic i was pisyclling i was travelling but i never set back an thought while this is wonderful how grateful it is could be taken away from you i tell people do not do that to yourself i try to teach them it can be taken away from to morrow when you are out walking the dog think of me think of me that cannot walk a dog and appreciate those things which i did not appreciate i try and help people in that way when i can i i think a critical messages also to inspire a sense of urgency in people i think people here sense of urgency and the h i am already under much pressure life hard but we are not talking bout a sense of urgency to take on more of what life has to offer a i think we are talking about a sense of urgency to fine one's purpose which takes work and is an on going process but to really get out of modes of apathy laziness a languishing and to start as you have described it paying deeper attention i may this is a a concept that was superimportant for me to hear about and i learned about it from you was how do you get yourself out of a rut you start paying deeper attention to the things around you and inside you and perhaps not coincidentally you referred to that as quote death ground ye it is what it is the strategy from my book i roger book on strategy my version of the art of war called thirty three strategies of awards really about strategy the strategic thinking it is inspired from sun so ta great chines strategist but it has vast philosophical implications the idea is you can almost think of it barometric pressure when necessity is pressing in on you your back is against the wall you have to get something done and there is this pressure around you you find energy in the that you never believed before willing names talks about this and en he talks about getting a second wind i explains it very eloquently when you feel your life's in danger suddenly you can you can leap over things that you never could leap over before sons says put an army on death ground and it will fight and till it is in winds meaning put an army with its back to the ocean or a back to the mountain and it is either win or die there can a fight ten times harder your gin to find the energy in you that you normally lack when death is facing you in the face or urgency or dead lines or people pressing in on you when that barometric pressure loosens up and there is none of it you think you have all the time in the world you get nothing done well man ism twenty three have got all these years ahead of me ell on a figurate out right ism not going to die have got fifty seventy eighty years ahead of me no you do not that pressure now is gone and your wasting time you you are your doing all sorts of things that are not leading to any kind skill your not learning or anything you need to put yourself on death grunting you to feel that barometric pressure which is the actual reality the actual realities you could die to morrow you can have a stroke to morrow your you coal be fired to morrow everything could fall apart you need to have that sense of urgency now because that is the reality you are fooling yourself by thinking you have all this time and when you feel that pressure suddenly you can move mountains you you have energy your life that you just have focus et camera neurologically everything clicks in and people who have had that experience where they where they felt that the ship was going on her and they better get their act together and survive they talk about all these physical processes i have a story in my new book i not boring him o l b the quite the opposite about a mountain climber who o he e he was climbing this mountain by himself and he was having a great that of a storm coming and he had to get down and he suddenly fell and he cut his leg open massively and it was a branch sticking in it and he broke all these bones and he was use die he's on a ledge he could see that it was getting dark and and storm clouds were were massing them can be was in the rocky mountains he was alone and suddenly he managed to get up on his two feet and he cannot explain how but all of this energy all this endrenant started flowing in them and said he was a mountain goat he was going down the ledge he jumped he was able to kind of get down to another ledge his he got it he got out of it and for for the next twenty years it was haunted by how did that happened i want that feeling again because it was actually the most ecstatic feeling i had energy that i never suspected in myself and he tries everything to get that feeling back he tries climbing other month he tries going to to mount ever if he try that and it does not come back and finally he thought kind of figures out formula fort and why it happened he studies a lot of negro sides it is a great book i music in my nuwbookits called bone bone games is very interesting book a lot of sides in it i and he got the feeling back in is smaller sense but it was the feeling of your life is in danger i better get my act together or it is the end and suddenly a dranolen dopamine all the other things were cursing in him and he got and he found that energy i that is that is the ultimate kind of death groundright there the human will to live is truly incredible and see i have to say as i said before ism grateful that your stroke did take you out because clearly there is still much in there and you are continuing to share a what is really exquisitely useful knowledge is just as

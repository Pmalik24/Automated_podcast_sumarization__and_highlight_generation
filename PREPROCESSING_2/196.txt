i is many people who have films that they have watched over and over and i have never really got that i was fee there is many films that i have not seen why would i watch one again but we get to these conversations and there always comes a moment where ism asked hell what is the film that you have seen the most and then i have to admit it is the besides adventure which i know is not a good film it is this seventy's move about an ocean liner that gets it by i sonar flips upside down and the passengers tried to make their way to safety it is part of an entire jonrof films disaster films that v never gotten any respect nobody thinks of these films as a it but i loved it at the time when i so it it felt big and i felt important and serious an i remember it was very of emotional and the reason that i saw it many times that this is the film that i saw more than any other was not cause i loved the film itscause o where i saw it is on vacation we did not take many vacations when i was a kid but on one of them we stated at this hotel an flared were the rooms had this thing where they offered a couple movies all day long anything's is long ago and the nineteen seventies my sisters and i we had never seen anything that even cable t v was rear back that but beside an indenture with the film that they offered and my sister crew and i we eat it up that was the iffy we watch over and over again yo as o this was a very importantving that are and ears in zap my nephew who we tried to explain this percent my we entered up watching it on t v at night if our parents one ut to dinner or if ere was a rainy day yet we loved it the way that i remember it is that is that the hotel just had this move on a loop and it would just as soon as it would finish it would start again and the way i remember it is that every time we would come into the hotel room you could turn on the t v and you would be someone in the beside conjecture et sounds vaguely familiar to me i do not totally remember that but that might be right y and i remember it having a lot of feeling do youemember it having lot of feeling what does it mean having a lot of feeling lit every meting yells a lot of emotions ye wit carry and you really invested in their journey to escape alive i do not think ism getting anything way by saying that sort a here the raider she these last three weeks have ben talking about the random films that people have strong attachments to thinking that might be a good episode the shell and i started to think by the besides adventure an i wondered what it would be to see it again would it have any feeling what any of it feel the way it did to me as a kid would be away to care my sister and i we watched it and i invited zap to since he is the age that we were when we watched it back in seventies he is to thirteen i was fourteen at the time carat was eleven and i when is there i did not expect exact to it he does not i lot of films and right away very foreseen let us know the kind of film we were in for i a little boy visits the bridge of the assess boson this ocean liner in the middle of a big storm and the w boy is greeted by the captain who is played by maser nelson who at this point had not made the career transition to parody characters this captor so as lo o i a go on on li en i we s on line what mind does lines si as i did not remember how winced the acting got some places when anis lorgnon shows at it is care that the nineteen fifty six so one of her best actor is not i one of his best rolls of he angry organ does seem to shout nearly every one of his lines in the film when they have got a done me and i did not expect seen the om again was how much of the dialogue i remember from decades to go and vas all surprised realize an i do not know what this as about me the lines that i remember the most i the little comic zingers i when a remember is ask to he is married i know his corny response for he says it no marriage for me missus rose i got a mistress la the see es thenhny i did remember and remember liking from the film was it this is an old fashion enough move the producers tried to insert some big ideas into the adventure all means es big ideas are provided by gene hackman who play a rebellious young priest in turtle make his big theological idea is a very conveniently helpful one for e we were about to be capsized in mover the ocean god does not want you to wait for miracles yet to take matters into your own hands do not prat to god its a your rob is from a sermon delivers early in the film at the does the quite for yourself got wat a sol wat witters not quitters i you cannot a at we try away he comes back to this over and over through the film rowing the passengers to fight arm i loved that is than nature that there was this ideal is to guy with this principal that he trying to live by and this idea about god that the film is tasting and i have to say seeing it to day i still loved it that the put that end there my mi he soon enough read at the struck of midnight on new years eve the venom hits the boat flits the plot to n the wreckage of the upside down i is party tin hacking cons es on e eight passengers that they should not stay in win o god to send rescuers a clime with him the safety please got the meet from wacko back very escaping the rising waters they go the ceilings of the rooms of the fours of they walk on in the fours of the seal and s the fiery upset on kitchen the group slippery ladders and inverted staircases and by the time they start dying one by one the carbon and me and even fact is no job were in it we care ye she just ell the hard wen i she just have the target ta yes wo that's pretty random lot not really think about the fact that she just lets femme out of shape after missus roman the dance gamma an the film dies her husband discovers her dead body e likewise going to be son i remember this moment hen i remember the really well this was very affected give been really in less yours mess sortorgid you do feel very invested yet an slake in long hermits can a happen nights unlike most other louis i wondered if zap was con to feel the same big feelings that i felt for the film at his age and til we did woos o dons no o he dies too no the worse closes no by the time ye get the gean hacking's big climactic speech to god qi w e g was i you it is clear the side an venture it does is job it gets to you but thin he by the experience tat zap had watching the film and the one that i was having it is different right for me twas walking into a room for my child good home and finding it in tact and exactly how i remembered it or we weld get to a scene and i would remember things and realize i remember is reading a a no for that the want to move together we think were watching the same thing but we are not me the beside adventures portal back to that vacation and being in that tearoom with cabin an knowing those move stars from other things they made in just that whole time in my lot i cannot hos that that going when do be easy chico is the samaritan life of or a glass to day on our program were a point in the end of i were many of us are still not going out to move theatres and we thought here it a show let us nor moving nit the t a show about movies and t e particular we decided to get people who have watched the film over and over you see something that most people do not see films to which they ore an audience of won these stories about how we connect the films sometimes very deep we but some of the very strange and random ways stay wit he at one many things she ought to understand what our producers dial wo spend most of her life thinking that she did not have a unique and personal take on the film the sound of music he sound o music after all have ready loves it what is her to say and then she or now her big is very different i watched the sound of music all the time as it kid it was one of maybe six we cess tapes we had at home along with baby an hundred on delmacions and a few years ago i wast talking with her friend about how much i loved to the may be going up and he said me too though the not sea scared me and i said what not sense and that is when i learned it'd never seen the second half of the film he turns out the move came out in a two v cs bock set and i for stories and had only ever seen the first tape my dad does not remember a seconder and why would you need when the first half makes perfect sense on it sow here is the plot it is a move about a woman name maria who as sent to the country side to a by set a giant family of children with the mean dad the on traps maria shows up bubbly fun and thee chest them to sing and playing be kill against the wishes of her father but the singing when an over they sing together as a family and finally at a party the kidding a beautiful song for the guests farewell and after that maria having successfully five the family laves just many popinstid and she fixed that family and that is the end of the move i had very clear one memories of the goat heard puppet show and the scene in the gazebo were lease the oldest daughter secretly met with the man man she was in love with and they sang and danced and it was romantic i had no further questions about any of the characters when i learned that there were seventy more minutes to the film i did not bother going to look for them the sound of music was a full complete and wonderful artifact from my childhood i didn't want a taint it with not sense but when my chapel order lend who is producing the week show and is a musical theatre fan which i most definitely am not when she found out i still had not seen the whole thing it seemed heretical to her she could not let it stand we watched it together over the in her net one sundae afternoon and i prepared to have a childhood memory either slightly enhanced or completely ruined before we started she had me predict what was on to be in the second half i why base to and this is base on my childhood memory and just what i would to see is it is the second half is just focus ah in my favorite two characters level and the hot man man i want to see their sort ship and and then they get married and that the end of that the my we had play and started at the very beginning started with a part i know and the first half was more or less the simple sunny move i remembered seeing the kindly and dower nuns come on screen early on was recognizing teachers i had in elementary school refer mote chest a bevy i simply can't fin by there is that gazibosian when the madman and lease sing to each other in started of on seventy i ta i i then whirl around the gazebo dancing oi gat this still six six mat watching now though i saw a lot of things that i had completely missed as a kid because as a child it apparently ignored anything that adults who were not maria said to each other literally none of that dialogue registered was the mumbly grown up in charge around my kid self had edited full characters out of the film i barely remembered the baroness who once to marry the dad this really is exciting folly gale be here wit you treesword mot rush wanted table that is not what i mead you do it any of their hotlines that were not resolved in the first half but i also missed of course how maria and the dad supposedly fall in love the dad by the way was even meaner than i remembered just cruel to maria o what be try at o we bust phonon web try but at an ha and one and because of that i still had a lot of troubles squaring the idea that anything between the two of them was remotely remanded he thinks shes cine half if you but tit is not true a they really spell it out body youyou must get flat surly eve noticed the way he looks into nice and you blasted in i tin en you i justice one romance that still sparkled was between lease in the mail man tho watching again i have to say the madman was not as cut as i remembered it is the male mad o he candle lie an mats rape the man man comes back later in the first half to throw rocks on weasel's window that moment i remember again dreamy but the one that followed was completely over my head as a kid i did see i mean it did do your his hitter his hitter ye hill hitter the hero of my version of the sound of music who it'd hoped the second half would center around he was the noisy also not the male man yes he was wearing a uniform and delivering messages but he was not employed by the postal serves as my child'self had understood he was some kind of military messenger the first half his peppered with a humor since this that things are going to take a turn historically in the second half of the move uneasy talk about austria flags and something called an onsluce but all against the backdrop of a glamorous party the kind of easy to miss if you are seven the last thing i miss of a kid the big title card that is says intermission in yellow script that comes on screen after maria closes the door maybe was on a second bagged lend and i asked forward through the music at intermission and the second have tar mi daddy ai get a laid ai e i see for you a this really beard you haven't thing any this we except does the second half starts i suddenly feel i have seen all of these watching the children play bad on their back yard felt strangely familiar six it spent much time already with e on traps at their home that this new seen just felt part of my memories this confusing data sticks with me all the way through the scenes of maria back at the abbey its not until the dad goes to meet maria the gazebo and declare his love for her that i am certain i have never seen this before you no won i u sot i loving you at not of e en the when you sheet on the porticulous on to away i knew the fist time you beetcity will o my guide o this is gross they basically just stared at each other three times an acari was letting this horrible man marry her i could not believe just as ism settling in to the newness of the second half locking at mark is wedding dress everything in the move shifts the not sees wollinto town it is incredibly abrupt e cut from literal wedding bells to a bell tolling over a giants mastic a flag on the town square lines of soldiers march across the plaza ominously the caller seem to drain out of the me the children show up next in drab brown close against the stony back drop instead of their perky curtain outfits from the first half the characters meanwhile ire dealing with their own with lash rape surprises lease as she is getting into a cart rebel easel o a ism basically as excited to see rape as level is right here because maybe this is when we get to the version of the second half it'd been wanting to see dolphin weasel's courtship raise cad to see you e groan you'll take this place and to liberty your father as soon as she comes home ouch rape he standing in front of a noisy flag weasel is clearly disoriented but still hopeful as she holds the telegram and coil asks do not you want to come over to night die rices ism not occupied with a more important bait and your fallthe bet of be too be knows what is good for but a ales a you chose a bad one this was the only relationship in the move that interested me at all is a child and it sobering to see the whole realistic ark of it as for the rest of the second half it is predictable their first escape is not can a work out it is obvious thill wen the singing contest great songs from the first affair just recycled in a weird way the one moment that moves me though does not have anything to do with the characters i was attached to from the first half it happens surprisingly when the dad start singing a love song to his country on stage he is doing it as an active gentle defiance that makes the not see officials mustache twitch and as the crowd joins in with him i feel my throat cutch a little they remind me of people all around the world tho summer in honking they route bellaroose here in apricot were longing to hold on to something as their own country change rapidly excruciatingly around them the darkest moment of the move is perhaps s at the very end when the family has almost escaped but then rape finds them in the abbey he raises a whistle to turn them in but the dad stops and reasons with him you do not really belong to them starry was come away with us was to rape looks scared and boyish he really crashes his gun and leans over relieved but then the do takes at one step too far you will not up be one of them rape chooses to betray ton it such a sinister and to senencsene held up against the in can be first half the family still makes it out in time but in spite of him not with his help an that is the actual end of them is far as i know tan here's my conclusion having seen it all he do not need the second half it's actually better without it the second half just takes one of my kidself's favorite characters rape and makes him a villain then takes the worst character the dad and makes him a hero there are barely any new songs maria disappears as a person weasel just looks uncomfortable the whole time trying to act a child for another hour everything memorable and i conic about the move my favorite things the kidsinging good night doh a dear that will happens in the first half but then i was at the beach this we get with her friend staring at the clouds in the kids thing sand and he said a thing that changes my feeling about the second half he told me that lately he can last about three minutes feeling everything is normal before he remembers it is not it made me understand the urged and clear the dark end of this story and the move about the singing family be cause once everything in the world o his changed he cannot really will it to stay outside the frame than will is one of the produces of our show coming out your acts wife has few thoughts about your marriage and she makes move about that that is not sound that is going to be a good experience for you that is in a minute from chicagobobagradio when our program continues is mac life my glass to day in our programmed at this point in the pandemic were many of us are still not going out to move theatre we thought here at our programmed let us do a moving night a show about movies the stories by people who see something that most of us do not see in some film to dash is a rerun we have arrived at at two of our programmed at two putting the ease in disease back when they pandemic first took hold a lot of people were watching or rematching the move contagion which originally came out in twenty eleven maybe you have seen this it is about a deadly and fastspreading virus that is spread by respiratory drop lets goes round the world governments fail to contain it and i think when we watchful that or read books about the nineteen eighteen flew cause it just an scratches this itch were we once some way to think about what we are going through writ now and it is just nice to see somebody else go through some version of it on of our producers a chancel has never seen contagion it be fenisopturning to this other move a movyou better virus you've probably never heard of it is a very different seen on the subject toucan you will not find this moving on net legs or you too or anywhere that at least i could not find it that way i finally had to order a d v d from an online vintage move store it is clear my copy was pirated off cable skips a lot and all of the contagion makes i was floored by some of the parallels to now especially given that the move came out in nineteen sixty eight more than half a century ago for instance in this move instead of a bat the vector of the virus is a bird a two can that stowed away aboard a green freighter somewhere near central america then the boat docks in new york harbor for inspection and the first mate alerts the military that a lot of the three is sick u a a a an par a a a to a a a a i e o a you a o on you ta o o ho a a i on eat the two can is still on board held in a makeshift chicken wire fence but then it gets loose lies straight into the city and starts infecting people just a few at first the mayor of new york an empty suit motivated mostly by money and pull numbers holds a press conference speaking into a microphone labelled w and see the public radio station in new york where used to work weird there is that plumy no cars roar only party seven cases of the report o car ut we u however make or o become but you were i vertical ma you are public he holds up a mask exactly the one i were every day after the reporters leave though there is deep concern in dread the health commissioner and older anthany touchy type scolds the mayor for underplaying the thread every one's facing true we can light on the party seven of porter doctors but be when you you good you go got to a doctor or o o i i

one is stirring around the city in a masked panic business is suffered the presidential envoy fast tracts the development of a backseat if it ware not for the twenty footling cob cars and aline mod dresses it feels some of these scenes could have been shot in manhattan last week end except there is one major difference between this film and the seven soda burg and contain reality were all living in because in this moving the virus its not fatal it does not even cause a fever or cough instead the main and only symptom is absolute euphoria that is it every one it in facts experiences unbridled happiness and elation it is victims began acting kindly to one another deferential in just a couple days the city is transformed from this i yo ya i g g i a a i o o a gan you c i a a a a o yo yo on i yo a i walk to this e monk a i spa me i help you the movies called what bad about feeling good it is a comedy from come really and it is not a good moving which is why you likely have not heard of it even though the lead actors are gorge paper from breakfast at litanies in the eighteen and merry title more from merrytitermore and they do a good job pretty much every one in the cast is really skilled but the full production is out lavishly campy an caricaturist here are few very awkward choices cartoon word balloons emerged from the two can's mouth sometimes when it quacks so what it is thinking oh and there is a schmalz a m radio themesong kind of a knock off of bird back a on a happyentatian ta en nation what s baby an yo that is said it is also a great moving n the way that silly be movies can be satisfied especially the a came one that make you feel a ki d watching a dull mess up for the first time give the greatest hits list of them in my head wild in the streets about ages hippies waging a who against the west government a invasion of the be girls about a race of murderous women we were also bees both of which you can watch on line for free but since it is hard to find a copy of this move let me just continued taking through the pot in a kind of abbreviated radioified cliff's new version for your move not going enjoyment you a gorge bayard and marytalemore are pet

robot kenned dead police battle demonstrators in the streets also sea long storm us embassy we were a nasion at war both abroad and with itself the protests and riots and cities across the country and he presidential candidate running on a platform of law an order and also courting segregationists and given all that you might ask what is bad about feeling good which is what the mayor in the move wanted to know in one of the first crisis management meetings with his cab went they are running down the symptoms for him until the virus stops people from brooding but it is worse than that is the

meantime pet much to fizz's horror has shaved off his beard cut his hair and is talking about trying to get his old advertising job back which which digression interests me because it is the opposite

straight believe you me for ma time of course it satire and in that way it is cathartic but when i got to that scene it suddenly felt every other part of the move had been an escape from was going on it is funny that one of the most ludicrous pieces of dialogue as also practically a quote we have heard in the news in twenty twenty and not as a joke much more of the story left but just to a brig they finally managed to isolate the virus amazingly because it is move they develop a valine that day but they still have to test it out they spray it in pet and fizzes nuptial bed in the hotel room of their spending their wedding night and set up a hidden camera behind the air van everybody in the bunker the mayor the touchy character j harder mono all of them sit and monster the couple on a big

man row watching on the monitor from the bunker is liked we e a a a a a o finger cate of it and i do not know what this says about me but of all the scenes in the move this is the one i remember the most clearly from the first time i saw it actually kind of carried it around all of these years cause it is genuinely sad lie looks her heart is breaking in real time say a be an coin your curious ago i i men the para ran i can o bad could not ma a and o la pet shrugs you your sin o out about a positive real positive there is a happy ending lie decides to leave new york and move home but at the very last minute she goes to say good bye to a ego the bird who is in amu now and pet's there too a we do that from come running thing and just that they're back together the city spurs the boxing into the air by a factory chimneys and exhaust pipes and most of new york lives miserably ever after but some people stay pleasant and uplifted because major plot twist fifty per cent of the people who seem to be infected actually never got the virus in the first place the joy just rubbed off on them and lie was one of those people which is why she did not get quoting quote better in the hotel room which is actually the moral of the move that happiness is a choice but watching the move during this pandemic i drew another darker conclusion somehow that willy weird jolt of recognition i got over and over again what it felt was this is how it goes when face with ha crisis this governments will minimize the severity of the danger the value the wrong things focus on the economy over people's lives and blame foreigners in an ugly xenophobic way ism sure there is version of america were all that math not happen but we are not living in that america right now and pet and lie were not living in it either if it is possible for human beings to do the wrong thing we will figure out away we are resourceful that johnkol is one of produces of a show m area are rectors cut shortedays by people who have a very particular take on some film and the person in the s next try finds himself in to situation that not many a service to been his ex wife decided to revisit the part of the wives as their marriage fell apart and make a move about it anyway about a couple whose life seems very very parallel to theirs in lots of ways this fictional couple gets married really young the thing to make it in a way the woman gets a big brag she leaves the husband at that point a happened in rear life too the guy's name's willwelden on ta baker explains what happened next will heard about the move from some friends when his back's wife started working on it the very thought of it made him anxious his acts rebec e eventually brought et up with him she said the film was only loosely based on their marriage which definably did not help he tried to put it out of his head a year and half later he was scrawling around on mine and i saw on face book people posting the trailer for the move and being a go see this move if it is in atheatrener you cause was made by rebec ataman and she is great and funny and i saw those popping up an then i just had this moment where i was oh the moment is here and that was when i was filled with the most get what were those thoughts for me i was the thing i was the most afraid of is that the move would portray me accurately wills camped about his was admits he was kind of a dot as a husband willing rebec that when she was twenty three he was just nineteen they were to gather for eight years married for almost five during that time he was mostly on i place though he eventually started doing part time work walking dogs and house sitting he did some stand up but not very often mostly had spend his time refreshing locker or i was playing place station or i was literally just sitting there thinking about how i should be doing something i was not really i had no actual rolls and i was not striving for anything that was i think the defining quality that ended our marriage because she was the ambitious fun and disciplined she wanted to be a try writer she would wake up early to work on scraps and when he watched the trailer that was in it and she is the harder worker and actually wants things i got the do y they tire me as a writer sing the trail i made it much worse now he realized the films probably returned him to some very painful times he would rather not relive liked the way their marriage ended to me at the time it really fell it came out of nowhere she got home from work and and she just head a very very strange the way people will start they will be then she set me down and she was just telling me about how she was unhappy and the relationship an she had been for a long time on they me being she it just i do not know why this has not why none of this has come up before i just loved her and i did not i really fell we shoe trying give it another chance and she was like do not know and at a certain point we were talking and i was who will we fooling here it really seems you are done and this is done and she was look well moved out after just a week started crashing on friends couched he was devastated didn't understand what ism wrong and there re other seems from their lives that he would hate to seen i move ism sure there will be conversations with her major her sister and her friend i do not know if they were come on girl you get it dump i those well probably be the toughest parts cause i imagine those will be things that will be very base in reality t film which is called paper year came out in early twenty teen it is got seventy one person on on tomato critic's comment on how authentic the couples love coming on don feels for a while well could not bring himself to see it but a month ago he suggested we watch it together and i was into the idea ism going through a divorce right now it is a very strange time of life i go on a lot of long walks i stopped watching television for a year i would not avoid my feelings all i read ourself help books and when i go to parties i corner divorce people and badger them for details about what this was for them and how they got through it divorce is my own personwill disaster porn watching in move about a divorce with the person who had happen to it is all i wanted it and well thought it would make it easier for him to see it for the first time this is a better way to view it with other people in just it is three in the morning ism along the torahs have gotten up in secret and i watching it in the middle of the night li a just deny having ever seen it if i want to i met willwern he was staying he is stop sitting at a sleep lost ageless home over looking a canyon furry throw a pillows and open lay out pomegranate and lemon trees framing your view if the valley all really expensivewill is on highland any time i move anything he is careful to put it back exactly where it had been are we ready hhhhehsure a i in a flag you veurrimwers the move opens with the couple can and granny getting married in a court house which will an rebec all to day can lifts granny and carries er out the couple starts out really in love having lots of sucks laughing kissing in back is your ash ye a i never had a rash so a so o o it the taking bell the guys job in the film dog said eagles he is got the rascal don't you this good with can i just point out the dog that your house sitting in this move is literally the same breeder dot that is sitting under the table art now ye it is a neck rustle chaw mix that he is dog sitting and i am also do sitting a neck rustle coal er mix in fact the house in the filmed damn framing you their dog sitting is a lot the house will and i are sitting in at this very moment similar lay out in do core same view this complete now i want to finish us in another scene frankly is sitting at her computer working on a secret can is trying to get her attention just you why you do not yo on w water the real lifeersion of this would actually play out a little differently less fun and more sad i well says he would do everything he could to get out of her way when she was working i would just disappear it'd wheels a t v into the bedroom and watch it in there just it would not be distracting the move which it'll ad it ism the targadadience for i liked it marriage made frankly unhappy in the same way it made me unhappy my life had ended i spent much time thinking about whether or not i wanted to be with my husband but i could not tell him that we had nothing to talk about because if he asked me what i was thinking the real answer would have been ism not sure if i love you any more the scene that well feared but frantic confiding in her mam an friends about all her husband's terrible qualities and everyone saying what they really think of him that never happens there is no seen where anyone bad mouths him none at all no one tells anyone to dump the loser instead what happens as much more interesting late in the film granny sits down to talk to her mama about her marriage in the scene she is trying to convince herself to stay with him bat everything pi well sits forward in his seat the day is marriage fell apart well came home and rebec was on the couch crying she said she would been talking er er mama but he never knew what their conversation was about he felt he was getting to see it now in the scene granny played by person talks to her mama played by and my dell maybe it is just lit the first year we marriage just hordes yo that old saying it can a few years look back in in la they look at me that sons bathe first year she be past the was not on of us up stick around because it only gets hoarder much charter it is ah it is just sucks seeing how upset she is that sucks she felt really bet is just a bad feeling for some one to have to go through you are seeing how hard it was for her what just i i do not think i was incorrect to focus on my own struggles during the whole process of splitting up but it did cant of prevent me from stinging about hers as well i just did not have as much of it appreciation for the difficulty of it the misery that goes into that choice it is sat it also is a little bit of a relief that was hard for her if it had been very easy for her to innings i would have felt such absolute trash am if just one day she come on be yo what not for me by pal but that is the story you have kind of been telling yourself a for years will had been telling himself the same version of their break up something he would sand paper down into this rebec got her big break and then she dumped hideout of the blow he was heartbroken she was happy and thriving moving on was easy for her be watching this it came flooding back at least a year maybe more when rebec was sad before their break up it was time travelling through all this pain that he deleted from his memory we asked rebec to come talk about her move with will she met us at the house where well were halt setting it is a little awkward the talk about the weather and traffic in the six years since their marriage ended they have never had a conversation about it and for her understandably this did not seem the best way to begin one by talking about her move it has a they mean this son certain sense it has nothing to do with will it is is own move it is not a documentary i a kind of object to the idea that were in a read into this move we are to use it of some kind of secret code understand this real life relationship that existed but also i fell the way you say it thing i was it just meed a move was just a move li where you reading into the foxy but i fee there are it is more it is more specifically related to an experience that you had sure but ism not not the a first person to do such a thing had i to dog walk well be i i said that is thy i know i was he is going a dogs it and can i have no ambition ye i i also i guess i always thought of that character as not some one without ambition but someone who was afraid and ism not that that is not me looking at you going that was that that is really who you are well tells rebec what he told me how the most emotional part of the move was seen her side of things how how hard it was for her to decide to break out a and then to finally do it it it felt bad because it was just her trying to justify not ending it or trying to convince herself it will git better and that was a very emotional thing for made and the most affecting part of the move hard to watch is it because it reminded you of that last big conversation we had that was emotional it it felt bad because it reminded me of you having to do yourself kind of all of the recognizing of the problems in the relationship i had i just had not ever considered the journey to coming to that point in that conclusion and how difficult it is to do that clear rind the missions think i mean is the now the part of the show we just talk to a bra that you want me to respond ye i i mean do not really want to get into it but that was a really tough periods were really kind of weirdly dark confusing times and i think that is what i wrote this it was not i was trying o rite this you would understand something oi was doing it that i could understand something i feel i mean i i obviously relate to this because i ism going through divorce i left my husband a year ago and o more personal fou my marriage seems really similar tires my husband was rustling an employed i was and one who was working all the time neither was were happy and i had to be the one to call at or if knew and i have to say i wish he would give me credit i it was really awful and hard and heartbreaking and i was tormented by it in who as the hardest decision i ever made am and i just i this is my dream realization that my partner could ever have which is to say o my god you it was hard for you too dead are you getting mat er you getting my projecting no i mean ism it is just am we have been broken up forhowlong now over six were ye i mean that i have not been bending much of that time going thinking oh i hope will understands my perspective some day i i think have just i think it is really nice that that that that maybe there is some kind of mutual middle ground that we are seeing it from but i think that i just it was a have for me to let will have his own pat through it well had a story of how things ended that was cemented in his in and without the film he would have gone on thinking it cherry picking the moments that made him fill the worst rebec as if he win your act understand your break up the best way probably is not to make a move about it it is away too much work and money and the most likely out come is that they'll hate you for it a a down the baker is one the producers of our show sic reverse this story both will and rebec each have got married rebec as i new t rich called guilty party on

sometimes superstar he get's respect for that body likes this is a media boss mat thinks that there is nobody better at games in any of the eleven amusement parks on by their parent company neuter fair it coils working one of the smallest to the eleven parks other game's managers bigger parks bringing way more money to for dos and games an the grand scheme of things is actually the smallest revenue producer at most amusement parks the biggest money in an a amusement park comes from ticketsals a'mscred at body be freed than march and then bringing up the reader his games but cold does has less effect on the company's bottom mine than lot's of people in the company and as much as cold loves this job he cannot but wonder how long can a person do this jo the one thing that i always say is

supposed to get a job too but on our fourth night there still without work i sat on the edge of my bed and felt that sense of being a failure this feeling would eventually become a staple in my life something it'd grow comfortable with in bars aims offices and bedrooms but just then the feeling was strange and new and i did not quite know what to do with it we lived in a coed boarding house run by a woman with a face a clenched fist named missus deed i spent my days hanging out at van's balloon stand where his boss finally became tired of having me around that he pulled some strings to get me a job working as a change boy at an arcade if you walked down the board walk there was a point where it looked the fun had come to an end my arcade was just a few yards past that do you never ware

singer group in an in any hall you have still got beats of parlors games with unsinkable crimes and the vague threat of violence about to a rock in other words wildwood had not changed much back then everything looked nineteen eighty six now nineteen eighty seven though as it turns out the arcade worked at his long on even at the time all the other arcades were carpeted an air condition but mine was an outhouse with all the oldest ad swankiest games while their joysticks having had the joy jerked right out of them years earlier on the fourth of jury i remember watching the fireworks through a little crack in the wall right above the donkey long machine i felt a young tony montane just having come to america except the only person i wanting to gill was myself oh oh oh o oh being a human

large complicated dragon tat to she told me it was a chines winged and that an old biker boy friend had given it to her it started at her neck and slithered all the way down into her pans to blow across the tundra in the afternoon when business was slow nancy would come by and tell me about how mike had just been over pleading on my behalf and how she tried to explain to him that we was just

time he photoplay as it turns out she is his wife we met on this very board walk duty might spend his day getting fired at an a cage but at least on his time off he has some one the talk to some one with whom to share of the secret week talks on his armor back when i live there wildwood had this reputation for being a big party town people were supposed to be scoring not on the board walk every night and actually they were the only real action i got that summer though was in the form of a single kiss i later referred to it as the kiss that run my summer it happened while i was out walking on the board walk late one night i saw a group of older girls maybe in their early twenties coming toward me one of them a little ahead of the others was sort of spinning with her arm stuck out and her long blond hair all over the place just as she got right up close to me she grabbed the back of my neck and put her lips right on mine i remember as she pulled back i spastically grabbed on to her wrist i did not wand er to leave her friends had to pry my fingers off one at a time and she stood there smiling at me all stoned and airy that night back at the boarding house in our room i spent the rest of the evening obsessing as n might have been the last one it'd receive until i got married that kiss pretty much felt my swinging backbone but in yeshiva it'd be the mysterious one with the pass for the rest of the summer i could not pass a woman on the board walk without thinking that we should somehow be meeting in a kiss bout that is how should really be it turned walking along the board walk into a relentless drill if small but horrible disappointments i did not know it then but that summer was prove the best one i have as a the anger even though i was work an indentured servant to giving every penny of my earnings to missus see even though i made no friends and even though i only made it to the beach but once where i sat on a mildly boarding house washcloth exhausted and pale that whole summer felt some big fat vacation just because i was sixteen and away for my parents for the first time when i got back home i did not end of going to shiva i did not bring home any pen plus money or happy romantic memories but i did bring back a pair of black hands covered in small white skulls they were really baggy and i had to wear them with ten inch cuffs at the bottom but when i showed up for my first day back at school i thought i looked really punk long i fight any one who never been ell but they were the pans of some one who got ell all summer long p john an the gold

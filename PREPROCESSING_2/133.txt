iron release is five america to house arrest after jobidon pays them six billion dollars the house overly chometevous to super o the bisons and a mass of brawl breaks out between a group of white offenders and a group of black defenders in albata ism benthpirtisis venthperro so benshpir showsponserby express we plan i talk about them every single show i have not on a we plan yet at express we plan right out express we piazza come less ben join has found a new group of people to bribe this is now i guess how we do business if you have a w and b a player who is not really famous cause she is a bun big player who goes to russia and brings with her drugs and then she is a rested and she is stuck in jail yes unjustly we are what could be trade to get her back and the answer is the merchant of death which again bad trade white socks go level trading right there a merchant to death for for bitty grinder well now we have a similar type of trade iron apparently has released from prison five america but has place them under house arrests he nocthual being fully released on not being sent back to the united states here just under house arrest an tavern which sounds a real parties being stuck in a house in tavern what exactly to we have to do to get them out of jail and into house arrest which again is its own sort of prison in tavern all we had to do as give them access to six billion dollars in oil revenue for one vote humanitarian purposes by humanitarian purposes iron means terrorism and nuclear development a statement from the national securedals i security council spokes person drain wagons as quote we have received confirmation that on has released from prison five america who are unjustly detained and has placed them on house arrest hell this is not encouraging stop these you us citizens seimacnamazi moral tabs an went share an to america with this time wished remain private should never have been detaining the first place we will continue monitor the condition as closely as possible of course we will not rest until they are all back home in the united states until that time negotiations for their eventually release remain ongoing and our delicate we will therefore have little in the way of details to provide about the state of their house rest or about our efforts to secure their freedom just to do the mouth former for those horn thakonamat that is one point to billion dollars per hostage ah i you think may be a on is going to think about taking some hostages in the future about russia far the trading strategy here a purest to be a truth to the new york bankers from the blossom red socks level of trading strategy here and this these this egregious it is a egregious iron is a terror estates we just gave them six billion dollars now to be fair at least it was not a hundred fifty billion dollars on the upper end or fifty billion dollars on the lower an of cash in pallets sent to a on when berakobamo was present an basically to cut a crapy newcomer deals that he could have a legacy in the middle east and again to be fair he wasn't trading talabantrrus for bull burg all a deserve button good an if you wish to incenseibize terror states to take america hostages very difficult to think of a better way to do that than by giving one point to billion with a b dollars to get these people released from jail to house arrest in heron wasigansting another billion and halfbacks to get them released from house rust back to the united states or is the the precursor to the long awaited bide move toward norondio is joining into use this as the predicts to argue that now relations are actually warming there thralling wit the baronial i toll us now we should remember at this point that the aronians a directly responsible for hundreds of america deaths in rock it was baronial back force that killed hundreds of america in arch iron is the most nefarious force in the middle east whether we are talking about backing the soothes an yeoman whetheretime out backing cabala i mass terrors group an lebanon which could lead to a war between israel and labor in the very very near future where the retaking by on bat backing comas and shipping them rockets iron backing syria every bad thing happening in the middle east right now can be laid basically at the door step of the baronial the thing you do not want to do is give them acts to billions of dollars in capital jobidon gave them access to billions of dollars in capital which again bat dude not good at the presidential was not trying get america hostages out of terrible regimes is a great thing to do but one point to billion dollars a person that is not the greckbright it turns out t actually six can be very effective as well not just cerate but the bin administration has offered no such stick in the past mean the ligan administration was able to free the cranial hostages by basically being incredibly threatening toward the baronial regime it turns out a fantastic way to incentivize people to take hostages is to pay them billions of dollars for hostages is this can be the predict to an even warm removed by jobidon toward norondoso we should remember at this point that jobidon his chief negotiator with regard torn was the amend named robot valley robot valley was recently removed in terms of his security clearance his secureticlance was literally removed because who suspected of training in classfight information sober valley's ben a long time critic of the state o israel he is been a long time piece neck with regard to the cranial atolls all the way back to the abdominal ministration robot valley is one of mama's guys valley just last month he had his security clearance removed leading a group of republican senators to urge the state departments an turn a wacstrug to investigate the suspension of valleys security clearance watching up scrutiny of the administrations handling of the incident valley was jobidons top iron convoy and he was homing the administrations efforts to restore nuclear tother when his security clearance was quietly suspended some time at this spring the was then put on unpaid leave in late tune following meteor reports that is clearance have been suspended the administration bends over far backward to try an draw some sort of rondel of that now they are sending negotiators who canoe get secure to clearance and there clearing billions of dollars in cash to the canola simultaneously their tempting to force the state of israel to make concessions tooranian back terra groups for example compass the latest attempt to by jobidon to draw piece in the middle east is ha suppose see study israel normalization deal now the studies are perfectly willing to normalized relations with israel they've been wanting to do since the trumpadministration that is the reason why the u a e bocharain morocco all these countries tat are very friendly relations with the studies have normalized relations with the israelies already study clearly wanted to do that have seen public officials from tidaraba directly talk about this when was the whole thus the whole up is that jobidin easily proprescious on the studies not to do it unless israel make concessions to the papist insane the pals insane happen to be governed by terror groups the palcinian authority is a long time tarregroup is lomicgehod is n actual terror group come of is clearly a terregroup back by on right now joint's game with regard to the studies in these rallies is to try to box benjamin it is a hot the prieminister of israel in by essentially offering the carrot of a study piecemeal and the stick that the study piece i will be removed unless being intone who makes overt concessions to a group of people whore likely to use all those concessions as launching pads four terrorism according to axis primanenturn its a who is seeking in security agreement with he united states footstone to turn a on in the contacts of that maladies that the be administration is trying to reach with sally arabia and israel of formal agreement would give u s security guarantees to israel at a timeworn on continues to advance it is neucleader program be presumably the fall with on is just another way of attempting to pressure baby into taking some sort of deal with the studies thy would amount to concessions to the placing is now again the saudi do not care about that realistically speaking this idea the studies a desperately involved in passing in pes negotiations is nonsense they do not care they the reality is that economic trumps everything right now in themidle east because all of theses kingdoms are dependent on prosperity for their people these are notomocracies they do not have the democratic support of their people the reason that they get to stain power is because they enrich their people through economic growth if the economic growth collapses they also collapse thy both strong interest in ceding economic ties with these strong is economic power in the region which actually is israel it is biding it is standing in the way of all of that we will see how all of this developed will keep an eye on it obviously gan just one second will get the latest development in the hunter biding case were the house overly committee is preparing to issue openest both hunter and jo first have ever invested a nice jacket shoes maybe a nice dinner well that stuff it is relatively tempera what is not temporary the sheets these sleep on that stuffing me on this for years eight

your very first order o cay meanwhile we have the house oversaw accountability committed now announcing that they are going to spinal the biding family here is names come re publican of kentucky and the head of the house overside accountability committee who who said this to day are you going to sepia hunter biding they had not time tinier under out ism during the train men a station and they ask him all sorts of questions about i wat we understand what we understood at the end in the danio me alive about russia collision yen this is always got a and with go tidings i coming in crore of the committee we are going cecipin an the family a me we are putting the case together to waiting court obviously with all the outhosation in obstruction were getting from the bin a trees the we know that this is get a and upping court when we spine of the so we are putting together case and i think we have done that very well now well they actually pay mention to the pinup probably not in there munch people ho have not in the past oviocsy see cannons in pay attention to a sepia handed up in contempt are colder when who is attorning generals in pay attention to a seeping he ended up in contempt have being holding contempt by congress at this point has very little consequence not the fact that the house overbite an accountability committee is now attempting to actually cepinah bids means that this is getting more and more serious comer says we want talk to three or four more associates first we've been communicating with a couple of them is were trying to bring them in we did day an archer for transcribed interview i they don't come involuntarily they will in fact besopinut he say it'll be very difficult you getting formation from jobidin thrusipinas because of course any time he try to pippin the president of the united states the present intends to ignore all of that but comer correctly points out the thing that have been pointing out for literally a couple of years at this point since the hunter by laptop the singlemost damning peace of in formation that we have with regard to how the money flowed in the biding white house and with regard to jobidin is vice present hunter by anotherescitis the sing most doing piece evidence is a ten message sent from hunter bison to his daughter talking about how he paid half of his dads bills now here is the thing hunter and job could have commingled fun very easily basically job defense here is that the money did not formally enter my personal bank account but if i pay for dinner with my father then he benefits and that happens all the time i got to diner it my at and it'll payfordenter he benefits for my income of hunter is easily signing chucks for all of job expenses obviously he benefited here is at times comer saying that tome the most damming piece of in formation is hunter literally saying that he pays does bills why they block is from more bankrecker to if the presidents don nothing wrong then they should allow us to see their personal banker i mean you san the meals they so the under bine was complain in to his daughter that he had t give had of ti think of to his father a that pretty doing evident when his i come one hundred present came from a haderstrage around the world were in fluent and e fort for beating the fornagett registration at ay yow he is right about all that obviously and the just position be tween the g o j basically attempting to gut a sweetheartseal with hunter bison and the yet ja simultaneously going after present trump his on have some pretty major ramifications for the twenty twenty four race represent if can us a re publican a pennsylvania he points out the junto position and how awkward it is for the bide administration haw do you seen that are not terms of this coantidance that sending happnintin tempting that been s coming out an hon to find i biting the next day another attack on on tromp i think it is pretty obvious and the america people i think or a waking up to tin a don everything they cant to suppress their their own a mowtheant's activity and hide their own accounts and you desperately try to keep the biding family out a jail meanwhile they completely focus on a dating that they number one a opponent in in a political a can payday i man now that that is bent a re public stuff medical people got in understand that that that in exactly what is happening get well he is right about that hell so points out of course that hoiden his lie repeatedly during this entire tobacco mean jobidon literally said that hunts receive no chine's money he said at n open debate in twenty twenty he said that he never benefited he said that hunter really never benefited from even using his name did he had nothing to do with hunter's business all of these things we in true here is it represent i muser pointing out that jobitan is a liar it first us talk about these thing you finding ton the house over seccommitey had he sail of tit well it is it is pretty ugly its pretty clear that jo bison a like a and why did he lie because he knew t business that was taking place he knew a lot about the business ta in he informed hat his son that he was in the clear in the clear for one job and why were you lying because you without and out pronouncing at i mean you must have known that this said this for there was some shave dealings taken place get well here is the thing the white house is immediately retreating to its fine old position in the motion bailey argument the the they're mot was jobidon knows nothing about any he business as and their bailey is you know teething they retreat to is joins just such wonderful father and they cannot actually show that the money flow directly to job here is the white house pokes person for overside investigations even rascal camera and his fellow extreme re publicans in congress are now admitting they have not uncovered any proof of involvement a wrong doing by present bison i mean they proved involvement even archer literally testified to it they simply will continue to sprit innuendo an lies as they persuade baseless i detachments done to attack the present well ism sorry to break it you guides you opened this more it was you it was you you impeached president trump not once but twice and you did largely on the pitapat that dona trump was a russia agents which was all innuendo and lies it was not true as completely baseless you made his entire presidency about a giant lie pursued by the muller in investigation and you trotted out congress person after congress persons you say that the smoking on was just behind the next door and it was not congratulations play stupid games winstupid prizes i said it at the time as son as the i peach trump the first time every president from here an out is likely t impeach as long as the house of the opposing party is very likely that person is going to be impeach now in this case it may well be deserve but even if it warrant it is a matter because this is the way this is going to go now here is the thing if jobiten really starts to go down for this if the evidence continues to mount it is not to late for democrats to get out that remains a very real possibility elizabeth warrant is starring to show a little bit of a crack in the dam s the senator for masschusetts who you storage presidential aspirations of her own and then it turned out to us in native america well i now elizbeth warren says she is worked about influence peddlers on all sides which is an interesting answer people close to job or people close the goal from but ism talking much yobardn making tens of millions of dollars because of their closeness to him that cannot be something that you there cannot be something that you are comfortable with ism as a phenomenon what i i always worry about the influence peddlers in washington regardless a party affiliation what of the things as you now i seen a lot of my time in congress working on is how we bring more ethics and more over sign in general to a everything that we do on government what can we got a united states supreme put where people take gift and do not even report them even tog the lar requires then to report they will get to that in just a second because the democrats are now swiveling to clock clarence homes this is the way that this whole stupid game works there she starting to show little a discomfort with defending hoiden as i say if things tare to get real bad for jo they could throw the old man overboard and ism unfortunately he cannot swim they do not care but there can swivel over to clarence homes that is their next predictable move get to that momentarily first many america have lost faith in the government media and schools that is the bad news the good news is there is something you can do to help get the country back track prefer you is an educational mine profit fighting save the future of the country they ben watch five million time to day prefer u videos spread messages of liberty economic freedom and judo crisis allies to the next generation we were closely with prefer yourtheir easily assisted company to our own have produced several videos on my own as as one of the narrators of a prefer you vino there truly is hope for america but only if we reach more young people with prefer you got to prefer you dot come make attacks deductible donation whatever you give right now will be matched and have twice the impact if you do not a ten bucks t doubles to twenty that is how doubling works seventy percent of yours say their mind was changed at for watching a prefer you but you will please give to prefer you to day your gifts can have double the impact and reaching more people and changing more minds go to prefer you dot come to day whatever you give again will be doubled however to prefer you dot come to day that is the best way to help young people particularly young people going t university actually see content that we will changed their minds away from the indoctrination of their professors whenever prefer you dot come to day and give generously o we meanwhile the democrats are tempting to swivel the corruption talk over to clarence homes propublica has easily bee putting out ridiculous hit piece have ridiculous hippies out clarence homes the suggestion being that he is some m sort of corrupt politician clarence homes has a lot of friend fort very rich they take him on vacation a now have just got a point out here this not rare at all a really is not rare people go on junkets all the time unless there is some sort of connection can be shown between the people quart easily taking clarence homes on vacations with them or letting him use their beech house and in actual case or controversy an free clarence homes is not a corruption problem at not the way this works here is the thing when jobiton was by so presidents of the united states he was presiding over youcrane policy hunt or bison was put on the board of a uranium company you can see the noise a when when jobidon was vice presidents if the united states had influence on china policy certainly the chines thought which is presumably why they were going hunter by n you can see the nexus if however there is a supreme court justice and he has a rich friend and his rich friend says would you to spend the night on my boat ad his scrooge court justice goes new spend the night on the boat and the rich friend has no business before the court never has had any business before the court will not have any business before the court were exactly is the corruption as supposed to somebody just going on vacation with a friend while probublica is not makingthat distinction they have an entire article to day talking about how clarence homes had thirty eight vacations wow thirty eight well that that sounds wild except for we are talking overtime course of thirty years something a vacation for year during his three decades mas supreme court clarence homes has enjoyed steady access to a stop most america can only imagine well was is supremecourt justice man nay name a poor supreme court justice quick go a today of industry tightens and ultra wealthy executives have treated hims to far flong vacations aboard their yachts ushered him into premium sweets at sporting events and sent their private juts to fetchihim including on more than one occasion and his hire seven thirty seven o say ism ism skin point out that is a person who a who traffics in economically you lead circles this sort of tub is not in common at all have spent time in luxury sports sweets and ism not a supremecort justice and have traveled on private git and ism not a supreme sort justice and unless they can prove some sort of actual corrupt even a legs me actual corruption here clarence homes going to a sport's game with a rich friend does not amount to corruption clockwork homes his leisure active ten have ben underwritten by benefactors to share the ideology that drives his jurisprudence wet you mean that his friends agree with him on politic kept crazy how no be still my beating heart propepublica but this of course is being used as a as an excuse to try and get rid of clarence those because clarence homes is the most influential justice of my lifetime and he has been incredibly influential and wive piety of ways it was scuba up untold solids untimely death obviously but the religious angry clarence homes because he is a conservative blackmail and and that you are not allowed to be an originals blackmail on prime court not allow to do this the the real animas here is but his politics which is we e supreme court annals for seeanand on bescupic is that talking about clarence homes controlling our lives which is heard since he is one of nine justices wroth dime r they on remember theywork us the best part of bonus printout justice is they set the law of the land for all of us clearance homes was one of only five votes that roll back rod away cleared homes wrote the opinion expanding the second an mama an gunfights clarence homes is controlling much of our lives i think hi should answer to the america public oka by answer to the america public you can try in teaching him any him you are years can t have to find s natural criminal ground which do not have at all but none of that matters again the way this works is when democrats go after a political phony you do not need an excuse yes do it when a publicans go aft for a political opponent even if there is good evidence that the person is corrupt we pretend its not happening wet's more on this in just one second first hiring somebody does not need to be this hard i know can be exhausting long expensive thankfully ziprcre is a hiring partner focus on you and your needs ziprocrun knows it is really tog but they figured out solutions for the probes your facing see for yourself right night can trim for free and ziprocrdi come slash daily wire we ben using ziprocruer over here for years it is not only a rat when to find great employs is also a great way to threaten the employes who might be on the bubble zipper example of a producer a producer name ja and say the producer name ja happens to be a quasi observing jaw who speaks here with an america accent far stronger than your own and sometimes you speak weber to each

corruption that were all going to ignore apparently it is just of now that the canary six committee the lead it all of its records what the hell is there any institution in america at this point that is not utterly incompetent and or corrupt according to fox news the house select committee tat in estimated the capital right on canary sixth failed to adequately preserve documents state and radio depositions including communications it had with the bit in white house that are still missing according to the re publican law maker overseeing the grope investigation into thecomitte's work this is nuts o came the j six commute most highly towered can gressional committee since the nine eleven commission this this committee the lead it all of its records now normally that would make a huge difference because presumably there are other records of for example the footage write the police at tat sort of footage the senate has that sort footage however he bout the communications with the white house what sort of coordination political coordination was going on between the j six committee and the biding white house what sort of political con iterations were going into the questioning that was happening how much was the white house running the show the now disbanded j six committee which was run by democrats an included only tugiope members has also failed topovite any evidence it looked into capital he will security failures the day of the right icing to represent of berry louder milk or publican of georgia he is chairman of the sub committee on overside for the committed on house administration lower milk said his staff has had difficulty gathering all the in formation it needs to investigate represent of deny thomson's handling of that six investigation he says part of our task it's this overside sub committee is to actually address the security failures looking how did it happen how are the people able to get into the capital he said the documents they obtain came over in boxes completely unorganized no table of contents in de nothing of an index at all he says new we realize that there is really nothing there from the blue team at all that is the group within the six committed that was directed to investigate security failures as the capital they ignored the actual part the woldhave mattered about j son from preventing a future six namely why was there zero cops at the capital building on the day where every one knew that things were onto gat ugly we where that is ha real question where were these security plans why was it that a few hundred rioters could storm what should be one most secure buildings on on the face of the earth on the day when the election for the president who's being certified we ah it still beggars the imagination i put aside whatever the evils of people breaking intone building worn those were substantial if you was tack and cops obviously but why were there seven cops where were capital police where was every one i this is the thing conga would be investigating an apparently then new in bother according to louder milk he said the blue team was essentially shut down by thecommittee in order to folks on placing blame on trump hes we have got lots of depositions got lots of spinal got video other documents provided througcopina's by individuals weren't seen anything from the blue team as far as reports on the investigation they did looking into the actual breach itself we else it in have an idiots vole end positions that is an amazing amazing things the destroyed presumably whatever records they had ore there is not turning any that stuff over there lodermlk said he came across a letter the was not turned over to his committee from tompion to white house special council richer saber and the d c s discussing an agreement made between the six committee and the executive branch to interview personnel whose names were later ad acted apparently the six committee knew certain staffers at the white house in these staffers testified and on then they just refused to turn any f that stuff over this is really dick sort of stuff if your a fan of transparency you should be pretty upset about all this now president in trump for his part was up set about all the her was president trump today about it my totally dispel telex a the we i to what happen an that they allow that to happen and that came dis an one any bet to to coped e but now we and an we i something that es taken an tax that we have the open ope as we that sipenopele all the send the ja six commit the in sole si cole everything is to lei and destroy to tax comma tangy thing was to led an destroy that that is a criminal act it is insane it is a really really crazy thing foreshore fore shore onyx meanwhile were now learning that done the prosecution blacksmith going up against at dona trump actually sought and obtained a search warren for donate trumps twitter account what they wanted were drafts of his tweets apparently according to politico blacksmith did obtain a search warn four trumps twitter account earlier this year titters in astral resistance to complying with the canary seventeenth warrant result in a federal judge holding the company in contempt and levying a three used fifty thousand dollar find a federal sort of a peals up held that fine last month in sealed opinion on wednesday the court in seal to redacted version of that opinion revealing details of the secret sort battle for the first time what exactly with smith seeking from trumps account apparently he was looking for drafts of the tweets obtaining dato from twitter might have re sealed patterns about trumps use of the account whether others had access to it and whethrthere a any draft statements that run sent not that is really weird right i he let what would be in the draft statements the would be of relevant two jacksmelt the trump was on ta ended draft sang i know the election was last by may but right anyway like that was going to be in the draft statements or something by the we the facet did not send it would be a pretty quick and obvious defense to anything that might be found in redrafts anyway twitter complain of the order violated the first moment the ustistrat sort judge said no and force twitter to turn over the records by the way one of the things about this particular attempt to but to obtain trumps twitter records is that one of the federal judges who as overseeing the prosecution apparently suggested in a footnote that dot the that they had reason to believe that trump would quote flee from prosecution the same district court judge wo saying they need to check his twitter account was also saying that they thought the trump might actually abscond leave free fleet he is one he is literally the most famous person on the planet where would he flee too what evidence could you suggest those suggest that dona trump is going to flee prosecution here meager more and more this case looks just kangaroo court it is it is really absurd meanwhile he have members the media who are very excited about the fact that dona trumps twitter history is going to be search including his draft here is therporter from order's eff mason saying his got batons there in trumps twitter draft there are a lot more things that but could be in those records that we would not see publicly drafts and i know from my reporting covering him the theentire time he was in the white house they would draft tweets he would he would i say tweets he wit t give tweet ideas to his staff when they would put him together there is got to be a wealth of knowledge there long the the direct messages a bunch of stuff that but that could be useful o git well ism just because he think a thing is useful maybe that that is all a fishing expedition and it is pretty absurd that it is come this fir meanwhile president trump is i not going to partisan in the first mat you'd imagine he says he is not going to sign any sort of araks we loyalty pledge ahead of the first to mate the irons he has said that every one does have to sign a pledge that they will vote for whoever the republican candid isn't support that re publican candidate trumped are not signing the pledge by to as sin of pledge f the people on there i would not have he told the pony he could named three or four of the copy challengers he would not support for president anna and he is specifically criticized chis crispy which you can see and sea hutchinson and then he added of course ronisantis because that is the way the dumb nonsense work but hotline is that a the the idea that he was ever going to participate in the bate i think is is foolhardy he is up a lot in the poles are not a logic the lot of logic suggesting that he needs who jump into debate for any particular reason i will say that scan be used against him by trobitdon all the people who are where voting for trump in the hopes that therewith be a biding trump lobate ism in predicting it right now there will be no trumpeting bate is not going to happen jobiton will not to make present entrust he is not going to do it jobitenis simply gin a say i do not dobby probate insurrections convictegpas and the the me you go what a hero what a hero that jobidon andyourbidon ill a brugejog then thrall cheer and the lights will slowly dim is the music rises and that that that is the way this this idiot e is going to go now what's that mean for the rest of the republican field shall basically it means it is a it is a grab pot an meansthere all going to be in that pot together clawing each other down thill that s mat presumably on to mantis will be the chief target of all the other candidates on the stage and trumps skin to sit out here an joying himself which again is in fact the these smart strategy o cant in just one second we are going you get you ranpaul going after anchovy touchy referring him shall for prosecution will get to that in just one second

september this ten archer is is exclusive to dailywyr pass wainwright now a daily why not comes slack subscribed at twenty five percent of your new annual membership she can watch convicting murder when it or years trust me you nock in one a misfit o can meanwhile ranpaul is now referring anchovy douche to the g o j he suggesting that anchovy douche actually committed perjury before congress when he suggested that he was not solving gain of function re searchers ranpaul going after it what whale turn the tables for you what evidence to have we how i do not think there is ever been a clear case of perjury in the history of government testimony and i do not say that likely he said atimatly that the government never fund in this gang of function research we now have the government accountability office the g o has admitted that the funding came from the an i e we have that acting director aback of the admitting it in writing that it came from the ani but now we have really the smoking god and that is fancy in private saying the opposite of what he was saying an goblin mean that is right anchovy touch has to turns out was saying the opposite in private the free press has a fantastic piece by davit's wag about this on aril seventeen twenty twenty with much of the hungry still in some form of lowdown and news of overwhelmed hospitals dominating the headlines doctor anchovy touchy that a member of the president's corronviros task force was asked to questions where the end of a white house prestbreefing was their possibility the novel vitas came from again can china there is a study recently touchy said where a group of highly qualified evolutionary serologists look to sequence s there and sucuincis in basis evolve and the mutations it took to get where it is now is totally consistent with jump of the species from an animal do human was not from lab touchy maintained this for a very very long time but touchy had an incentive to arrive that conclusion because the when instead of verolghe was known for doing highrise virology research studying manipulating corronofvirises and touchy had funded such research at the w give last month a trope of explosive else another documents released that e house lick sub committee on covin these revealed evidence of touches and other officials behind the scenes involvement with scientists an journalist demonstrating their efforts to quash the able theory entirely the recently disclosed private communications first reported by public and racket lay bare that the highly qualified authors of that paper actually had extensive in certainty about the virus being the result of a natural event at all apparently a month just before that a that paper was published christian andiron one of the paper's authors were to slack message to his collision quote the lab escaped version of this is frig and likely to have happened because they were already doing the type of work and the molecular date is fully consistent with that scenario and then another to author rote on slackwuhot it is not crackpot suggest this could have happened given the gain of function research we know is happening touchy then intervened and he faintly got them to write a paper saying that was very unlikely and the he went ne like and said he had not unto gain o function research in the first place and a he tried to read o fine gain a function research to mean gain of function with in species at not cross species should he be tried for perjury on this one i mean he free it is pretty obvious that he should it is a merit plans decagon to take the one up at no that they are to busy going after everything the dons up does obviously meanwhile the left which it turns out was wrong on many aspects of covin they just keep doubling down and ceding fancy scenarios where control is justified say arris a person with whom have ben friendly and a and have had him in show he said man his show it is been a little while since we talked a say arris did not interview that's gonviro in which he talks about government control and in order for him to justify government control during the pandemic he basically had to make the case that if bovid had been capable of killing everybody on earth we would have bin o cay with government force well i mean make be but also that was not the case i failed to yes and if aliens were attacking earth and martial law might be it necessary and it i do not understand what tho has to do at the price of tea in china as they say here is a say arris but did up the the deadliness of the package and give us something air born bola that in curates for a month you do not you do not know you have it and you are what you walk around spreading it angst seventy five per cent fatality rate and it is mostly killing kids no one gets to make that choice any more i may then literally the the cops come in and vaccinate you and i would say that all of us would agree to that the momentagain the turn up the lethality on the on the package and you turn up the effectiveness of the vac sing you turn down the risk of the facing give me a truly safe facing where there is not even one documented case of vain injury right that then you just have to be completely crazy to be worried about being vaccinated in that invite that kind of environment i then it is just a no trainer then then we just do not tolerate a diversity of opinion because the stakes are too high is it it is a full on emergency bodies of kids yore being stacked up in parks right we we there is many of them we do not know what to do with them we have got these mobile morgues and we have evading that actually works and then we have got a if a jun our saying may maybe to not wanting maybe do natant gat the jab on yoga's pokcastsright that is that tasty the world have been worried about ever since cold well i mean i soon the argument that he is actual making here the sort of steal man his argument is that he is worried that waxing skepticism is going to mean that if we ever do get a virus this then the reaction is going to be a lot of skepticism bat number one that is the fault of the institutions and to be fair it is the faults of people say arris who were promoting a lot of government interventionism along these lines and there the reality is that if you looks at the statswhat you saw is that wherever the virus got incredibly prevalent people actually voluntarily took the waxing more during those time periods then when the vitric was not prevalent with is precisely what you respectsanthing with mass people in other words take prophylactic measures as they see fit in order prevent themselves from getting really sever versions of the virus this is why elderly people took the pirate an took took vexing into far high rate the people were twenty and that thatshuld be the case by the way but i mean of course if we are talking about air born bola killing seventy five percent to people that it touched and mostly killing kids i mean i would not has did get o vacs that point would you be why why would anybody and yes i mean a full blown emergency is different that is the whole point the point here is the the government treated this is a full blown emergency for three long years in many places in the united states and across the world when it was not don't understand how the movements failure's here our somehow justified by a completely speculative hypothetical scenario i mean i can make those up too it is very reason makes up what if the government lie there was no covet at all when that justify no governed interventionism and suggested the a action line to you meant there aether hypotheticals all across the board its not hardly to a hypothetical ism just confuses to who say arris things that justifies what the government did here cane meanwhile an what has been a bizarre solaria and yet controversial case there something happened the other day in montgomery albata that is now being called the albata tea party raw a it is or the albata sweet tea party i have seen apparently what happened is that it was a sturdy evening i montgomery's river front and a black riverboat to captain was attack by group of white people as other black people rushed to his defense here is a video of what exactly happened riverboat captain trying to park his riverboat here somebody comes that man actually hits him a white eye is coming in thing the black eye the black eye throws his hat presume blue saying the he wants to go and a these other white people are walking a alongside the which eying their trying who pull the black eye off and then other white people run in and tack a the black eye which which a bunch of nearby black people i they got the hat signal and a and they run in to intervene a one black eye jump in the water and swims across the a the the river here to go and help the the black security guard actually as the as video continues the term axeman was trending on twitter after that the reason this was treated with with some humor is because ever understood that a the white eyes here ritually doing the wrong thing they were one who arrested and nobody actually got yo seriously injured in all this as if tuesday warmth were issued against three men who are on the pontoon boat richer robots forty eight who counts of this degree assault allantois twenty three one counts of this degree assault and scary has simp shipman twenty five one counts of third degree assault all our mist demeanor the three charge were white men on board pontounboat the prevented theriverboat from docking for nearly an hours would sounds a they were being jerks here was the montgomery police chief announcing the prosecutions the police deportment did not have the look me of e we that we all ha fen no not we have more information again will not who in olein the video certainly paint of in in picture after in solo e pitcher members of the to and t litter jumping in to defend the river boats to captain avian picket as you can see from the new footie the fight quickly escalates and one point a man even swinging o holding chair on doubly delleasy oil this morning richer robots two other men it'll an tod and scary shipman are expected to turn themselves in all of them they sing mister manor assault charges gay this is a a bazar story with a happy attend seems the people who are engaging in assault our going to jail now the police say this is not racially mot if attend some age to in to drunk people being drunk an and at asking other people but the media can quickly turn this into o racial stories that what charges blow is doing over at the near times says the albata sweet tea party that was one nickname people gave to a brawl this past sturdy i monomer albata river front doc capturing viralvidios after a group of white people attacked the dampen picket in some obvious ways the holeposod to sad the situation should neverhave descended in violence the people were asked to move their boat to the riverboat could dock should is simply complied but other ways many black people in particular sought as an unfortunate but practically unavoidable response to wat can feel an unending stream of incidence in which black people are publicly victimize with no one willing or able to intervene or render aid black people coming to the fence of that black man was not just a specific thing that happened at one time and place those also a o pasture in some ways from the most memorable images in a history that centuries of black targeted brutality which traces the journey of black people in this land that became the united states leave it to charges blow to turn this into a rough frenum on all america racial history as pose to some drunk jack assist attacking a black yin getting their assist kick for the benefiting going to jail ait got by the way would charges blow be writing the reverse if this eningrup a black people attacking a white riverboat captain i have serious serious daft there be anything this let suicidal analysis from charges blow sometimes due people and criminals and bad people do bad dumb criminal things and the race in actually the be main issue in all this which is why again white people an black people were mainly happy that the perpetrators were a rested regardless of race all gat

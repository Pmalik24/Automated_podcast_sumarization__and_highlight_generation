e i was world i was worried about having offended her i yous worried about offending people whoa for line of defend she put her coat on over her predates and ran over to the facility but when she got there there were security guards out front and big signs jawing was flustered she does not actually remember exactly what the sign said but the message was clear she was not getting in to see her

be would require fix people om noincooding the can for talking to going i noticed she could not help herself going down these thought spirals farting ways to save her ma'am all the things that could go mam and i think that because she cannot do anything and she wants to badly but there is not a way out where could she possibly go no my apartment mi part my tiny most few you ti department wool not be to fit a the lumen that she ne and i would not be i would not be fuck to care for her by myself om then what other facility fat wit what other facility in your city faith what other facility in america fate and seerbasecly out of plaint where you lay there i cannot there is nothing i can there is nothing i can do i fatly at the point where my unconscious is dreaming up plans that take my mother to mark my mind go the very flying places where i think about being told that mi mother ventilator hefty you that my mother ventilator if better you be a vary if hard for me even come up the grammar fold if it feel hard that my mother ventilator could better her some one with younger and healthier this has not happened nobody u suggested her mam give up her ventilator but she cannot stop thinking of the possibility of it and then my mind got down a habit hole i thought looking up hides where i could give up half my long may be that ti healthy person can fell be fate beef i because if if about about long to selling with fruits right and i think who if i can say that other person that my mother get to keep ventilator an your mind jo then hours in tho habit hold which our comply completely youths right because it is not mean to been or not my decision what ism protecting if probably totally in fain and find officially medically impractical dial did get a small bitter release she managed to get in for one last visit that was too week togo what did she got say to each other bacon i am her garter my her care give her i am her conduit the world give fa responsibility to sud her panic not too job it mi said things to her the i think i would wanted some one else to fat me which is if i going to be don't cay we will get throw this i will see you again very soon i do not know when but it is going to be very soon and am and we will get you is together but they wasn't word i necessarily believe if i wold i totally unit she talked was send for hospital step bandit told her there is a significant chance that grown a virus enter the facility that she should be mentally prepared for what that means ding thought about staying with her mam never leaving that visit becoming her man's caretaker her but her mother's long time are convinced i and should be more help to her mamma outside and promised that she would stay with t outlay as long as she could manage at the time they were hopeful of it only be a few weeks i mean i think out myself i do not know if i mad to i decision i i think that if my mam is on a if she is not in o sure the illness then i should be to one in there and then i mean i din i my mind go to dork places i think well who cares i do not pay to went who cares if if everything else toxin t absolute manic all i want to beau with my mam ye i mean what do you think your mam would want sued do in the situation it was it was willy hard to leave her if she began crying just hysterically crying because i think she knew that debit my assurances than it would be a long time before i saw her again an and i think i think she would i think she would want me to say fate i think she would want me to find a way of coping through i crises without the coming to it without being crushed by it stand a bury lying this stories or the so about a tines man reporting on the virus in what in one of the ideas his journalist makes he introduce in is to his guy he calls coming his father recently died because of con iris coming talks about being with his father in the last hours of his life out holding his hand as his heart be drops his hero the young i was one of the most emotional moments in the story obvious reasons hi story with one that i thought show contain much pain and terror that with unimaginable can me at the time ad now i realize that that today mig be talent time i i laughing they might be the last time i will ever i mean that that but that might might happen the at time i then my my mother i can even get the pensive street the grammar does not compute my mind and i thought that i in experience with absolutely the most devastating and then i think about how how luck coming what i know that if my mother contract open i ten she will almost certainly die and i and i also know that ti also know that when i get the call from the hospital let e me no that she is been infected i will not be permitted the go win there and i can see my mother's window every day there is a little park that separate my apartment building from from my month hospital and when i than in the park i can s you her window i can almost

months ago yet it is i mean it is i defile feels different now i thank two months ago it just felt yet just uncertain and things changing by the day am yes o the just every every week was different as this point it your maybe on the other side of the possibly on the other side of this what what does that look welkin yet things are feeling much better here i think he just feels taking off a really hot jacket when when your wearing a winter jacket and all the sudden the weather gets warmer in you i do not need to be wearing this any more it'll take it off an you get short sleeves sure i short sleeves on and just feel yo just relaxed can you take the train now what is it water the trains yes i just saw picture a from the than to day and it would at the beginning the trains were the subways were still running i think the wholeway through but back in the beginning there was one or two people pear and now all the seats at least the folio mi saw all the seats were being satin but i i have not taken the subway since canary you have is there he reason for that or is a just am i think i just told myself that that was something that i could control and i just tot no it i can get it there on my electric bye or my bicycle they'll go to those places but if i i just i stopped taking taxes and i stop taking the sup a even thoughthe're all running it is just cent of my personal think that i decided i was not going to do as i talk to rebec and other friends in china have notice this thing when they talk about things were turning to normal the sat describing all these things that are not normal every ones still wearing a mask here were told mot to wear mask in some cities in china basis or mandatory bar i i saw the other day i saw some one taking a self and then half way through the self they were oh so wearing my mask bayou remember take it off and then take the self again what does the mask does a sort i feel this re minder to you that is sis is not normal ya was kind of me cause actually the government said you can take off your masks i they said they they had a press conference an and the government official took their mask off and it was you can take your masks off you only need them when you go into certain public areas but in reality most people are still wearing them then as not to that people are still wearing masks temperature taking is now everywhere when you going to any public face and also when you enter any housing compound an apartment complex a there is some one at the gat a with a little body censor thermometer and they put it up to your forehead or they put it on your rest and take your temperature the newest thing for rebec to get used to has been this car cod sister basely sorts people should you be quarantine or not it is a little an clear how people are being sorted into these categories but it involves people's locations being tracked through herself on if you recently visited a hospital that are ones and person bought a train or plain ticket it is being monster the code is an admission ticket to do anything in the city i went to visit a friend a at their apartment complex and i had to first i to register my name to number passport number and the i also had to show them on my phone am a a car code a a little square code that am shows that have been in shanghai for the past fourteen days i get a green code and the only way they can find that how is they have my for records and my a do yo ps coordinates a whet e read or no how they find it but but that is not something that i do not know where is that possible yo as i do not i do not think i do not think now that offers that gives me that makes me feel i have a sense of security to be honest cause i look at it and i say oh will have been here for the past fourteen days i ism in the safe sone am but a n if you go ell elsewhere if you maybe go to another city or you travel abroad and you come back then you are in a yellow zone or a redone to play a game a baseball you need a cue our code an the when you get the park a volunteer picture temperature before letting you in am they do limit the numbers of people going into the ark across the street for my house but a there is just it is it is always lots of people there now but i think they still i do not think they have let the ladies do thereon square dancing at night i think that is not back to normal the usually at night time around seven p m in all the parks you'll have bike a older women in older men doing dance routines line dancing routines and that has stopped and i do not think it is come back rebec says they discourage it because a crowds would be too much i doubt that our future in the you ask looks anything what rebeccons describing but everything feels chaotic cure and the idea that eventually that feeling stops o get used to the new normal i can take comfort in that emmanial berry we it a a war stole a the s rob ta say s is report is putter day by gang chives and natty

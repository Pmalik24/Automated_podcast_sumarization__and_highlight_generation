wind should of his true amsterdam is one o the rare examples of a city that really decides to take on the kind of boys club culture and firehouses and the fire fighters do not lay down the fight every step of the way and when they is unusual about the guy running this department lane scop staid he is shockingly frank about just how menstup his department really is one of his tactics is to be utterly transparent show the public what he learns is happening behind the close doors of the firehouses he is all on about the push back he gets and and other fire departments and police departments with similar problems in this case for once we see exactly how bad things wore laid bare and we a to see all the resistance when somebody comes in and tries to change it as he just how hard that is to accomplish it smarting li from our glass to the honor show we have this very unusual look inside of place this reported gonna consul has been digging into this for months that be act noted to day show and this is such and embattle department that the only way gonna could get most of the firefighters to talk to her was to change your names and replace their voices our you can be hearing a bunch of that what is bet to follow easily only lane shop and one of his man opponents let us use their voices a pretty her making unique reported this with gonna you hear mike's voice there now and then asking questions heres gonna to take on a bunch of tough guys the may or hired summon who was used to bang the toasty in the room lanes hop climbed to the upper rings of the ampsterdam police department by speaking his mind and not caring who did not it he got things down by moving quickly in a grass of late he ran the riot squad he was known in town for forcing out anarchists squatting in a full city block of abandoned homes amsterdam is a progressive city and sympathy was with a squatters lots of people hated can for what he did they threw paint boys at him plan luff lights d he do of it only cowardly leaders stone show up laneterviews with ham are filled with these kind of tough guy cleshase not the sit icon this is the battle and one of us is going to win and it is not going to be you sometimes it was hard to keep a straight face o some better but don't to ishbodysion boat to for you ye main desire departments from not really word mat getting bur an your top yer do lane smile he knows when he is long it on that he is intense with reddish down hair and blue eyes that look incredibly is if yo pestamov his first week on the job there is a welcome lunch for him fire fighters do not show up then he gets an anonymous letter telling him not to enter any fire stations he goes anyway and he notice his right away there is nowhere for him to part the fire stations parking spaces are filled with recreational vehicles boat gimps we to its with care vans with campspervans because basically the fire fighters was using this area round the firehouse is their private space saying wee your twenty four hours this is kind of our house this is our place lane gave fire fighters their first order he sad get all your personal stuff outer here then this did you do not run the show you are not the one who besides this the actually said you do not rune you don't rums it is you problem thatthit is what i whit you mim gone be sitting why you getting work up i out this little boat we an and what was your response to that en he been that e to conium top been a new i i told this you have to get these boats and the camprpence out of here if not ism going hire somebody to take on that step away i you be dot and they were listen won go ahead lotic and ti took a step forward elect but an it stood my ground i threatened to take a police crane and lifted out of there firefighters were curious and thought lane was acting too much an uptight cop but everyone complied they got rid of their boats and campers except for one guy who ignored lane and defiantly brought a boat bright back the only boat in the parkin lot lane put him on probation and moved him to another fire house it was one of his first disciplinary actions they go retaliated by not coming to work and take a department for lane was figuring things out pretty fast he estimated there were about fifty of these guys in the entire department guys we joined the brigade dictates ago and ow ran their fire stations it kept tabs on their boss through a five at what sap channel some fire fighters called them the brotherhood lane always called them then and yo it men e still a thin angry white man he says ore against any change that would force the out f their golden cages he knew guy's exactly this in his police department days the whole made wit the backhand en so to they i o states these are som gie and burn was and am stay in the streets the nail mam they're ligemhi the li i i iterator they has slots ta tosh have big mat they not much as so supersmart but their cunning yo woes and m if you train too approach them were too much new on then your not gin to make it because they know how to play and then a few months into his job morocten dutch fire fighters on the for started coming to him about a particular guy one of the brotherhood who called them censor manakins in dutch this was a racial slur when i asked for an english equivalent some one told me camps or maracas is saying fucking marocains come i schmos to blush n opinion is moltishaid and also when he was suppose to put to fires an abstain we t where there is a lot of maslimps living he would say that he had to go to the califate the guy had a long list of tires against him he walked around in a not he jacket he threatened a nail crucifix to the shower door of a muslin fire fighter and he refused to go to a fire drill an a most again lane soft i shorforbill on e woful did i i this is really wrong what if there is a fire in a most will he do his job on he save the people if he does not one to go in there now for the practiced is the first responder in this misty coat sit and you cannot say that you do not wont to know somewhere because of religion and a for the jock of it tit and an lotic hyomhemoted each ma do when i heard about this case i that be i have to do something about this tom i cannot leave this line lane fired him it was the first time racism had been sided as the reason to fire someone from the master de fire department he got rid of the boats he fired a guy for racism progress but the brotherhood started o petition for the fire fighter to get his job back how did you feel about that now tut they might open them open really open my eyes instead of kind of unitingits around the people who were discriminated against they united against the mission who was discriminating and they formed a block around him the problem run much deeper than lane that why when they won to stick up for the guy getting harassed for lane it was obvious he instinctively sited with the fire fighter getting picked on and he did not understand any one who did not that empathy for the outsider it made lane an unusual commander he started investigating to figure out just hotbed things wore the numbers were not encouraging when lane started there were only five female fire fighters on the entire full time force of five hundred the fire department is not allowed to report race but he estimates that only around ten per cent of the force for people of color these numbers did for flock the city at all at least the third of ampstams population is non white lane visited the fire stations and talked o fire fighters of her coffee at the long lunch tables there and he learned the lots of them liked the changes he was bringing in he had a silent band of support he asked people about their experiences in the department and his surprise people opened up to him three their stories he started to get a sense of what it was liked to be a person of color or woman in his fire department maracas an serinamys dutch fire fighters that they were called rats and monkeys the brother had told some that they did not belonged that fire fighter should be dock and white one muscle fire fighter on calling a lee told me that over time he lean to go along whit the rather sleds when his coworkers called him been gotten he acted he was an upset youyou have to ignore it if i find out that she do not it they will keep on coming back and back ad back have you ever reported discrimination in the past it was not possible to do that nobody does it you you could report whatever you want but nothing was can happen in worst of cases when it really got out o had what you would just do is shake hands on it and get it over one excuse his to say i come on tan was it joke nothing's can to happen lane hired a consultant to help him reach out to women who quit the department they felt they never belonged they set her aspen an thelittleman happened every hour of the day one woman sat men in her station asked her to leave the room thy could comment on her ass men told women to sit in the windows of the fire house as if they were prostitutes in the red light district during job interviews women were asked how they do their jobs on their periods one of the few female officers in the ampserdon fire department is a woman ism calling duty the guys respected her she was strong physically and she was top had no problem standing up to these guides but even she felt she was constantly being tested when a fire fighter under her command purposely opened his towel in front of her when she suggested that her bosses not put women into fire stations alone but with other women one of her superiors called her a highly educated moaning female one night she was doing around checking in on every one and stopped by the canteen i was saying good night to everybody and then they were sitting and what she born did to say something bat no i did not i did not say anything about that horn was a regular thing an the commonarias of lots of the stations i do not know why i do not know why i did not say anything i did not comfortable to say probably it is a me being included by e be to brother who i think because saying something it is it is always uncomfortable to say that i have to t mat that i avoided it too everyone is grip on what was normal was out of was guy remembers a woman at a fire station who had this particular bedtime ritual she would go to bed and somebody would come to tuck her in wait they talked her in to bad at night wat o talking in it was when you put your little one to sleep and you polio blankets tits a round the person do guy who would do that sad ism going to tuck her in and i felt in comfortable about that for her i made it it was her choice but i would never do that because it makes a certain situation that i think you should avoid she was fine with it is she did not mind this happening o i thus i do not know i i i cannot remember having i er talking to her about that why that is a good question maybe i might be putting her more in a danger or why i might not be helping her or maybe i was telling myself w e maybe it is her choice and and she likeshes or something but y i don't now hearing all these stories lane realized he had to spell things to what is normal behavior in work place he wide a manifesto on how to behave a professional fire fighter and sent it out to everyone it begins all of us are going to at normal normal want we do not yell at each other we do not still coffee from the firehouses we do not make a fence comments on social media we always were our uniforms we do not store our personal panning bad in the woman's dormitories of for men if you write the rills he will be punished and if you no longer know what normal is please find out one of the biggest ways fire fighting is not a normal job fire fighters work twenty for hour ships everyone less together they work out shot for groceries cook watch to be like soccer sleep professional boundaries get blurry cannon in to push the department to aid our ships it would make are stations more a work place unless a private club and tot so so litticot tie is i thinks the fire torment many if the fire fighters will find not almost literally to the deft to defend is twenty for hour shift fire fighters liked being together for twenty four hours and hanging out and then getting a couple days off to spend with their families or hold down second jobs and the brotherhood argued that bonding in the fire station is a mental the push back was strong that line managed to open just one firehouse on eight our ships as an experiment the brotherhood pastured fire fighters not to drowns for that the guides in the brotherhood are straight to talk to reporters every one i reached of to is worried he would loses jo but i did get four of them to speak to me on the condition that i not use their names it'll call this one yon he did let me use his real voice s he said the problem in the depirebent was in that it was lame and talking women into bathe said it was not sexes i can only confirm that that it id when me as we i seldom betters about it in that moment but wot o oyouinto bed is at over than the men ye come on e the there are male sometimes o analysis i also went to bed then i as that he mi bet than somebody el else can from the show any was already before me my bet this kind of think seen but if you're women and somebody's talking you in to bad it is a different experience in i is not nothing that e that they want to shop you or they want to in bars you or bet is what i saying is o we there are people who are minorities an who are women they are but jujus too afraid to speak out to you because your afraid to of or professions miss is i stupid a si all ta time i did hasn't hap not that that not at it probably happened one we one female an pal and probably one female ample nest also no n do you have to say then of a ti i sexist company or all the females i believe or all the rather people i i believe i do not think i asked him about the fire fighter laid fire the one who called the muscle neighborhood and ampler down the calcific and used rather slurs on his rock an dutch coal workers hes not a nicest that is for hun person what you deed that to me is an in cadent still an incident in a big in a big company do not i make is a bigger than it is i twenty nine years is my wife i five folks on a all the bet tings sat i said about er than e we would never get marries you my s r not honor most you none have to finest a as long as you not any rout make it in is roltescase he locate yester lake cancer bracken in your not a laser not okay that is in the heed of the discussion use si change wanotocay that yon otonotosa and and and the take party will we dead poly and we as right always wrong i do not just tit i must not dare that one thing is o sure i know he is not arms how much do you think that the force should adapt to new fire fighters the thing is then we have the feeling that is that we are force to change then its can be n this i my be in the wrong way no if you want to change and the chicane and not to force it and do it in a very gefterway that he in a letter way that you will change and without noticing that will be to perfectly and this is not having my them this is what lane says hey was up against a group of men for whom normal man keeping things exactly the way that always been e i working basin a was have the right to impose blundering work place we are not sin this business for him it is not a dopes to a of lie well wise that make this very clear that is not for in a yogis way of life lane's approach to making make institutional change is was on a progressive fairly new management theory designed to curb all the sorgansations it is essentially draw hard boundaries make no concessions be consistent on relenting and intend to fifteen years may be they will be a real shift it is arduous the beginning is the hardest part this approach made a lot of sense to lawn because of his experience on the ampler down police force he helped clean up and reform the department as a rocky cop he ad seen the problems first hand he started in a corrupt precinct the red light district in the nineteen eighties he says cops stole sold drugs were excessively violent changing that meant rigorously enforcing rules writing up bad cops disciplining them firing them lanes as it took about ten years for the rules to be accepted as normal but this confrontational approaches not the way things usually work in the netherlands sri not we know the dutcheltreis very much everything pease everything together no conflict and with the fire department to condos traditional recipe is talking talking talking not but not the dutch have this term puller medal the take pride in it the idea is to bring everyone together despite their differences just their ancestors came to gather to build dykes and damps to protect their land from the see his stories debate whether that actually trust anyway everyone from parliament to the local amateur soccer club tries to make decisions this way through discussions and consensus lane did dabble and puller medal a little in the beginning he spent his first six months going to fire stations trying to convince people that diversity would make them a stronger fire department in the city with almost a hundred and seventy nationalities and that women bring pragmatism in emotional intelligence to the brigade but lane was almost always met with blank stairs guys told him women are not strong enough for this job one of them said he just wen an excuse to bring in a hundred broad again here's one ti for halal is in the scrucyofor deficient i intellect is bonnicalba intellectuallywas onward to have these conversations about diversity and i don's on crass and i do not want to be in kind about my people but some of them or kind of to stupid to keep having this diversity conversation and in ins in that way in i some point cadi just have to say toxin a stop talking about which is going to do it in wo itoithis winnow this is an organization it is not some kind of democratic wo by asking we on and a talk about in n majority rob you can take it or even he was don reasoning with them he did not have to after all he had the full support of mayor ever heart fonderlon he was wildly popular the city adored him he snowed to lot of mare prudent when he was in town because the russia leaders antilogy ties the city counsel back the mayor and he tapped lane which meant but the mayor support lane could do whatever he wanted en he had a big idea for how to get the kind of countability h wanted in e fire coming out in this on people he can threaten their jobs when seals tie talk that is in a minute chico bobocedio went our program continues it is is marc on mi from for glass to day so burn it down we have two stories of people who think they have no other choice it is time to burn everything down make enemies do what has to be done who in the middle backed one a policeman burns down a fire house johnny a kiss is in the fact is rebutting on the amsterdam fire department the resistance changed from inside the department and in this half of her story haw the bigger politics to the city start to shift everything quick to grenada before we stood t second half of this a gonna discovered when she stud a looking into this story that the fire commander's partner hots a journalist the somebody of joannes worked within the past gonna has not discussed the content of the story with this journalist the journalist was not involved in the story in any way again hers join lane had devised the very unusual plan but to pull it off he happy toniest the mayor he did something that i verily seen any public official do he took all his criticisms about his own fire department and made them public and by doing he made himself the biggest critic of some of the most beloved figures an amsterdam imagine the head of the police department in new york or chico publishing a long list of all about stuff the are officers had done it would blow up in their faces that did not happen the lane here is how he went about it he started by writing a single letter to the mayor detailing his findings about discrimination in bulling at the fire department did isn't the homemade day of do not e and as isolation as e read the letter an then there was a certain surprise because i think he literally said i thought there were all contesting going on bat it turns out there was even more going on than i thought but now i ax we have the proof and now weeping to work on this together and oi ashamed for the in response the mayor wrote his own letter blasting the fire department and sent it with lanes to the city council making them public record reporters pounced i did did you in the mayor that did the to you talk aborted i set of a strategy ya ya it is us it is us ugly a mighty day my and i overlie there was absolutely my idea and i knew it was gin and up i media i knew this i make the papers overdo that was something in a thought i before that if i write this letter there is going to be a certain amount of treasures that i would get the tunisia council and also the public to see that something needed to be done and awfully din do best there ha pocosin om heels a media the till this was very very calculated even to the point where i did use words that hey knew the medium i you bounce on if you get in discussion going but what the prison this free me tat trace is in my discrimination thusly aim about lupin consumes a terms that i know a going to get people's attention it is really unusual for ism a public official to do something this the that u shot show ma dad would have o o well effect yes it is extremely unusually it makes it very effendis and i looked at what former fire commanders did and i felt that tit did not you use a instabilities they had enough and i the consciously decided ism on make more if band that means you have to get your hands during and you have to go public do you remember any discussion you had with the mayor or with any one else who was less sure that this was the right way and yah yah okra i i but but the but the spur in my old sating is conch when i noticed in and which people around me was must be were and that with a lot of the pop we management here the awarded me that they were kind of reticent me to a new this kind of organization if you go looking for a fight here going to get a fight did the mayor ever have any reservations about this is a strategy look onions the details in lane's report landed on the front page of the main newspaper and amsterdam then the mayor an lane went on a media lets here is lane on a radio shell flinging open the doors on what really goes on inside a fire house the host of the programs has to lane what you found was a very much of culture i you en he give me some examples of that all she all mut a close on golly ho cause what if you are sitting at a table in your march and and something comes on to we about his lam than people start talking about those cants for manakins and when you are sitting there as a serious professional fire fighter it has an effect on you and then of course you ere the exception ha we do not mean you it is those other cants or marocains that is one example an report i deploy mention o over late yet in wee shelf the cot my slap camacisie and have got people telling me i can survive the twenty for our shift i to stay in my room and then is a group you could think a o e case somebody spending the horseshit in the room but you could also think what is going on here but this not thehantin shock of last lasted the lav and that is really what i want to happen that we are able to engage with each other in a healthy way people wrote to newspaper saying they were repulsed by the fire fighter's behavior sit council member said they were shocked the mayor told lane to keep pushing on with his reforms but inside the firehouses lane's tactics did not go oversell his support drunk even people who agreed with his gulls the thought was fighting the good fight fell lot he was smearing every one lumping them together making them all look bad the way that he did that he turned every fire fighter against him this is a long time fire fighter of color in the brigade lane and the more whence about is really medically the use to newspapers to try to turn public opinion against us they're very very fitful stories in newspapers that we traces than we were sixes all hands of old stories really from e doctor more ago we broad beck to pay the black picture of and of course the brotherhood was pest it was a public declaration of war on social media fire fighters called lane in the mayor know at all political losers and vile full of lies they wrote in dit this mayor and have i sued for defamation and thanks lane were all painted a bunch of racist inside the firehouses the atmosphere changed attitudes hardened again here is alone the fire fighter color who says his white coworkers called him been laden he said things got worse for any one who was not light something a trendy broke enough for first time you see that people for instance one shake you hand is his tradition after we put out of fire we always sit inside weave a coffee an old fireman shake a chat is hands that is that is ready tradition enough for first time since have been here what fire fighters a refuse to shake er hands meanwhile lane got more don than ever he doubled on on recruitment what to mosque and dinners during roman tried to convince more people of collar and women to join the fire brigade slowly those numbers of increased he also back managers who discipline bad actors he stream line worships opened a new fire house and improved fire prevention he made home safer by setting fire fighters door to door in the city lane with the backing of the mayor was making the kinds of changes he was hire to make an exactly the way he wanted to make them quickly an aggressively but then something happened that lane had in accounted for six months into his job mayor eberhart fonder can revealed he was sick long cancer a half year later he died immediately the ground started to shift under lane when the mayor died the brotherhood grew embolden here is lane it bate betide ton the noel binman in frobopobom adding of the dot people commented that it was great that he died and there was eaten somebody when for the can was on his deathbed who said for the can the cockroach is slaying away on would distil ton and it was quite shown somewhat is on his despite from a hanger in your kind of rejoicing in hagbut for them it really was one enemy miss soon a campaign to push my not of his job kicked into high gear were tired fire fighters in unions rallied around the brotherhood publicly demanding that the city investigate lane for bad mouthing the fire department in the media fire fighters did interviews anonymously e bouncing lane in a conservative new paper the biggest paper in t motherlands from the moment the mayor announced he was see lane started getting anon om his fatheads one letter sad a headman was being hired another tarted end his fourteen year old deader he was told the threats for coming from inside the fire department are in the summer of twenty eighteen amsterdam got an energetic new mayor the first woman in the city's history face balsam she was lane's new bass and set many years in parliament as a high profile lawmaker representing the left wing green party a champion of woman's rides as a politicians she pushed for tack brakes to address poverty she also wrote newspaper columns and made a documentary about mole women mayor handsome a condemned the at threats aganslane and publicly through her support behind him but not long after she started lane remembers her stopping by for a private meeting he told her about some of the changes he was trying to make her reaction chocked him to from the butetamasion i shelf when we having this conversation about races in indiscrimination than mayor herself came wit the following example apparently she heard it from one of the fire stations or a some one to firemen of on did we have a number o not callers working here en are not you the yet states to and there was one that all the other fire fighters were calming share which is san a dutch name and that was not his name it was a races to word play joke they looked for reasons to say no to ham they could say no hair ore in dutch nay hair which means negro and the sou bucamson must hot to look blow is ad little tits fetish the more you laughed about this invent sheaths is really funny i find this extremely hilarious she seriously laughed so e locate hell hat she laughs very loudly and a for me that was really a kind of penal moment on which i realized i am fighting against all is and i am dealing with the mayor who sees is his funny am that i a not a to showed push that she mu lo i told her i was immensely shocked that she had to laugh about the uncle of humorous remarks and i really asked i the visit what is going wrong he to that bust o my o cant mayor balsam seemed denied lines account she says she is only told the joke in meetings as an example or to in tolerable behavior that is not always recognizee such by fire fibers for lane that moment crystallized the world of difference between his own an new was after that who gave up on er mayor balsam hat liked the rest of amsterdam see lanes fight with the fire fighters play out in the media and she did not i she talking out problems an reachincon senses the dutch way fire department managers who sat in on meetings with the new mayor in can said it was clear right away that they did not get along that sometimes he was abrasive their styles were totally different they called the mayor high the an ran boxing the mayor ordered her own investigation into the fire department the new investigation acknowledge the her problems but it concluded that over all the fire department was quote at its for not a resist or sucks organization and it called o lane to take a different approach and build trussed with fire fighters a city hall reporter told me this report basically through lane under the bus when it came out at the end of twenty eighteen lane had been on the job for about two in a half years i spoke to him around this time he seemed unfazed by the report he was still going about the business of reforming the fire department and airing its sturdy laundry this problem fire fighter not i much lotus of sh land he is not fired yet but ism going to fire hims heres the situation there was a group of fire fighters in hi super market because they were doing shopping for their firehouse shes yet there were all in the uniform standing at the registers you and at the register there was also an elderly lady on a mobiles bet goon the deal o money lot how c sike lot w she is trying to pay for her groceries and a hundred and fifty years folks out of her pockets an a one of the firemen seize that and as he drops this money and puts it into his soke and walks out with it well some time passes in the of that the lady goes on she realizes her money's gone the woman checked back with the store about her missing cash and security hammer showed one of lanes men putting her money in a sock taking an old lady's money while your wearing yer fire fighters uniform of course tat did not fly with lane the police got involved it was embarrassing an outrageous as a send the reaction is not this oh my god i cannot

was in full support of lane when he first exposed the raise in sexism in the department two years before this they been on his side but now that was old not the public had moved on master dams a progressive setting but on last has blind pis during the holidays some people still wear black face when they dress up as saint mics helpers and the public shock over the racism in sexism in the

unsafe for the public mayor possum did not feel the same way after the meeting she gave the intervene o local news o at last seeing i calsonesince an i send at seen tots help an indeed ex to a nettle shiny tat car o show come garment oshouteon she was of course it is very worrying if they do not have a good work in fireman that could indirectly affect their ability to do their job as well i m the foolishenon a man an you have to take these fire fighters concern seriously after that city council meeting lane knew he was running out of options city council had lost faith in him the mayor was not on his side and four hundred fire fighters more than half the brigade signed a petition saying they did not trust him to run the department inside the fire department lane supporter started to hear rumors i caught up with some of them in mad not long after the city council meeting do you think commanders cop is about to get fired i hope i hope it is not fast i hope he does not leave again here is ale wat would that mean for you personally if he was i be very disappointed what he did is give minorities a play form where they could speak out and that was not there before him now were we are in direct contact with and the operationlons of management and we can immediately reach them as for help we get a love support and get definitely makes difference lane had been there almost three years and all in a couple of female managers tell me they were finally starring was he change fire writers were thinking twice be ore making rimester fantast comments everybody's c more careful now people really correcting each others still things happen a people make an make jokes that but some one will say what chat something you could have set before and the old days nowadays you cannot do to s any more now jolty improvements wee see ow for the past few years if he leaves you can you can throw that in mystery forms it is going to be beck to square one these these angry white man have always been dominant they always decided what went own that my does a city does a maybe to she understand that this is now the situation well i i do not know about the mare she is new but i hope she will not fire him if she does fire him just shake hands on it with us and say o k we do not want people of color in fire brigade they pile be fair way to go about it just say o say would it we only one white people cause that is message it would give but it signal to you is she saying i do not need any more people you i do not need any more my wars not just i do not need any more people i do not need people you any more the culture forms over a hundred years it is rely hard you try to get a foot in the door while people just want their old firebricate back and they will resist any change butthat is reality i asked laying to give me a got check do you feel your days or number big i e an we then a the women the ova if ye you once taxi think we should talk about the may be a different moment and is not something that you really want to talk about right now nide no not now am have you have you made a pitch to the mayor about why you should stay d ye n that is did think i told her that is ta face where and now it takes about six years yo ran than habits my and m only after six years on just art night thinking about you unifying things and i think now the unis organizations all about trying to find unificationthingis but i think that is too soon and i told her you should just leave me here for another couple of years to do the breaking best my don m my a do on some wet may whet the mar say an a not sets coconut she nodded the mayor declined many request for an interview i wonder decline was regretting his management style if he was thinking you should have been more palmer medal more diplomatic do you feel there is something about the way you do things that perhaps am contributed say the something that you may see in i in in mytrospeck i shtik on is differently i should have approached this differently ism just curious ya e a the and yeritrospect the going you if dot e sometimes i think may be and in it respects an i anted results too fast you up only going you but a real cultural change really cannot be and force or speeded up instead of creating more support you cold of get for resistance because the organization is not ready to change sot e don the on enol and don't she to inplutual but you me enough what they i was very black in white and i do not really regret ted maybe i think now with more new once i would have opened it more to conversation instead of just resistance do you think a conversation would have helped no t that is tattoo ti stilts still to do limb that is the dilemma gettinfras long you got honestly begs me to say that i also really did not try i just went down and lay down the law it may be if i tried tan it would have been slightly different goo but the question really is how long do you wanted to take do you accept this kind of behavior to continue for another twenty years and ism trying to change in sooner rather than they lane i in si think i ma mean me just think very i bed for to think or that your telling me that your days are number is a what your belly be made out the mahaneshofishes i am not allowed to speak about this lane's last day is commander of the answer don fire department is on tower first

the day lane's departure was announced a fire firhtopart to camper band at a station man i kisses oh normally reporter for and peas daily is programs a me a star e a a a n can a a a a a a an a e a a to ma a ma ma ma he ma ma ma ism we have time to shunted i for o just on mar a quickstory about somebody deciding that the noway forward is to rip something down at rebuild from the ground up own a baker tells what happen here is a typical day from when kat did was fifteen growing up outside to trait she gets home from school and i our tourist was posted on the backstair and i was really frustrated cause it was longer the normal and i there were chickens from where the slighting glass store had been left open this happened all the time her mam love chickens and they got in the house here a chick there a chick everywhere a there were chickens perched on the couch there were chickens on on the kitchen counter and on the dining room table i mean they were just chickens everywhere i and i looked up the stairs and the was yes sitting at the computer and i was just in that moment i was very frustrated because now have got to heard the chickens outside complete all these shores i was just very irritated and at some point rather than c going straight into my chores i sat down to at journal will you mean me what you wrote ya on this entries says my mama never does anything but sit at the computer and play the stupid sits on line any more that is what her mam was doing when she came home from school playing the sits the video game where you get a simulated family and a simulated house to live a simulated life to day she made me do all the real chores after school because she was busy doing fuck ones on the sits she brought home three fancy chickens to day oh great more fucking birds o we got ago i kat says her mam moved out of her bedroom and set up a futon and the computer room to sleep necks to the game she would play crash on the futon play more kat craved her attention i remember i used to just sometimes go up to her little den area where her computer was set up and sometimes doing things just too intensionally anoa her but in kind of a funny way i would take her headphones off and i would just come up to her in sort of like member her neck raspberry her nag or what can i do to get your attention kat began to feel invisible i was just standing there waving my arms over my head which as hilarious cause that something the sums would literally do win they wanted your attention they would put their arms over the head and wave an shout at you in whatever him language they be sometimes kat would catch glimpses of the world her mama was building an the sits her mother played the guitar an piano hat dinner parties she also had a sir's family named after her real husband and is her sister and father looked hear sits but not kat in real life kat died her hair and dressed edgy but i remember the him that she had named after me headline the stupid almost bullet looking brown hair and always more these rinse skirts and button up and i remember thinking that is not me at all is that who you wish i was she tried everything she could think of to coax her mam off the sits she would tried to reason with her joke with her bargain with her finally kat reached a breaking point one night she sat down at the computer and opened her mams sits world with her literally sleeping on the futon just five feet away from me was well ism do in this the first thing i did was there was a acheecoat i think it is a slimy coin in an explanation point over and over you put it in and you can get it was a lot of money i i got enough money that i could buy moltipol stoves mostly i another thing that i did i remember is you could buy i think it was a those oversized teddy bears people give you could buy these giant oversized bears and put them nearer the fire plays and stuff that and m and i remove the fire extinguishers in the smoke detect ears and stay and i remember walking the him she had named after me out to the yard and the leading the door behind me that went out to the front yard and just waiting the at and sister him go to the stoves and start cooking say in a kitchen anna living room fire break out the sparks had the petty bears game on and the simar just running around screaming with their hands in the air and and they really scream right yes they scream in whatever that weird him languages w hosolakeays it is just that is just shivering and ism laughing hardly i remember is ism waintingingly wen it be my hands and ism trying hard to lake not laugh out loud because she is sleeping right behind me there were firemen but they would only come if you told your him to call them i i burned her gym house and family alive i eventually the firestorm the kat character stands in the yard her mama father and sister are dead when a gym dies this little earn appears in its place i i went back in the house and you could pick up the we earns and i picked up the little earns and just sort of place to them near each other and new well ism going to be in a lot of trouble to morrow because kat was the only sin left it was going to be pretty clear who done all this i got up the next morning to leave fer school in i remember i as i was leaving she was just sort of starting to get loved in to her game instead m wen i got home she yelled at me to come up the stairs i came up the stairs and she paused her some game that she had been rebuilding to turn around and yell at me and she was you owe me in apology that was weeks of my life and it still felt a small victory i guess because it was one of the first time s in a who that she had two step away from that life to engage her real life she wrote in her journal grounded figures but it was firing have to do all the house work now sic she can rebuild i do all of it any way whatever that thinks it'll go to jail someday at least in jail they do not make you get

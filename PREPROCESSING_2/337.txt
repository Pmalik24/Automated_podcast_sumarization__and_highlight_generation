welcome to the superman ladponcas scum science science space to for life i man her supermen and om a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine today my guest is doctor vivace murphy doctor vivid murphy is a medical doctor and acting surgeon general of the united states as surgeon general of the united states doctor murphy oversees more than six thousand dedicated public health officers whose job is to protect promote and advance our nations public health doctor murphy received his bachelors degree from hazard university and his medical degree from the male university school of medicine to day's discussion covers some of the most important issues in public health not just within the united states but world wide including neutrician and the obesity crisis as well as food additives and why certain food chemicals and additives are allowed in the united states verses in other countries we also discuss mental health the youth mental health crisis the adult mental health crisis and the global crisis of loneliness and isolation we also talk about corporate interests that is whether not big food and big farm industries actually impact the research and or decisions that the u surgeon general takes in his directives toward public health and of course we discuss some of the major public health events that occurred over the last five years and the current and future landscape of how to restore faith both in public health officials in public health policy and science more generally by the end of today's episode you not only will have learned a tremendous amount about public health and why you hear the particular public health directives that you do but also how to better interpret future public health directives you will also come to learn that as surgeon general doctor murphy has both and extremely challenging job but one that he meets with a tremendous amount of both rigor and compassion before we begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is how her part of my desire effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is me new venison man new venison is the most neutron dense and delicious red meat available have spoken before on this podcast in solo episodes end with guess about the need to get approximately one gram of high quality protein expound of body weight each day for optimal nutrition there many different ways that one can do that but a key thing is to make sure that you're not doing that by investing excessive calories maw new venison has the highest density of quality proline per carry and it achieves that in delicious things ground meats venison stakes jerky and bonebroff i particularly the ground venison i make those into venison burgers probably five times a week or more i also the jerky for its convenience specially when ism travelling or especially busy with work and know that ism getting an extremely neutrino dense high quality source of proline if you to try make new venison you can go to me new venison dock cam slash superman and get twenty per cent off your first order again that is me new venison dock cam slash superman to get twenty per cent off today's episode is also brought to a spy oka oka makes eye glasses an some glasses that are the absolute highest quality have spent a lifetime working on the biology the visual system and i can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of challenges in order for you to be able to see clearly indifferent environments oka understands the biology the visual system and is designed their eye glasses an sone glasses that you always see with crystal clarity originally their glasses were designed for performance that is for running and cycling and for sport and indeed they can still be used for performance they will not slip off your face if you get sweaty their extremely light weight but i should mention that rock eye glasses and som glasses come in some of the aesthetics more typically associated with performance glasses tho sieborg style glasses but they all have a number of styles that you'd be perfectly comfortable wearing out to dinner or to work i wear readers at night or when i drive and i wear some glasses during the day if i happen to be driving into bright light or outside and it is just overwhelmingly bright i do not wear some glasses when i do my morning sunlight viewing to set my circadian rhythm and i suggest that you do the same if you to try oka eye glasses or some glasses you can go to rock are k a do come and enter the cote supermen to save twenty percent off your first order again that is rock to k a do come and enter the code superman at checkout and now for my discussion with doctor viva mirth doctor vivid merely welcome think much drew and please call me viva come informal o he vet my understanding based on my internal search is that the role of the u surgeon general is to provide scientific information on how to improve health and reduce risk of illness and injury do not have that correct that is correct what are some other rolled that you play that perhaps would not come up in a a top a top hit gal church the that i ought to be aware of and that our audience ought to be aware of here is how i i general explain to people there there two primary rolls the surgeon general has one is to engage with the public can make sure that people know about critical publichelth issues that thinks they know what they are how to protect themselves in their families this second role of the surgeon general is less er known but it is equally is important which is to oversee one of the eight uniform services in the us government and that is the united states public help service many people are familiar with the army the navy the er force do be also have the u s public help service which is six thousand officers include doctors nurses physical there is farm assists publican engineers whole range of of helthcarefolks and beer job is to protect our nation from public heltthreats when bola i came on the scene an two thousand fourteen in a major away in west africa we sent hundreds of officers too west africa to set up the on movie medical unit in liberate treat people would with a with bola domestically when their hurricanes or tornadoes we dispatch officers and deploy them to go help strengthen the social the public health and for structure but also to provide direct care we deploy thousands of officers during bovid these officers ism incredibly proud of them i they could be no lots of stuff you outside government of private sector probably making a whole lot more money get no you no work all less hard but they are really committed to protecting the public health of the nation i have the privilege of overseeing that services surgeon general and those those those of the jobs that have signed up for in this roll got it i was not aware of that role and if i understood correctly these people and these public heart officers a that presumably are made up of physicians and lichen psychologists and nurses and forth a the you said they could be making a substantially hiring comes in the private sector but the work that their doing with you is their soul career this point they are completely devoted to that or their doing this as a side hustle now that they are full time government of close and and members of the public heart service their day job is often in public health agencies were their embedded in communities helping day to day to advance public health and during times of emergency hie we deploy them i and and there the extraordinarily well trained a their experienced a dealing with adversity but they bring a combination of skill and heart to their work and you really need both to be effective at public health ism glad that you mention the word emergency because in preparing for our discussion to day it occurred to me that in the a list of roles that a your title assumes that scientific information on how to improve health come first then you mentioned emergency what it'd to talk about first is health non lack of health ye but health it not often we hear about o the mental health crisis but where really talking about is the lack of mental health crisis each mental illness and rarely do we hear for instance what constitutes mental health we hear what constitutes mental illness whereas in the domain of physical health there is a lot of information out there about how to be more physically healthy cartivascal exercise resistance exercise you go type exercise mobility et camera and of course some people have physical health ailments and there is a lot of information terms of how to deal with that as dealt but what i would to know before we get in to the long list of issues that our nation confronts everything for mobility to food out it is to mental health issues what is going we'll in other words in the last let say five to ten years have there been any areas of physical health and mental health improvement in the you ass at large that we can attribute to some of the public health initiatives a directly s that is really goo question and let me just also say about the very first point you raise that you are absolute right that we have operated primarily through an illness frame when we look at health and in my mind that is only one half of the equation we are talking about physical illness for example youknow as a doctor i learned how to diagnose and treat some pul diabetes or with high blood pressure or with ordinary heart disease but we also know that even if i do not have diabetes or coronary heart disease abhor high blood pressure you've i i do not have any diagnosable medical condition i may not be at an opnible level of physical health right i may not be able to for example walk round the block without getting short of breath i may not be able to play with my kids was by physical things and stamina is is sufficient i may not be able to lift my luggage when i go to the airport a because i do not have an a strength in my body yet i would not have a diagnosable mental illness i think it is easier to understand there with physical health that we are not just aiming for lack of illness we are aiming to optimism our physical health the same is true with mental health and i think when we talk about manual people think we are just the sole got here is to prevent diagnosable mental illness that is one to both prevent and to manage a mental illness when it arises but we also need to recognize as a whole other half of this specter where the people may not have diagnosable mental illness but are not operating optimally in their lives and that is detracting from their fulfillment from their functionality in not just at work but also in their communities and in their families and thing part of the conversation that that i want us to have as a country is about how to optimize mental health and well being and that is includes preventing mental illness but it is much broader and bigger i than that alone great i think it is important that we recognize that am treating diseases critical obviously but that there is a lot that can be done to improve one's health even in the absence of any known disease and and you have got all these officers these incredible physicians and a nurses and a people at a your disposal i my hope is that they would also be accessible for and currently carrying out efforts to transmit information to people about pay here are the things that you can do every day every week every month in order to make your life as as healthy as possible am as well as rushing in under conditions of publican crisis yet it is a good good pontes and it is certainly in many of our officers do focus on this broader rubricator and well being but it is part of how we need i think the the router health system and public heal system to operate even outside of government and this i think will require significant change and shift in how we think about our jobs when i went to medical school the vast majority the focus was on diagnosing and treating illness i it was much much less focus on thinking about how to enhance well being and when the you ancient talk to people in their lives it becomes clear that they want to do more than just prevent dago spotless the they want to be able to walk their their child can the isle they want and to have the endurance to do that they want to be able to be independent often and carry their groceries or carry their luggage this is why i think we have got abroad our focus and in public health and look when i came into this role by the way i was not expecting to seven government this was not part of sine five ten thirty year plan a when i was a a kid i was interested medicine but i ways tight i was in a practice medicine my dated and my the clinging my woman set o put up a shingle see patience and a be a primary cure doctor and and feel good about the work i was doing but what happened a to me along the way is a you my i trained in medicine i got interested technology spent seven years building its ichnology company a that was focused on health i got i was became increasingly worried about the way we were delivering health care i feel our hear sister was broken people needed care could not get it was often too expensive to get care we were focusing on treatment solely and not enough on prevention i sturdy getting involved an in advocating for a better healthcare sister when doctors around the country when despite all that i still never thought i would work in government but in two thousand thirteen a i is when a present of bombs team had reached out to me and asked if i be an considering the position of surgeon general and is it what ways interesting to me about this position as especially very different from most positions a the are appointed by president in government and that it is supposed to be an independent position my a agenda the issues i those i hon are not determined by a president or party they are determined by science an the public interest and that is what is w guides me and that is what ye that is what guided me that first term when i served and what present bind asked me to come back on service surgeon general a second time that what is guided me here too a biding is not sending you note saying e could you put some effort into a getting messages out about bovid or could you put more effort into getting your team over to make to deal with the the you get there and which is a long arc tragedy right we get the news and in in a blast of this happened and then the next blast comes in about something else and we forget that there are physical and mental health crises that are on going and and thence i have to imagine that stare to overlap with one another war's it as it your decision whereas how to deploy the financial and and human resources look it pecan put ten people on me ye we are going to put a five people in the central states going around talking to major organizations about what they need to do to prepare for this winter is that how it works were you getting memos and u another words who is your boss everyone has a ass at some level miner is are the listeners of of the podcast at some level i work for them it used to also be my bull dog costly but my my boss my wife and my two kids for five and seven they i i do with they tell me got god but how we make our decisions in the office actually it is it is a bid different o with those two rolls a went with a second one with overseeing the commission for or six thousand officers there the the decisions about how and when we deploy officers a clabrde d you now we work with other comics throughout the department o healing human services we work with people and female cross the administration but we also work w at states sometimes states often often states win's put in a request and say h we need support here can you help we will work with colleagues across our department to sail it will we can mobilize our commission for officers what ask us can you mobile eyes and then collectively we will send a team out there for example we have officers a helping in more wrist now i particularly with mental health needs which are i worry only getting continue to grow over the weeks and months ahead on the other side of the house when it comes to deciding which issues we engage with a public on in this case mental health has been a big focus a area for me on on that front while we certainly are open to suggestions from the public members of congress sometimes say he can you help the public understand about this issue you now lot of people have ideas an opinions but the decision about which issues o focus on those a our offices and to me that is important because part of the reason over time i believe the public came to have some degree of faith in trust in the office is because they hope that the office was functioning the way you hope your doctor's functioning which is being an independent source of information for you in a source that has your best interest at heart that is not being pulled aside by political interests for by other agendas but the primary agenda is how can i help your help and for me aught we have to make an indeed an assessment there and same where is the need the greatest here where can we make the biggest difference sometimes we may not build an an issutive on an issue and that does not mean that that issues on important or that it is not affecting a lot of people behave to make hard decisions about where to put limited resources and when i was surgeon general the the first time one of the big areas i focus on was the olio crisis t we are dealing with as well as the east a cigarette use among youth because we were seeing a dramatic increase among kids in a cigarette house can i just ask you a sort interrupt yet i think it is relevant here am has that increase continued or a e cigarette use e a raping ye we still see fortune they re there is been some improvements but we still see was to many kids who were using a raping devices early on and part of what we did not from our office is recognizing that we actually issued the first federal report on best cigarettes in youth we call the countries attention to the fact that this is a crisis we worked with members of congress i to talk about the kind of action we needed from a legislative and regulatory perspective and worked with colleagues at the ftiatin government as well but there are two things that are really most important in guiding our choice about priorities one is data we look at what the number numbers i shall tell us about the impact these issues are having on the populations well as the trajectory arise if something is getting dramatically worse and people do not realize that might area for us to focus but the other a critical factor is what i hear from people on the road i try to spend as much time as i can visiting community a cross the country doing town halls meeting with a commute members and just try to frankly just listen to what is on their mind and that is where i guess should get a lot of information as well they tell that that is actually how i came to focus on the issue of wonelinessan isolation it was not was i popped up in a report as being the leading public healtisio in the country twas because everywhere i was going two thousand fourteen two thousand fifteen what i was talking of college students talking to retired america talking to parents in real tries an urbanairies i kept hearing these stories about people who fell they were all on their own r they felt in visible they felt if they disappear tomorrow now one would even care e they fell at they just did not belong and it is heartbreaking to hear that from anyone it is particularly heartbreaking to hear it from kids who you hope are entering life and looking for to what comes but many kids were not feeling that way that is very useful context and will get back to the isolation crisis am such an important initiative that m i it is thank you now for having put out the the message on social media and elsewhere butut about that because i think one of the questions i have in light of what you just said is it is clear that you got your ear to the ground you are talking to different people it is also critically important that people here from you and know not just what is happening but that you perhaps want to know what a where the issues why and what the what the actionable steps are that people can take right and i think that we now live in a hyper connected world in fact it'll just ay that one of the reasons i launch as podcasses and twenty twenty i was going on podcast talking about things maintaining sleep in circadian rhythm and stuff for my lab related to irenic conium a just anxiety under it under conditions where i think everyone was anxious and sleep rhythms were disrupted et camera and i was somewhat surprised that i did not get a warning on my phone hey make sure you are getting warning sunlight i it'll get a flood warning ah you will get a warning that i might get a warning but it is only a test warning ill get three of those yesterday living here near the coast but i do not think once during the pandemic did i get a male or a public service announcement saying it if you are going to be indoors a lot you region have to be mindful of maintaining your circadian rhythm because if you are not an we know based on hundreds of studies now that drifts an circadian rhythmicity are a precurcertimental healthishes i mean in fact there is a new idea that many not all suicides are preceded by a period of disrupted sleep which is you uneconomic sense in u and it is not a causal of course but how come during the pandemic we each in all as u citizens did not get an male or a tax s message saying a these are five things that you need to do every day to try and stay as stable as possible in this very uncertain landscape that were in well it is really a question and and i think it is a it is a reasonable in a very good suggestion to say that a look there should be a clear and comprehensive way that we can get messages out to everyone ism if we were working in a hospital system and there was a safety issue that came up they would be female sent to all the hospital staff member saying lathis is somethingyou need to be aware of is i think it is a reasonable expectation a practically if you go back though last twenty thirty years for an an on health issues there has not been sort of an agency you are an entity that has sent males out to everyone first all how to send an male our teleran in america is not a simple proposition either technically its challenging there some legallysshoues you would have to deal with as well but you could do a night where you go see an and fox an b c a b c her times well street let you could hit the right the the right wing the left in and to taken that thrilingtonte one but one one video yes where they all agree a this is important information a a political yes i would say that that kind of messaging i would say through traditional media certainly has happened an it happened during covet i it happened for example when i mavin the first year of covet i was a private citizen in the private pair administration but i you know i watched both then and at the beginning of the abiding administration i many officials would go out in front of cameras and say here are three things you need to do to keep yourself safe from from covet is and that was a big question people hat how do i keep myself safe cat her three things you can do a couple of challenges i would say here is that number one even if you hit all the major net work and cable newsboy you are still not reaching everyone right because were living in it in a society where increasingly people in or watching nevi either getting their news from other sources i the other thing that is important to know is that attention shifts quickly aintraditioal meting also from issue to issue and you might get clip out at a certain a day or you might get on all the sundae shows for example but the next day that message is an necessarily there it is it is gone and people's attention has also switch off to they were i mean i can count and we have long probably thousands of interviews at this point that we have done with mainstream media with sort of concise messages about three things you can do to protect yourself et camera and you knife glad we did those we got to do them but i think one o these we they do not we do not have right now in the country and this is an i think a bit of an health inform structure challenge is wish do not have a quick efficient way to reach everyone in the country with a a health message just what you said water you wanted to get that message about three things to protect yourself from let say covet or three things to do to support your health and well being during a time of crisis ordering a time of health men again to not just the flood warning yes the the daily cause i i do think that most of mental and physical health is the result of daily practice that are you o the build on themselves sort compounded propounded in h basements and then of course there are acute challenges and chronic challenges place but the ageings of that sort too i i think those kind of messages in time of health tat are o absolutely important as well and you might think i think in the sort of i think fast pace crisis driven environment that we live in unfortunate people oftenest a paying less attention to those maintenance or an improvement messages hand they are to managing the crisis messages but i think that they are equally is important but i do think they what your pointing out is an inform structure peace that they needs to be built which is a way for health authorities too reach people with information quickly and comer extensively it'll to tell you that in nineteen eighties when see every coup was surgeon general one thing that he had done a done which was interesting as he had actually sent a letter a physical letter a to all households in america about h ivy physical letter physical letter some of our listeners will not know what that is si you read about the history books is en he show us up in your mail box and you open it and a of something onto read but in this cane case this case he was worried about ah i v about the fact people in know about it he worked through an you with as i understand it with a member of congress found away to do this from a funding perspective but it was a very unusual move and one that was never replicated since and there was never infrastructure funding to do that again am when i was searched at a last ti you knowhow know some years ago and then this time around one of things i did do as i was able to send a physical letter to the medical community i the first time i was about the olio use crisis and about changing our prescribing practices and medics that we exposed fewer patience to the harm of spirits while manure people who needed them actually got them in ta second time it was about covet deropeutics it was about making sure that when we had data about medicines that actually work parotid that we may actually offered them to patience made them available to patience as we were realizing that many people were not getting offered life saving medic medications even tough they were in diarist's groups am we were able to find and we again there too at a sort of creatively cobble together resources funding is is all sort of is a behind the scene's government stuff but e bottoming is in in what you wanted an emergency a and what you want i think in the long term is a simple clear comprehensive way the public health messages can get out to people and to this day what we still have to rely on a art one traditional channels you no traditional media to cover the initiatives we put out whether it ts on social median youth matalhalther loneliness or on youth menahothmore broadly we real to rely on on mine channels which which we do as well or we have a look to creative partnerships that we build with people who reach different audiences and then together we try to get our messages our office dos all three of these but i it is a patchwork and and and it is not always ideal but it is what we do now i think part of what this reflects is a broader challenge in government but also in society more broadly which is it we have valued historically prevention and health communication very little we put the mast majority of our resources in to treatment strategies into getting medications to people into diagnosis and that is very important do not get me wrong but we are now seeing with manahaltisas one example but if we only focus on expanding treatment and deepening are well of knowledge there and we do not do anything to help people stay well the wee just cannot keep up i and i because one problem feeds the other exactly the kids that are stay list an fired grown up in to day's era it'd be on my phone and tablet late at night cause i was up reading magazine and talking friends on the phone lade i is not a criticism but but destruction in sleep destruction in circadian rhythm destruction lack of physical activity poor nutrition social social isolation i mean these are all piling the sand much higher on this in does other side of what you do terms of her i obviousstating the obvious it is just on create a mountain of issues on the other side which presumably has a larger budget is what ism sensing but does not a but there is no way that budget is large enough to deal with tat o me is somebody is kid for instance is am trying to address the issue of weather not to go on prescription medications and or by the way folks and or change their i treat take because they feel they might have eighty they forces i what are they going to do they are going to googly they can listen a pot cast that they they should be able to write first to your organization and say what is the highest level stringency dad a say about these issues and a i should be able to tell them accurately yean maybe you have somebody chime in for them i mean we all pay taxes i pay federal in state taxes em and and and to some extent happily right em because it pays for public works and and many many important things police officers fivewriters et camera but if you do not have a channel to communicate with people bout what they and their kids and their relatives can do then to some extent it feels it it is em it is a coldosack it is how how in the world can we get healthy again were healthier as as a country the part that keeps me up at night is and won's tom the hardest decisions i have to make in the office are putting aside issues said we know deserve about more time and attention ah but we just really do not have the resources to deal with the issues that we have dealt with ism certainly paid it teem that we worked hard to try to raise a awareness of the issues we have taken on whether it is around you o social median youth a mental doctor whet it is around isolation are glenicalclenition burn out or other issues like that but the truth is the there is more than needs to be done more issues an need to be tackled and we have to get to a place where we can you do not talk about what i think of is a for pillars of a healthy life r which are sleep our nutrition our physical activity our social relationships these are all vital elements to living a healthy life right now we are not teaching kids about this in school right but if you think about education and school as a place and a force that should perhaps eradicates for the rest of their lives it should lay a foundation for a healthy life going forward these absolutely are important elements for kits to learn about i i think it is as inborn for kits to learn about how to build and maintain healthy relationships in their life as it is frankly for them to learn how to read in right and i know that is a strong lament to make but it is true in terms of its contribution to their there a happiness or fulfilment their health in their success i i could not agree more we have a series it is out now with a sychatris upalconty about mental health not mental illness about self inquiry and how to use of injury in practices that do not require a therapist in order to bolsterment mental health am of course therifice can be very useful but not everyone has access and not everyone feels comfortable to doing that but we are but one channel demand you are the governing body for this am you are the army a navy and marine to speak of of health as many of have been taking a one daily since two thousand twelve some delighted that their sponsoring the pod cast a one is a vitamin mineral robotic drink that is designed to me all of your foundational nutrition needs of course i try to get enough servings of vitamins and minerals through whole food sources that include vegetables and fruits every day but oftentimes i simply cannot get enough servings but with a one item sure to get enough fitments and minerals and the robotics that i need and it also contains adapted ins to help buffer stress simply put i always feel better when i take a one i have more focus and energy and i sleep better and it also happens to taste right for all these reasons whenever ism asked if you could take just one supplement what would it be i answer a one if you would to try a one they will to drink a one dot calm slash supermen to claim a special offer he'll give you five free travel packs puss a year supply of vitamin d three k to again that is drink a one dot calm lash huberment there is a lots more to explore there a we may have to do several a of these together but i to touch on all of them but may we a em talk about a few of the things that i our listeners asked about when solicited for questions the i more than ten thousand responses across social media in a very short amount of time but there were some redundancy i one of things that ism very curious cannily on that why years when ism really glad that you asked a folks it ti submit questions and was really excited to see how many people shall wrote in but i think it is also dis a testament to how you have done such an incredible job a building a channel to the public to let people know about these topics said that are vital to our heath and well being whether it is sleep or fusil activity or mental health and just what i thank you for shall the work you are down try to help people understand more about health and clearly the fact that folks are engaging their sending questions and there sending comments you means that you rebuilding a relationship there with a lot of folks o just could us you for in l thank you that the audience of the humoring lapodcastis is the only reason we do it i mean i love learning and teaching but i that is the truth they are the podcast an the podcast is them i thank you for that a there were a lot of questions and i also wonder about why is it that many food add it is and preservatives and dies and things of that sort that are not allowed in rope are allowed in you ask food products is a really toe question and decisions are round food an food safety in particular are made by the food and drug administration that is the f t e it is not it is a separate that agent independent agency it is not one that our office i is involved in an sort of directing in any way and we are not involved in those decisions and do not have inside into how their making there drawing their conclusions but they do it in a process that is you guided by sciences they do and with medications with devices et camera with that sat i am concerned that dietary practices the food that many america are consuming are in fact not supporting the health and well being and in many ways are detracting from it when we look at highly process foods one of the concerns i have there is we often see sodium content is very high we see the sugar content is very high and there are certainly added times in there as well that i think we i would love to have more data on the actual health and backs of those but the bottom line is the a significant portion of our diet i is comprised of highly process foods in america and and that worries me the also other piece of this that worries me are just how much we know refined sugars are being added to much of our foods and most people think that sugars are only added to things like deserve et camera but you look at spaghetti sauces said dress is say dressings a lot of these things which we think of is savory products have have sugar added to them as well and we are consuming i think unhealthy levels of sugar in our diet we are consuming fair amount of additives given the process food composition in our diet and i think part of the reason this as happening and and when be very clear i do not fault individuals out there for the composition of their diet necessarily because we have also made certain decisions in our country about what we subsidize about what is cheaper and more expensive for people and the cheapest foods unfortunately are often the most unhealthy foods the most highly process foods if you are somebody who lives in the lowing come neighborhood number of these neighborhoods do not even have grosser store in them which is tragedy because you cannot get fresh proxies et camera a lot of times your shopping your grocery shopping may be done at a local convenient store at a seven eleven or at somewhere else they may not have the array of o fresh fruits and vegetables a you and your family neat i do not no now how they have vegetables i think they have they will occasionally have some lemons or apples or oranges of bananas but when i walk into a convenient store what i see is a pharmacy i really do i see alcohol kafir energy drinks that have a number of different things in them design to stimulate different demodulators dopamine and keratose and i see nicotine products i see high sugar high highly process food keep in in i was a tea major i an i drank my slurps i had my butter fingers was not bartsimson in my lethouder fingers but i them but but it was it was a smaller fraction of of what we ate a when we were at home those foods were either not available or we were not we certainly were not allowed to eat them in at dictum one uses what is clear to me is that the f t er makes decisions about what is safe what is not safe but for instance of this last year there were several papers publish an high quality journal showing that if people eat just hi just sweet and savory foods combined that narial circuits in the brain rewire through process of enrol ploctassy that drives increased appetite and changes the response to healthier food that they do not taste as associating of that sort of a do to a lot of people but i think it was an important sat of findings because it said the brain actually changes in response to the the very a rich favorable foods that a associate with with highly process or even moderately process foods m that is just a couple of studies u there was nothing in those studies that said if you eat these foods you are going to develop cancer but at some point one has to as a citizen a tax bang citizen speaking on behalf of many other tapping citizens i have to take a setback ta how long do we wait right do we have to get a randomize clinical trial about the the the five a hundred thousand sick kids that growing sic adults om and then run a trial where they go on at an elimination diet where they are eating only on process vegan or in process o meat and vegetable or in process starch and vegetable having then we are talking about a thirty year health crisis before the intervene why not i mean if i were in charge which ism not and clearly i would not survive in a government organization because em wealth i got the uniform down i was car the same thing but a uniform but i would not because i would want to say wait why not err on the side of caution why not send out this a i generate tax message that tells everybody in all the languages that america speak and can understand hey you get to make choices about what you eat but you should be aware that ism making your diet comprise of more than fifteen to twenty per cent of these foods it is potentially going to lead to serious issues down the road and those serious issues are extremely serious having the cecity crisis is really a crisis of both body and brain metabolic challenge that we can talk about who sets the thresholds another words we is it that in this country we have to wait until peoples start to get really sick and dying and really struggling before something is done in the direction of their health and ism not blaming you i just want to understand because i question that the wealthy people i know care a lot about their food sources and they pay a lot of attention to it and why are not we allowing every one the opportunity to make better choices this is the right question and this is something i i think about a lot as i ism conscious about what i eat but i also talk to folks around the country and realize a lot of people do not have other the information a ore the resources actually purchase healthy foot right and to know what is can be good for them for their families this is why you n i mention we have a list of issues that we would work on we had more mort more resources this is actually want of them because to me one of the most common questions people ask is what should i eat that is simple but it is it is vexing it is complicated it is incredibly confusing if you go on lining to treat a search for information and it is a classic example of ware it is important to have an objective scientific authority that can come an and speak on broad principles around diet that can talk about what we know and do not know the hearts it important thing i think a lot of times people may see something is a on the market they my realist of ingredients they do not recognize half of them cause their additives but they figure well if it is there than it must have been studied for thirty forty years and there must be no harmful consequence is right but sometimes things are are put out there because we have short turned at that says that their o we and there might be but there may be need for more long turd ay to helping people understand what do we know what o we not know is important that people can make decisions for themselves based on how much rest they want to take the other thing tho the concerns me here drew is i you look i i have to i have a biosphere and my bias is that i am worried about the additives and other products we have in food they do not have long terms at a that is clear in terms of heltherests hand's o because of that my basis generally to think how can we get people a you do not minable or less process foods and how can we get the more fruits and vegetables how can we make sure that they have that more available to them but we have got to not only make the information ofvailble but we have to make it accessible from a cost perspective if you do not have a grocery store in your community if vegetables and fruits cost three x what t other foods to the son be a problem right to change diet the other thing we have to keep in mind is that you do not food companies you know a lot of do a great job ofjactu try to get healthy nutritious food out to people an own kudos to them but i worry also that there's an intensive also to just try to sell more and more and more of your product and one of the ways to do that is to tread a hack a the body the kind of figure out cable what kind of synthetic actives could i put together here or what kind of a combination of nutria's could have put together that will get people coming back for more and more and more we all this in the nicotine industry you saw the vicinity you also i would say another inperillels you see it in social media is well were the business model of the social immediate platforms is built on volume of use right how much time am i spending on the platforms it is not quality of time it is quantity of time right if that is the business model then you are going to design your platform to maximize how much time some one spends on them regardless of whether it is detecting from sleep detracting from unperson inter action detracting from anything else his healthy regardless of whether that may be causing certain harms relic the business model dictates in many ways how these things are designed and tat applies i think to food is well which is why i think it is incumbent upon us to be particularly cautious a with highly process foods foods that foods that have additives and to understand how is his impacting our brain how is that impacting or satiety how is it on leading potentially to greater ingestion that is healthy and leading to things obesity which have a whole hosts of other medical conditions from cancer to arthurite is to dibedies is and hart disease associated with it those are the questions is a as a citizen is a father of two young kids who try to bring them up at the healthy life cell this a the questions that i would want to know the answers to it is on of the reasons i think these kind of objective reports are important for the public ism stay to see the the scope or the problem in the mechanics involved in to and to alleviate these issues are complex i see that well they're not also thing one thing is is imprint to do tit to is you need to have authorities that can speak to these issues better isolated from political retribution right and to explain this i in to that ye look mean listen a somebody forgive me for interrupting by somebody who from time to time will am make not recommendations but will offer information about potential actionable items no things that people could do or not do according to a couple of studies that come have come out ism have come under intense scrutiny from my colleagues am who are weight that is not a randomized control trial how can you do that and yet i know from being in this feel for a long time that for instance the emerging therapies for for pitiosty and depression that are now based on federal funding for things a and ism not recommending this by the way for children are for everybody but for instance the a sacred suicide ben they vertically supported a legal use of sylicidein for for a major depression the dato there are they are not perfect but there pretty dawn good compared to the major issues or eyes am but for years if if an academic said that the words i just said they lose their job only a instantaneously cause their controlled substances am that is i that is to do but then their number of things that were talking about here that are just about making better choices about things to avoid right if people understood i think that am i is sugar poison while some of my audience will say sugar's poisonous as addictive is coming luck it is not as a fictive is cosine or heroine it is not however if a child or adult is eating very sweet or very savory foods of any kind consistently if those are not am healthy foods or if they are if they contain in healthy additives overtime the brain will rewire that healthy foods do not taste as good right they will not be the choices that people make an you r on and up with a sick individual period and i do not think we need one more clinical trial funded by federal tax dollars to support that statement what ism trying to gather s that you are a very rational grounded broad thinking individual not just saying that cause you are sitting here and you are trained in medicine and you understand the science of but that you do not have the means at your disposal to put out a call that says hay folks having some sugar everyone smile treating the kids to ice cream grate but if eighty per cent or more of the diet it of our kids is not made up of minimally your non process foods they're brains are going to be rewired and unhealthy ways and you can almost expect that there are going to have some health challenge in the future that may not be am opium or schisafrenia but is going to be a major health challenge of and that is serious and nose the time to intervene by avoiding certain things ye and if you do not want to do it look it is a free country at that level you are welcome to do it but you be better off spending ex number of dollars on these healthier foods yew because there is also and we know this from my colliallycrumbs laboratory standard that even the mere knowledge that certain foods are nutritious can lead to more satiety from eating those foods at the level of hormone release not just psychologically are telling yourself of the oranges as tasty an and filling as a sandbar but the understanding of of the fact that it is nutritious actually leads to shifting patterns of of gremlin secretion et camera that that share not people can be feel better on a a healthier slightly lower gallery nutrient en rich diet a healthy prolines and fruits of vegetables and it is not a mine trick it is its physiology o anyway i i i think i feel your pain it frankly and it'll tell outlook something as people as e one oh his grand say couple of statement to you just said when that we find like wire whys time needed to prison met that our resercinated et camera here is chilly walk i know it in to days age is easy to just go in rattleoff off on a ofticofs statement in her shoot from the can my social idiot channels and a really way to get the word out to millions i appreciate i may y up on that but it'll take the one of the reason whole things we always to do recognizing that when we put out statements that people people one they they trust its coming from a scientific authority an that it is been voted right we put the effort and time intervening this thoroughly we check sources we look of the day that we talk to experts we think about how to communicate this in the right way that is the work behind this scenes work are that we do before we put out said reports and an initiatives because we want people to have have confidence in in what there hearing we also know that when we put out initiatives that other people build on them philanthropists an and foundations will than think about should give fund work in this area schools and work places will think about shifting some of their practise policy makers will also think about legislation o that they may i want to design base on that we want to make sure i it is really solid but the point i was making when i set also that we have to make sure that not just our ifs but o folks who are in public help then who are in medicine who are try to speak to the public about their health that they are protected from a retribution attacks this is what i meant which is that saying things about diet saying things about tobacco these can be challenging for some folks because the are industries built around these right which may not always what you have to say if it hurts their business model i or their bottom line and they may then lean on apolitical leaders elected leaders other to then try to silence you or shut you up and it'll tell you have experience this in the past en i ways certain general during my first term i had issued to a key reports one was on alcohol drugs and health about the addiction crisis and the other was about the cigarette crisis among youth i will tell you that they were plenty of people who are very unhappy that i was issuing the first feel report on ye cigarettes ism folks who felt that hey ism is soon to make folks unhappy its in a great political pressure or i it is contcradle a lot of problems i similarly with alcohol drugs and health there are many folks who said hey if you do this you are really on upset the alcohol industry do you really meed to have alcohol in the report why do not you just focus an other drugs ism want you take alcohol out of the title all of these sort of unconcern yore realign you this so her people who get paid by the algal industry on these are people in government who are reading the tea leaves and who wo are supported of the work we are doing butter thing hey you are gingko really unsettle lot of people and is is they and also get a helpful lot of yet we this is what it comes out to this it well and if you upset folks than they're been a trotted fire you ton a tread to all these things to which honesty my my response to a lot of these and the reason we just put them out anyway was because i said the worst thing that can happen is i get fired and that is get if i if i go out known i did the right thing here then ism fine with that ism not looking to build a life long career in government ism not doing this job to like you now get to the next thing on the latter or this is about serving for the time i can i wanting beagle to go to sleep at night look myself in the mirror and know i did with integrity ism the was an easy decision for me but but my point is that we have to be thoughtful that in these issues said they're going to be head winds right ism sure in your case for example you probably got and push back from folks about talking about certain things that may have rankled ill folks who may have had an interest in those issues not cat you keep talking about them as as you should and ism grateful for that ism but this is i she especially important at a time where i think public trust in are institutions more broadly and in science and in medicine have taken a hit over the last few years and i think it is of time we're we have to be even more vigilant those of us in medicine and public health to make sure that what we do is base o data that were transparent about why we are saying what we are saying that we are also clear about what we know and what we do not know that if recommendations change o wartime people recognized that this is not necessarily flitflopping you should change your recommendations if the data changes i if the circumstances change i neat this is all part of the work that we have got to do but to me this is a really important part of the work the integrity behind our work in public halt is not just about the issue were taken on to day it is about the trust that we need to rebuild i in the field more broadly understand correctly if you were to for instance a put out a call that says there are food natives that are allowed in the you ask that ore not allowed in rope that maybe of risk we do not have enough data at at present to say to avoid these things but here is a kind of a yellow zone you green known to be safe red clearly known to be unsafe yellow we just do not know yet not enough data here is what my recommendation would be for my children yet free country the people to argue it it is not but at least at the level of which foods you want buy with your own mud it tit is it is a are country you are saying that you get messages that warnings about certain things could lea to push back but if i have to imagine that there is something and ism not a conspiracy curious but there has to be either the people that are saying look there could be problems are just friction verse there just do not any one to be angry at any one were there there must be someincentive for things to remain quiet mean mantel the government has not had problems saying h to do things or to not do things that had that upset companies ere shut down companies or were else ate companies and there success ism copied to know more about the the fact contour this the look on i think and this is not to disomelar frothing what happens and in other industries but it is been a whenever you you do something and whether in the privatesaturen government people we with where the prose cons what is to bushbuck on get how to i deal with that bushbuck right and bushbuck in always a bad thing right if you get pushbike from the public people hey that does make sense to me sera that is you should listen to that and and use it to inform your approach but that is the public whose your job is to serve i time bushbuck from companies is is different rights when bushbuck comes from people who have a financial interest i in the product that you may be commenting on then you you have got to be you need to know about the never one that how to had unmitigated and well people may take different approaches to this my approach as a public official as surgeon general has been to say it the end of the day ism happy to to hear from any one interns of their concerns are bushbuck but the and the day what is going to guide my decisions about what we issues we take on what decisions we make and what we say to the public is gin to be what is in driven by science an the public interests and if that means it is policy inconvenient that oka if that means that something happens it into my job that is o hate too we look the bottom line his life is short we don't no much time we have here we may as well make the time we have count we must not do the things that that are right and that deserve people that is mi some loss hin my parents sobbing when i was growing on that is the of the proactive i bring to this and that is why if we were to do let us say an initiative on diet i have no doubt that them the things t we would say would be perturbing i to folks who had a financial interests in industry cause i do not think that the current set up in industry is serving the public well i think we have made unhealthy foods cheap that is a problem we have made healthy foods expensive that is a problem we've put health from a dietary perspective out of reach for millions of america that is a fundamental problem and we have also disemboweled people wibutby not giving them the information that they need to make decision even if you have resources i can't her their people tinning to this pod cast a many more people out there who go to the grow stories feel confused what on earth should i buy what is healthy what is o c any more a it is is hard to know and i think we have done a disservice by not doing more to help the public understand and access i healthy foods and again it is why it is an issue that that then it was on our lists of issues that we would want o work on cause i think that the public health need hers is immense id to just take a brief break and thank one of our sponsors which is element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt sodium magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar now salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called anurans now people of course have varying levels of requirements for sodium people with high pretension or prehigh pretension probably should not increase their sodium however many people are surprised to find that by increasing their sodium take they are able to function better cognitively and physically n that is because a lot of people specially people are falling low carbohydrate or even moderate carbohydrate and really clean diets oftentimes are screening a lot of water and electrolytes along with it and simply by increasing their electrolyte intake using element they just feel better and function better i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kind of physical training and certainly i drink element in my water when ism in the sauna and after going in the wanna because that cause is quite a lot of sweating if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is elements doc cam slash supermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element elements dot cam slash supermen have a question about trust in big institutions and public health initiatives in general the cushions about masks early in the pandemic as i recall we were told that masks were not necessary then we were told they are necessary and i think for a lot of people that flip in messaging landed apparent telling their than age kid to always were a seat belt but then you look into the front seat and commandant our wearing seat belts and as anyone has been around than ages her has been one you make that mistake once you are not making it again and you may never recover from that particular example in other words the public felt there was a switch of messaging but what i do not recall happening was a a hey we got that one wrong sorry on us what the new date i say blank what i recall was a message of do not and then do but there was not a lot of em kind of acknowledgment of of how challenging the situation was it was just a lot of top down mandates and in my opinion and this is just my opinion i think that led to a pretty rapid distrust of subsequent messages from which we still have not really recovered and why do you think it challenging for public facing officials to just say look doing the best we can at the moment screwed up before changing the message and ow may change again navigating this and in real time its dynamic ye please stay with us because goes without saying there is been a huge chasm around just in related issues yet it look this it is important question and lo i ism always i want to be thoughtful about a how i comment on what was done in the first year o the pandemic i was i was as hand as outside government and i do notknow what was happening in side government in terms of the a the decisions i remain made there but i do know sometimes for my experience any bola and inside during those experiences we had as the country that in the you in the fog of war when everything's coming at you sometimes it is hard to make the right decision all the time right i want to give some of those folks who were there in the first were the pandemic some benefit the doubt but i do think that the important thing the principle i i certainly try to follow but when this think that and you we can all do better i can do better certainly too but i think important principle for us in public communication has to be there were clear that were transparent about what we know and what we do not know i and that we explain the why to people for it telling some one to do something why is it because this lot a dated behind it is it because it is a sort of expert agreement best practice case sometimes as an in medicine sometimes when we do not have enough data to guide us oat there peptic reproach but when the problem is imminent then sometimes experts will get together and put together expert inform guidelines to say o call base on our best judgment and the limited data we have here is what we recommend and as the data evolves we will change an in modify those recommendations we do the with high pretension right e evolve an up a recommendations we do that with lipids i here too i think that has to be a could keep part of the approach i think one of the challenges that i saw many publichealth officials encounter was even when they went out with comprehensive messages that which are hard to fit into a sound bite or to simple posts on social media i often lot o that was not covered what gets covered is the top line this is what is being recommend at that is what is being required et camera all the explanation is lost its missing right and i think we also are living in a time where people are reading had lines their leaving busy lives right there not necessarily always hearing all of the new aunts you know that is being explain i but i think that that is a challenge right is know many public official struggled with how do you deliver new ants inform nation a at a time when there is not a clear black and white answer to things but i think the last piece around this is a i think something was daughter early in medical school is to approach your patience with humility recognizing that even though you have more training than they do you do not are not living their life you do not necessarily know what they are going through and you should not assume a things about them again preaching with humility means that a you have got a recognize that not everyone can be able to follow your guidance and if they are not able to the disiminou criticize them it also means recognizing that people may have ideas or suggestions for you the mayashally improve your recommendations or how you communicate and i these are the principles i think that are important in public communication but i think that both the challenge of translation new ants arguments into what is actually covered that was tough from any public health officials i thin the other thing honesty then a human level that became hard for many of them and i am thinking prertyclear about local in state public health officials who are in the front lines that i talk to a lot was they ended up getting attacked a lot an abuse a lot during the pandemic and do not just mean attacked on line i mean people shown up at their houses people harassing their children a people threatening their safety am and in these was often people who were upset about some of the requirements that were being put down from local departments of health and you can understand locket was a stressful o time is we have seen recently people lost their jobs people were losing loved ones i mean talk about distressful time but i think that a human level public health officials who were exposed to that kind of abuse and who start to worry about their children safety a many of them stepped out of the remand said is this really worth it to put my family at risk am and that was hard because we lost a lot of good public health people in that respect i think in addition to having sort of these core principles of public health communication in place they what we also see to restore is not environment were we of frankly of humility and civility we do not attack people who maybe have different views or coming out the recommendations that ism are not palatable to to asks and and i think it is also incumbent upon our leaders in society to not still that kind of resentment ad and violence as well cops that happened during the pandemics clove got increasingly politicized and what that may have been at times done for political reasons here and there the people who suffered were both the public help leaders were trying do the right thing for their communities and the public themselves who were not able to have a clear direct channel i to an a dialogue with their public health officials i because a lot of that edit up getting closed off i feel like there was a lot of talking down to the dissenters in the general public ye and i tolly agree that ism you know getting violent or harassing people with whom you disagree is is totally an appropriate in yo the one thing just to say about the humility pies and i'llgive men example here of wear i think this could have no should have been done better is not an effort for example around masks i to recommend the people wear masks and one importanthing just to know is that when it comes to schools requiring masks i those are decisions that are made on local levels wet the federal government does not mandate masks and schools does not the authority to do that the are local local decisions but the end of the day they were people who did not want their children to wear masks right for variety of reasons some worried about their development social developments some worried that twas adding streets to their kits people had met i different reasons why they may or may not have wanted their children to wear masks and one on the things i think that was not helpful was it when they were to components who made the decision they do not want their kits to wear masks i i think some of them received a lot of criticism without people necessary stopping to understand why they may have been making that decision exalsay is a parent whose children were in school in my kits are five and seven and ain the first year the pandemic they were doing preschool virtually which was a nightmare it was incredibly hard for us even the they got back to school and the fall of a twenty twenty one i it was a really tough adjustment for them and i could understand some o the concerns the parents i were having wondering about hey how are these precautions affecting my child's experience and social development on the whole this recommendation may still be i hey improve ventilation your class rooms recommend masking recommentesting et camera but those recommendations i think have to be made in a way that acknowledges the humanity of people who are may have a different point of view or may make a different decision a for their child and i know that when local localities made the decision in many cases to require a schools in their in kits in their district to wear mask that put some parents who did not want that i put them in o hart place right and but i think that are a failure to actually have an open honest respectful conversation about this were we did not feel we were i each being a tacked as parents for our decisions or as commune members for the decisions we were making i think that not only hindered i think the response but i think it actually contributed to this division the sense of black and whiteness that hates us against them and then suddenly if i was against one measure that i was against all of them if i was for one measures for all of them because we just tarted segregating into sides i and is became polarized you experience at a time where really it should have been a crisis that brought us together as messes it was and that honestly drew is what i worry about most for the next pandemic i i think we have learned a lot from this pandemic about a how to manufacture vixens and n had a developed them quickly i had a distribute them efficiently in we had on i won't is one of the thing most historic and an effective acting distribution efforts in this country even though certainly could have been better but it was historic by by all measures we have learned a lot about how to do valines their puts a lot of the nuts and bolts o a a pandemic response well but i worry what we are still struggling with is he we build trust how we communicate with the public and how we stay together as a country in the face of adversity cause if organ if we are divided the way we were during bovid during the next pandemic or the the next i for i a thought that may come from for an adversary that is a huge national security issue for us and that that is what keeps me up at night when i think about the next pen that make that may come two questions relate to what you just said first of all am as it relates to valines in my opinion i and i think the opinion of many people out there that the response to the next pandemic am will be heavily contingent on at least some sort of acknowledgement that there are people who at least feel that there's been waxing injuries right to simply say am decade the previous tat round with bovid went this way and now there is now virus acts right let us hope not and god forbid but sounds i gets coming at some point and people are going to think to the last time and they are going to immediately say well the last time we were told to i take of axing some people had a good experience with that other people did not and it in this empathy model of acknowledging and outvote letting your moral compass guide an understanding the why behind what people are a are doing and how the reacting it seems to me that now would be the time to at least trying to understand where their coming from even if one disagree sees maybe even especially if one disagrees and try and get people alined now before the next pandemic it and ism what efforts are being made if any to try and acknowledge ism that some people really do feel as if they were harmed ism not saying they were not but clearly there are people who feel that they where people they know were harmed is there an effort to present them with data to have discussions with them to try and get people aline that the next time around ow we can be more of a unified from whatever the necessary response happens to be yet now is the really important question and and to me i always go back to but first principles from practising medicine it which is if there is a medicine you give a patient and even if it helps nine in a when in i percentipatients but this one particular the patient to happen to be harmed by it you go in you acknowledgment you talk about it and you together trot out a path for how you want to move forward and teethe pathos might be yes let us get rid of that medication but let season alternative let us try it or we cannot use that medication any more here the risks you may sustain but will find other ways to protect you right that is what we would do in medicine wright that is what have done with patients over the years i think here too similarly when the when it comes to tracking adverse events from vixens this is an air where the sexy seen the f t track and collaborate and tracking means not just not only collecting reports from the public and from citations when they see an effect that may be related to a vixen but it also involves analyzing those to see we they quarreler tor where there's actual causation there right because ism if i f to day for example i felt unwell an i trace back what happened yesterday in it turns out hey i ate this beside that was out in the the sun for was too long the question is am i feeling sick because the bride or did the breeder just happen to be a yousomething to hap than met it is independent of how ism feeling maybe turns out somebody was actually sick with a g i bug around me and that is the reason that ism in the way i am to day analysis that needs to be done on cases that a reported is important and it is something that the seedy seem the after do together now that analysis i think is essential to communicate clearly to the public i and whenever i engage with folks in the public which we do often and people will talk to me about their experiences with fact scenes i do these important to acknowledge what people have gone through like some people for example when i got a vacated for cove or example i i felt i had mild flue symptoms for a couple days it was not great i would note prefer i did notion know have those feelings and than i felt better couple days later and then i moved on but i acknowledge it did not feel good to to feel that way there another people who may have had experiences where they felt that they ha more serious inside of facts and there maybe question was that related to the fact scene or not i think we have to not here and acknowledge those n i certainly try to do that i know i the probably think it is important to keep doing that a cross all of government but i also think it is important for us to to help people understand the process that we have to go through to understand whether those are related or not if you go on line and the ad see a sight that where they collect a lot of this information and you just purely look at reports that are given of potential adverse effects that you cannot sort of take that and say ah those are all related to the vac scene look at this rate of harm it is extraordinarily high because we do not actually do that with any other vacenior medicine i sure we e start there we do the analysis and we try to understand what is actually related or not i think that is that is what we have got a do here too one last thing it'll says that it is important i think also for us to to help put this in contact of other vaccines and medicines and interventions that we use for example just take hymenal for example most people think go well tile all it is safe there is nothing bad happens if it take tall et camera but people who track the data know that tile all buy enlarge is a generally speaking a safe medication but there are peoplewho experience adverse effects from tile in all liver damage and other a adverse effects and that data is available but what has happened in the case of that medication is that the risks and benefits are boast analyze and then a recommendation is put forward about a generally safety to use it and then there is data put out about the the subside effects common or rare right but i think sometimes we also forget that a lot of the medicines that we have come to take and just see is normal part of our life just any other of akene that there is some a rate of reside effects that will happen i say that because what i worry about in the black and white environment that we are living and is sometimes people will take an anecdote about a potential adverse effect and will portray that is the rule in will say well look i know somebody who had this side effect nobody should take this cause is is what is going to happen to you if we did that nobody would ever take tile in all no onewould ever take i beprophen no one would take unique no one would take any the common medications that we pick up at their drug store and that we commonly use that is how i think we have to approach us with a commination of a clear communication pathic listening and and data and contacts am again that does not fit neatly in it in a an a social media post per say but i think part of what were we need to do is a country is rebuild the relationship honestly between the medical public health establishment and the public and i think its sorts with this kind of communication the other question i had about the next pandemic and the one we just had is a why not have committees of people of diverse background social economic diversity racial diversity every aspect of diversity rather than individual standing there telling us what to do for several reasons one as am we are country of many different people i think we there are dozens if not hundreds of scientific papers showing that patients follow the advice of doctors that look them and sound them or to whom they would aspire to be we know this and yet public health officials typically are unitary one person telling us do this do not do that this is a good idea that is a bad idea i but one citizen but ism putting up both hands both we in all toes and saying committees small but diverse committees that people can relate to and feel as if the messages that they are getting are vetted through a common understanding yes it is really god suggestion and and i could not are with you more that a diversity of voices is really important to to get a message out and during covenashy that is one of the thing is that our office sector was always helping to build was something called the community for i were we actually we recognize is a very clearly ness to something i yon i came to see as a doctor sometimes i was a right person a message to patient sometimes i was not i sometimes it was the nurse sometimes it was the medical students sometimes it was an administrator or the the social work or a different background different life experiences part of this work is going going to step up when to step back i but the communiticoure that we were building was a really diverse you group of people and lot of had public help backgrounds but a lot of more community leaders who understood health eventhough thy didn't have formal training a but they people who knew their communities and they had the trust of their communities and they understood what was going on they wanted to be helpful we brought them together to say of look here is what the science is telling us here the general recommendations a here is we would provide you ask us any questions you have something we do not know will go back and look it up a but you are the leaders in your community they should be hearing from you about about these messages and t n that those folks went out and actually we work closely with them collaborated with them they would design the messages for their community base on what they thought made sense and weren't taken what we said word for word we do not want them to but to me that kind of divers approaches what we need more now you will see what would i would have liked i would have liked if more media net works put those folks on ten and got them on the radio right because it is important that many of them were showing up in their communities were knocking on doors were i doing local podcast et camera and that was great but i would have liked more of their faces i carried on levy right that is a place where when we talk to media and my tout folks inmediaa one of things i encourage them and pushpin to do also s to say look if you can take more of these diverse faces and voices and put them out their that is she good for the community and also helps people see that it is not one or two people were a sort of push in a gene here this is a the public here communities big it is broad it is diverse at as lot of voices and and s the more voices we can hear from as public thin the better off we are hear her i i again i genuinely hope in pray that we do not have another pandemic but if in when we do i hope there will be committees rather than individuals i know we this is a thing in this country we the idea that one persons can a save the climate one persons can a save transportation one person the other covers the person of the year type approach d i but we but then we get frustrated when that person does things or makes decisions that we do not in their public personal life and then it all seems to fall into division and i just feel not talking about groups of hundreds of people at small groups i think we are lined in that way look there there is the thing in a notion that em i think some has we do want the one person who can not only necessarily have all our trusts and we can look to but also who we can hold accountable something i does not quite work out of we do not something and and hell i get that set of mentality i think that in this moment especial cretin a rebuild trust i think it is important for people to know the what they may be hearing in terms of medical torsi a public couth recommendations it is one for them to know how broad an audience that is coming from or broad a group of experts right and we there was a lot more broad agreement for example during loved and i during you bola during zeta on public health recommendations but you wouldn't always know it if you turn on the deny as you worsening a the same couple of faces i think we have to to certainly diversify that om one other thing i than it'll tell you that is important here is i think we have to also think about how we fund groups on the ground that are doing the the hard work of getting public heath messages out because one of things that those groups often would tell me and these are might a groups ism om talk about the comedy organization that spent years in a neighborhood getting to know families where folks recognize them when they are walking down the street they go yet that is a personal organization acts they understand as they get us there looking out for us lot of those organizations had spent their resources helping the community getting to know the community but they did not have sophisticated mechanisms to apply for grants for example they did not have grant riders who had done this a thousand times historically those groups have a hard time getting supporting funding it'll say one is to thing my my wife did which i certainly was very proud of is she was helping to to build an effort and to build an an nonprofit organization with a couple of colleagues that a organization of people who knew how to get money how to apply for grants how to get foundation support but who also had the wisdom to know that the most important they could do was to give portions of that money to groups on the ground they saw themselves as an organization that channeled money to groups that had trust and they executed their their their mission that way and that was very effective and i think we need more of that when it comes to disseminating finding one thing getting many people may not i may r may not appreciate is that when you it is actually hard from government to put out a lot of money i at once and to do quickly right when love got a lot of funds tat you need to get into communities what happens as a federal government author will give it to states states will then give it to local communities i to the local department of public health by apart potentially and then they will look to distribute it t others that takes time but it also means if you are not connected to that network if you do not know your local department o health or you are not connected the state department health sometimes it can be challenging to figure out how to get the money and i think we need more operations i we my wife and others have been building to try to get those funds directly to the folks who not you do not stay have the most fancying of grant writing operation but they have the relationships cause f the end of the day it is those relationships that create the trust it is a trust that allows inform life saving information to get to people and that is the length it is missing interesting farmer big farm i got a lot of questions about whether not big farm is on the take for every public health initiative now as somebody who understands a bit about and certainly believes in the use of certain prescription medications i find most i questions about quoting big farmer to overlook the fact that there are thousands if not hundreds of thousands of medications that save lives and enrich people's lives that a prescription drugs ii'lso believe my audience knows i say it over noveragain that better living through chemistry still requires better living we still have to get our sunlight get our sleep social connection good nutrition exercise an all those things there is just no pill that is going to replace those but i think it is a valid question that people are asking is there a direct relationship between big farmer and public health initiatives in a way that should have us concerned about the messaging that were getting and hat times and the fact that the united states consumes the vast majority of drugs for mental health for instance as compared to other countries that is one question and then i want a dove tail into that question what are your thoughts on the fact that there is a history of the tobacco industry being a very interdigitate shall we say with government policies in ways that had us basically injure if not kill millions of america and then eventually say you cannot smoke on your hospital you cannot smoke anywhere there is very few places where you can consume tobacco products that that kind of relationship and financial incentives and then a lot of back peddling later i think were on peoples em trust how should we frame the relationship between the farmer suitable industry government an public health initiatives in a way that is you know at least half way functional it look i understand where the concern in suspicion comes from right and look i i think it is important that public health initiatives and medical advice is independent of the influence of industries i may seek to profit from what is being recommended or from medications are being prescribed and we look we have a history in medicine right of doctors who were you given gifts and vacations and all kinds of fancy things by farmaccompanies and an effort to influence what they prescribed that was really problematic and now we are seen a lot less of that which is good lot of rules hade been put in placed by medical societies and professional societies and by economic institutions to say this is an unacceptable way to practice and that is really important cause i do think that human psychology is that sometimes we under estimate how much were influenced by incentives we think a ye ism getting that but i know ow to make independent decisions but an unity we r human and when were influence words a great drug it could be while this is he drug is rally helping my patience unhappy to recommend it to them yet that's it was sort of i want us every one they though taking money from a farm a companies as a physician i think it is highly problematic right i think it is hard to say that it does not influence practice may be does not for some people but it it is really hard to know who this people are a i do think that separate from that you can be a physician who prescribes medications as you believe they work look as a doctor i have prescribed many antibiotics during cases of infection that have helped my patience and i would prescribe those again i am glad that those exist a in many cases they've save the lives i a patients has caring for in the hospital that is what with should drive us i is is does the data show that they work and does our patient need them right that is what should drive er decisions when it comes a public hell toe recommendations here to i thing a similar principle holds which is that i do not think that farm a money i should be influencing our public help decisions which means that it should not be funding our public health organizations that are making recommendations a certainly i la you that this is obvious to you but it'll say just to be clear for everyone who is listening our office a does not take any money from industry not just farm industry for many industry our the money that we get is allocated by congress at the end of the day it is backstay our money and that is all we get and and that is important we do not want money from the from from farmasuitable companies am but that is important because people need to know that these decisions are not being made for for financial gain amwlthat is i be being said i there is a broader concern i have drew which is i think that we have become a pail for every problem society well we look for a quick fix of a medicine for every challenge a that we may incur and some time s yes ism ism a believer that if science you now helps us create a medications that can help solve disease we should use them appropriately but i think we discount heavily the behavioral changes that we need to make the more broader suicidal and environmental changes that we need to make that influence our health our food environment matters for our health our decisions about how physically active we are matter for our health whether not we sleep matters for our health and all of these impact our mental health and well being as wealth and i i when when i think about the that by us that that to me is not always stemming from money that came from a farmer suitable company although i think it the adds that we see all the time from farm a companies i thing try to convince us that hay just take this pill once a day and all your probe ill go away but i think it is more complex than that and and i think that even for you in to health care setting if you are if you are seeing a patient who has pain whose having intense pain if feels easier sometimes to proscribe a medication for that pain rather than trying to to deal with non medicatishian based approaches ore try to get the deeper origins of the pain ism not saying that is what doctors do all the time but ism saying that we are living in an environment an a broader culture were we i think increasingly reach for something that we see is a quick immediate fix and i gan do not blame people for that we rather take a quick fix over some its can to take a long time but i think it is selling us i think sometimes a false hope which is that that is all we need to solve our problems and in the a lot of times you need more you need the behavior of changes lined the environmental changes ism that is one of my big concerns in terms of how we communicate about health would a potential solution be this idea of small committees let us say somebody's experiencing chronic pain localized or general that they would go to their g real practitioner but in the room would also be somebody who understands sematic medicine a a she train clinical psychologists who understand someattics that the body in the brain are linked through the nervous system am and could also assess a possible psychological routes of the issue and then somebody in the room who can make a behavioral nutritional am even supplementation based safe supplementation base recommendations and then the physician who can say in in addition to that i think the person should have on hand you knot a five milligram dosage of a prescription drug that if they need it they could take and i think it would provide a lot of protections against a potential adverse effects of any one of those things in isolation a the great protections in having people meet in groups a for lots of reasons and the person would feel very well cared for again small committees of people worth diverse experience pooling together to treat people from a for lack of a better word more holistic perspective why not ism your disposing the dream i dare not exactly what we need interdisciplinary teams that can provide in o grave care recognizing that in this stain age there not one person who has all the expert teas to help us figure out how to best manage or help challenges the thin what we have not figured out or couple things and for one who are all the right people who need to be in the room for her the sort of virtual room if you will the second is how to we create a a structure a healthcare system where that can actually happen with efficiency where can be reverse appropriately but that what we should be doing and then the third leg of that is the the group experience for patients right and there is increasingly in a more clinics and healthcare systems are on the country that a working on creating group experiences where patients who all let say a working on die on their diabetes a come together let say once a wee e and they meet with the help care practitioner that might be in addition to their individual appointments but there is much power in groups coming together groups of patients who can find community who can help each other learned from each others experiences that is highly under utilized right now in medicine i but to really do this well drew they means that we have to we have to pull back from the model we have had for years in medicine which has been a very a highly individual i type model which says okay you go to your doctor you see your doctor one on on you get everything you need maybe you need to go see specialist than you wait a few weeks get another pointsmen drive thirty miles go see somebody else maybe they're connected to the electronic helpsisan maybe there not maybethey know what was discuss me they they do not maybe they will call and talk to their prime cure doctor but maybe they will not to there too busy and that you is a patient are stuck tronapiece all this together what will often in pain will yet in in physical and emotional anguish en offering to my own experience a that have had you mild examples compared to what other people dealt with but people with chronic fit pain or irritable for understandable reasons i man tit it is or maybe somebody is close veering towards suicidal depression then there is the interpersonal effects i man i feel the the crisis's is one of a lack of efficiency and thoroughness and ism an again ism not throwing stones of the medical profession i i you believe that it is a collection of mostly a well meaning people turn to do their best but the specialist model and the referral model is incredibly combers it really is cumbrssom and and you look i having worked with many medical professions over the years i these are call i deeply admire men that they are there for the right reasons they wont to help people alleviate suffering but they too are feeling burned out and prostrated by the inefficiencies of the system as ill tell you one of the greatest contributors to burn out for doctors and nurses is they lack of self efficacy it is seeing a patient who has a problem in front of you and feeling you cannot get them to help that they need that is the the greatest paper cot if you will a to the sort of spirit of clinicians and many find themselves in that circumstance where they either find that they know what is needed but the system is throwing up prior authorizations or other insurance hurtles and preventing their patient from getting that care or they're kind of at the edge of their experts right this happens to pediatricians and primary caredotches more broadly all the time with mental help right most of the mental health care that is delivered in this country is delivered in primary care offices right now primary curidoshis i necessarily train specifically and only in mental health yet they find themselves having to manage a lot of that including increasingly complex substance used disorders and you treatment resistant depression and they need help figuring that out but if you do not have a lot of resources to get that referral to collaborate with the mount a help professionals and you are stuck on your own figuring that out and you think the pain is being experienced mostly by nations and but also very much by clinicians and that is why that overhaul is needed and i think look a lot of this is ism not to help cure economic person but i will say that a lot of this that thing is tied into the business model that we built around medicine the notion that ism where paying individual people for individual services and individual procedures that are done i while that has some merit in some cases what we really care about is that the persons getting efficient integrated mufti disciplinary care over all and when help systems for example come together and say if you are rather than am sort of focussing on the amount of getting reverse ornery procedure cornett take more of a valuable to procure when we say can wee got turn amount of money to care for certain people what is a most efficient way for us to provide them care i recognizing if we do not do that it is not only bad for them but our cost in the long term well go up because we are not getting reverse for every process r were getting re inverted for the the care over all care that we are taking for a nation they are more of these value based models that are our being adopted i certainly in two thousand intend when the affordable react was passed and when other measures were taken in the atom administration tin met care that really pushed value base payment models forward ism and again they are not perfect they have got they they need there own weeks but i do not think that the existing financial structure that we had in medicine was serving us interns of delivering the kind of mufti disciplinary integrated efficient care that we increasingly need tough problem but through recognition of tough problems comes good solutions that is my belief i monoptimius at the end of the day you mention mental health ad lately you've been increasingly vocal about the crisis of isolation just ones i drew before we go there sone they o that the tough proms are you are exactly right and the problem is a longer we take to acknowledge and address these tough problems the more intrenched the interests become that profit from the sadist quail right if you look at ism the private insurance industry right now there are many challenges we have right now with patient inclinations saying that they know what care is needed but it gets denied they know what care s needed but prior authorizations get thrown up there and required i even for a medicine that clearly your patient needs urgently have had the experience myself of having a family member whose needed a medication for an urgent situation and then being told that the farmers will not fill it because it requires the prior authorization but that cannot be process until the week end is over because no ones in the office to approve the prior authorization and your thinking yourself this is make any sense this is an urgent situation my family member needs his medication have also had the experience as a doctor of fighting for my patience who have been denied care by an insurance company being on the to an saying i am sitting here in front of my nation i know that they are sick i know they cannot go home i know they need to be in read there is nobody literally to help them at home but then not having ta the rehab tat approved by somebody who is not even there right and there is also just a a practice that we have seen time and time again where insurance companies will also just burden citations with more and more request for information before they will agree to reverse for services that have already been delivered for patient who needs them which is just crating more and more barriers hoping that f you are small time dock out there who is got you shingle that you put up you o of a lot or resources ow are you to keep fighting all this and sending more more people workinseventuallyou will just give up ism we have a lot of problems right there in in industry there should be delivering care often is doing good things but too often i think is allowing barriers to be put up on to the care that is needed and this is particularly true with mental health and over an a talk about that but mental health care is just been such a difficult thing for people to get in our country and part of the reason the many reasons for one of them is that insurance companies historically did not reimburse adequately out were in the same level for mental health cares it did for physical health care or if they did they would only reimburse for a limited number of sessions that you could have i but how if you you're a mam out there who sees her child's struggling wit depression you are really worried ism you do not want to be told what i you can only get there sessions that is it what a you as to do after three sessions right and what has happened is it even thought two thousand in eight there was a law past called the a diction i equity and mental healparity law oven though that was passed to try to close that gap there were many ways that in turn's companies were skirting it i one of the law was not even being equally reinforced for many are but too intense company sometimes with salsa you do not we reimbursing adequately but when you look in the network they had very few providers you really could not access somebody rites that was a problem for patience and then the other challenge is that they would say o came you can see somebody but you have got a complete this prior authorization have the completed by your primary ocarrydoctor et camera went throwing have more and more barriers very recently in back just a few weeks ago present by just announce that we are from as administration putting out a proposed rule to actually strengthen a the metal health parity law to prevent some of these what i think of is abusive practices because they are preventing people who need care from getting it and if you have ever been as they know many people have been who are listening to this if you have ever been in a situation where you or somebody you love has struggled with e mental health concern we you need in that circumstance is help you do not need to be filling out paper work you do not need to be waiting three months actually get care you need to show up and be told only only if two more appointments you need to know that help is there when you need it and a lot of these denials are are being issued to people who have done there they are part of the bargain they paid their premiums they have held up their end of the bargain and care should be there for them when they need it any this something that upsets me lot because i just i have seen too many patients over the years struggle without the care that they deserve and should get because the bears are beengthrown up ah by industry but i say all that just to say that we you take on big problems you will run up against entrenched interests and that is a fight we have to take on we cannot shy away from it we cannot say in uts is politically too difficult one of things on very proud of as it were finally negotiating on drug prices through the medicare program something they should have been done decades ago but it is finally happening now a me knot administration justice of this is got to happen it was pass by congress is is good a and we just t makes no sense that we would pay more than we need to and past the cost on to taxpayers i when we can negotiate and we got a get look you got o if you are collecting taxes as government you should be doing your be to make sure every one of those dollars is being spent well i a somebody took money ad end their paycheck i did not use it for their family did not use it for their kids and they gave it to the government for good reason because that supports first responder as police officers old bunch of services that we need but the response mean government is to make i that money's been used well and to pay more for medications and we should makes no sense at all especially for impatience and tax pars clearly some steps in the right direction are occurring while on the topic of mental health let us talk about ice the isolation crisis what is the isolation crisis what aspects of mental and physical health is it impacting and then ism perhaps most importantly what can we each an all do about it well this is one of those issues that i if you had told me drew ten years ago have you and in me sitting here talking about loneliness an isolation i wound to said i do not think but i was really educated by people i men across the country about the fact that this is a real problem and the truth is it was familiar to me because of my own personal experiences was a child i struggled a lot with sense of loneliness and isolation as really shy as a kid i was pretty interested and i wanted a to make friends and an gout with other kids but it took me a while actually build one relationship i i spent a lot of time feeling left out there were times when i i i i would men an elementary schools and never days where i pretended i had a stomachic ad my mam would not a make me go to school and it was not was have scare of attest or teacher sending one i walk into the cafeteria one more time i be scared that there was nobody to sit next to for that know one would want me to i to be at their bench i as i know what it feels an i also know what the shame as as i never told my parents about this i never told any one about that because even though i knew my parents loved me i just fell ha if ism feeling this lonely it means that something is wrong with me ism not likable ism not lovable ism home's got to be it is got me my fault in some way it was only years later drew when i talked to friends from great school that i realize that a lot om were feeling the same thing we were all struggling by ourselves i no one really knew it and i came to see a lot of this is a doctor when i seeker care patience an i never took a class on loneliness an medical school was on part of our residency curriculum yet when i showed up in the hospital i found that the patient who had come in with diabetic wound infection or who ad come in me because they had had a heart attack when i sat down and talked to them often in the background they would talk about how lonely they were sometimes i would ask som hey i ye were i need to have a difficult conversation about your diagnosis's or somebody you would want me to call i to be with you during this time and too often the answer was ye i wish there was but there is nobody it'll just have the conversation by myself but it was when i was sere a gentle i realized that those experiences were not limited to me in my patience they were incredibly common and two things i learned when i dug into the data drew was number one that loneliness is exceedingly common with one and two adults and america reporting measurable levels of loneliness but the numbers are actually even higher among young adults and adolescence the numbers and among youth actually depending on the surveys you look at are between seventy to eighty present i who say that they were struggling i with loneliness that is the first thing that i learned but the second thing was how consequential loneliness was i used to think loneliness was just a bad feeling what i came to see and digging into the scientific literature was that feeling socially disconnected be lonely and isolated was actually associated with increased risk of depression anxiety suicide but also in increase risk of cart faster disease of dementia and these are not small risks we talking about twenty nine per cent increase in the risk of ordinary hart disease thirty one per cent risk in the increase risk of stroke fifty per cent increase risk of dementia among older people increase risk of premature death and the mortality in pact of of loneliness by the way and loneliness an isolation i is comparable i to the mortality impact of many other illnesses in fact it is even greater than the mortality impact we see associated with obesity which is something we clearly recognize as a public health issue you put all this together and for me one of the key take always is that loneliness and isolation our critical public health challenges that our hiding behind the curtain behind this wall of stigma and shame and unless we talk about it and address it unless we reconcile what is been happening to us over the last fifty years where fewer and fewer people are participating in commute organizations ore and more more people are feeling isolated than we are not going to be able to repair the fraying foundations of society which are grounded fundamentally in our connection to one another you mention community organizations not could you elaborate on those a you growing up in the seventies and eighties i was exposed to community socarteims swim team those a community pool these royal public a things a there were a churches synagogue and monks are we not seeing as much participation in those those types of organizations any more and what other types of organizations are or out there that am you will come to mind when we think about the isolation crises yes o that there are several factors that have led to us being as isolated as we are one of them as you mention is he decline in participation in committee organizations this is not a recent phenomenon this has been happening over the last half century in america we have seen for participation and faith organizations and recreational leagues in service organizations and other commute groups it used to bring us together and i think you at we can talk aby the reasons why that has been the case but one of the see consequences of that is the people do not have places where they can come together and get to know one another especially a cross differences we actually associate more and more with people who a us but this is also been fuel by a few other factors ithettere going on at the same time one is that just from a cultural perspective as maternity has arrived not just a you ask but another other countries we have seen the people are more mobile right they move around more be do notalways stay in the community that we grew up in we tend to even if we move somewhere else for school we may go somewhere else for a job we may change sops and move somewhere else we are leaving behind communities that we grew up with that we went to school with that we worked with and ism not say that is all a bad thing right we are have more opportunities and that is a really good thing but i think one thing that we have not accounted for is the cost of these changes rights if we know what the costs are of certain actions we may still take those actions but we may find ways o mitigate that the costs we may in this case invest more in our relationshoulds we more conscious four reaching out to other people going to visit them but that has been a a quiet but bedevistating consequence the other pieces with maternity is that we have more convenience in our life which means that we also do not need to see other people to get certain things done bin groceries or mailing and dam out or getting something from this store i can sit in the comfort of my home and have everything just come to me now on the one hand that is incredibly efficient right but i think efficiency is an interesting thing because it is only one factor we should be considering in our lives they are too we have to ask the costs and one is just they met covet as many people in the first year of coven we are all separated from one another when we finally came back get thing and i had many people who said to meunoit i expected to miss my parents and my siblings and my friends not being able to see them what i did not expect was missing the strangers that i saw t the coffee shop were the folks ho i ran into the grocery store or seeing neighbors as i walk down the street lie i actually miss that more than i thought i gouge we have lost out on some of those interactions in those loose ties but the final thing to keep in mind also is about what is happening with how we are using social media technology which i think is fundamentally transformed how we interact with one another and how we see ourselves and each other and this is particularly true for young people who are growing up as digital natives but what has happened there i worry is that and it has thought that social meters all bat just to be clear in a technology look i ism a believer that in technology broadly speaking i use her of technology misspent seven years building a the company ism a believer in tact but i think whether technology helps or hurts us is about how it is designed and slimy about how it ends o being used and but we have seen with social met as well is that for many people it ended up leading to in person connections being replaced with on mine connections i we came to somehow value and i almost seek out more and more followers and friends on social media feeling i somehow that made us more connected but the nature of dialogue also changed as human beings we have called over thousands of years the not just understand the word someone is saying but to hear the tone of their voice to see their facial expression you and i are sitting across and and we are both processing our body language right and ism seeing you know your head and ism seeing your eyes focus all of that matters to how we communicate i but also you and i are less likely to say something hurtful right now to one another because we can see each other if i said something or hurtful to you i probably see the pain or to consternation on your face and that might give me pass right when you are communicating on line with other people without any of that information or with any of the a sort of barriers if you will that make you pause before you hurt someone it least a very different kind of communication one that can be quite hurtful at times and i also think that when the people many people do not recognizes that to communicate with somebody nelson reach out and build a relationship with some one it actually takes a certain amount of self esteem to do that you have to believe the other persons going a want to hang out with you they weird to see something valuable in you and for many young people what has happened and i think frankly from any older people too is your experience on social media has shredded their self esteem as there constantly comparing themselves to other people you man you and were growing up a in the eighties we we compared ourselves with the people to right people have for millennia but what is fundamentally different now is it in a given day you can compare yourself to thousands of images that you see on line that is equally vitally what people young people tell me i do round tables with solitudes and shool soon all the time around the country that three things they tell me most consistently about their experience of social mediasand makes them feel worse about themselves worse about their friendships but they cannot get off it because the platforms are designed to maximize but a time they spend on them you put all of this together and i think what has happened is that we are talking more but we understand each other less we have a lot of information but we are lacking in the wisdom that comes from human relationships i and i think that that is really hurt us we see it certainly in the data that tells us about mental and physical health outcomes but there is also the human suffering component drew i it is really hard breaking for me to traveller on the country to hear from people of all ages often in quiet whispers about their struggles with isolation about how they feel the just no matter at all about how they feel lie they just do not have a place where they belong and it is these are people on the outside look perfectly fine they are posting happy things on line to the folks at work they're seeming everything's going great this way always tell people you loneliness is a great masquerader it can look with drawl and sadness they can look anger and irritability it can look a aloofness as well and it is only when we stop to ask someone how they are doing when we tank pause for a moment may be reflection what is happening i their life the we realize it where the majority of people in our country are actually struggling with loneliness i firm believer that our nervous system involved under conditions of close interpersonal and direct connection and to suddenly throw a technology in front of ourselves that deprives our nervous system of its normal development is it is clearly in ta my bad places it is also clear to me as base on what you just describe that you know when we go on social media we see something but they do not really see us hens perhaps wide people get am aggressive in the comment section that they will not to be hurt yum we will not to be seen i think all of us want to be seen and see other people ye and a social media does not allow for it easily i also now the lot of young people will congregate with their friends to plavidio games on line but that is different you are your mentally showing up as an avatar and when your when we werekids we also played different characters in arsed and our games but oh different now do you think that there will be a youth rebellion movement against these kinds of technologies have mind there is a long history of of young people rebelling against the the stuff that is been put in front of them and no no more we are going to rebel in fact that was the way that youth overcame the the nicotine a epidemic if you recall it was the advertising pitching them against are pitting accuse me against am wealthy cackling older men in char in rooms counting their money that was whet haw shy was successful and getting kids and not smoke because kids have a rebellious street i supposed when they were told haste smoking terrible for you your lungs are going to fill with cancer piston stop smoking tension stop smoking he was you no rebellion has been baked into our nervous system a in the adolescent intern years do you see a rebellion against this i social isolation or kidskin that start putting away their phones and hanging out together again and that is get a rescue us and that is a way of saying what can we do for them what can they do for themselves and what can we do as adults cause they're a lot of a the silent suffering is the thing i also really worry about it is a good question and i think there is already a movement that is building among young people to great distance between them themselves and they are devices and pretticuarly social media and it it is it is cropping up in different ways ism meeting more and more some of these are organize efforts but ism also meeting more families where the parents it gets together have decided that they are in to delay using social media and till pass middle schoolboy in some cases even later or were there deciding the they gang to draw boundaries around social media use we they g in a replace they smart phone with a diaphone tat allows them to do things tax and make fond halls and use maps and and in all that help it does not necessarily social medals on it that this is still a small minority and and where is you dealing with the bit of a network effect your right because if you are the only one who is not on social media in your middle school class and you might feel left out which is white comport for parents to and and kits actually do this together but i do think that to use your analogy with smoking that one thing that a think many young people bristle against is this notion of being manipulated and used for the a profit e of a social media platform and the reality is that the again we have talked about how the fundamental business model is for most social media platforms is built on how much time you spend on those platforms that translates the ad revenue and that translates to the bottom line where is what i care about as a pain as certain general is about how well that time is being spent is it actually contributing to the health and well being of a young person or or in not is actually harming them and this is where i think when i go out and talk to young people about this mum for one ism impressed by lot young people is they they are to have a lot these insides they breathe ones living it right they are not thinking that this is all perfect and and it is all a pure benefit here they are the ones telling me that it makes them feel worse about themselves and in their friendships but they re also have no hard time getting off it because again of how these platforms air designs about a third of adolescence a saying that their staying up till midnight or later on weak nights using their devices and lot that a social media use and this takes away from sleep which we know and you now better than any one is critical to the mental health and well being of all of us but of young people in particular whore a critical face know development the other thing that is very concerning to me is nearly half of adolescence say that using social media has made them feel worse about their body image as air constantly comparing themselves others on line and we used to think of this is just girls for experience in this and yes it is a lot of young girls whore experience in these body mageissues been outs increasingly a boys as well this is happening across the board but the other piece thing that concerns me thinking about metal heart symptoms is it you look at how much time hits are using social median average adolescence are using it for thread a half hours a day on average there social media your social media and that means many are using it for far more than that and what you are finding though is that for adolescence who use it three hours or more in a given day their risk of anxiety or deep session symptoms double i and if they average uses three in a half days that means the millions of kids all across our country the majority we kids are are risk here and you put all this together and and it paints a very concerning picture whatever benefits there may be for some kids of using social medium there's some and we lay out some o this in our advisory on social media some kids find such my as a great weight express themselves to reach other people to find support especially f there from a community that does not have a lot of folksier them around my can be really reassuring to connect with others but we cannot say the just in the to get those benefits we have to subject our children to all of these other harms it that kids are experiencing exposure to harmful content to harassment an bulling on line six out a ten adores and girls are seeing they have been approached by strangers on social media and ways tat made them feel very uncomfortable am our kids it are also finding that health promoting activities in their lives are being cannibalized by their use of social media that it is detracting from time for sleep in person interaction physical activity and the erosion of self esteem really concerns me as well because you you need that not just for social interaction but lie look as a as a father i want my children to grow up being confident about who they are being calminfinete enough to be authentic as they show up in the world do not feel they need to creates some brand that is different from who they fundamentally are just to sell that to the world i want them to know who they are and to be comfortable being who they are and to encourage other people to do the same to support them in their efforts to be authentic that is an a at my kits to do that is not what is happening to a lot of kids on social media i think we not only need more kids to understand this and to support them in their efforts to create space and sacred spaces away from social media but we need to support parents here to colander might be concern with parents is we have taken this technology which is rapidly evolving which weeding grow up with as kids and we have told parents you manage it all on your own we put the entire burden on parents and kids to manage this an when we were growing up remember that motor vesical fatalities are really high i in america and we did not say o k you know that is just the price of modern life which set excepted and keep moving on with our lives we set hold on wouldn't have to go back to horses and buggies but we also do not need to accept this sethwhat we need to make this experience safer and we put in place with the advocacy and support of incredible groups mad and others across the country it'd me mothers against strung driving ultimately the government put in place safety standards that got us seat belts air bags crash testing to make sure the frame of cars were robust in the setting of an accident and that helped us reduce moterviical accidents and debts and that is what we need here too we need to have the backs of parents and kids and that means from a policy perspective putting in place safety standards o protect kids from exposure to harmful content from from the experience of bulling and harassment an that also protect them from features that would seek to manipulate them into excessive use which is happening far too often right now we also need to policy that requires data transparency from the companies researchers tell us all the time that they is their independent researchers they tell us they ore having a hard time getting full access to the data from the social media platforms about the full impact of the platforms on the metahalto kids as a parent look i i do not when we bought car seats for my children when when they were born we looked up the safety data many parents we wanted to make sure the carpets were safe but if you had told me that hey the manufactures of these carpets rashly not disclosing some of the data on the impact on children but go had not bide anyway ism sure other people a bin these cares you should be fine i would have been very disturbed by that i no parent wants o feel that information being hidden from them about t they health an packed up products on their kids that is what we have right now this is a place where i think while yes and what will wish well talk about some sees parents can take i as want to get to practical sees of people who are here is parents for people of kids in their lives can take but we we we need policy makers a step up and step into the avoid here and to fill the gap because this is too much again to just ask parents to manage entirely on their own and this is not again about telling parents what to do and restricting them this is about giving them to support they need they have confident i when they see and i tacknolegy out their device out their product out there for kids that they know it is been tested that it is been study and that it is actually safe for their children my understanding is that in a countries china there are limits as to how many hours kids can be on screens period and when i was a kid we were allowed to watch t v for a certain number of i thing twas a half an hour know me on was constantly kicking about of the house lithely you got to leave the house you got to go down the street and play ye unfortunately i liked out door activities am nowadays we also have the issue that a lot of parents are on their phones that soccer games and it kids events and the kids are modelling their parents ye an parents are distracted as well there is lack of social connection people even an immediate family people are screened in a xenon ten there is laptops there is multilephones eye pads people are you more engaged in the screen portals than often then their own portals that you go to a concert and people are watching the concert through their screen that they can send the same image that every one around them is sending out to the world if you think that is kind of crazy a but i guess they want to capture that unique experience ye but a it is not unique at all that is the that is the myth that is the illusion there is nothing unique about the your post of something that you went to go see what would be truly unique at a just experience that and real non i its wild to think about what we think of as u our unique portal is actually not unique at all it is what we do with it learn what might my stances glean and learn information on line than go use it in real life come back from time to time may be n our a day maximum ore can i just underscore the two words you said real life cause that is thing is a really important key here which is that all if real life is not happening on social media there is a whole world out there which i think is real life which is happening off line and what is happening on line too often is distorted right it is giving us even just take on young just take the images that that we see of people there a the another summer beach images there great vacation images that is non representative of their entire life how their living their life that we see that we see people's anger we and their victory all and we come to believe over time that that is how people feel that is what people are dealing with an experiencing their life and and we have just got to get you know your mama i love what you are of did of getting your guides outside i my parents did the same thing too we was very bless to have two parents who did not to they do not have a lot of resources working optayin' o to this country with a lot of resources but the one of the greatest gifts they give gave us is that they loved us unconditionally the other great gift that they gave us is they pushed us to just explore to meet people to learn about the world they wanted us outside playing experimenting just rediscovering the world writing our bike round the neighborhood and and that is what we did but right now two critical things that kids need for their metal help and development are two important forces i should say that are impacting their metal help and development one is social medium but the second also is the lack of on structured platoon that kids had unstructured playtime is time when we is kids learn how to negotiate situations with other kids had a resolve conflict had a recognize what is going on in some one else is i know eyes before they say something we learn how to collaborate and play an with other kits is a lot you learn on the playground it as it turns out but i worry that right now that we have almost somehow made that kind of structure time seem inefficient we have set these standards a for our kids that they need to be getting fancy jobs and into fancy colleges and making exam out of money an to pat to doing that is to be enrolled in ex number of activities after school and to do all to sustain school and their lives are viper structured i that i worry that the time to just play to be created to reflect and think to just have on structure time with other kids has evaporated and i think to that also is hurting them at a hop and well being of our children i love the idea that that unstructured play time could be framed in the accurate content of the nervous system developing the way it was supposed to develop in i would argue that success is going to be easiest for children that engage in the real world more i fact there is great risk to posting everything that you do on line we have seen some examples of that preventing people from s getting into our staying in college based on things they said or did previously that they should not have said or done that is what door kind of negative high lighted cases but in general we know that that the nervous system thrives on diversity we types of interactions and social interactions and particular ism just restating what you just said if ever there was a call for kids to get out into onscreen life let us hell it an engage their nervous system that way it without question is going to benefit them in terms of their ability to learn and retain information perform well in school which is not everything life about but let us face it we still live in a society where hitting those milestones on a consistent basis or the best is the best predictor of people being able to you non live self sustain lives built families and that sort of thing you mention a few actionable items for parents as it relates to kids maybe well not maybe limits their screen time force them outside in the safe weather and safe conditions of course but what about adults as well a d what what can we all do should we be restricting our screen time t ex number of hours per day you are the surgeon general if you had a magic wand which i realize you do not am and you could make a a a highly informed recommendation about what the thresholds for too much a time on social media a but were to be to hours three hours yes it is a good question and let me as show go through some of these things of parents can can do for kids in that we can all do for ourselves with kids in particular what i would do specially with social media is and this is is is frankly what i am planning to do with my wife for our kits as they grow up number one i would seek to delay that use of social media past middle school at atman mum and i know that that is hard to do at a time when all kids are on social media and you soft want your child to be the only when left out and to be lonely is a result that means no account of their own means no account of their own and i would make see to the best of your ability see if their other parents that you can partner with to do this because it is hard to do alone as a parent but it is also if there are other parents your partnering with that means your other kids who are also delaying you so means your child is not alone and i think if you start the conversation with other parents who will realize a lot of them are worried about the same things you are they may have thought about delaying you but they also do not want their kid to be the only ones this becomes a numerous challenge but partnership can help us if your child already on social media what id recommend is to create sacred spaces and their lives that or technology free and specifically i would think about the hour before bedtime and throughout the night as time that you want to protect this kids are losing not just sleep because they are going to sleep later cause they're on their devices be they also waking up in the mill of the night maybe yo use a bathroom maybe to get some water and then they get back on their devices again the quality of their sleep is being significantly impacted by access to those devices her in the night i would protect that time hour before bed throughout the night i would also create make sure meal times were neck free'sown that people actually that you talk to one another you see one another and time with friends an family members when you are out at a birthday party et camera can that test freebie let them focus on their time with other people those three tack free'sowns can do a world of good i to help your child and in the last thing it'd recommend here of the many things think parents could do its to start a dialogue with your child about they're use of social media we do not always know how social me is making our kits feel i from the and and we may realize when we talk to them that they shall haveteir own concerns they might say at not making me feel really good but it is just hard not to be on it of when is testing on this er everyone is a everyone's you nor sharing information and posting pictures on i feel i need to be on it you can only help them start to manage that if that that is a challenge at their having open a conversations your child knows that your not judging them but you are turn to understand their experience is important also you can help them understand what is not acceptable for them to experience on social media they are being harasser bill lead by strangers i that is a problem you want your child it is o to tell you about that to report that ism if they see something posted on line that is really concerning to them let us say they see a friend post that they are thinking of taking their own life for harming himself in another way you want them to note that that is important to flag and to get help thatched should not just squirrel past that that conversation is really importantand finally his parents we can lead by example right and this is hard cause the truth is we have been talking about social meting youth and that is the subject of my surgeon generals advisory was on but have concerns an adults too i say it o somebody who had challenges in my own use of social media finding sometimes that bleed sill yo know past my bedtime and ism realized i thing i man y check something for five minutes an hour later ism still there scrolling through something and sometimes i i find myself i have over the years i found myself comparing myself also i to posts i see on line in unhealthy ways sometimes i find myself am sod have pulled into a content a that ends at being angry and bitriala can leaves me feeling worse at the end have experienced this as well and a these parents one of the hardest things to do is to fall this advice for giving our kids to draw those boundaries as well and to put our devices away when we are round or a kids one experience i had which should have i still feel bout about but which really help kind of knock some sense into me was after my my son was born a my older child i was i silly i was surgeon gentle at that time i had relagenon was busy job et camera but i wanted to make sure that i protected bedtimes and meal times for us to be together as a family yet one day when i came home you know after dinner when we were in the battle an a bedtime routine to get my on ready a for the night my wife was changing his diner and instead of helping i was just sanding at the side scrolling through my into and my wife who has infinite patience and is one of the most well just to people that i know just paused and she turn to me an alive said do you really need to be doing that right know and she said just very quietly but i felt is such a sense of shame when she did the cause was what am i doing this is my infinite child and the rare few hours i have with him during the day and ism just sworn through my into my phone this is terrible and look i know that all of us do this it may be different contacts but i was a awake up moment for me cause i realize tie one as well as a our scientist we cannot really musty task i we are rapidly tasks witching right and not ways time in mi wen i ahead was in my into than my head want with him n my heart was not with him right i was just distracted and as parents if we can honor those sacred times when we are with our children to keep our devices away meal times sleep time as well it is not easy to do but it really sets a good example for our kids i all behavior change that we are talking about here the kind of behavior changed have worked with the patients over the years are in physical activity and diet all this is harder to do when we are doing it by ourself it is a lot easier to do when we are we have a couple of friends or family members we agree to do this with we hold each other accountable we encourage and support each other i it is how have been able to make the most successful behavior changes have made in my life have come about because i have two good buddies a divan sunny who are my my part of my brotherhood and the three of us is brothers talk about health we talk about our finances we talk about our family in our friendships and our failings and we help keep each other accountable and it you just encourage parents is to say a sounds daunting or overwhelming you do not have to do this alone think about one or two people other parents you might want to do this with and i caring you there lot of us a struggle it the samestuff and they would probably welcome an opportunity to do this in collaboration with another parent such spectacular advice that i hope every one will follow not just for their kids but for themselves i think that whether not a social media a fictive in in the true sense of the word is is kind of a meaningless debate at this point now it is at the very least a a compulsive behavior for many of us and as you described it in example you gave it becomes reflective yes we are just n we are not a widely seeking pleasure or looking to to engage in on line battles is just it is become reflective finding yourself with your hand in the refrigerator just even think about it yes doing it becoming more conscious of the use a and thereby more conscious of the value of putting away the screens and social media for extended periods of time each day and certainly in the middle the night folks nerd plasticity brain retiring happens in the middle of the night while you are asleep and i this when you mention kids awaken mel the night lather pone i just i thought you have and o mi ne no as a it wins me and look have look at my phone in they'll the night i try not to but but ism certainly not in the window of maximum plasticity either it is terrible for everybody but especially terrible for kids am what you just provided it is an incredible let us just call it a it'll call it a man they you did not say it but a suggestion of of teeming up with people ism to become more minded around these issues and to really promote health along those lines i i really want o thank you first of all for the conversation to day you are incredibly busy your responsible for can entire country is worth of a people to take time to sit down with me and to discuss these topics for our audiences it incredibly appreciated by me and by them i i feel comfortable extending their gratitude here and it is also clear based on to day's conversation that you face an enormous number of challenges at the level of budgetary challenges by the way of in o work on that is hard to shut me up as well as the the huge array of of issues that you confront and u and it is clear that it is a challenge that you have embraced for many years now hundred difficult conditions and that you are clearly willing to get out and talk to people and here their criticism here their concerns here and learn from them and it is been of great benefit tour to here and learn from y o and i hope this will not be the the last of our conversations there is many more topics to cover but just really one to thank you thanks ever much for the the the intellectual power and the emotional power that you put into what you do cause that is very clear you are a physician first and you care about your patients and your patients are all of us thank you much and that forstrange is incredible kind of you i thank you i appreciate that and i have loved our conversation and you now for me what what i hope most of all for mi is for our country more broadly is that is it we can go deeper beneath the i these surface issues have worried that we find ourselves disagreeing about in fighting about on lying and recognize that there is a deeper challenge that we are facing that i think underlies a lot of these the anger in the vitriol and this issue around how disconnected we become from one another i think he's at the heart of that i do not think that there is any policy or programmed we can implement that is con ultimately fix what a society without fundamentally realizing that a lot of this is a manifestation of a society that has become more disconnected and more disinfested in one another go for time and that is just not who we are it is not how we have called over thousands of years finds not how reganette thrive in the future i know that sometimes when you look at these big intractable problems i widespread loneliness in the united states that it can seem hard to address these but i do want to encourage everyone to to recognize it when it comes to human connection that it is small steps that can make a big difference because we are hard wire to connect is human beings and if you you just pause for a moment and if you just think for a moment in your own life about is some one who has been there for you during a time of great need somebody who has stood up for you and you could not stand up for yourself some one who is help to reminds you why you are silly good person why you still have worth and value to add to the world even when you had lost faith in yourself you think about their faith in you about their support for you about their love for you think that how healing that was that is the power that we have to help each other heel we are going through an identity crisis in many ways as a country were i think we been to ask ourselves who are we what defines who we are what are the set of values that we want to guide us in our life and to guide our country and i know that it feels we are a nation of people who are mean who only care about ourselves we are throwing blame and anger at each other all the time who are pessimistic about the future but i shall do not think that is really who we are i think at our heart we are hopeful and optimistic people i think in our true nature we are kind and generous to one another in our hearts we we we are interdependent creatures who recognized that if someone else is suffering we want to be out there to support them a and who wanted what people to be there to support us as well that is who we really are but we have to to make a clear choice here about our identity as as individuals and as a country and recognized that that choice has real implications for everything elsehat we are talking about here that is the foundation and when i think about my own kids have grown up many parents i worry about the world that their coming into i i worry that therein a use the wrong word even though their intent ions are right and people are gang blame them or cast them out know i worry that they are in a stumble and fall down and the which and keep welcome by not caring because e one's live in their own life i worry that they might become a someone who does the same thing to other people right none of which i want what i want for all of our kids is for them to grow up in a society where we care about one another we have each others backs we recognize as that old african proverb goes that we can go fast if we go alone but if we really one of afar we go together that is what i want for my kids in our country but that is what we each have the power to create in our own lives it starts wit the decisions we make but how we treat one another do we for example each out for five minutes a day to someone that we care about do we pick up the phone and call them to say hay ism thinking about you we can all do that to day do we give people the benefit of our full attention recognizing that while time is scarce our attention has the ability to stretch time they can make five minutes feel half an hour ut it is a hard thing for people to get as they're distracted aby their devices but do we give people the benefit of our full attention and do we look for ways to serve one another recognizing that is through our acts of service that we actually forge powerful connections but we also remind ourselves how much value we have to bring to the world this is important in a time when the self esteem many of us and our young people in particular is being ye wrote it not particularly by their use of social media these are the steps that we can take to build connection in our life but the cop values i believe that have to be at the heart of our identity these values are and kindness in generosity around courage and service these also have to animate the decisions that we make in our life about programs we advocate for the policies we support the leaders we choose they should all be reflections of the values that we want a see in our children and society more broadly cause it'll tell you that ninety per cent a plus of the decisions leaders make they make behind closed doors and what is guiding them in those moments are their values that is true whether you are the leader of a company or not profit organization or leader in government those values matter and i want us is a country to speak more about the values that we choose about the identity that we want to anchor ourselves to that is the way in which i feel america can be an even greater beacon of hope for the world because the world is struggling with this too we are not the only ones who are dealing with loneliness and isolation were seeing anger and resentment aviary all bubble up a hat extraordinary levels who are seeing mistrust and institutions sore many countries are experiencing this i would love america to lead the way in some ways and showing what it is to embrace more human identity that centered or on kindness and service and friendship and generosity to me all of these values ultimately address stem from love y love is our greatest source of power it is our greatest source of healing i see that as the doctors prescribe many medicines over the years but their few things more powerful than love in it is ability to help us through difficult times and help men the wounds seen and unseen a that we all carry with us and i think if we recognize that we recognized said we do not have to have an eddy after our name ore gone to nursing school to be healers we all have the power to help each other heal drew we are not fundamentally a nation of bystanders we just stand by while other people suffer we are nation of of healers and hope makers who can restore hope that the future can be better who can create a better life for ourselves in the people around just right now it is a we are capable of it is what we are built for that seem insanity that i think we now more than ever me to

obviously the information was was being disseminated we heard rumors knew sum of what was going on and then and then we came back on lying last night and a and here is what we came back to over the course of the week end eight hundred to one thousand terrors entered israel for approximately eighty gaps in the fence in the security border that was supposed to be secure there may a lot of questions to be asked about the intelligence failures fore about the technical failures here and then proceeded to attack twenty communities and eleven is really defense for stasis id ye basis at least eight hundred people are dad several thousand have been wounded for for those who proclaiming that this is because of israel treatment of gone us recognized israel hand presents in the goestrip israel abandoned the gozestrip into thousand five under the called disengagement plan common a terra group established in nineteen eighty seven nineteen eighty eight with the express purpose of destroying the state of israel and killing news glibly common was elected to lead the gone strip into thousand six the eve reeled continuously since two thousand seven they have initiated multiple conflicts over the corse of that time in two thousand sixty thousand eight thousand even two thousandeighteen the initiated large wars in two thousand eight two thousand twelve to thousand fourteen and two thousand twenty one and the general is rally security prospective was keep them head in keep that wall make sure they don't been breach that border every often their be breath of rocket fire use iron dome to shoot down those rockets and essentially relegate your own population to living in bunkers under ground for several weeks every year welcomes fires rockets at them but long as the casual ties are minimized just continued to live an men the weekend the the time line of the weekend was essentially that about six thirty a m local time the commas terrorists began firing a barge of rocket fire from goa into israel landing several cities ranging from tell eve which is basically located in the center coasts of israel down to rocovote and camera and ashkalon those are areas that are there slightly closer goshkalon is petty close to the gozestrip i for thosewho do not know the geography of the state of israel state of israel ks a cental wedge the gone strip is a is at the corner of that wedge if he as matching israelsro elongated diamond its at the lower left hand side of that elongated diamond its fairly small area those about two million palistinians palstonian arbs and do the gozestrips i stay has bender the complete an utter control of comas since two thousand seven israel has no presents in the gozestrip it does not control what goes on inside the gozestrip it does not allow weapons to flow inside the gozestrip it t has been providing free electricity and water to the gozestrp for literally decades they started firing at about six thirty five a m of the sirens all went off the m people rushed underground and the turns out the dissolved distraction technic is a highly sophisticated operation plans and greenlet apparently by the baronial government the cranial government on a jet political level is terrified that israel about to make piece with south arabia hen that pieces gan break out across the region providing original counterbalance to the worst terror state in modern history the baronial terrorstate which is spread it is tentacles of evil across a roc across syria across lebanon into demon into the gone strip at about them seven forty a m the common terrace began blowing up pirates of the border fence this bordfence was supposed to be technologically sophisticated with called touch fence which means that a if there were ladders that were stacked on the fence then they would go off and then every would be alerted b apparently there as a simultaneous a tack a fiber attack on the border fence which meant that it was not functioning properly apparently about eighty places in the wall were breached they rushed through they proceeded to a blow up and and murder a bunch of news in these idea bases and then they proceeded in to frailly border towns and they went house to house murdering people in their homes kidnapping children raping an kidnapping women murdering them house to house understand this the worst disaster for the news since the bellicose it is worth thin the nineteen seventy three one could for war that was military operation designed out eviscerating israel but at least it was a territorial military attempting to take on another territorial military these are terra we have no actual military a agenda they are only a agenda is to murder as many yes as possible because antizinism is antisemitism because the destruction of the take of israel is coincident wit the murder of as many news as possible with more just blood spilled with the murder of infants the people were shooting women they are shooting babies this is what they thesis what they do they proceeded to terror ice is an aria near the got a border which has been none it with thousands of rockets over the years they shot at a civilian car they when open fire on a variety of vehicles shooting as many people as humanly possible that was the basic time line for hours on end they were going through these cities these twenty cities and murdering people we had people in our community an our mediate community who had brothers and sisters in some of these communities the wore tempting to hide the'rebeing dragged outoftheir houses in shot if they were hiding they were being their house were being burned they are being forced out and then shot and again peoplewere being kidnapped now ism going to make you look at things this is your morning ism a a make you look at things that you do not want look at because this is what evil looks tit was a blot on the moral imagination of the united states that after nine eleven we did not put on loop tho footage you nine eleven because people need to understand what evil looks because we do not we are lucky we do not encounter evil on a daily basis all of the people who we think are truly evil in america politics or at least the vast majority them are not truly evil in people we disagree with many o the people the disagree with on politics there evilagenas but there not evil what evil looks is what we saw over the weekend and ti's to show you stuff that is that is going to be impossible to wash out of your brain and i want you to look at it and and i want you to look at it because you do not understand what has to be done about evil that it must be absolutely eviscerated and eradicated unless you look it in the face this is not a matter of territorial dispute this not a matter have a negotiated compromise there not a matter of failure of a peace plan this they group of people who want to murder as many news as humanly possible the have the evisceration of very the murder of innocence on their mind it is what they want it is all they care about remember there is no military enroll here the only enroll was the murder of as many news as possible that is all this began by comose brigade members invading a military post here's some video of commons break are members invading a military post as is put out by comes itself the vest majority of this video was not put out by these rallies is put by cross bragging about there they are evil in their human's rights violation here is the beginning of the military operation that they that they performed these were there actual breaking through the wall and you are going to see them invading a military post and shooting as many people as possible obviously rain heating memory to v which is i be shouting obviously as they a break through the security barriers a very tall cement barrier breaking through they blew it out and now they cut through in iron fence when they rush entrails military basin is a short staff base because it was a jewfish holiday this tack not remember for muslin for radical muslin it is obviously a violation of religion for a for any one to do anything during romidon but any jewfish holiday is an excuse for terror is to murder as many as possible walked into a military basin start o murdering as many human beings as possible this is a just more video of them doing just that and then they proceeded in too scaly towns because again this was not about there is thing these are there jeeps these are their hummer jeans ah they then proceed into militia they then proceeded is vision towns again there is simultaneous attacks on multiple civilian towns as well as a massive dance festival we will get to the mass of dance festival in a second because that was the chief place of doubt it was again that is not a right left issue that is not a political issue in israel or anywhere else these were largely secular news at a rave an medium rave but hey call the piece rave somewhat near the gosh border get to that momentarily but e here is what again ism to make you look in images that you not want to look at and because this is what this is what the world's really is when you get when you rip off the veneer of civilization when judo christian morality disappears when when morality disappears generally speaking what you end ut with is is words that that there are no words for this sort of evil they're no words for it the you cannot describes not animalist because animals wen not treat each other this way tit is not animal it is a edits o monstrous because there are no monsters they are only human beings there there only some of the most demonic evil pieces of human excrement ever to walk the planet that is what that is e commons is here is a video of an entire family murdered you can see these are women on the floor hen men on the floor this is commons putting out this video again this is not the israilies comose is putting out this video is an entire family in their home ism in gun down and murdered and there jot shooting people horary dad on the floor geum there is video of a father who is attempting to help his family escape from the top story of of his home in one of these villages a e can see in the corner of the video for those account watch he is he helping his family escaping and see the are women and children or are escaping the top window here trying to get out derris are in their home imagine for second terrace or in your home your trying to help your family escape other tempting to get out and ta the last person nowt is going to be the father here but he is not going to get out he is going o be murdered he is n be shot n he's going to be killed in the video than people were sending tax throughout this throughout this day to friends and family members telling them that they were about to be murdered and then this who be the last today can see this sum this father has been shot and he dies in the window here the m come ass wit avidin o entire families be murdered on the roads the straight literally strapped cars filled with women children entire families i these are these arvidios that a we are taken in the aftermath the is a yuan see the people strewn on the ground entire families see here a just many vans filled with with the dad the they i ta it did not matter just a as a in the bible describes it describes om ta lake as a as praying on the week and the elderly that a this is this is what they do is a picture of a grandmother who as a murdered she she was murdered bycamoss terrorists the young woman in the picture found out that her grandmother had been murdered when she saw avidin the comas posting on her grandmother's face book page of her being murdered is a picture of a couple e tie an cadaster cheeky not thirty they had ten month old twins ten month old twins there a their village which is called far goa which is see boots in southern israel robots a sort of a common in southern israel a they they shielded their babies with the with their lives the babies were we are next to their dead parents for twelve to fourteen hours before they were before they were rescued a but the comaston stop there of course they they proceeded to mutilate as many bodies as they could find this is a again all this videos disturbing he's a this is this by the ways a tie worker who was a who is mutilate murdered an mutilated nine america citizens by the weird at the very least ti citizens are dad german citizens are dad why privy this the worst tears attack on the planet since at least ye thousand one ism you see they're going around and and mutilating the bodies of the dad they he this this gyms not that he is just going in there still mutilating him are kicking him and beating him about the head and now they are taking a a shovel a spade and be heading him this is this is what these people do this is what the sons in then teas at its i i do not want to show you this i do not wan to show you this but it needs to be seen it needs to be seen it needs to be seen these people this is that peace partners moral equivalent cycle of violence or maybe not hit is not the only mutilation of body idea dead soldiers had their bodies mutilated kicked in the face beheaded this is a morvidia from commons side them reading the bodies t of the dead taking their ammunition then finding the dead bodies the corpses of soldiers they have killed and do and kicking them in the face and mutilating them stabbing them and then posting this vision line going body to body to mutilate the dead there can there can be no negotiation with this there can be no the can be no talking with this i can youknow dueling with these gees wretched pieces of felt there can be none of that there can be none of that and anybody who claims once again any sort of level moral i evil see the r people who did visit by the way that is only the beginning it gets worse it gets worth what you've seeing here murdered families women on the ground they getstowors they took they took hostages but before we get to even the hostages here is what happened at these railing music festivals there is a massive music festival there is an eye witness account of that festival that is been printed over a tablet magazine this is according to let lebaletts writing says have spent he last twelve hours speaking to his rallies were at the supernovae music festival there testimonies as you would imagine our very emotional at least one broke down at mid conversation was not able to continue his recollection the attack on the festival outside of train began round seven am the party was it it is piqued by than which went that by then most people were inebriated at first party goers heard about explosion which they took to be another spastic rock attack on southern israel the explosions grew louder an constant kept going for about five minutes the music stopped the police protecting the five or four or five thousand ravers began pushing every one to leave by then terrors were approaching in pick up rocks bearing commons military markings shooting began many were executed on the spot two hundred sixty bodies were found far on the side the ravens now probably in access of three hundred many of theyoung men and women started running in the flat expanse of the western naval desert the terrace began rounding up the victims some were bound and kidnapped i saw videos of the mail getting held by a group of arab kids their sixteen seventeen's of irises their kids there young men already their holding the say he looks as is girl friend as been mound town bike can driven away from him womenhave been raped at the area of the rave next to their friend's bodies dead bodies several of the rate victims of pure to haven later executed others were taken two gaze will get to those videos momentarily here is what it looked at the actual festival as you can see at the festival people were partying and tat in the back r on you can see in the distance come ass paraglider who flew in armed to murder as many dancers as humanly possible and see in the background there they were arriving huge majority the people in the video are probably dead now people were fleeing the music festal amass these sure people running across s empty fields trying desperately to get away from the people would murder them for the great crime of dancing and being news i anta here is am and here is som video of the aftermath of the music festival an can see what it looks after a massacre this this sis mum again horrifying stuff going through the i lo young people the enjoying themselves a nothing enjoying the music was the sun was coming up and then a the missile strikes they they interecips they am them going off an old at confusion and out of that confusion it appears the mama ran that am were just killing in a frenzied way any one that they could that they could reach any one a that they could not sort of pull back an take away get back to gaze look at this idea into dead bodies all over the place an see the burned out cars it sum body backs everywhere in that a in that earlier photo that we nan was showing cars on the side the road because people were tempting to escape and come o set up a blockade and just began mowing down people as they were attempting to escape again that is not even that is not the worst part compass has now taken in access of a hundred and fifty hostages when they went into towns they they stole babies they stole literal babies they stole women this is compass taking a woman hostage and shoving her into the back of vehicle and driving her back into data where giant crowds of people cheering animals this women has obvious my the grate mortal times she is bleeding through her pants an force into the car in viciously raped you imagine sodomized from the amount of damages and done there this is mum cheering hanging their horns the who car the shouting in the video the stuffing women in the back rats and a if you are wondering what happens to the women they do this to here is mum the a here is well get in second to the work of the other day heres a here more women who have been held hostage entire rooms filled with womenwho hae been held hostage who will be turned into regret victims and sect slaves presumably entire lines of women whore have been kidnapped an commons releasing the video is commons doing this because they are under mistaken impression the his going to break the will of the we us of these rallies they're they are sorely mistaken they are sorely sorely mistaken the the wrath of god that they just brought upon thus this is this is by far and ism sorry to to make you watch this but ism not sorry that done that we but ism not sorry because frankly again we all have to watch this this is what evil looks it is what evil looks it is what evil looks its what evil looks this is a this is the body of woman a woman her name island look we know her we know her name es german citizen she is tat the rave this is a this is avidin of her mutilated body on the back of a truck can see that her lives are bent in in natural positions because she is dad they are cheering a huacbar in a mass of crowd in gaze over her mostly naked body she has been mutilated she is clearly been murdered this is m this is who these these people are amusing word people as loosely as as humanly possible more hostage idiots women more hostage look looking how many women they've taken captive the the got ere is to paralyze the state of israel to stop them from doing what must be done to clearer gaze of compass and destroy it utterly and completely to eviscerate it to kill its leadership i should mention d this point that every ounce of blood an gaze is on comas every ounce of blood an gaze because not only do they seek to murder israel civilians take women and children hostage we haven't gone to the children now it'll get tote children but they hide behind their own cvillainstha be doings for years there is literal video and have played on the shobefor of israel calling up buildings and telling them to get out because civilians are in there and compass saying we want the civilians to be there there is a reason that they put their military headwords under hospitals is they want israel to retaliate and then to kill civilians by hiding behinds villains hiding behind civilians a war crime every ounce of blood that is shed here is on comes every ounce of blood palcinian and is rail is on compass an more hostage videos ante we will get to a and they all get to the children lying o e raise rate tank militant group and here is em here is the if you think what weave done far as unwatchable just what evil has no limits evil has no limits here is a m hostage another hostage video of om a twelve year old the a child being dragged away a gain reales by mamas and an attempt to terrify these rallies dragging is rally children back across the border into goa mean this is holiness tie style this holiness style material i the worst ovidiother day in my opinion this is am hostage video fan is rally child is kid cannot be more than five or six years old he is being taunted by other by by palistinian children their hiding him with sticks and telling him to say ma ma ma means mother means mam in her i taunting him grabbing him by the head he is rather children other children a mocking the child who parents ere undoubtedly dad hitting him with steps and telling him to say ma these these are the are here are notes these are notes es are notes anybody who is called anyone in noisy on line these that is what noesis looks that what noses m looks this is they took his rally grandmothers the hostage one of them was at holiness survivor this radio compass grabbing in his rally grandmother and driving her again terrace for driving in his rally grandmother across the border and thither celebrating his teasing a that noises that ill that is the m that is the celebratory noise him in gaze that is his rally grandmother holiness survivor i the m this one she was actually rescued by m is rally forces

video a this is a from this is a the e a a father saw yet she called his wife and and then he saw his wife on the news and his two children being taken hostage to women holding two red headed children and being and being pulled away by terrorists into the gosestrip of a hundred and fifty people a being takin taken hostage by these pieces of human debris come ass of course with celebratory about all of this because his what evil does they commit acts of evil and they celebrate the the act of evil come ass release of idiot showing their political leadership many of who are in cuter thanking god to celebrate thinking blah bowing down to celebrate the murder of innocence and the rape of women and the catnapping of small children and the torture of all these people here here they were thanking a thinking ala for his beneficence in all of this watching all to zero watch arms an her you can hear them celebrating smiling broadly use of the leaders of of comas every one of whom should be put in in early grave as soon as she only possible on the not evil looks it looks men in business suits and fancy business suits in cater bowing their heads and thanks to god at the rape of women in the murder of children that is what that is what it looks right there that is what looks in the suit does not make you any less of terms this is a come ass thanking iron will get to that a moment because the get political ramifications of this situation are are quite grave the united states as tempting to avoid the by administrations tempting to avoid its own complicity in the fact that is provided hundreds of millions of dollars too various palstinian groups ranging from palcinan authority to humans itself billions of dollars to the are on resume the sponge or this will get into in unjust a little while here as a come of leadership thanking iron for all of this thanking them for their help miss a person who mass or is thanks to all these individuals groups and countries particularly salami re public baron wit supported us generously with money arms and other means providing us with the missiles that have been battering design strongholds during past confrontations with the occupiers have also supported us with antitankmasens which by the grace of god and the faith of our fighters shattered the with of feminist superiority and that really was the goal here obviously the goal here was to shatter the the notion of his really military in visibility by murdering as many civilian as humanly possible whole these people are about to find out the hardly exactly what it means to fall around and find out comma's leader ismalhon is malhanea has now called on other grabs to join and has called on israel to leave the land that you saw him earlier bowing down in thanks to allay for the gift of murdered news here he was suggesting the real purpose the real purpose is not a territorial settlement the real purpose is not control the gossistrip amass ben in control the got strips in two thousand sect here he is calling on am all news to leave the land a talking that for nothing anal meting the label wen is the i say to the sons of our pallicinian people and arabanislamicnation martin to day you are on the verge of a great triumph and a manifest victory will be in namagalaam what happens to day reveals the fragility of this enemy a this enemies suffered defeat to day the same acedia wat political military intelligent securitere a security and moral defeat says this a evil enact human o by in shall we will crown all this with the resounding defeat yagamiaudabyna minuseathe enemy will leave our land our jerusalem our alexias that is that be the temple out and we will liberate our prisoners avert the goal here is not merely to liberate liberates by by liberal we mean have these monsters take over more territory which is as it turns haw by ley giving giving territory to some of the world's most evil people is a horrible idea i know that ta there have been those who have ben convinced in their sophistication that giving territory to the world's most evil people is actually a wonderful idea and that it is the best way to summat world peace as it turns out is the beltway to promote rape of women murder of child run kidnapping of babies now that is what that what it turns out am the m their goals are very clear meanwhile the secondary goal here is to have israel kill as many palstinian civilians is humanly possible in the hopes that this will somehow scuttle israel birdman and piecemeal with the south royal government this is why it came out earlier today that the gaze ministry has been telling people not to pay attention to his really wanting to get out of their building o israel does a process whenever anyone suggests that israel is willfully calling civilians that is most ignorant bigoted antiseptic bull reversed israel goes out of its way more than any army on earth not to killcivilians to the point where they they literally have a type of on that they drop on rules to shake the building and warm people to get out they make announcements on radio to get people out meanwhile comas is literally telling people that tom the id effs ten and voice messages should be ignored why because they want the pictures of dead palistinians compass wants pictures of dead palistinians meanwhile the conflict is a is going more global according to the associate press he same day all this went down or the following can egyptian police person open firer on is rely tourists in alexandrine killing at least thosraelies and one egyptian meanwhile compass supporters all over the world celebrated commassuporters in the called wetback toad be idea and maria they celebrate because this is what you do when babies are murdered and when and when we mere killed by the way israel is now how many mothers hae been murdered israel is now calling on women in israel to donate brestmil because many women have ben murdered and their children are still alive small babies do not actually have proper nutrition theyarecalling on people to donate brestmilk that is hat that tow many women were kill again eight hundred people at least dad at this hour here is comma supporters in the west bank celebrating see the small girl a tap her a some aatopaman's shoulders carrying looks a in m sixteen or busy whisper america m for rather there been suggestions that those america em force where those coming from if those are america em forest there ben suggestions they came wait for it from afdanistand were jordan surrendered to the teleran meanwhile cabala has far not going to in on the party the reason yes below not training on the parties because they v the most to lose commas is a about to find out exactly what it means to wake the sleeping giant that is the israel military cisbela wants no part of that if cesbelaw were start launching rock its across the border israel would not going with ground troops israel going with the the israel air force the most efficient fighting force in the at least and they would simply eviscerate southern lebanon it just would not exist tomorrow because israel cannot afford have a hundred fifty thousand rock its falling on it cities in the middle of something this but of course they did praise the situation has cabala is of course funded by iron which is the which is the terror state behind all of this cusbela's leader hogan and astral another terra you set it sends a message to the arab an is comic world and the international community is a whole especially those seeking normalization with the enemy that the pasting in luaus is an everlasting one alive until victory and libration again that is the engulf here the enrol was to prevent the the possibility of a is rally south pieaceial while israel is pursuing piece with the saltines while the studies were pursuing piece with israel iron was fomenting the worst terror is violence that we have seen on the planet in several decades and the worst violence against news on the planet since the holiest meanwhile celebrations were taking place in is gamic commute is lamest communities all over the world i ironicalashin not in iron there is avidin than merged from iron where they tried to shine a palistingan flag at a soccer match and the cranial people were calling on them to take it down because they rani people understand that they're being governed by terrorists and they do not wish to support that but celebrations took place in turkey here some of the tape from turkey because this is this

because there is no distinction between antisianism and antisemitism the whole purpose for antizinism is to murder as many dues as possible that is the entire purpose of the elimination of the state of israel as i said of the top of the show for albania just have been slaughtered mass the state of israel is the guarantee that that does not happen again the slaughter of just in israel is just part of a brought mission to slaughter just everywhere is the extension of the new hatred remember none of the excuses apply here this is not happening in the called settlements this is happening in a legit part of israel the has been a legit part of israel since nineteen forty seven this is not happening because israel occupies the gosestript israel does not occupy the gosestrict comes an control the godestript none of the usual excuse is apply is a pure simple vast terror break out to rented at the murder of civilians and it is being cheered and facilitated by members of congress an if the democratic party had any balls at a though t expel all of these members illhan oar treated out i condemn the terrific actswear sing on full today an israel against children women the elderly and the unarmed people who are being slaughtered and taken hostage by compass such senseless violence will only repeat these back and forth cycle we have seen which we cannot allow to continue we need to call for d oscillation and cease fire i will keep advocating for peace and justice throughout the middle east mi piece an justice d escalation an seas figure there con be not desolation and sense fire after the vast murder of nearly a thousand of your own citizens the kidnapping of hundreds of people desolation anybody who calls for a sense fire after a to let's a going for a sense fire after non eleven there will be noses fire there cannot be a sense fire anyone calls for a sense fire is a terror sympathizer under these circumstances if you call for a sense fire after this with a hundred and fifty civilians who are still being held by compass in the gosestrip after the murder of hundreds of people by the terrace group you are an emissary of evil and illhanomars an emissary of evil and she is matched in that evil by recreated to lead she put out another statement quote i grieve the palestinian and his really lives lost yesterday today and everyday i am determined as ever to fight for a just future where everyone can live in peace without feer and with dreary i equal rights in human dignity the path to that future mustinclude lifting the blockade ending the occupation and dismancelling the apart tied system that creates the suffocating to humanizing conditions that can lead to resistance on lame point out this point there is no partied twenty percent of seal's population is arab a huge number of people in professional positions our arab their two israel israel a party sitting and confessed right now hereisraelis been for justices there are arab this is the sea lie ending the blockade by the way israel has admitted fifteen thousand workers in recent months given fifteen thousand pieces from the gossip strip into israel for workers believing that juster would be then for reciprocated the was recsurprocate in the form of murder sh is a liar she's a viciously evil lirisshu italy quote the failure to recognize the violent reality of living under see occupation and a partite makes no one saver no person nochiled anywhere should have to suffer or live in fur of violence we cannot ignore the humanity in each other as long as our contryprfideds billions and inconunconditional finding to support the apatite government this heartbreaking cycle of violence will ah her solution is that we should continue to funcomass and we should pull our funding from the state of israel as america in the aftermath of the worst terror taxes non eleven and the worst crime against shoes since the holiest better that is the perspective of psalmist terror sympathize or extraordinary rechutets my elected congress women from the state of michigan and member of the vaunted squad but the but donor the the squad goes even further cry bush put out a statement as well the beaten congress woman from missouri quote i am heartbroken by the ongoing violence and palestine and israel and i more the over two hundred fifty israel and two hundred thirty palstinians lives that been lost to a first all the equivalent is not existent the palistinian lives that a been lost are solely the result of coast israel is targeting and killing leading members of commas and the are hiding behind women and children because this is what they do because they are the world's worst people they are committing war crimes on every available side she says i strongly condemned the targeting of civilians and i urgent immediate seise fire and descullation to prevent further loss of live our immediate focus must be saving lives but our ultimate focus must be on a just and lasting piece that insure safety for every one in the region violations of human rights do not justify more violations of human rights and a military response well only exacerbate the suffering of palistinians and is rallies not and a military responsum end the suffering of his rallies that is the idea the idea is israel kills enough of the sons of bitches that this is not a problem again the issue here is whether israel is my to militarize zone that protects its own citizens whether israel provides enough of a military hand in this areas prevent more rocket fir on a citizens whether israel anna says of the gossistrip as damlall should because of it the palistinians have prove themselves in capable of self government in the gosh strip by allowing compass to overrun them and not only overrun them govern them comas was an elected government this cannot be allowed to continue no sovereign state would allow this if this were happening on america feel compare this to america southern for get if america southern border ere chest being overrun by migrant seeking jobs by terrorist with guns walking into the it meets of dorado taxes and mowing down people and then taking women and children hostage driving them back across the border or firing tens of thousands of rock its over the course of years in to el past taxes for sandier californium if you a make back comparison bat would bathe comparison non america would do would liberate the border eviscerate it occupy it annex set up a daisy that is what would happen query bushes trash doc is trash our as her statement s to day is devastating for all the seeking a lasting peace an respect for human rights in israel and palestine i can damhamasas attack in the strong at possible terms no child and family should ever have to ensure this kind of violence in fear this violence will not solve the on going oppression and occupation in the region an immediate stele fir n diescullations urgently needed sat you see the the score was too short the news existed and that was the big problem the news by existing in their storied home land the holy land of israel by existing they earn this that is the message of the squad another democratic parties eat to grace in absolute abject disgrace for championing these these trash heaps of congress people the media's joining in as well is academia the hazard palestine solidarity group has put out a statement blaming solely israel for this for this debacle quote we the undersign student organizations whole the usually resume entirely responsible for all unfolding violence to day's events did not a can a vacuum for he last who deputes millions of palistinians and got have been forced to live in an open air prison first oval you knows force them to do that would be comose compass as dedicated billions of dollars to terrorism zero to building actual inform structure to investing taste making life livable for the people living there the soft give a damn about those people is rally officials promised to open the gates of hell an the maskers and got have already commenced halsinians and gods have no shelters for nowhere and nowhere to escape in the coming days palsinians will be forced to bare the full brunt of israel violence by the way i gosh does not need an ironnome cause israel is not target's millions that would be the reason the parasite resume is the only one to blame is rally violence is structure t every aspect of palistinian existence for seven fingers you they are no they are no words strong enough for the vast moral garbage you are if you sign a statement this for the absolute toxic waste of a human being you're an a moral leave if you back the sort of statement good news it is supported by no less then forty one different groups including the award c an america resistance organization amnestic international at harbor hazard act on a dream hazard can muslin students association the hazard college paxstanstuden association the hazard divinity school muscle association the harder is comic society hazard divinity school students for justice in palestine hazard jaws for liberation the hazard prison divest coalition the hazard undergraduate ingroup the hazard undergraduate o poly students association d fun these in these supposed institutions of higher education immediately and then of course you have the usual suspects in the media already the moral equivalent rolling off the pages of the york times o something to be hold they call it a cycle o violence already they suggest tit israel rotted upon itself they suggest the tensions are rising on both sides on both sides is a lie it is a lie i someone comes in your house and rapes your wife and kidnaps her and murders members of your family and steals your children and then you respond that is not a cycle of violence that is not both sides anybody who believes it is is morally bee sighted they are there on the side of absolute evil weasand me we host cumin moyeldan blamed mama's attack on israel as well because this is what trash people do that the graham accords did not bring israel the peace three that israelies wanted to bray ad brought them some business i brought the bodies dailies again important staff want if you are trying to solve a problem that is are now persisted for the better part of a century and you are trying to do the same way over and over and over again it is by definition intended and what were seen today are very deadly consequences of fail policies failure on the america administrations part to change up or to take a if fervent course to action with how we deals with the palistonians in theseraelies failure on israel part failure on the regents part if only if only israel had made more concessions to terror as this the certainly would me only israel had take pulled out of the intaragozal striping hand ad over control the comas and then avoided destroying mamas completely fer fer decades on an if only they done that oh that the unbelievable lies men while carat aria who writes for the washington post and a is apparently disgusting human being echo to social mediopost by a fringe somalia that had quote what did you'll think decolonization meant vibes papers assays boozer that is a twist on the almost on x suggest that those on left who band about turns to colonization but do not support terrorism are hypocrites she then said she then added we are forced to see state violence has justified in moral while violence by non state actors is not this is changing well no actually but to moral is rushing into towns and me i cannot i can a enough anybody wo the level of moral blindness that you have to that you have to demonstrate to do this is just it is beyond it is absolutely beyond a misery meanwhile israel has obviously declared formally war they have declared war that is not operation it is not an incursion it is not going to be a limited operation it is going to be a full scale war in which israel has now activated some three hundred thous and service apparently the revers reserves are showing up on mass one hundred and fifty per cent turn out for all the talk about is rally society over the course of last year and a half being wildly divided there is one thing that brings is rally together and that is the that is the threat of accistential destruction that is the threat to jewfish life israel comes together round life palsinian authority is lomicyhatcamas that come together around death and the celebration of death is real comes together around life and defending it venjamentinawho has put out a statement he is warning palsingans to leave gaze here is what he had to say is e erslyi we got comasyour citizens of israel sh this morning on chat and a holiday log chat compass invaded israel territory you and murdered innocent citizens in luring children in the elderly beamy compass as started a brutal and evil warms poem we will be victorious in this war despite unbearable price so to on is a very difficult day for all of us o come ss once to murder us all that is a fact e to is an enemy an murders children and mothers in their homes in their beds and in me the duck the elderly children young women shutout slaughters island masters our citizens be she including children to we simply went out to enjoy the holiday is what happen today is on precedent and israel and i will see to it that it is not happen again meanwhile president of israel as a curing that is more of a ceremonial position but a sort of unified position as a kurzag said our enemies have made a great mistake here was an is occursogny president of israel my behave citizens is men my dear citizens i know how discus in panful thesis but this rail spirit has always pedal and it shall triumph tho this time as well just a few hours the go i visited i the injured and the a pelican i saw and all is rely strain o and e a danger rosary of and a have to say or enemies has made a grate is taken ere a session of this strength of this daily spirit because even through bispiercing pain we can see this is daily power in full forests in israel military authorities a declaring war ideas major general hazan ally he says that oases open the gates of hell and that is exactly right there cannot be there cannot be any limitation to israel military operations here every valence of civilian blood is on hams every single ounce they hide behind village they hide behind shall the hide behind women the murders raises in the murder this own people an israel cannot hold back israel cannot how back on the basis that they are going to act with more discretion with regard to pausing in civilian life than compass is willing to evidence israel cannot risk its own citizenry it already has thousands of people are wounded or dead because of it here is here is israel idea of major general hazan allow no country worth its salt would allow terrorist to disease them from from saving and saving lives protecting their own citizenry by violation of their own human rights its its insane here is ideas major general hazan plan but that i soul how c commas says i on say one thing classes open the gates of hellers e gasastremamen monk you comas made the decision and compass will bear the responsibility and pay for its deeds who is behind thus it into their bunch of questions the are on to be asked her the security failures are going to occupy is rallies for decades in the the level of failure here is unthinkable and unimaginable and people on the ground an talking t them every minute pretty much a a stun by it as as well they should be but this was a very sophisticated attack this is not a base line attack in es jerusalem by a palistanian air with a knife this was a highly sophisticate attack with hundreds of fighters breaching walls using highly sophisticating military weaponry according to h waster journals coming directly from iron quote baronial security officials helped plan compasses sturdy surprise attack on his role and gave the green light for the assault at a meeting in bayou last money according to senior members of compass an cesballa another iron backed million group s they are deliberately telling they are deliberately saying that it was them an it senior members of compass and casually where pointing the finger officers of irons is logic revolutionary hard quod had worked to compass since august s advise the air land and seeing versions the most significant breach of seals border since the seventy three tune for war details of the operation we rendering several meetings in barrooms member barroom is a a it is lebanon in its ad in eonian proxy state a tended by argosy officers in representatives of four on back militia groups including compass which hold power an gas and cusballa a hate militia group and political faction in lebanon meanwhile you asked because it is dominated this administrations dominated by cowards their pretending none of this astappening they are the ones of course you sign billions of dollars over in funding to the aronians the pretending money is not fungible a do not worry sin congo for terrorism but that is how money works if i sign you a check and i say you cannot use it for drugs but i know you are a drug user i signora track an i salesman to pay for your food what do you think you are going to do wit the money you were going to use for the food you now use it to by drugs the same thing is true here money is fungible the united states is granted billions of dollars to iron access to billions of dollars not only that americahas been emotion with on of renewclior program well there own they're own negotiating team led by sober valley was infiltrated by eonian agents well documented house officials have a stake an pretending iron had nothing to do with this a house officials had we do not have any information at this time to corroborate this count and secretary state antonym blink in the nighty said we have not yet seen evidence iron tirectodor was behind this particular attack but there certainly a long relationship ask about the meetings much mood mere dally a senior omasoficials said the group planned the attack on hits one which of course is a li a spokesman moron's mission to the can said iron was in support of gasses actions but did not direct them it said they are fiercely autonomous which is again all the reason theireattempting to pretend that it was just compass is because if you arguing to try to dissuade south for making piece with israel you pretend t as commas alone if iron was behind it south hates iron as much as the is rallies do as had actually exacerbates the chances of a piece with israel meanwhile jobidon the president of the united states spoke out yesterday i here is what he had to say about the situation e people's under tack rotary a cur ionization homos n the smalercatea dona she a of the world ne cur teeter a the non is to stay is we will not ever the the her back well make cure thermel there sits need say con continued and no he or see appalling images thousands of rockers o the space of hours ring down rely cities get up e spore start to to seven thirty eight o'clock my call monsters crosses or calling not only is rely soldiers but is really civilians to the street to their hones it's sone people murder wounder entire family taken hosts by amass just days after you mark the holiest to days in duty you is unconscin they will mobile better keep the support coming because he has an unfortunate history being pusilandmis about all this meanwhile the same day you made sure that he held he barbecue apparently according to the pool report from the white house six am sundae evening a reporter said that they'll her live band in the white house when they asked about it the white house said that the present first they were hosing a barbecue for the white use executive resident staff and their family meanwhile antonym blincoln he sending mix messages he says correctly the commossprings only death and destruction but as we will see he then admits that iron for salesman calls on israel fort restraint and there basically two paths that are before the reason right now one is the path of of normalization of integration of people working together and by the way in that and on that path it is not a substitute for resolving the differences between his rallies and pallstings on the contrary it needs s to be used to advance that effort as well but that is one path the other path is what we sing from moss tears hard and something that offers not only nothing to people throughout the region it offers nothing to the palistinians on the contrary everything that amps does makes their situation their plight even worse they bring nothing but death an destruction not only to his rallies but to palicinians of course that is that is absolutely true but that does not answer the questions to by the by administration rein stated support fort the palicinian authority they suggest that they have not provided any port o commons but in their own documentation they admit that shipping culled humanitarian ait in to got was probably being used for the sort of stuff quote due to its over all strength and level of control of good we assess the s a high risk commosscol potentially drive indirect unintentional benefit from us assistance to gaze there is lass but still some us risk us assistant would benefit other designated groups as well that is according to internal united states documents did not stop the by administration from shipping millions of dollars into the gossip strip antonym blincoln has admitted that on fun terrorism if ship millions of dollars into kronor or least unfrozen billions of dollars flowing into iron here is blincoln the argument that money is fungible a on may have known this money is coming and used other fun to help fun is attack that baron has are has unfortunately always used and focused his funds on supporting derris o mot supporting groups am as i an it is done that when there been sanctions as done that o the have not bee sanctions and it is always privatize that we exactly would we unfreeze money to them the united states that is why explain the answer is there is no explanation its we auto sophisticate adults who believe that you can negotiate with evil and give them money and somehow this is going to make things all better by the way secretary state blinking actually committed a penis ridiculous moral atrocity when he tweeted out yesterday quote furnish for minister ho confident who by the ways he terra sympathizer and i spoke further on compass terrastacs attacks on israel i encouraged turkeys advocacy forasease fire and the release of all hostages held by comes immediately a sense fire a sense fight you told that to the the terror supporting foreign minister of of turkey did you again blincon then to lead od that things are going really well over therefore the for the biding administration speaking of which you es office of palistinian affairs tweeted out quote we unequivocally condemn the attack of comas terrace and the loss of life that is occurred we urge all sides to refrained from violence and retaliatory attacks terror and violence solved nothing that was pulled down after am it became perfectly obvious that when you tell israel mots defend itself that is in fact in act of evil meanwhile blincon call on israel to avoid civilian casualties he should long on coast void civilian casualties since they are the ones who literally man ma civilian casualties for the cameras if this is at prolonged attack what kind of humanitarian crisis are you expecting here and impact on civilians what we have seen this unfortunately a repeat itself although teethe magnitude the scale of what mamas did here is something we have not seen before but in or in pair instances am those who have suffered along with the victims o a terrorism a o civilians including in thin gas and whatever israel does in gas as always we look to it to do everything possible to avoid civilian casually something of course that home does not do on the contrary not ones is to seek to avoid them it is deliberately target civilians gan all in you might stop talking israel to stop avoiding civilian casualties sos that your actually doing s putting the owners on israel to put it s own citizens in harm's way to defend civilians that compass is putting harm's way no country worth it salt would put itself in that position not on its own borders not a the murder of eight hundred of its citizens and the catnapping of hundreds of others i beam going lot of questions over the past

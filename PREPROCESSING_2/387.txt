welcome to the superman lad guest series where i and an expert guest i gust science an science ace wins uni in man drew supermen and ism a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day's episode marks the first in a series with doctor and gain doctor and gain is a professor of connesiology it castrate university fullerton and one of the foremost world experts on the science and application of methods to increase strength speed endurance hypertrophy and various other aspects of fitness exercise and sports performance across the six episode series doctor and gallant pulls from his experts working with everything from professional athletes to recreational exercisers and teach us us the mechanisms logic and specific protocols for how to achieve any of the number of different exercise adaptations that i mention a moment ago ranging from strength to endurance hypertrophy and everything in between we get really far into details but at all times pain attention to the macroscopic issues that is how to create a program for endurance or strength or hypertrophy or speed or one that combines all of those we also talk about supplementation and nutrition and how to maximize recovery for each of the different types of exercise adaptations during to day's episode doctor galpanteaches us how to access our level of fitness and more generally how to think about fitness that we can best achieve are fitness exercise and performance schools doctor professor and gallant superexcited to have you here there such an immense treasure shrove of information on physical training and optimizing for specific goals and outcomes with physical exercise ism curious however many people have different levels of fitness some people are professional athletes of course but most people are not many people exercise regularly some people are trying to do that more some people are doing too much of that there overstraining they are not recovering enough if we were to take a step back and each an every one of us ask how fit are we with the word fit of course being a very around encompassing word could compass endurance certainly does strength the ability to run fast even if for short distances it might even include hypertrophy or directed hypertrophy trying to balance one's musculature to offset a cemeteries recover from injuries et camera how should i or anyone else for that matter think about their level of fitness and i know my resting tartrate but what do i do in terms of really accessing whether or not ism as fit as i could be and should be both for sake of health and performance and here ism asking the question not as an athlete but as somebody who as been pretty consistent as an exerciser but if we were to throw our arms around this question of how w do we assess our fitness what would be a for the different levels of a sentiment that we should think about and do when it comes to exercise people generally have to major goals in mind got number one is achieving some sort of appearance why this is i want to be big or want o not o be too big or i want to be lean something right it does not matter what that goal is but there is an esthetic component almost everybody they want to look a certain way or not a certainly the other ant is functionality i want o be able to perform a certainly now again that definition differs for persons i want i be better at strength i want to be better at mobility i want to be able to have energy throughout the whatever is there is some sort of appeal to ascetic there's some sort of appeal to functionality with in both those categories we want to be in a position where we can understand where do i need to go with my exercise training that i can be as fit and as healthy an achieve these goals at i want now as well as be in a position where i can maintain them for a long period of time this blends both immediate goals say your just interested in squatting a lot await say you are interested in running a five a time the best went it does not matter it blends that with the ability the the desire to have a long wellness span to be fit throughout life to achieve all those things for long as possible that in the question kind comes back to saying how to i know which are i need a focus on the most and why am i not achieving these goals or how can i get there more actively and if we look at the big picture we have to understand that there are several major components the physical fitness that are going to be required in all of these categories and to achieve that there are handful of components a have to happen to be able to hit those gulls now there infinite methods the same way actually use here lot is the methods are many but the concepts er few what i love to do to day is over the course of our discussion is hit exactly what those concepts are and then coverall whole bunch of different methods and we could do that for hours but we will cover a number of them for various souls one of the reasons i went into negro science and not into exercise science it's because of this thing nauru plasticity that nervous systems ability to adapt but the more time i spend with you and the more i learn from you i realize that many if not all of the organ systems of our body have this incredible ability to adapt and when we are talking about physical exercise there are incredible adaptations that of course in solve the nervous system but also in solve muscle and connective tissue and many other retypes and tissues that is said when we talk about fitness what are the major types of adaptations that underlie this thing that we call fitness and later i know we are going to get into how different forms of exercise can trigger different types of adaptations but what are the major adaptations that one can create in their body using exercise there there are many reasons why one should exercise and we could perhaps cover that later in our chats but the physiological adaptations can be bucketed really in a nine areas the very first one is what i call skill or technique just learning to move better more efficiently but the specific decision and timing and sequent sir whatever that is this could be running more effectively this could be prating a skill shooting a a ball or an implement swinging a golf club anything that i call that skill development the second one is speed this simply moving at a higher velocity or with a better rate of acceleration a that is very similar to the newton which is power and power is speed multiplied by force the next one then of course on top that is force or strength is that those are really synonymous terms right how effectively can you move something now this is often confused strength rather as muscular endurance what i mean by that is strength truly is a marker of how what is tho maximum thing you can move or it is maximmount of force you can produce one time its not how many repetitions in a row you can do that is actually another one of our agitations called muscular endurance i right that is typically under the order of say five to twenty five may be fifty repetitions think of a classic how many push ups can you do in a row ow may sit ups can do in a minute tat things that our muscular endurance muscular endurance tends to be localized this is your specific to just say your triceps in your an your deltoids it is not a over all party of vascular endurance marker or anything that that strength number four number five is musclehypertrophy and this is the first time now we are talking about an appearance rather than a functional outcome you moving better moving fast or moving heavier or indicators of how well you can move this is the first one that o simply how big is your muscle that is muslin peachier muscle size after that is muscular endurance this is how many repetitions you can typically do of a movement think of how many push up sin a row you can do how many it ups in a minute you can do things that atypically in five to fifty repetition sort of range and it is often or it is almost always local muscle what i mean by that is it is i i push up messes is really how many raps that your precepts and packs in deltoids can do it is not a party of vascular endurance it is not a global physiological endurance is specific typically one or a few muscle groups at a time this is why you have to do multiple tests for a sort of every group there after that now we have moved into number seven which is what i call anerobic capacity this is more synonymous with maximum heart rat and now ere actually looking at rather than a single movement or muscle group it is a total physiological o limitation it is a the maxim mount of work you can do and say thirty to forty five seconds maybe even up to a hundred an twenty seconds of all out work i think of your classic interval type of stuff here how much work can you do at a maximum rate where you can enter tremendous amounts of global fatigue the new past that is maximularobic capacity and this is probably to something in the eight o fifteen minute rain were you are going to reach probably both a maximum tartrate as well as a true via two man which will will talk a lot more about what that is o later that is is a different from the previous one where you cannot reach this in a matter of seconds it simply takes multiple minutes to get to a position to were your view two maxis actually going to be a sufficiently challenged are indicated the then it'll at one number nine is what a colony duration and this is just durability to sustain some maximal work for a long period time with no breaks no reduction whatsoever this is often called steady state training or lot of people to think of this when think of what uncle cardie but your ability to continue move and without any breaks or change or drop is the last in final adaptation and for long distant steady state ism guessing it exceeds fifteen minutes because a met a the previous one was at eight to fifteen minutes or what sort of us great time ranges are we talking about in terms of this a long duration will that is victuals one for you can be anything past fifteen minutes really if you look at a a count of a minimal number there generally twenty minutes of what we are looking for but a a more typical would be twenty to sixty minutes but anything pass the would still be limited by your long duration anddurants seerabilitye to sustain work over time o case yore even that therefore nine different major adaptations that can be induced with exercise of specific types is there any one global test or sentiment that people can take or do that a lows them to determine what level of ability of fitness they have in each an every one of these nine different categories there are probably down or more tests that you can do for each one of those nine categories and what would actually to do is walk you through my favorites for eat and giving you both the scientific gold standards if you had the ability i limit resources what should you go do as well as some that are equipment free that are cost free things that any one can do across the world in addition to that i wat a walk you through what those numbers should be how d o identify if you really pour in something or if your great and then if you are not as good may be in a category you want to get better at it exactly what to do in terms of protocols a for how i chievoptim results in each of those sees i notice in your list of the nine different adaptations to exercise that you did not mention fat loss or health promoting benefits which are two reasons that a lot of people ex excise was there specific reason that you did not mention those absolutely its because those things are actually not specific training styles they are by products of these nine what i mean by that is if you understand how fat loss occurs which we can sternly talk about you will realize some of these nine protocols are effective for fat loss of some are not general health is the same thing when we understand what it actually means to be healthy from a physiological perspective then the rational for what to train for is going to determinateself what i mean is looking at things in order to be healthy you have to have sufficient strength you have to have cartoon vaster fitness we have to have sufficient muscle and et camera therefore training for one's health is determined by those restrictions for you drew you may need to do more strength training to be healthy where me because ism strong already way stronger than you i may not need to do as my strength training our caruncle health based protocol are based on our current status or limitations and physical fitness among these nine areas what i would to do to day is to cover a brief history of exercise science and the reason is it is going to explain a want about why people are not getting the goals in their exercised programs that they want as well as gives you very specific direction about what to do instead i cannot wait to hear all the things that ism doing incorrectly and have you help me remedy that before we begin it'd emphasized at this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is also separate from doctor japan's teaching and research rolls at can state follicton it is however part of our desire and effort to brings erocostic consumer information about science and sized related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme wed to thank the sponsors of today podcast our first sponsor is moments momentous make supplements of the absolute highest quality the superman lab podcast is proud to be partnering with torments for several important reasons first of all as i mention there supplements are of extremely high quality second of all their supplements are generally in single ingredient formulations if you are going to develop a supplementation protocol you are going to want to focus mainly on using single ingredient formulations with single ingredient formulations you can devise the most logical and effective and cost effective supplementation regiment for your goals in addition momentous supplement ship internationally and this is of course important because we realize that many of the superman podcast listeners reside outside the united states if you to try the various supplements mention on the hubermanladpodcast in particular supplements for forgot health for sleep opplemization for focus as well as a number of other things including exercise recovery you can go to livemomentous spelled o u best that livmomentous doctor slash supermen to day's episode is also brought to us by element element is an electurolike drink that contains the exact ratios of the electrolyte sodium magnesium an potassium to optimize seller functioning for mental and physical performance most people realize is that hydration is key we need to invest in you fluids in order to feel our best and perform our best but what most people do not realize is that the proper functioning of our selves and nerve cells nurses in particular requires that sodium magnesium and potassium be present in the correct ratios now of course people with press pretension and his pretension need to be careful about their sodium take but what a lot of people do not realize is that if you drink caffeine if you exercise and in particular if your falling of very clean diet that is not a lot of process foods which of course is a good thing chances are you are not getting enough sodium potassium and magnesium to optimize mental and physical performance element contains a science pack ratio of one thousand milligrams that is one

make smart mattress covers with cooling heating and sleep tracking capacity have ben using an eight sleep mattress cover for about the last eight months and it has completely transformed my sleep ism sleeping about the same amount but ism sleeping far deeper and ism now getting the proper ratios of called rapid i moment or red sleep and slow wave sleep and waking up feeling far more recovered mentally and physically the underlying mechanism for all that is very straight forward have talked many times before on this pod cast and elsewhere about the critical relationship between sleep and body temperature that is in order to fall asleep at night your body needs o drop by about one to three degrees in terms of door body temperature and waking up involves a one to three degree increase and cur body temperature with eight sleep mattress covers you can adjust the temperature of your sleeping environment to be one temperature at the star of the night a different temperature the middle the night and a different temperature as you approach morning each of which can place you into the optimal stages of sleep and have you waking out feeling more refreshed than ever if you to try eight sleep you can go to eight sleep do cam slash supermen and check out their pod three cover and save a hundred a fifty dollars at checkout eight sleep currently ships in the u sea canada united kingdom select countries in the e and australia again that is eight sleep do calm slash supermen to save a hundred fifty dollars at checkout before we get in to how the history of exercise science in forms the mistakes that we are all making and how to remedy those mistakes ism curious as to whether not you have any favorite one or two studies that point to a sort of naturally occurring a example of how people can become very fit in one aria and not another in ism familiar with seeing endurance athletes that apparently have terrific endurance but at least to my eye do not look they are particularly strong ism also familiar with seeing individuals that are very very strong polar n social media but that do not look they could walk up i light of stairs much less run a mile you have any examples of studies in or outside the laboratory that point to that in a concrete way there is a lot to hap to discuss here but it'll answer really clear if you look across the literature an this is actually back to as early as the mid nineteen fifties in fact that actually goes back to previous to that to the hazard fatiglab nineteen twenty seven to nineteen forty seven area people actually were advocating at that point a combination of strength training an endurance in then noting then way back than e fact act goes prior that day lay eighteen eighties there is scientific evidence back that like became more well developed in the midnineteen fifties an sixties in fact there was the initial stages of what is called the exercises medicine movement which is the movement now but the initial stages of that actually route back to the nineteen fifties and i old actually go in that whole discussion in t story of how that all came about but that is the health less wealth a mantra that came from the nineteen fifties from the scientific community the all those those data points are going to suggest you need a combination of some sort of broad strength training and broad endurance now if you have a specific goal five months from now we want a compete in a was are h a certain physique think that is fine to focus on one area training certainly were an athlete that is different but if you want a maxim miss health and and over all functionality throughout time and east be combination and are really really highline this liken actually talk about a couple of studies that have done ism one of when we actually did in stockhome sweden i did this at the carolansk institute which you probably are aware of m it is actually one of the founding places of all of exercise physiology a general it started there it was called something different back then but really our entire field came out of stockhome in the clans institute and we work with the whole bunch of cross country steers that we are in their eighties and nineties and they were competitive swears the nineteen forties and fifties and they had been seeming competitively for that entire durations you are talking fifty to sixty consecutive years of competing we there are eighty to ninety year old living alone and healthy and we compared them to a group of individuals a here in america who are the same age but we are not exercising and what we wanted to do is to say an can look out what of these lifelong endurance individuals what they look when we brought them in the lab which is by the way amazing to do a veal to accept on a ninety two year old a especially in language that they do not speak you are in a you can imagine you are doing this in the hospital right and you are running people through this is a cycling test and for a veal to access you have a mask on your face you hooked up to a metabolic carts we can collect all the gases that are coming at your mouth and your you are chanting these people on and easily every minute the work load gets harder and hard and harder until you camp completed and we are doing this in in a cardiology enter and the cardiologist are usually waiting for the hart rate to get slightly elevated than they stop them cause there eighty five eighty six years old and only we not stopping them but we are screaming in their sis lacogogo and sweetest burin ai in english right and hen that the translate with it does not take a lot of translation when seven screaming at your face gigolo we ran them through whole mentor view to man was we did the same thing for those folks back a here a in america and what was a incredibly clear from that study was the view to man a you can think about these numbers n nesses was called relative in the relative terms are a middle leader's per kilogram permitee and we standard number is about eighteen is we call the line of independence if youreviel two man is below eighteen middle later percilegramperment is very hard for you to live by yourself your fitness is low you probably a going to have somebody living with you or you will need to be in some sort of assisted living how if you are in view two man of twenty you twenty one or twenty two you are not below that line of independence but you are on that threshold and we found was our folks here in america the group average was right around that number they were living at home by definition we pick them to be people living by themselves in their eighties not in t living but they did not have any band with if they got a cold or they had anything pop up where they lost a little bit of fitness they were a drop below that line and would probably have to go to some service as o living situation the folks in stockroom the the cross country steers the group average was most closer thirty five to thirty eight mill laderspikilegram permitted now that number is about the view two man you would find for a normal college mail and these folks that were literally eighty or ninety if the of the joke if a saber two tiger ran in the room or r whatever an it chase it down and we all had to run to see who did forget eaten alive that the college men would probably've got n eaten before the the ninety year old in in one case we had a ninety two year old individual i think his view to man was thirty eight which was an our estimation world record the highest feel to man for somebody over the age of ninety me ask what is the typical resting heart rate for somebody a very fit these a older sweetish cross country swears theyyou have somebody has a am this let say their number is thirty five millers for kilogram in this a view two man test but since most of must do not have access yet that kind of equipment but the we cannot measure our pulsate ye what was a typical resting tartrate resting cursory sub sixty she i typically that is a good number to go off for anybody regardless of age any time i see somebody above that o ism consternate asking questions certainly above now you'll seen the literature people will say sixty to eighty is normal on i i do not agee that at all if you are up if your resting hatred is seventy five beast for meant there is either something going on or you are not fit how much cross country scheme were they doing on average in the previous must say if we take the previous twenty years since they would been long come cross country scars divide that by twenty years yet on everagar of these people cross country scheme five hours a ay two hours day an hour or de yet that is actually god question i do not remember it is been many years i but they were not doing it every single day and the volume would not of shocked you it was the consistency over fifty years the got them there now i see these people were again world champions and lump old metals and nineteen forties and fifties they were ye let they just continued consistently over time but it was not a shocking amount of physical fitness they also did not body their way to train hard they were busy chopping would they were busy doing number of other things and then they just happened to do some these races and ski a long way but it was not a crazy amount to where your all that is great but i can never hit that number it was something much more reasonable is the take away to be consistent about getting party vascular exercise and we can define yet what consistent means in terms of days per week lo bit later i know we will what er some other examples i love these examples of a from the real world here here is the downside though i only told you about their vial to macs what i did not tell you about is the strength and functionality and that part was no more superior than it was their counter parts who were not exercisers what that showed really really clearly and many other studies have been done since then that look at the class it a we call life long endurance exercisers you will see in general their veal to acts the party of aster function they are resting hart rate they are blood pressure it will be a markedly healthier then folks yo do not exercise it is extraordinarily clear that type of exercise is very important for chronic these management no out about it however it is not sufficient for over all global health because it does almost nothing for legs strength for any other marker of health which we can talk about what are the things inner actor going to predict mortality i or bebitye the most that was a a big a big smashing indication that is a came this is great however you are leaving things on the table for your over all health not one could argue they are eighty and they are doing pretty well but they were not doing as well in these areas and a study we did later actually as o follow up was looking at monocline us twenty this is actually interesting being he scientists his is a classic example of one of my gradual students who would been i my lab for probably three or four years and she was in our single fire physiology lab and shes you imagine she is n she is isolating individual muscle fibers from an athlete one by one with the tweezers and she is going to do several thousand individual cells i say she is you are down there for hours and an things happened own there you can't lose your mind and choose kind of going on one day with one of my colleagues just talking and shes o ya my uncle is really really fit and something or other and then oh yet he is a twin anis of ye monosigas find she is yet for those that are no mass i identical twin yet what is is interesting you basely have when ism setting up here's is this the perfect exercise scientific experiment mono's likes identical twin to mean the they have exact same tone an egg was fertilize split and then two humans threw out of that with the exact same dean and now we can step n once or the questionable yoke what about maybe these cross country skewers maybe they were just genetic freaks maybe it did not matter its some people have we men exert always a component to it but how much well now we have a snare lining out herds si uidama you have monks us twin we have a replica of a human being exact same dean e the only differences we would see in their physiology now would be due to life sal circumstances interesting monks us than in a it out an uncle right uh great do they exercise we one of em does he is the life long endurance exercise runner cyclist swimmer iron man all these things what about the other one no he does not exercise at all at at that point i wanted to kill my graduate student cause ism you have been in my lab for three years or more probably and you have never told me that in your household is the perfect scientific experiment for exercise you could ever create i ten is the the the look on her face when my calling an i we staring to sucychall my god ism call them right now there coming in the lab of fly them in from chico outfit care what we have to do we are getting i in and i wanted to actually going back to the model that was first developed by the harbor fatigued one thing that is interesting about that committees they started off with the concept of trying to examine human per romance through a wholistic lens and it was the antithesis of looking at a either organ by organ we are going to only look out the party ofvescer system or only going to look out seen o muscle and then we are saying we are looking at this entire picture and that model we wanted to carry through when these twins an i wait are right i want to bring them in the lab but ism not just going to look out one system i want to do everything we took stool samples we took blood we did vertical jump test we did maximum strength test we did a am rise of muscle mass we did i a veal to man test we i deficiencies of we we deject testing we dance test wed psychological battery we want to look at everything to figure out all these things whale differ between the twins and if the second see question there is by how much can i improve my veal to mac sure every one knows that but how much can it change by five percent eighty per cent where is the number and putting some qualification on this was very important and again we had another example of a classic endurance only training paradise compared to a a non so this is a a person is ends a truck driver by vocation which is i thin actually drove for a potatoship company which was even funnier the the endurance actually actually was great because any endurance people he had a he had physical books of all his training manage for the last thirty five years and we could we was went through them we calculated the total amount o miles he ran his averages his hart race per e time we had this unbelievable thing what races he was in at the documentation you was is totally notstright something that insurance people are shaking their head right out on o ye i got that to ananduranc spokes are pretty hurry yes y right as great because ow i could valid it as close as one could to actually how much he ran anythings that they ad about a thirty five year discord they both exercised up through high school about eighteen they stopped doing it by the time the run in the lather in their mid fifty is about thirty five years at difference and when we ran them through the testing if you look at the the measures that were similar to the sweden study it was almost identical the the exercising twin was significantly better at things a lipid panel resting hartright blood pressure reveal to mags any of those markers i ask predicted were er much better what was very interesting though was the things that were in the middle first of all their total most a muscle mass was almost identical to the gram with in the margin of air of a demo scamp could possibly ever be the non exerciser though was a little bit fatter the difference in actual body weight was explained almost entirely by body fat a non lean tissue really same surd okay no one surprised there that the exerciser was a little bit leaner even know it did not change toleamoun a muscle mass at all when we looked at some of the more functional tests and we looked at things muscle quality this is metric you can get from an ultra sound you kind of think about this as how much fat is inside the tissue which is some times in advantage for endurant exactly to have a little but moreen what are called injure muscular tried la worse because it is a fuel directly no the tissue but in general the exercise are the a the muscle quality was not in favor of the exerciser if you looked at the performance testing and if you looked at strength it favored them the non exerciser now again we have the same finding we saw in our sweden study but in identical twins and it really really high lighted the fact that if you want to move forward with optima health simply picking one si lo is not going to get due there what is all the meeting just running just liking right does this mean that the twin that did not exercise could jump hire or win in arm resin a competition not that that is a vital thing to be able to do with just in terms of measuring strength as our isometric strength was the not exercising twin stronger o at least as strong as their exercise in yes particular grip strength yet and any the measures the vertical jump extension power in a number of things they often favored the non exerciser which you are still a little bit of a chicken and beg you do not know of necessarily the endurance training reduced that other twins strength or it does not even really matter per say i think the highlight of it is can you change some of these metrics of van to mafia not even close these things are v are response regardless of your genetic your genetics will give you a starting place very clearly even the non exerciser was a pretty healthy got they weren't godson admit fifties does not exercise does not really attention is died at all and he was in presa shat however if you want to actually move progress and move ford a high functionality you have to do something besides just run right just distance run now i could say the something for strengtring that alone ax i do not want to make the sing ism saying underencs exercises it worked an both case both thy studies those folks were much better off in tactics that are incredibly important to mortality how long you arguing to live veal two macs t get it is just not going to get there inters a strand we took a look at muscle fire physiology is well which is very interesting what i mean is there is generally two types of muscle fires fast twitch an slow twitch and one on things it is a hall mark of agave is a respective reduction in fast witch fires and that's because it is difficult to activate them unless you are going high worse activities you are ant active et slow twitch fires doing almost any activity of daily living and they stay around fast with fires unless you are doing something of his force or going not be used an not going to be kept around and that is a problem because when you look at things the need for strength throughaging the ability to catch yourself from a fall these things are incredibly important you do not have fast fires you do not have the speed to get your foot out in front of you on time and you dofthave the eccentric strength the stop the fall from happening and if you look crossing in the aging literature that they are very clear about the importance of maintaining strength an and fast with fibers overtime we know that this is an important distinction here of roll and people will often talk about o k how much of that ais genetically determine can i change my fiber type and the answer theirs is resoundingly yes and can i change it with exercise an the answers absolutely you can and the next question is how much now again rganisseem order of magnitude in general without going too far down a an area maybe began for for later each one of your muscles in your body has a different percentage a fast witch an so twitch for example your calf if you look at your holiest which is a kind of he smaller one echoes in the back that is generally mostly slow twitch typically eighty per cent or slow twitch the gastric which is the other one right next tits if you are to point your toe next your face in that part that cot a flux is out in the middle pops out that is your gastric that is almost the inverse it is generally eighty per cent fast witch may be twenty per some so twitch generally anything anti postural or postural rather anti gravity a spinal erectors things hat a met to keep you up or moving all day are gong to be slow twitch and things your hand strings which prefer explosion are and be fast witch we buy ups the quad in these individuals and in that muscle it is generally about fifty fifty fast witch slowkdwitch as it is a really broad number well what other things t we found was in the non exerciser it was almost tax book what you would predict it was about fifty percent or slow twitch a little bit of percentage of fast witch an a about twenty per cent of one of these called hybrid fibers which are a hall mark of activity i great in the exerciser it was about ninety five per cents slotwitch and it is extremely clear again i do not know if may be their set point was lowed hirer towards that in the non exerciser do devolve down to his place or they he one but it does not matter i mean going from forty per cent t which in one case to ninety five percent solitritch in another case it shows you that the the limits of physiological adaptation our darn near boundless given enough exposure an this case thirty five years of extremely consistent training and his muscle morphology was completely different than his identical twin of the exact same doing those are two beautiful examples of people doing endurance work for a number of years and what that gives them in terms of benefits and functionality as the opposite experiment been done or observed where somebody just weight lifted or just sprinted for a number of years i i do not know that there is a identical twin a control that no i wish betta third t an to too much was o right triplets o case o triplets out there om e you're exercising in different ways were people have triplets maybe you assigned one kid to be a runner when i ye a weight lifter and the other one to be sedentary please do not do experiments that but the expectation as i understand it would be that the person that prince were to that does heavy squats explosive work would then have more fast witch muscle fires in their quad and they are non exercising counterpart would have fewer that that would make cents but what happens if you abscise the the endurance level in somebody who is just done string training or just sprinted yet we do not have those data specifically there is word actually just starting to have studies come out on life long strength trainers and there is liters very good reason for this i which is a whole story we can get into but the the quick answer is we do not have a lot of people who have been lifting waits for thirty r plus years we have a whole swath of people who've been doing in turns training for that long is that because fewer people have been weigh training or the we trainers all dead you gout go back to the nineteen fifty three nineteen fifty for yet two major things happen the change the entire course of exercise physiology and exrcisescience and really exercises we know it it is important to understand the history of our feel a lot of the questions i get are based on false assumptions of what exercise can and cannot do as an example we a questions momentum should i use momenta a that is cheating right or it does not work i it compromises my results it is actually totally untrue there are excellent reasons when you should use moment when you left there are reasons when you should not it is sometimes very beneficial to go fast with the exercised repetition sometimes very slow an patrol this better any question i get in fact ism very infamous for always responding with it depends the reason i say it depends is it depends on the gold when you are training for speed or power muscular endurance the answer to some of these very common question differs what people fail to realize is they think they are asking the right question because they do not understand this history what is been planted in your brain subconsciously is driving that question it is not necessarily the right one if we walk through that a little bit you will see what that field has led you why you think certain things matter when they actually do not or maybe your assumptions renin correct and then exactly what to do about them i to see a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor athletic greens it lentic greens is a vitamin mineral robotic and adapted in drink design to help you meet all of your foundation or nutritional needs have been taking athletic greens daily since two thousand and twelve ism delighted that their responser of this podcast reason i started taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athletic greens once or twice to day is that it helps me meet all o my foundation or nutritional needs that is it covers my vitamins my minerals and the robotics are especially important to me it lentic teens also contains adaptions which are critical for recovering from stress from exercise from work or just general life if you to try it lentic greens you can go to let greenstone calm slash supermen to claim a special offer they'll give you five free travel backs and they will give you year supply of within in see three cay to again if you to try it lentic greens go to athletic greenstone calm slash supermen to claim the special offer in nineteen fifty three nineteen fifty four you had roger banister breaking the four minute mile subtorment file and they also had sir adman misery and an his trip an norway a summon verist in the same bitch to your stand that exact same year after that was a formation of what is called the america college of sports medicine now that is still around to day it is the are eminent group for this exercises medicine if you are interested in things exercise for obesity prevention for cancer treatment for for things that is not really sports medicine it is more for a clinical exercise that is the place to go mericacolege spouse medicine we have this launching of both a ton of people wanting to start doing endurance exercises start swimming and cycling and running tend you have a launch of people coming off of the back of the harbor fatigue lab the fatigue lab actually shut down on nineteen forty seven you have these people interested in physical fitness but nowhere to go well all those people left the harverteaglapan start of their own labs another places you have launch the careers of people a they have costal and n an johnhalase an some these very famous exercise physiologists and they start bill in laboratories and we start for the first time ever studying the science of exorcise years go by and these people happen nineteen sixes and nineteen seventies when we call the runners bone people start that if you fact if you look at the numbers of people who are doing marathons it explode through these two decades space right because it is implore them we could do these en durance fear notice both those feats for endurance right running short term as well as going over there no one has thought anything about strength training and here is why in the late eighteen eighties there was a very famous a physician and a gorge kinship i think was his nan who is a big proponent i strength training well he died like in the age of fifty something of a hardtack and that terrified people of strength training for seventy years because there wood that stuff we will kill you as he was a doctor he was crying his running around the country doing this exhibitions and reporting it and then he died the sort algins hundred per cent dying all the some people said he died of a harder take of the people said he fell through the ice into cold water tit is debated but the fact that a e every proponent i the a now titian plan dies suddenly yet not good for business now the little storm is brewing nineteen forties and ism going back a little bit but bear with me for a second there is a guy name a peter carbrvitge and he is a a scientists out of springily the decorated physical education p that ghat's a legendary place springbok college and he is anti strength trying for a lot of same reasons and is not our career talked about note do this he is one that lunch these ideas hat strength training will make you those flexibility it will be bad for kids all these things that we know now are clearly not true he is proposer o these things and there is a show that happened cumin his a springfulo college and a guidance bob york and if you work barbell that still around to day he is going around the country and in putting on his exhibitions they come to spring field an ti sort of a a new aged a him you thing wheres the students know it is about to happen the carprvitt shows up to this event and everyone knows he hates strength training and everyone is waiting for t to end just to see what he is on a say this whole exhibition goes on these people are doing not be getting rebec the time body building way lifting power lifting strong strong men it is all the same thing there is no differentiation stand it finishes and carprovitte stands up and the crowd goes silent and he just asks one question he us points to on of the guitar says scratch your back and now he just assuming and waitingfor the guide to be ah and not be able to put his hand behind a sad and i think he pointed to john gamma cusk o famous body builder and he reaches back and scratches back no problem and then they proceeded to grab two dumbbells i think there were fifty pound duckbills into a backlit standing back with both any chance they start doing the splits on sage thy start going performing all kinds of physical function ten and an carprovitts is stunned he is like wholly she has nothing to say he leaves there an his hole life is changed all these things he was claiming were shown in his face to be false he does a one any on his career he starts running study after study on strength training and starts finding immediately there are no detriments to strength trying in drums of lake local health right of course you can do it wrong and things that in fact here comes a whole bunch to benefits through nineteen fifties while this thing's going on with the endurance folks no one still strength training because there is no there is no record to see there is no america call just ports medicine there is no societies there is no science or not sure safe and meanwhile czarevitch is is hammering study after study after study showing you it is safe and safe an safe but it has not picked up yet and then everything changed in nineteen seventy seven thank youarnald sortznegger he came out with the trifled he hits you with pumping iron which i know you now that to be right pumping interesting move even for those not interested in body building it is a very interesting move because it really gives the window in to not just him but the way in which way training started to show up as a regular practice you nay when i was growing up the only people waytrain were people preparing for fall body builders who basidin't exist in the town where i grew up and the only people did yoga we are bogie's doing bicarb but now you drive through any major america city or your incite and there bogus studios there is him with freeways if areola shortener is largely responsible i think for it for initiating that that shift yet he cause he d think about it he hit us with pumping iron conman and in the terminator almost in back the back very close within years you have got this whole cascade the seventies of people running cycling is swimming now science o martin to come out that it is not dangerous and may be actually some benefit and then be not allays hat not bad for you it can make you into a real world super hero we think about the psychology of of a child going up watching somebody conman think about what bat man looked the nineteen fifty o sixty's right and then on i can look that now not everyone wants to look anal but you see t if you see the power that can landing people no one had ever seen or thought you can make your body transformed that you could maybe be born that but no chance that is within the grass of all of you when i was a kid growing up one of my favorite books was the jinnis bookaworld's records yet i still have it images in my mind of the the a coldest animal their the longest lies band et camera or him and there was a picture there of and shortsnegger and you know it his record was is said perfectly developed man eye which is as you point out that is not the physique that must people us air at but it really i it did inspire this the ship the other thing about resistance straining that i think a has a certain allure for some people men and women is that it is one of the few forms of exercise that because of the enhanced he blood flowed to the muscle that occurs during the training the called pump yet it gives you a transient but somewhat real window into what your results will be for you on to run and your gasping for er you do not get the you are not experiencing what it is to be faster than you are that day it's r but when you wait train you get and esthetic picture into how your functionality an esthetic will change it disappears a few hours later for as the the call pumps of subsides but it is a very an interesting form of exercise in that way it is almost as if you go into learn a language and during the process of learning for brief moments you are actually fluent and then a it taken away yet its what puts the doomed carpet out in front of you yet this is just me hypothesizing as to why weight training might have a taken off the way they an mi's if you got paid every hour on the hour we you are working in the to thing of the day thy take the money back but you still as the time clock is going on your day you are looking up you tot seen why you are watching your bank account grow in real life you can see why it is addicting to those folks to finish the story here what going back your actual question answer this is happening the late seventies early eighties and now jo leader all these gems they are exploding because people want a look that or if they hade they realize that have the chance to change how they physically look that had never been a reality before you easily men at that point ism almost yes elusively yet for a large number of reasons cultural acceptance et camera even within durance stuff you coal get fitter and run faster n that is better but i gens was not going to change how you looked unless you were losing fat now you can change how you look which is incredibly dieting factors of a very famous quod i think it is a goweader who said show me one man who wants to be strong and all show you ten a an a lookstrong rights that is very very powerful right this is a whole the hit dis ton o this history isn't going to with is sort of explaining to but now your the penalties and you have what i call my generation you have my generation who fall love a staring training the eighteen in n nineteen eighty's nineties but there is really no scientific field for it it is not really come about yet the science of endurance and exercise physiology is now humming along in a massive rate because these people came up win the seventies and eighties and there five ten fifteen years in their carer they are producing they are in it they're entering gradual students they are starting on labs and the excise physiology still to this days eighty per cent endurance steady statestup almost exclusively well now mike my generation you love you love sports you love lifting you aloft all these things and now we see hatpin is the chico bulls michael gorge starts picking up strain train who that is an that is on ties on sports in er non mid nineteen ninety's lifting weights and we go back actually to the a nineteen seventies and ism ism not sure of your football fan but any footballfanwill recognize then abraska corn huskers and h nineteen seven eighties and eighties change ha foopulse played well the reason it is because they start a staring training and hit start of doing it with the name boy et believe who is the founder of the anlace the national strength and timing association is formed in the light nineteen seventies as well just any and was developed the year after those two events happened nineteen seventy eight the year after onto comes out come and sea is formed and now you have a scientific organization dedicated distrain thin addition you have got and a fell strength inishoning coaches that are starting to come on board you have got scientists that are starting to come and elapse and strength edition became to scientific field well every thing swings now from an exercise perspective into body buildingand almost all the things in fact we were sort of talking before i could run a whole bunch of tricks on you and i could ask you a whole bunch of questions about things you think are absolute standards are guaranteed about training ism supposed to do this ism never supposed to do that for instance i for instance is it of cay to train a muscle group on back to back days most people are at home thinking no you are not supposed to train a musclenees to recovery and that is total nonsense right ism other things body part split training right training one muscle group per day i other things cardie endurance training influencing will it ruin my gains for my lift all these things are on at a a base of assumptions that come from body buildingnow that is a fantastic work but because everything started in the eight nineteen seventies as body building s turns a basic strength training was that weight lifting an power lifting were not at all around right they were but nobody cared again show me someone who wants to be strong it'll show you ten a on a lookstron the physique thing just dominated and we are we are not getting out of that yet i were not alloy out of it we are starting to them because here is why people star to realize this this body building ding is fantastic i can change my physique ism getting better but damn these work outs take an hour and half two hours anti's an a spend that whole time on one or two body parts which mean ism going to half to lift six days a week and ism n after that consistently right now ill send boy two hours on my on my elbow letters damn my elbowstrtnto hurt and yet my understanding is that it does not really require two hours to day not at all training in order to get benefits even just for hypertrophy totally but but a a lot of time you get to have to get some amount of time in because you are spending much isolation we have gone away from training movement running is a movement cycling is a movement ism training my beeps is a muscle a not muscle group ism training my hand strings are a muscle group it is not a human movement we have done a one eighty in terms of select in the exercises from movement base prescription two now muscle group base training when your coating muscle groups that means a whole trunk of your body is really not doing much throughout the day what happens if your doing say legs on money and you miss my aka iron a flight now your legs have to wait a whole other week rat's the suction habit this dust become problematic people's or are getting beat ups people start realizing i can not feel that great ism not superfix ism sweating just walking up the stairs ism out of breath why because all that training you have done nothing for your party of asci fitness you have done nothing to improve ism heartraight oxygenation bloodflow and that paradigm swing way too hard into the exercising especially lifting weights is single joint often machine often slow often high volume isolation and that left a gift opening of people going await a minute what if you could get into gem i could promise you the same or better results and under thirty minutes and i fact you also feel better you will lose more weight and that opened up group exercise classes kettlebell stuff cross fit type of off circuit training because you can come in you will not get beat up was the volumes lower the time is much lower you get multiple adaptation at the same time great the problem with that though fast for ten years is it started burying people because you have now d emphasize movement quality and you have over imprecise scores right this is a classic example if you go you watch pumping iron you will see ore anybody bi you will see if they are doing a by repro they do not even really pay attention to the rep range they do not really pay ten to the load they are looking at their muscle ere trying to figure out how do i get that thing to fire they are squeezing tire flex in their posing at the end of every set there try figure out om mi getting enough pomp it is exclusively founded on exercise quality the rep range the numbers almost a refit when you go the other model exercise technique it does not matter just get the most among of weight up or them mount of raps or the fastest time et camera camera high be the cross fit have walk passim cross fits use have done too cross that all o is you said crossbar i did not oh i don't know i i enjoyed the i defile i felt was working hard i oh you i observed a lot of people in very close proximity undoing olympic lifts and doing kipping that is where you kicky legs folks you no sort bucking and and kipping tight pull ups a no i i enjoyed it a it was motor me for the long term but it did seem that there was a a lot of ballistic movement in goes proximity to other people an the hazard to me seem more about that than the actual movements well again the the point of setting up here is that was actually a really brilliant solution for a lot of problems the classic body building hyperchfy introduced i got away from isolation movements and got people doing big movements which are more effective generally better i got people doing things fast and explosive that is more athletic that is more important for longevity it solved a lot of the problems joint health was not getting crashed the issue they went with is they just pushed the pace on score rather than quality they push the pace on how many people can be in here t the same time now you are doing high risk movements higher intensity higher fatigue and with a total not that they do not care about technique but it is not the thing that their most concerned about it is getting the number an the thing done they stall the time issue though you can get tremendous results in three days a week under forty five minutes each session et camera burn people to though was too much high intensity weight too often and the other problem safety concerns all kinds of worth o poetic issues and other to can i a interrupt you for women just ask ya question as we go through this art of the history of why endurance training predominated or straight training or body building type training or cross fit type training cause i think this is fastening i know where about to arrive at where we are to day an what the future looks for for people in what they should focus on and do at what point if any do you think resistance training started to become adopted my women there was no equivalent of areola shorts nigger there was a kinda hamilton an the terminator ye am there a some impressive a physiques certainly on a female actresses and a athletes the willing sisters very pressie i musculature physiques and of course their tensplaying yes for itself u has that happened yet i mean yet what i mean is a do you think since you work with both men and women ye do you think that most women understand tat weight training done properly is going to be extremely beneficial for them maybe even especially for them in terms of am offsetting bondensity lost and things of that sort m or we still waiting for the stigma the a popular a stimulus for getting eighty percent of of young women thinking i want e lift waits yet hart for many ancercas em not ism not a woman right now i have a daughter shes for fault will see ism what i can say is is have probably worked with i do not know how many professionalthins in total a lot have worked with them probably fourteen professional sports have worked with a young winners envy pes the whole allay the credentials right i bet thirty five forty percent the we this have worked with our female have worked with e limbic old medalists have work with a bronze metals and multiple sports have work with o the most decorated power lifter of all times in a number of these areas fighters world championship all these things i from me i feel that verses area yo hap my students if you look at my class room i i do not nowt the numbers are but there is no small number of females in exercise science and excess physiology i if you look in our laboratories that is one thing you will see there are very few female exercise sciences there are very few a female strained inisionin coaches but that number is is is coming down a astronomical rat you have a people that are being hired ism in every sport a you pick the anodal you pick matrix baseball every every months were hearing first female hired for this first f male hired for that am the bankers rather rather about is fantastic you not yet yet race's been out to my lab she is terrific yet ye ye that is that she is fantastic an she is now being hired as i think she is a hitting coach now actually work i she she is going to be a jam t that is this hero she is a terminator am that that is already happening and my student that are coming through our program are getting place in these rules they have not got through yet a lot and terms of being an actual scientists but they are getting there am s more sciences to beating hired females and from big data collections what science an tack will cover a an an another discussion but i think is happening whether not the the cultural and social or i cannot speak to that ant equation what i can speak to thou is one of things i think is is most fun coming for d scientifically is you know a number of years ago and i at came blackly came through wit their mandates o saying it is no longer acceptable to exclude women from scientific research i as we just did that for that case well what happened i just to fill this in cosseting it is worth noting is that for many years am studies even on road into ye we are mainly carried out on maleroad ins because the a sumption and the assumption turned out to be wrong but the assumption was that the physiology of female robins because they do not have a menstrual cycles not twenty eightdays of an extra cycle its for days a a different type of cycle that the would somehow disrupt the data turns out that is entirely wrong now it is actually required a when you sit on ta grant study panel i which the people value he grants you they ask they literally say did they meet the bacteria for see as a biological variable herewere notch about secs as the verb seems exist a a biological see and am if you do not say yes that is a strong hit against the grant you say yes then it checks off that box it is now required they both male and female roadies and humans be studied an a given study unless the study is specifically geared toward understanding that only exists in one yet on ere the other population such as a a metapaus for e essence menstrual cycle a anatropous a for instance but am this is extremely importanti'm excited to hear that am we walls can to go withthat is actually that will step one which is cool you got include whet we have not gotta to yet but have seen more and more grand applications come through for this its just the running has not yet which is it is one thing to in to let women be in the same studies that is great it is another thing though to star performing high performance research specifically for female questions that has not happened yet that is just a running issuer we have not gotta money yet people are not are not supporting that we soft get a lot of financial support for sport science but we can't cannot tract on the money yet of something me going i want to do a study in female at thin spencer female attic questions these will not help men these are questions specific to the female that is the next tout right that is where we got to get to we can stick maybe we should do things differently a around training o recovery or or we should not or t does not matter that there is some there is a handful of not lower quality but some studies i i do not love them yet there just needs to be a till work o birth controls a very good example it the the information for women at female athletes or even just hard exercisers you i have to be compettered bounty around what is worth control doing what types how should i manage that what conversations should i be having with my doctor almost nothing women have nothing to go on for high performance what if ism trying to compete in event or or run a rays how all those types of questions should be answered a normal value normal of data i perform us testing i it is just not there on the female that is an marry i i think ti if somebody really wanted to make a change that the sciences want to do it i know have talk to many in our field that would really love to explore it o because it is getting there the teeth tie us sat the coaching side it is getting there their seen that they're hiring these people ism seen in in my students i they on my my followings is not all men tit gits very large percentage of females and all i do as most about excite science this all i do will this pard best is a very we know very clearly the audience o is fifty per cent women fifty per cent men that is runs which is great just to jump back at our history discussion and to finish that point o where r at now an where i think we are going to go or should go we walk through the body building count of running everything and people walking into a him any time they lift awaits the the making all their choices based in the assumption that maximizing muscle size is the gold and clearly that is not the case er other adaptations you may be after we talked about how that had problems than we talked about how somebotyese other forms of exercise filled those gaps and then what problems those things introduce well i think we are actually at a point were the pendulum is kind of slowly shifting into the middle what i mean by that is if you want to maxims muscle strength we look towards the power lifting community you want to maximize muscle power orbit look the waylifting community we want to look for muscular endurance r well proteins maybe we look in the cross communities and somebody's obstacle course races or functionalitything what we can do now its generate protocols that get us the exact adaptations we want and not ones we do not want because we can look back at each of these different styles of training and pick and these optime protocols or combinations for them somebody is simply wants to get healthy we talked about when we listed the nine adaptations and i mentioned health was not one of them that is because what determines your health verse is what determines my ostomy health differs if i need more hypertrophy i can look towards body building concepts but if i have enough or maybe for personal reasons i decide i have too much i do not want to add any more then i can say eight how can i get stronger without getting bigger and bore my look words airlifting concepts how can i get more powerful how can i get faster but i do not ta now again want to lose fat o agree or if i want physique changes we have all these different areas we can pick and choose from that have expertise in specific adaptations and develop ourselves perfect protocols a based on that information it'd to take a brief break to acknowledge our sponsor inside tracker inside trackers a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood ending e to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals have long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason than many of the factors that impact your immediate and long turn health and well being can only be analyzed from a quality blood tests one issue with a lot of blood testantyanatus out there however is that you get information back about serious levels of lipids and hormones an metabolic factors et camera but you do not know what to do with that information inside tracker makes knowing what to do with all that information exceedingly easy they have a personalized platform that lets you see what your sips i numbers are of course but then also what sorts of behavior old dues and dots what sorts of nutritional changes what sorts of supplementation would allow you to bring those levels into the ranges that are optimal for you if you to try inside tracker you can visit inside tracker dot calm slash supermen to get twenty per sent off any of inside trackers plans again that is inside tracker dot calm slash supermen to get twenty per cent off with the understanding in mine as to how we all myself included arrived it such lopsided fitness too much endurance not enough strength too much strength not enough endurance it's really hard to imagine any one's perfect in this regard can you walk us through the nine different adaptations that you mentioned earlier and give us away to a less our level of ability or our level of adaptation in each of those nine are it the very first one we want to talk about is is movement skill now set aside sport specific o ism not goingogiveoug a sentiment for optical golf technique swing is is really about human movements to the you stay injury free and you can continue to train for as long as possible war o the minimerequirements now if you can have access a highly qualified physical therapist or movement specialist that is the best rout right go to them have them identify all of your movement patterns overhead press in squatting running all these things that is your gold standard if you want to do it yourself though here's a very simple foretupsolution the way that i it teach us is go joint by joint and i i think of this just as the major ones your shoulder your elbow your low back hip knee and ankle now what you can do is do a representative movement for you if you venture lot use the but if you do pull ups house so pull up if you squat do that i would recommend doing an upper body press an upper body pull a lower body press lower body pull an example would be a push up a pull up or a bent row a squat an then a deadline now would be a very very well r sounded approach what you are going to do is do that movement and would record it for yourself and in record affront of you and a side view i probably do three the ten repetitions our angle of slow in control you do not need me bodywayht what you want to do is move and you want o look for four key things at every joint it i again imagine of doing a squat ism in tor do a squat am in a focus on just my ankle an't a look for these four things of the ankle and then an ism n to go back and watch my knee and look for these same four things the see to the hip et camera right where these for things number one as you want to look for symmetry symmetry is front to back left or right and a your right limb in your left him and we we want to look for or and if they are not moving perfectly that is fine but you want to see is one moving further ahead than the other one is one a turning to the side one's it is one fidgeting in and twitching around differently you want to look just o check to see and make sure that their stable that is one ism number two you want look for stability key indicators here are things if you if you cannot construe a a squat a controlled squat where your knees do not start shaking i that would be an instability issue can you do the movement slow can you posit the bat a may be three seconds may be five seconds or ten you should have complete control of that movement at all of these joints ism are your hip sliding ones side when you stand up is one elbow closer to your body when you are benching an the other one's more flared out these a the things ism talking about right ism not worried about what angle they should be at or not you are simply looking for a symmetries or instabilities re u again as you are pushing up toes one elbow start flipping and twitching and going all of the place the third one is what i call awareness a there are lot of movement technique issues that are simply people do not know and you will watch them squat i do this on my classes all the time it'll have a hundred kiss out their squatting and you will we some horrible squat technique and when you just tell them ay did you realize your heels are supposed to be on the ground all times in you squat oh and they can correct it is not actually movement lot it was just simply an awareness i did not know and then i actually did not realize that that was happening that positions we want all of our joints to be going through a general full range of motion which is number for the ankles a doing a squat your knee should beagle to go far over your tests possible will maintaining good position your feet flat on the floor your you three points of contact your whole foot foot andyou are not compromising another joint that is all your going to look for those four things symmetry stability awareness and range of motion through each joint teach movement it sounds a difficult and time custom it is really not you can generally kin o clear these things in one or two repetitions in a couple of seconds and what you are really going to look for this lots of scoring schemes you can ye basket physicaltherapus ass or you i just look for abs all terrible i cannot do it at all minor flaw or pretty close to get that that is really all am looking for some mice going sister o zero one three zero is you are not going to do this exercise came you are at a very high acute rest you might get her on rep one to morrow never one i a score of one is there is a minor fly here we can probably do it but we need to be cautious of load and volume another one is maybe it is perfect maybe it is not but go ahead and to do it on a reasonable photo call you'll be fine ism that is generally what you need to do is a cost free method of identifying good movement technique within any the things that you would do what about speed actually do not think this is one most people should test if you are high performance outlay we can front a forty a dash or we can do i some different things with a velocity transducer on a bar bell if your weight lift or something for most people pure speed is really maximum velocity or acceleration or con the two ways we break it down it is not telling not that necessary o test what about number three power which i believe before you told me was speed times force the reason why i do not worry too much about speed is because you can infer a lot of it from y power test and a power test is easier to do as well as easier to train for for most people the the story version here is a simple broad jump this is stand a with n normal position jump out as far in front of yous to possibly can a measure the distance between were you started and the back of your heel where it lands a superbasic number to look for there is your height you so build a broad jump how tall you are if you are five foot five you should at five five six foot five et camera it is not perfect ism that is going a rate it down a little bit about fifteen per cent for females they dissimply do not have the power in general that men have not you can want to bring that down a little bit but that is a is a very crude number if you were to look at a high perform and a fell player if there six feet tall there can be jumping nine to tan to eleven feet if you can jump your body height wield not look in for optimization and this particular test what you are looking for red flags if you can jump your body height you are onto be just fine that is incredibly straight forward and yet have one question yep ism assuming that i can squat down as low as i need to before i jump i can swing my arms from back to front as harder with as much momentum i as i can muster and when i land you said i men to take the measure from where the back my heels you can a measure the distance you actually covered clarify there is no running approach here there is no a steps in to it you are ta stand at a still ya you can swing bounds as much as you to do you get a projectile offs you can a measure the distance from the tip your to basely stand behind the line and then the furthest point back were you land basely the worst possible score not the best possible i cause your feet will not land symmetrically one's probing it to belittle it for our the n now technically if you fall backwards in your hand touches the ground we mark that number by in this case just use the furthest point back of your back yell go from there it'll be drying it to morrow morning now if you have access to little bit more technology or you just really want a know i better number a a classic vertical jump it is a good starting place you can actually do this in a simple copper way you can just measure to your hands put them to gather that both of your a middle fingers are touching overlap them and put them directly over your head ah and you cone on reach up as high as you can get and you mark that on the wall my brother and i use to do this all the time we would take a a high lighter the the yellow ones and culler as much as we con on our finger tips touch the wall that the high lighter would staying the wall if you actually go back to my house for my childhood you will see these markers all over our our house ism sure apparent rthrby dad did not cere single that he did not care is this whatever you give donor one you want ta measure that and then of course you are going to jump with those two hands and touch besides you can up and you it ta measure the distance between your standing reach and the actual highly you jump there now the reason you are doing it two handed by the way is because if you do one handed you can actually reach pretty high by off setting your shoulders and now you are getting into differences of who has more shoulder mobility who has ability to can get up there a two foot stand a two hand to standard approach is here i same thing no running approach here you can dip you can drive you can an do all those things you can swing your arms but youregingto be a two handed touch as it is a general item do that and you want to look for a number of something twenty four inches or higher if if you are pass the age of fifty that number can come down a little bit to closer to twenty and a gain for females it is can o be watched down about fifteen per cent every in to go if you are a a middle aged female and you are jumping twenty inches you are euare'n a pretest spot ism you gingko be looking really i said now if you can do that on a force plate that is even better these are very basely scales that will go out to multiple ridges sometimes five to nine midgets passes hereroll and you ut stand these things you do exact sanest and these are very interesting because they'll tell you not only how high you jump but they will tell you how much force you put in the ground they can also tell you how long it took you this call your rate of force development as well as impulse and speed to bunch to other stuff which are our important to help you understand were on the power spectrum you need to be you would do that in addition to using some sort of velocity transducer on a barbell a very classic thing to do would be let us say your in to do a squat and your get to put this a device on the bar bell and you and that is gingko measure the speed which the barbell moves and you get to do that at forty per cent of your one repetition acts fifty per cent sixty per cent seventy eighty nine you up to hundred and that allows you de greet what is called a force velocity curve and you can start to see at what point when you start loading things heavy you start slowing down too much and that will tell you what pa t of the force velocity curve that you want a training to optimize your power why that's important a lot of people will do things when ism trying for power how heavy should i left we the general answer people say is thirty per cent of your one man but that is actually not true at all what is most optimal for power development which will discuss more much later is depending on where your food in the first velocity or if you have access to technology that that can give you lot for inside information if not do the broad jump test or the highlighter on your finger tips and jump at tuts the all test at and yelps i my is you not come along as already the walls are already must up just go had come up to washington will do it fantastic what about strength right strength is really important you need to measure this in a in multiplareas and we will start off with grip strong gape you can do this in two ways i you can buy a hand grip dynamometer now these are anywhere between twenty to a hundred dollars anywhere the actual used to be risen school hundreds of dollars and now you can lithely buy them on anywabside for twenty five boys my last recommendation is technically that is not costly i know your whole thing about the compare protocol but twenty five boy some call in that basely mystery i you can bring that in testa and as that is a little device where you can squeeze and your a d and i would do your right hand and your left can i you want a look for a symmetries there but you want to look for something typically those or therein to give you a value in kilograms and a you want t look for something a minimum score here of forty kilograms ideally you are out past sixty would be a really good spot to bean you want to make sure that there is no less than ten per cent variation between your left and right hand you are you are non dominant hand actually should not be that much weaker an neatest what you'll actually my lot ofttimes as the non dominant can be often time stronger ism because the dominant hand is more for movement precision writing things that you want them to be close i if you are a male and you're under forty kilograms on a hand grip inaeumometer were were need to train that if your female it is not that much lower but about thirty five kilograms is the cot off point if you are above fifty five we can add a tree training but ism not worried about leaving it out to your training if your female if it is about fifty that is my sort of cat off were won ago that is a fairly cheap one another onethat you can nectar do is is a dead hang you can hold on to any bar ideally one that is thin enough to where you can wrap your whole hand around it you do not want to be using a a giant fat grip i your have a false reading here something going to the him and jumping on any pull up bar or a pull up rack you ant a hang an this is a simple time test in general we we should be able to hang for a minimum of thirty seconds as what we are what we are looking for thirty to kind of fifty seconds is my good but we could probably get better here if you are cruise above sixty seconds ism generally pretty happy i this actually y a good example of when females and t o be better gripstrength and women is tends to be strong they can hang for quite a long time i they will still standers do not really change that much for women now if you are exceptional large this thing does not scale perfectly ye if you are two hundred forty pounds and even if you are lean its just hard the to hang and hold two and or forty pounds conversely if your hundred forty did five pounds even if you are unhealthy you are going to build to hang for long time that is is not that much weight to carry yo just rough numbers that is to start off with that is grip strings what about strength elsewhere in the body the primary as you can do an upper body strong test if you old although it is not technically something we do very often happy to do it one i maxpench presser something that that's right i the more not ism generally more interested in is a leg extension test and the reason i this is a back squat is better a marble back squat is look that is my that is my jam that is my life right is this very technically demanding and it it is challenging you need spotters you need confer i a lockages in this for for the average person a leg extension test is fairly standardized you to to work about technique and people can just get into it and go and what you want to look for there is is a a couple of standards you want ta hit a gain a very simple answer here is bodyweight can you do a leg extension with your bodyweght one repetition one repetition i can answer that right now can you no you cannot no i can had squat a reasonable man o weight but in us on the leg extension this morning an night is a nautilus mace machine and i certainly could not let it'll nature my byway lame ate molar for were you doing a single leg no bile out er you cannot leg since you body i know what i certainly can hamstring colonel my bodywight o c we may we have some ism deficiencies are quads it we need to go after yo but that that is a pretty good number you want to be at if you go up an age past edge forty every decade that can come down about ten per cent and you will till be in a pretty good slot if you are fifty years old and you are a hundred and seventy pounds if you can do one sixty year a pretty good sir a spot and then you go us again take it down about ten per cent every debate after forty but prior to forty there is really no change in strength i but certainly somebody in there forties to fifties should be able the leg extension their bodyweight nodi i look for to our discussion a bit later i talk o about how to build strength yet another strength ten they do not have to be done to a technical true one rat man you can use what are called re petition a conversion at equation but on a load that you think is kind of clothes to your maximum and just do it for as many rats as you cant as long as it is under five raps total you can then actually go on line and enter that into any number of calculators anywhere and it will tell you o cate you did three re petitions at two hundred pounds you are one rep man is probably two hundred fifteen whatever there is estimate equation if you do not want to spend the time are you no t truly comfortable absolutely going to your true when i man just get to a number that is fairly close and do as many as you can and then go on a line again one get man estimator equations are everywhere ism if you get past five repetitions or the accuracy of those equation starts going down do not put on something a got did twelve rests of it and then try to figure out your one i man it will get clothes you start moving past that you just getting worse and worse and worse accuracy i want to make sure whether you down the leg extension test or a front shut test you do not technically have to do an about one ran man ism if neither of those are adoption another one i a lot here it simply a front squat or a dobla squat hold you are to hold to weight in front of your chest whether a kettlebellis as grated here a unwell is fine here and you wan to hold about half of your bodyweight go all the way to the bottom position and try to hold that for about forty five seconds it it is a pretty good indicator of ism number on your position it is hard to be in a bad position for that long at that load as well as core strength and low bags to billy it is a very different indicator ism then say the leggy sentient test but its it is a really nice one it does not require many moving parts it is more difficult than leg extension but it is it is quite a bit more functional and it is can tot given in sight into a lot more areas than just the quatroseps forty five seconds down at the bottom of the squat yet and then returning to a standing position yet in if you cannot do the return i actually at ism not that worried but as long as you can hold that good position without a technical break down in that forty five seconds that is a really good spot ism scan into i want a third of your bodyweight for thirty seconds trifid i planned to attempt all of those strength tests very soon what about hypertrophy sure ism action before we get into that i want a jump backwardly quickly it is important to add a couple of carrots to the strength strengths of there is too that i want number one these are assuming you are a technically proficient i do not want you to do any exercise to exhaustion or to maximum strength if you are not comfortable with your technic a just these accordingly if you are not comfortable with the front squat do the like extension if for i don't comfortabwith that do something different we never want to utilize maximum testing if it is going to come with e consequence a a sere secure entry that is the most important fie the second one is you are warm up protocol we will have a huge a fact on your actual results and whenever you do these test especially you aregongto do a test andthn i test again down the line you want to make sure that that warm up protocol is standardize now again the ease and i in we can i can give you resources has specific guides for exactly what to do for your warm up protocol prior to one i man testing we can go there and you can look that stuff up we can have that to show utter something yet i think i when we get into a deeper discussion about strength and hypertrophy and resistance training in general if we you touch into the at the best warm up critical i know i have mine and ism a certain it is can't be subtitle bis not everything every that is how is not every o conversation were ever had where i learn all the things underling in correctly but i do make changes on the basis of what you tell it is not in correctly much as it is suboptable the three kind way of telling it is in correct thank you a what about my perjure there thing you ant t pay attention to here is you have the esthetic a portion of hyper that is entirely up to you there is no rational you can decide what you feel looks good or does not look good that is irrelevantthere is a sufficient about you need to have where below that is detrimental to your health regardless of your out comes and the best way to do this is a couple of ways any sort of body composition test it can do this whether this is a a scan a the a decks o scan which is a gold standard or other a ways of biological a dialectical impedance or otherways there is a ton of different test you get there pretty close what you want to pay attention to when you get a sex o scant is a number called f f m i and that sands for fat free mass and decks you can look at again any number of on line calculators these are all standard does not actually matter when you pull hem up you off to worry about looking up and wether not it is right or not or something and that is an actually ell you if you have sufficient muscle mat and a number you want to look for in general of something if your man you are f f am i should be something twenty or higher if you are woman you want look for something eighteen that that is the targets if you get pass twenty four twenty five for a man that is a lot of muscle mass assuming your reasonably lean now if you are f of mi is twenty four twenty five but your body fat is forty per cent you are actually just a very very large individual you are not you are not n a going to gray spot when we say these sort of numbers it she assumption that you are probably sub thirty per cent body fat for a man in sub thirty five for a woman those the numbers there are on calculators all you really need to know is your total body weight your body fat per centare and then your height you a answer those three numbers and then they will tell you your f if mi scoring l correct for unadjusted value then most those will actually tell you the greeting rubric in them si good average bat et camera but those the numbers we look at if you are as a man sub seventeen as a woman sub fifteen aware an area of of pretty severe physiological detriment for insufficient muscle and some of our latter discretion will talk about why that matters that is not am sub seventeen per cent body fat this is specifically the f f m ai that is a correct yet what about muscular endurance is this wren tell me an you do wallets this is really nice you can to any number of tests here a a standard plank it is a good testament of of muscandurant can you hold a front plank for sixty seconds can you hold a side plank for forty five seconds pretty easy if you are able to do a push up if you cannot that sort of tells you lone it is actually interesting if you cannot do a single push up that is not a muscat durance is due tonsectualy now strength as you cause it is a one to man problem m we want to be able to do for again for a general male we should have no rob doing twenty five plus consecutive push ups i apologize for interrupting you but as long as we are big about pushups just mention form are we talking chest touching the ground a elbows breaking right angles what is a proper push up according to you are laboratory unless you have a very specific reason to limit range of motion i want all my testing done through a full joint range of motion i this is different for the person it is individualize to them but in general for a push up this would be a full complete lock out of the elbows on the top and a full chest touch or close to it at the ground you can do it different it does not really matter but just keep i standard from your pretest your poshest if you are trying to mark progress a but for us unless we have a very specific reason we are going full arrange of motion for all these us twenty five push t a fire males for a male it is a standard and even something ten is a number were looking for again is con o minimum categories i for an upper body muster n durance and not to get two down in the weeds but a i have observed other people course number myself not ism getting but observed other people pausing at am maybe at repetition fifteen catching their breath and then continuing or you that man be a say like is a a piston that would be a fail to no pauses correct just up down up down an trying to get yet least ten but i really twenty five i learned this lesson in one of our studies ill probably nine years ago we we did not clarify that and we actually had an individual he was not pheasant he was not being a various he just figured out if i do a couple take a quick break into a cup he quadruple his hottest result from his pretest result because he figured out that little hack you want a standardize it it is not that ism against or have some sort of strong belief it is just trying to keep political standardize and which means any break fell test ten to twenty five push ups minimum for males what a out for to else if a if it is subteen for a man that is again in you are very severe red flag problem we really we to see a number above twenty five looking that that is wherwere anchor anything between tween ten and twenty five is e ye but not severe it means they have work to do we have work to conifer and for females for i female you a skill that sort of back a female the answer could be little zero i see yogin to see that can you do a full opposition if there in that position we are generally not going to do a muscat n durinstest from the knees we were to know the answer is heres here i we will actually to fall to another test wit it'll talk about in a second were for those of those folks any that is in a skaledoun it right basely you looking at fifteen is that marker twenty five on for the man where i want to see above fifteen and if i do wore good anything between five to fifteen is ha number of o k if your sub five i wed wed generally have some problems and if that is different between one and zero than i now we zeros is is a problem we should big to do that use female can not do ten full pushups yet ten for pushups is hard for a female depending on sins o cay lout say a female cannot do five full pushups she said rather than go to an geese down version what would you do to assess their muscular endurance and would you then also encourage them to work on their strength well but absolute again if they cannot do they can do anything less in three i you re o be staring the fact if you want to look at muscat en durance in general this is a bit of a off topic ben a promise on keep short not come right back when i was a doctor student had a two playmates one of em was a runner e female a hundred twenty pounds something that small en the one was a male and he was was we a straight pro he lifts weights thousand do any others for of training t does a very classic not training program but cannetrane and they were sort of bantering back and forth for a while and based she was saying you are unfit you cannot run at all and he saying your week you cannot do a pulled ads they challenge each other to competition as said at the end of the year the girl is going to do twenty six pullups and the guy had to run a marathon twenty six miles that was the thing another there as some sort of consequence for whoever sorta failed til the guy quickly try to forgot how hl mi can run twenty six miles when i have not run a mile and many many many years we just armed running you three miles for miles whatever she what course they both of ran neatly to me right t she was how they hell i cannot do a pull and i was great and i gave her very specific maximal strength photo callant she was wo i want to go to the assisted pullet machine and work on doing puts a twenty five as have got to get my muscat an durance up and i try to explain to her you are muscly endurance is or relevant if you cannot do on it is never going to matter she did the muscular durance protocol the entire thing did not listen to me the end of the year came she still produced exactly zero pullups point is if you look at muscat endurance where is it a strength and wears at action muscat en durance the general sort of number that you are looking for is under eighty per cent i that is on to tell you as this a muscat n durance problem or is an out strength problem under ye per ended one re petition ye yet what i mean by that is this in fact the aculeus in your question the other way to as less muscat endurance is take the exact strength test you did from the the talk five minutes go what which when did you do old that to seventy five per cent and then do that for as many repetitions as you can and that is a tremendous barometer of muscat an durance if you were able to do two hundred pounds on your leg extension tests but seventy five per cent tat and y that is many a you can you want to look for more than eight repetitions if you are below a repetitions then we have a muscular endurance problem if it i if it is higher than that if you got fifteen or twenty then we know we have probably some problems an your peak strength or the test itself that is a good eight to twelve sort of number it is where you ant to be looking at to for her what about an robot capacity this one's more challenging either have to got laboratory and do something a windage tests this is a thirty second maximum am test where your going to see how much work can you possibly do in that thirty seconds if you do not have a lad us as to laboratory you can you can do this on any any protocol you want yo this fund be sprinting this can be on alike an air bite this could be on a rower anything that anything where you can exert maxima effort and you do not after ward about technical problem i generally do not to do things a cattle bell swing or something thither just woman other variables you need to be able to goes hardest you possibly can knowing you are going to get to a place of tremendous fatigue now in ta lab we often use wat called a boss protocol and you'egong to stand in a force plate your on to do as many vertical jumps as fast as you can as high as you can for sixty seconds and your absolutely destroyed by second forty five e either use that when get protocol or that boss protocol if you want the again take any o those other places thirty seconds or up to forty five seconds up to men if you on it does not rally matter and you just mark down the distance you cover that is all you we do not really have standard for these things because it is going to be different how far you can traveling thirty seconds on a treadmill it is is can be different than sprinting in the field or on the assault big or whatever a while you really want to worry about there is can you complete it and then how awful do you feel afterwards what what you really want o think about here is not those protocols but this you want to think about can you get close to your predicted maximum heartright the the number we throughout is two hundred and twenty minus your age if you are fifty years old two twenty minus fifty you should be able to get to a maximum heartwrihter round one seventy beasts percent now that number is extremely generic if you do not get there that does not have any indication of your business you get higher that does not mean you are any more fit it is just a rough number here is what ism what i want youth do in this case your heartright recovery is the better metric i want you to get up to a maximum heartright and then test your heartraght recovery and what you should be looking for there is about half a beat a recovery per second you are gingko get up to a place where you reach absolute terrible exhaustion maximum fatigue test your heartright and then count right have a time er going within sixty seconds you should have again at half a beat per second you should have a harry recovery of thirty beasts per men within the next the next minute to in recovery t should begin half that sixty beats those are rough numbers to go by and your three minute recovery is again half about again that is the closest way if your harry recovery is worse than that then we know we have a problem in your araroba capacity or your carnivascopassy love it what about number eight maximal heart rate bed's what you just describe sones a lot maximal hart i this is your view to man the gold standard here is to actually go into a laboratory and get this thing done we can act your run of evil to man less where you put a mass on clocked all your gases and run you to there and there is a very specific photo call for a completion of a a true maximum test and is scientist will know that if you do not have access to that you can do a couple of test one of em is called a twelve minute coopers test this is simply time you can a run for twelve minutes as far as you can and you can record the distance you covered again you can go on line to any a any number of of calculators enter the distance in and that will tell you your proximo i estimate veal to man that is a twelve minute sprint twelve minutes rent maximum distance you can cover in twelve minutes keeping a steady pace the whole time or go what every want the goal is to get maximum if discovered in twelve minutes that is anywhere between a mile to two plus miles e baying o half it you are but you just do that coop for twelve minute test got it i told you if you remember it a robe of capacity is eight to twelve sort of minutes where you are gin to see a real true test of that veal to man you simply cannot get that ism in under a few minutes it is it is a the if you want you can do a little gentler version of that i there are a number of sub maximal less there in fact there is a one mile lock test you can do again all your going to do is in this case you have to have some sort of either a stop watch or ideally hart a monster an all you have to do as is is a rock for one mile some maximal test is you can a walk a mile record the time record your hart rate at the end enter those in and those wild give you again estimates of refuse to man that is the o my gosh i cannot run for twelve minutes as hard as i pass we can or an want to do it or i we have a lot of hes in our executive program a see my knee hurts to bad have got back pain when i run whatever can i look and you do walk is and it is pretty accurate if you do a correctly technically all you have fact to do is measure your heart rate on your you no can count sixty seconds but its is easier to work with everyone is watches and stuff now to swear to hart my monitor plug in those numbers i at again those are all standard a calculations anywhere you find those i you ought to worry about the source you just enter your stuff fin in there can be running out the same occasion the id of the twelve minute run i many give it a shot sit for for years we do to one mile version of this and o this is a lot more science on the cupetomi could protest we did that it is pretty good and it is not even remotely close to fine it sounds fun for other reasons ye well it is it it were fun in the sense that it reveals a lot yet powerful potent super there is no hiding you can hide with a leggy center test it does not hurt that pat but you you can not feel anything but the twelve minute run as far as you can test these are really actually si psychiatric diagnostic test are of source number nine long duration steady state yet exercise i think of this as a a endurance but as you mention before there are other forms of endurance londration steady state exercise yet you really want a think about this as not a standard number this is you should maintain consistent work out put for over twenty plussmenites e and this one i want you to spick something that it was in your lifestyle is there a loop around your house that you can do is there some photo call that you you to use it for and you are simply going to test your ability can you maintain work without stopping that is all it needs to be now ideally i person to throw little twisting here which is can you do this with nasal breathing only that is what i feel really good if you can go thirty straight minutes without needing to take a break ism walking does not really cut i unless you are very very unfit in which case if waking thirty minutes without a break is a challenge oke i there but if you can i want you moving at a non walking pace i do not care what zone this is to three four or five i do not care sonly you can maintain minimum of twenty minutes of work with no breaks no intervals no downtime and i gan ideally breathing though your nose only i love this list but it worries me a bit not because any one of these tests is necessarily that overwhelming but because ism unclear about how to arrange performance of these different tests for instance do i separate them ism doing one last long duration out put on one day and ism doing strength on another day those seem pretty obvious to me but rather once that one can combine on different days how much time should one give oneself in between these tests and how often should one do in assessment just as we do not want in the sarilyes valuate body changes by getting on the scale three times to day m once a day at the same time each day is more practical how often should we be assessing our fitness for each in every one of these well the way that i would say this is you want to pick the one that is the worst and do that more quickly if for example you do the upper body strength test and you are fantastic if you can bench rest double your body t i do not need to test your bench very often for the average person not a power after but maybe once a years may be not even that we just do not new o get there however if we then test your your view of two man and in your twelve minutes you cover a total of a half a mile then we might wont to test that every month and we are got to let our priorities emphasize which one we are going to do mar often i would recommend doing this full battery once a year for batter yo mean the entirelist on one theentire not one day but within a week you could take a week now you could do these technically all in two days a three days split here it is probably best if you were to dis a hay this is testing week actually love this for beginning in the year i whatever it is a you sort of change your training but think it once a year just once a year you should probably go to a physician and get full blood work i a full o heart scan and in everything that i and then if maybeyou had heartishother come back in attest you or frequently whatever the cases right you should probably run through this and you arguing to be thinking the rabbit i do not want ta i give up on my exercise ting that week well i promise you you are not going to finish this week and think i did not do very much work this week it is it is get ta feel great and then you recon have a very nice barometer of exactly where you need to change and and prior to your training for the next quarter half a year or wherever you want to go if you want act you do this every six month that is real we and o back you down this quite no thing more every six months as a general i test that is a really good way to do but if if minimum if your argue with me give me once a year you don't do this which order to do them an the non fatiguing test you can do whenever this is the the body composition scan the effing and my the body fat composition all this stuff can be done never i generally to do that though as your very first activity the reason is we know that a cue d exercise can heavily infamous things body composition measurements because of sinful inflammation water store to tetra it is easiest o list sort of get that off of a fortnight hour rest you want to make sure you do not do any hard exercise the day before a body composition test and probably fortnight hours before that just start yourself off for that your movement test can be the same thing i you do not want to try to do a a sentiment of how well your squatting if you are incredibly sore from your your brutal squire to ten to do those things when you are the most fresh then what you want to do is any skill or maximum strength or power goes at the very beginning of the day any fatiguing thing happens at the end and you could easily do this all right ism going to do my power test my broad jump right you are not can be fatigued at all from that and on the same day since ism already pretty warm up now in a roll right into my leg strength test and since ism really warmed up ism going to do my leg muscular an turn less right there since is a very comonstratagyou we use would do our one r at man leg extension five minutes seven minutes water we need to do come back loath to seventy five per and do as many raps as you can we you could roll right into then your upper body test or your grip strength test or anything else a you want to do there i is there a little bit of influence ye but really for most people it is not the bad a what influence i mean if you do a leg strength test coming back on doing an upper body strength test afterwards it is not that big deal give yourself fifteen yourself twenty meets keep plenty time you can nock out your strength testing in rasconrndrance testing all in one day that could be you could do your performance i your skill diagnostic your power jump test your strength and your muscat durance and all that suffix knocked out you are going to have to come back on a separate day and do your anerobic test this is thirty seconds maximondurance things that you could though if you wanted do that after you are long duration test you longguration test as and as is can a function as a i be warm up or you could loot those things or you do them on separate days you going to have to do your veal to attests on its own day for the most part unless you wanted to do again your movement or your body composition sort of before those things i you really have the ability to kind of mix and match ideally this most realistically probably takes three days if you ant to separate them into four or five the more separation you do the better dafter you i get it is just a question of how how pedantic are you really trying to get here and are you willing to lose five per cent to then say the whole day then you can do sort of things and multiple stacks that is that is how i would break up what ism hearing is better to do it than to not do it most definite and be rational don to a do not try and do your strength output late in the day when your fatigued if you are going to combine with some of the instead sateen durance in a maximal heart rate fine understand there may be a slight defies it there but tested the same way each time in what you really looking for is improvement yet and you can also do the array recovery under any a optic yo you o the hartright recovery ism after you veal to man as well you finish that thing and then just a against the same test for up toe three months these a fantastic tools ism almost tempted to say that ism willing to post my numbers but that actually violates the o door principal the think we are getting out here which is that it is highly unlikely that anybody is going to be phenomenal across the board am in certainly there will be individuals that a but base on everything we talked about earlier specificity of training and i how extensively somebody is been training a certain way will without question topside them if you will yet toward being better in some of these assastiments and less good in others and that is just simply the way that these adaptations work yet and it is not you do not need to be optimal in all these areas to be quoting optimal health from this perspective you just want to make sure again there is no severe per romance anchors s what we call them right the we will not want any these severe constraints cause you are going to get limited by that thing and you want to do as move that up to just sufficient or concerning and get it away from that if you do that that things i can catch you you can be able to continue to pursue pursue optimization an any the one things t at you have a specific passion for which is gently what moves people right you you train i you feel better you train because therefore all these benefits to it and in jest this audience probably could list hundreds of them but you also train because you generally to get better at something a lot of us that have something and you want to make sure thatyou are not gone have i know your good endurance but you really should training more we do not want that message not at all i want you to love your training we just want to make sure that you are not loving that much that you are not taking some blinders off and missing another area which would actually again you pull that performance hinder this whole ship sails faster with less effort and less friction what i love about this is also that as you have described it it is not just for athletes or people that are superinto fitness it is also for people that just want to be healthy and want esthetic changes and that is why they are exercise in which i think accounts for really large percentage of people out there and i think of what you described is it incredibly well structured incredibly clear and incredibly actionable i want to thank you for that i serious about my willingness to do this and at least share those numbers with you and i think for most people that are seeking what you listed ox before esthetic changes functionality in longevity it is clear that all nine of these are going to be important in summer actor another before we close out i want to go back and finish off the metrics for reveal two max's and don't actually think i gave you numbers on that in general for men a minimum number we want to look but here is thirty five mill leaders per hologram per minute and for women that be about thirty were can actually push a lot higher on those things in reality i want to see men above fifty if i could just interrupt you for a second when you say forty millers per kilogram millers of what specifically yes what act those metrics mean is the first one mill leaders is oxygen such a mount of oxygen kilograms is body weight it is how much on can you bring in per kilogram of byway per minute is a volume of oxygen per your size in a time duration in fact the way that you calculated i is you multiply your cardiac carpet by whats tell your avid two difference your carry caput is your heart rate times your stroke volume how much a blood your pumping out per pump as your stroke volume how many times your pumping or your beating you multiply that by your avid two difference you we o two difference is artery mine is vain difference the mount of oxygen in your arteries mine is the amount of option your vain which is going to tell you how much you took up in your capillaries in your muscles you take those two factors moltipime to gather and there is our view two acts you knows you were describing that i imagine you getting to an efimori machine and seeing that equation lighting up in your brain cause clearly it is committed to memory very well thank you for that clear description yet to finish those numbers i i really truly want to see some a man above fifty n ism not even really stoked until i get above fifty five in fact it is sort of funny have costly whose lab i did my page and he was retired by the time but he he is again what he is legendary figures an exercise physiology ism started in the seventies he would always say there is no human excuse to be below sixty which i always always damn l that is really actually pretty hard to get to if ye but was he oh yes dear e now he still actually setting world records in these last couple of years and is all the master's records for swimming and recycling is some he was a supersuperfit guy i he was always above sit he's probably fifty something now even oh he is now eighty or whatever eight years all year with f the o two acts of fifty's probably really not fifty's probably but he is probably going to member that earlier in the we talked about i have the ninety two year old by the view two mat of thirty right they'd probing to break that record when he gets there ism sure ism s i gan in fact i grin to you he has that number in his brain have a talked him in fifteen years but i guarantee that number is in his brain and he is probably training for it i love it and i love it because it proves that exercise pays off oh yet it is one of the few things in life where the is a direct relationship between work and outcome yet that is as henry crawling described in his wonderful essay if you are familiar with that oh my got or you are unfrock i henry assure i mat i certainly know who he is and saw his he has work an incredible one page a paper sort of something to do with the iron any basely describes that as this is the one thing where it is truth it is the most true thing you will ever do i which is y love for that i it is almost a principle of nature hon er present yet with with the women i really want to see the women if i want to see men above fifty five i really want we when above fifty is the target in if you your there ism pretty goods you can do the math on then the middle ground of what is o k but we need o work on it in fact if you look across the literature i different athletes you arguing to see the the really high level endurance folks you they may past seventy or eighty in fact i there was talk a few years ago f o guy breaking a hundred a is an eighteen or nineteen year old but i action do not think was ever fully confirmed repeated but certainly you will see plenty of people ninety five i in those extremes if you look at other sports football or basketball there probably going to be in the fifty five sixty five sort a rain if you is an average person or fifty five i that is a really good marker to be in if you get even close to that you are a good shot i ism sorry if i let you down have it just look out you describing this average perusing ligan me with disallow bit of sympathy laugh if you if you reach the standard of average drew a listen you are giving me prompts all over the place to try and a improve my metrics whatever they happen to be and i think that is one of the great values of getting objective numbers the even if they have to be measured by someone's back to the envelope techniques that am at is we always teach people in the laboratory right that a tool can be a not extremely precise but as long as it is reliable corderyis still value there and of course you would love to have the most precise and most reliable tool but if you cannot then at least go for a reliable tool and measure for consistency yet for the real world reliability be felicity is as much as we can for lot of things were talking about especially for using it as a metric of did i get better as long as that tools reliable a body composition is all these things have inherent error and some of them are smaller some them are larger but as you mention having standardization with an attesting protocol is can allow you to measure progress anus i tell you weareout a now that we sort of cover all the these fairies of adaptation we walk the history we walk through a bunch of the explanations for we people or are maybe not getting the results that they wanton get though their training the way i would to go withe rest of our conversations would be to just go through each of those adaptations step by step and make sure i cover very specific protocols for if you have run through this testing and identified an airy of weakness maybe you have sort of been lifting a lot could you lifting in you maybe realize that your party ofvascerfitness or your hart my recoveries not where really should be or the opposite we talk about maybe you're doing a lot of that type of work and your strength is not there your rmovemalqualities not there you have identified a problem how do i specifically all the what are the evidence base and a most effective protocols that i could put myself in for each one f these categories and i think that would i give people a lot of take home value abut is can to take us some time to cover it is it is going to have to come across over multiple conversations i between you and i very on looking forward to each and all of those conversations and am i want t ad just one more metric to our discussion to day which is really just my way of saying thank you because if there were a metric for amount of useful information per sentence spoke you would be at the upper level of that metric you have this amazing ability to provide much knowledge in a clear and concise and to day listed out format that is both interesting grounded in science actionable on behalf of everyone listening and certainly for myself as well sone to say thank you why i appreciate the compliments and ism looking for to the next conversation a jumping right into speed strength and i perch re training and what the evident space and best practices for protocols in those

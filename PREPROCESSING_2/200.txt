from w easy chico it is this america life ism shown coal sitting in for i glass back when ran was in high school she had this friend josh they known each other practically since they were born their parents were friends this was in a small small city an wisconsen fun was going down to this park with buffalo in it and throwing them hunks of bread anyway iron was fifteen josh was a year older and one particular day he gave me a mix tape out a mixed sexy from just to say this was long enough ago that the word from naturally followed the word we d or talking may be two thousand seven two thousand a i can see i can see the seedy a you can see it in your minds a you mean you are not looking at it i no certainly now i can see sharp bee scribbled all over it and in sort of scrawled handwriting in squiggles is is what i what i can recall josh was into theater he and grand did place together actually musicals at this little community theater in town he was if there was a jock of feeder kids that would be hin charismatic the star of every play i really grabbing everything he could out of life an you could say wit a little bit dramatic she remembers a couple of the songs the were on a mix tor she does remember the exact number of songs for reasons that will become cabin aminigh there were twelve of the twelve songs i an dutifully pledged it into my tunes and listen to it and thin think much of it i do not know e did read in to it as i should have i mean literally literally because of what happened next mind you this next part was months after he gave her the s d solidly months ah i was i do not know pugging ran and tun's livery reorganizing something and i looking at it and it dawns on me that the song titles spell out an acrostic i love you ran i at a second yet down down the left hand side of the of the trackless thing in i tuns the the first letter of every song as you read downward spelled out i love you ran yet did iron and missed it at first because loading it into tunes somehow the blacklisting had been reversed instead of spelling out i love you ran it said mere oi evil eye not quite as romantic ho sun the still remembers one was yellow by cold clay was the why you the e at the end of love er maybe the be ginning of ran was elephant love medley from the move moulin huge which itself works a little a mistake these two characters christian and seine just curl lines from famous love songs back and forth at each other i costs s n saringottle crunchy about that one and you might think elephant love medley alone would be a dead give away but to her that was just josh being josh she said dramatic a thing about mixed tapes there the yogis of yester year you could not always be sure what the intended meaning was or if the recipient would comprehend said meaning does he love me or does he just love these songs in that way josh literally spelling it out leaving nothing to the imagination was a decent strategy except even that was lost on grand due to som due hick up in the machine it was you don't it was a at it was a lot of emotion which i felt terrible for missing even if you are not get a reciprocate at least you fee you should be getting the gesture i but i i just had not seen it he was strictly a friend you was a friend we had kind of a thing a kind of a thing yet nurseling i crash we never didst but look friends for a long time may i ask an indelicate question an you may did you ever kiss her anything a likely proudly made oi turned out to be gay the them mi have a few ran revelations for cheers to come just was not the time or gender who do right yo knew yet importantly arrow has no memory of ever telling jo she saw his secret message he was just left in the dark wondering i stayed friends moved on each other a few more times after high school but eventually lost touch have not spoken in years at this point it is funny that is something that deeply felt was communicated and received and yet remained unspoken i always thought of her her many granger she was my her mingy granger this of course is josh i did not bring up the mixed tape right away when i talked to him first i just asked him what he remembered about array she was just smart and well respected by everybody and could just talk circles around anybody and ism yet her intelligence was very intimidating to me intimidating really but in in a friendly way she would never show off about it i i had a crush on her to be honest any time i would happen to drive by her place i would i would think the one that got away i was always the feeling but ism yet we were friends josh unfortunately does not have a copy of the me tape any more either did not remember any of the songs that were on it but he did remember spelling out his devotion with the titles hews bashful about it as a lot of people would be when talking about stuff they did as a tea anger i guess i was reading i can brown and all these kind of spy things and just throwing hidden messages and to things and i was i guess i was trying to do it in my own way and you could practically hear him blushing when i told him that he had put elephant love madly on there yet that is guys i thought i was christian from e lounge ye i just loved the kind of level of seriousness he put on romantic love i always had a thing about that and clearly much much to my detriment at times honestly and here is a million ways we could psychomanalis that but ye did i did i tell her that it spelled that i no u no hope she found it o of was here is for herm brought the seedy i took josh through everything errand told after all these years he was only just now learning what happened with his little letevenshe love coat that she had seen it the message got through she just had not felt the same well o a well i guess i could not have asked for to go any better than that wat how how is that it going well well because his an a happy accident it is kind of cool that it happened in its own time i do not know i picture a love a lovelorn jo sitting sitting in his bedroom wetting underling when is she gone a ye i only then that is true as i said i was kind of intimidated by her and i think particularly at that time for errand to be the person that i would at was beyond something that seemed realistic i was you thought she was out of your league totally a i we i wanted her to know somehow on some level but i also did not on push the matter or make her feel in comfortable or i do not know i always thought she would probably turned me down i guess i just wonder i mean other than it being a sort of very pagan and one could argue in effective way of of conveying one's love to put it in a rustic on a mixed have i do not think it was ineffective ah i challenge that i think it is it is not even about if it got through and terms of a really really clear communications if it was there even if it was out of order when she first popped it in it was somehow there i think in my mind energetically and i still see the transmission even if it was can quiet in wont sent you grand but i think that right there is the power of mixed tapes when you put them together a certain way the power of music even or at least the power that we believe it have that it can confess devotion on our behalf even in the form of an exploded puzzle oven the most casual mistake that you make playlets these dit that you make for friend you are sang this is what i or sometimes this is what ism feeling right now in a way your sang this is who i am songs gathered together that or kind of parents a language the words are some one ease's but they are also our own that is what is coming up on to days up a sod kind of a mistake of its own because we have a crush on you and because the particular songs in the show tell you a surprising amount about the people listening to them can we to play for you stay with us track one just be good to me you use music to connect with other people were send a message all mind tape but there all of these other times of course when you sort of communicate with yourself through music putting on a song to reveling some feeling or feeling this er that band or singer is speaking directly to you this next collection of songs works that they are all of a piece in a way that writer neck perking really related to here is nicholl there have always been songs about cheating spouses and their lovers when women sing them they tend to be from the point of view of the disappointed and hurt wife in dolly parson's unforgettable colone she begs a woman not to take her man in smiley brown's busy confrontational woman to woman smiley lets the other woman know she is not letting her ruin her happy home but how happy can your home be if you have to call another woman and tell her it is happy songs these mete the other woman a villain with a capital we those songs were not for me i was more interested and aunty songs the songs from the point of view of the other woman they were what woman in the wrong corner of love triangle sang about finding good love in the middle of bad decisions they were old school soul and army hits that our mothers aunt's and older play cousins used to listen to with shining eyes and far away expressions holding setting glasses of drinks that were off limits to us kids we were too young to be singing those songs but we felt their power anyway we heard the longing in the singers focal acrobatics and it moved us even if we were not sure why we would hear them on the radio played during every quiet storm sometimes with dedications from dense to that special some one she says who you are and then the ultimate she chic and them as we lay by smiley medal will begin to play us song about everything that happens in the moments before your man has to go home to his wife in wether tenants songs are where we got to hear from the other woman and realize maybe she is actually a human being with emotions too were hearing the perspectives of women who know their love is futile but they will take what they can get for as long as they can get it lone of the most famous aunty songs isn't under cover one that most people do not realize is from the perspective of the other woman in saving all my love for you jitney button calls out her lover's lies even as she con tines to wait for him you used to tell me we would run away together love gives you the right to be free you said be patient just wait a little longer but that is just an old fantasy when jitney hits that beautiful extended high note on fantasy it feels we are all falling back into an ocean of her lovers lies with her and her we let ourselves be carried away anyway h when i was twenty five years old and living in new organs i met a man with a voice made for might he was a lovely nutty saying with a shaved head and freckles a sprinkle of joy across his nose and cheeks and a few dots on his lips that were clearly targets for my affection he was not yet thirty but he already had the look of a hippo professor in line at whole foods it'll call him bayard at dinner with him and a friend i laughed too often and too hard at something bayard said he slid me a questioning glance after one giggle too many and i tried to pull myself together but it was too late at a club later we ended up sitting next to each other trying to talk over the music at midnight we sat in my car talking and then the sun reminded us our deoderance have been working for twenty four hours i decided to shoot my shot is there any one back home waiting for your morning call i asked him he took a long time to answer which was answer enough yet there is he finally said he looked down at his hands and i looked at them too of course he was involved with some one he was smart cute and funny and it'd met him at the wrong time we exchanged smell dresses because that felt safe there was nothing long with having a people was there soon we were exchanging pages of text almost daily he would call me at work and have me crying from laughter and sometimes he would call me at night when that some one back home was out with her girls and he talk to me with that voice saying what his words would not after about three months of constant communication he came back to new organs for another visit i do not know what he told that some one back home but he told me he loved me i said it back to him we kissed my member tells me i had candlelit and that is probably true i do love candles i remember his face as he looked at me and told me i was beautiful i believed him he was engage to be married and for the most part i did not care i definitely had some woman to woman guilt since it'd had my own heart breaking experiences with cheating exes but bayard and i started seeing each other when i was firmly in what we would now call my hot girl summer face i also knew i was not the first woman he cheated on her is i decided i could not care more about his woman than he did i refused to take responsibility for his decisions but i had no problem benefitting from them those aunty songs i had swayed along with because i appreciated i talented voice and good music a pealed differently to me during this time now they were peptics in secret lovers by aplanatic star a pair of lovers are both devoted to other people yet unable to stop their attraction i did not have any one i was committed to ut there was a particular verse i kept going back to while i fancied myself in love with bayard sitting at home i do nothing all can but think about you and hope that you are cam hoping you call before any one gets home i wait anxious lea alone by the phone this is the stuff of schoolgirl crushes of clumsy ram calm heroines of swooning damsels everywhere and that is how i felt about bayard i just happened he was committed to some one else a few weeks after that candela visit i was unexpectedly hospital give and board was there for me he called my mother cleaned up my apartment and made sure my cat had a fresh litter box he stayed with me the entire week event after my family arrive the care he showed me was a fantasy it'd never allowed myself to indulge he was married a few months later he e smelled me from the honeymoon and several months after that we made plans to spend a weakened at a hotel together he left the hotel depside up on his laptop and his wife found a book it'd inscribed with something sneaking she eventually reached out to me via meal and aim instant messaging of old the exact messages have been lost to time and anger but the just remains what did he tell you about me he did not talk much about you why you you would have to ask him why did you do it i wanted to do you love him i think yes do you want him no ism not trying to take him from me i saw your pictures oke him does he love you ask him why did he do it ask him i ping ponged between a strange loyalty to him the need to defend myself the desired to protect her and the need to be caddy i wanted to tell her to leave that he cheated before that if it had not been me it would have been some one else bastard's wife reminded me of the petty girls in school who could not understand why guides would be interested in me i did not have the things i was supposed to in order to be attractive i got in a few stingers but i let her have her shots what ever she needed to fell better and giving myself what i wanted it'd heart another woman i felt guilty even as i would not allow myself to fill ashamed when i wanted to brush away any concerns about you he was treating his wife or when it'd start to fell bad about not having a man of my own it'd put on the does bands just be good to me to gasp myself up and keep me focussed on myself i do not care about your other girls just be good to me his wife did not understand how i could be with him and claim to love him but not not to take him from her i was no fool i firmly believe in the added how you got him is how you get got i think eye stop loving him first he was the only man i was saying i love you to in a romantic sense but he could not say the same i stopped answering his meals and calls he wrote me a letter and i burned it unopened after i made the decision to let my relationship with bayard go i found myself holding a sweating glass and staring at a blank wall the aunt songs once gave me strength and now they gave me permission to cry i missed some one who was never mine even though i had made a good decision in moving on from the affair a decision that had been mine in most aunt songs we hear the other woman passively waiting for the man to make time for her but in everything i miss at home the singer overall tells the story of a woman who initiates her infidelity and lets us know she is the one dissatisfied in her main relationship she cheats without regrets and is grateful to have found some on who gives her everything she is not getting at home she was not the object of desire she was in control of it the song is a gruel slow jam made for a two step and i contact perfect for a woman who refuses to feel remorseful about receiving love from unexpected places r i let these songs guide me through an affair but they did not tell me what happened after i moved on i started reading romance novels when i was very young and became a diced to the promise of happily ever after for ever was found in fiction and fairy tales but in aunt songs for ever was a stolen nine does the other woman get her happy ending maybe it is enough to stay in a loop of borrowed time i still have not figure that out yet but i know i can beloved anyway i want necolbergans is a writer from natural tenners for memoir from which this is ay is adapted is called sometimes i trip on how happy we could be an it is out now coming up they say a little knowledge is a dangerous thing but it can also make you a beloved roccritic at least in one case that is in a minute from chico public radio when a programmed continues it is this america life ism show cold since i was way this week we mad you a mishap it is called this is just some songs is is some songster a excide where a track too music is easy it struck me that a lot of the song most of the songs in the show today or from a long time ago and i wanted to play you a minute of this one tune s little newerfrom early last year and for me is is one of those sure worms the at ism delighted to heaven my year all the time the artist calls himself josephine network a self described shapeshifting yenta in dreg it is song about unburdening yourself getting whatever it is off your chest through music w s we a n have something else wanted to play that for you because where they say say what you mean this next truck on our mix tape is about saying explicitly indisputably what you mean with music although the people in the story might argue that it is not always easy a part of their job is hunting for exactly the right song for the occasion this is track three the end of the road and i think the only other thing you need to know is that my colly conojophy wolf is a big fan of those slide chose that schools put together wat then of the year for graduations in the kind of thing wretch prospective side shows loves them here hon u i got a bonus and of the year slide show last spring i was in expecting it because was for my second grater and he was not graduating anything still i was pleased when his teacher wrote the class to say she wanted to mark the end of the year we should all join their morning meeting by fume and there was going to be a slide show shown said i do love sideshows and not in a normal way i do not thing i always cry every time and ism really not a crier but these stupid slidejhos always work on me i will cry when it is not my own child graduating i will cry even if i do not know a single kid in the sideshow for instance here i was at an elementary school that my kids do not go to i was there reporting would not be a graduation without a slide shell an jury and it takes hen a second the pictures of the kids at work at their tables it on their field chips an match and teashirts i wove hon they do the photos from the beginning of the year and then the end and you see the kids get teeth and long legs in the front row there is a grandma wiping his eyes i was done one more an i promise it'll get to the point here in a second this one was the most embarrassing one for me i went to this graduation at a different school i was reporting on you of my god now well how the rob ceremony do you gas know about this diabolical thing they now do at some high school graduations where they give each kid a rose each graduate will preset the boss to one person well thrall this try and then they ask them to bring it to some one in the audience who got them to this moment then you see all these kids stumbling over their robes trying to find their mom in the audience and you see mothers just absorb their daughters and hogs both of them sobbing i watch this one awkward seventeen are boy walk up to his grandma shove the rob toward her and mumble thank you and she wrapped him by the neck and pulled him in brutal the woman from the main office in the school she saw me and came over to pat my arm to tell me it would be o say remember i was not related to a single person graduating in the ceremony anyway this year i join my child's class by fume and i knew what to expect we all watched a very sweet side chose the teacher put together and i felt nothing nothing we saw pictures of the kids reading and bean bag chairs learning mat nothing making volcanos no i just what sort of mum my mention drifted i looked at my phone i looked at everyone in the boxes on fume and a bunch of slides in i kid consume united himself to say something random my dog sounds and just hearing the sound i realized e there is no music that is was heard about this there is no song they would no much at i i e and now that fat at fecit o isn't ever e heard of that best massy is a school social worker the maker of many slide chose and the most enthusiastic fan of them to when she is in the audience best cheers were every person in the slide who every activity she cheers for the days of the week that exactly targeting fa i e at using that's hid and cry ye i think it is lid and cad tetchily i did talk to the teacher in my son's class she says she just forgot to put musician i called best and i called my friend rather sissy rather and best combined have probably put together dozens of slide chose over decades of working at summer camps running after school programs and graduations i asked them both what does it mean that i did not feel anything without the music there is rather ye i do not i kid a the mean the i without music bolt i i a look even the at this point we would not be having flip er actually musing like in in at old word i feel fee if you doing it without you sic you cannot help lit you a quacking fold ti found of emptydit no that will exactly what this slidecho felt yes felt time was moving slowly and the pictures did not have any of there meaning ore id not tee meaning that i wanted yes it think you think it there way with the like with her celebrating the got the path o find word year older but with music that feel conduit it full o potability emu i if yet i ti the the looking ut it all good eating yes oh ye exactly i had in the limo in i lady i ill an in my old rattle we reality like you lit jo the right song it can tell your mind what to think about when you look at a bunch of pictures of all the possible things you could be thinking about and feeling the music tells you need no this is the one to pet best said imagine the rob ceremony without music did just be awkward i watching a bunch of people stumble over chairs trying to find their seats i thought it'd try play the same slide who but just put a song under it see if i felt the right things i was skeptical though because this lido had a lot of other things getting in the way for one we were not altogether watching it in a crowded auditorium and honestly mostly what i saw was not the pictures of the kid's being cue i just notice their masks and the fact that their desks had plastic partitions and in some pictures there wearing winter cots indoors because they have have a windows open for ventilation it just felt distortion and i could not really imagine a slideshoon fume over coming all that ne i i i think et of work be ever faithful in the medium believed this was absolutely fixable she and rather both give me lots of suggestions of songs they thought could work that i could play during the slip to feel the rat things it is not complicated the was basically any song everyone knows can do the job pop songs hi energy songs those are the best rather things it is all about the learns i hope you had the time of your life as we go on we remember all the times we had together but then there aunt o the the tong and the road a hard ti could by yesterday or that that derma lock would thought i will remember you whatever i for the out about end of the road end of the road oh yet is is a road yet words just it ma no eniotiplat let that the big feeling about o something ending the ye on the knows the is the particathet of a for yes end it that ta tit does not call for li forty there is one song ten in rather both mentioned it that was be perfect slide song in all the ways it was copy everyone knew it had the great energy and the lyrics tell you exactly what to feel the kelly tong the world created which were sober bed i can no longer really do but it we perfect lite o o that was in heavy rotation for many year writ ti the then who it did the feral things and should not be the hero of at till habit to have written two of the greatest pride so for tip and i do notary but ti it i hit the overtime that that i see i am a marching band i am melting something about that being the faces of kid i believe i could fly y the could cut the my a the ninth of the like e of the having the foot of beta binge to a obviously ism not in a play archery under my second greater slid but all the other songs best and rather recommended they all just feel too sentimental and i do not feel sentimental about the last year an do not think i want to feel sentimental about the last year of school end of the road i wish it was the end of the road but it did give it a try i sat with the slide and tried to put music under it test had suggested a beadle song and there is a beadle song that i sing to my kid at that time it happy have all the rate learns but it did not work it is too much about him and mean not his class or his school it did not believe this slip was navigable there was one other kind of slice song that best talked about one she would seen work recently at her mother in law's ninetieth birthday party and it did not work because it was a song everyone knew or because the lyrics tell you how to feel she said it works because it makes you think of a particular place he to to mike the little down ah on i li it worth the li tat the the con de cancel m all penal bowl that pul found about the down that he was come i started to think about that and what song i associate with this specific group of people and this specific place there is really only one every year since my oldest was in great seven years at the end of the year assembly the kid sing a sing called this pretty planet i have never loved the song and i did not miss it when a new music teacher came in recently and retired it but it did seem it might work for these and it did this pretty the spring an free was your hard you are a harbor you are hole as i knowdid you hand motions and everything he actually felt watching a flag i had never seen before the mat and the heaviness of the year were still there but my brain did not focus on that instead i thought picture i had totally miss of my kid leading a group of friends and some sort of stomping game in the yard i thought girl who could not read bast the a standing at the board with the pointer stick reading to everyone mostly i just thought the incredible razilients of all the people in that classroom and marvelled at the teachers smiling and reading and skilfully making all the fear and chaos of the entire seer they could create something that looks school it not easy being with kids all the time it is tedious and boring and hard even when there is not a global pandemic but there are these flashes of big ness the flat takes all those flashes and bottles them up that you come u back over the past the a for a few minutes ideally no more than six with the right song plan and actually see all the thing you miss on a puffy waltz as one of the producers of outshout track for what is the frequency kennel much musical discovery happens when were kids you really find the songs that former tastes when you are young for the most part o really set would happen with me this last story is about some one discovering music who was much older the guy named ken glad he was actually living in a nursing home in boson the duplex nursing home it was called this was decades a go by the way there were forty five residents in the facility all men my friend avid green burger was the activities director there an the late seventies in early eighties i started the job the beginning a seventy on and it'd met ken probably immediately because he oh he walked with a walker and he would sit himself right beat there was a desk for the activity's director who was a cabin would stuffing it it was in the corner of a room where they all sort of lunch wan stuff ken was always seemed right by it cause he like he you what are you doing you sir whoever was an outsider see i gan no which going on out there he never saw himself as a guy in he nursing a was i a work for y my leg and only spells that i get o he pointing to his head he got some sort of spill oh he would have seizures he ad had some kind of brain the surgery you could see the scars had from that that affected tho he could walk along and he was just started talkatively ken was a talker you would not know it looking at him but he had been a tapped answer in night clubs back in the thirties on of the jasmine an boson he said he had met was kindly billy holiday sorry gorgerin letter young who he called prep during has sack upon solo he would be the guy in the audience healing go go go go go can also drank along back in the can according to his in take papers the surgery he had as for a sub rural hem women lacing blood messing in his brain probably from falling don the stairs one time when he was drown he also had diabetes seeming paralysis on his left side and he had no family to begun siblings and parents at all time and been given all of that he was still this up been smile charmed said that if avid did not go ahead and marrying his grill friend he was going to meat up with her on the corner which two we bottles of john damson avid was a denizen of his own very different kind of music scene he played in a band in the payday of boson run a skinny already twenty five your old white my with a moustache compared to can who was black a world wore too vet in his mid sites and for whom going to shows was well in the past still music was something they easily bonded over ken wanted to hear music on and specifically one to know what i was i music there was an element in him where he was i what is going on out there and he would point out the window i gene know what is going on out there and first i just played him some stuff on i the the first thing i pladhim was i massage her to the outsider art trio of sister is from a samphire they sounded that ken had a lot to say about the shags actually know exactly what his reaction was because avid rot it down this whole rapid fire soliloquy avid read it to ma i could not dance to that not regular dancing with a woman i could softshoe with that any o this music your playing for me i could soft shoe with or bucks wing with it wore off time with it personally myself i could do it i do not know everybody else would i know for a fact that men kelly and free stair could dance to that and if they could i samphire could do it myself i pray to god some day you can see me dance that that ism well enough to do it i me tell you something have anytime anybody i just need to posture for second and talk about the reason avid wrote down what keen had to say about the shags early on in his job at the nursing home avid started a small magazine the been called the duplex planet it was mainly quotes from the residence and spirits of their conversations that he thought were surprising or funny or point it was self published hundreds of subscribers not thousands but it had this devoted following lasted decades after avid left the nursing home he interviewed old folks all over the country there was a comic book virgin life performances seed was everything and kenneling was one of the early stand out regulars that readers look forward to hearing from every month avid crated a special section for him actually a music review call him called ken's corner he play ken songs on a cassette walk man ken would say what he thought of them and avid would sit and take notes in the first official ken's corner column as show twenty nine he re viewed money will not buy you happiness by the incredible casuals he says it is crazy it is really gravy or as you say to day it is really nice i what is crags me up as you say to day nice as if feeds gotta rid of the word crazy it is i he is used to beat nice took you is do not do that e wright but i say its slag it is gravy that a beat an e beat i beautiful i it i what i hear give him a chance they will be up there these kids can go up they can go there is no stop on him now if they stop it'll tell him there fools there is that old saying now you probably never heard it beg they bates he said do not stop right there we go a lot of the repeater that in a good way here is this poetic repetition to his gushiness and he encouraging we'll be those kits are going places whether you's talking about incredible casuals or a much more famous band the clash quote should i go ham no no do not go stay there baby these boys are all right they are gin a swing sometimes avid would play an artist kenned heard before franklin entered ills press but mostly it was stuff that was all new to hem and those first time listening reaction f idiot that are on you to ben ticktock now it helped if you already knew the song he was talking about because it allowed you to hear i through new ears ken's ears there was a complete lack of knowledge of context he does not know anything out the history of the person which can be free he is just who the things just rolling over me it is really about how you would talk with a friend while you are listen to music he was my friend hews never in a i ironic way i do not even that who thing that gets one sometimes i let see what grandpa says about kiss i the slit sir what a we exit just some thing that you normally would not be playing for grandpa li read out of the mouths of babes except for it is not babes it is old people he had the it reverse babe i but but a lot of times he would relate himself to it i mean basically all these things while they are music reviews the whole thing together is a portrait of ken described in these funny little ways piecing together a puzzle or the little bits of it are all coming together that is what it really is here not just a portrait of his personality which is palpable but practically ken's whole life is depicted in the reviews reacting to the lord's prayer by the beech boys he said i was a methods and then when they sent me to school they switched me around and made me a catholic that was the maintain he did not me because i was too popular and too good a dancer but i did not care can was a rebel crashing parties no matter what floor they were on he talks about climbing the sides of houses to get in the words rasing hell appear at least a couple of times but there were more placid memories to he is down of the charges river in a couple of the reviews sleeping on a blanket or he is at magazine beach where he used to be a life guard music his dry this is from when he listened to captain beef heart's tropical hot dog night ism sitting la an on me man an and i got the beat my body in my blood i look over to one side of me and there is a for girl along here we down her back and she is got those tight knees on shaking up she is tearing up the world and you got to get up and get the same beat that she is got and there you are you apparently there were lot of women in kenslide he never married seems he rejected all of that but he had girl friends and not always happily it was an accident by and a b cut got him talking about the time on woman told him she was pregnant with his baby in his skip town turned out it was not his ha and sometimes all of the carousing and carrying on intersect with america troubled history this is what he said in response to bunker and jakes if i had a dream if we played music that back in the thirties the police e iris cops would raise hell with us now what ism

ow they call it marijuana we would be dancing and long comes a pounder which is a cob and he says all right now break it up sometimes you run in to a cop saying hey that is my cousin your dancing with boy to a he i ad and e to be clear can did not everything avid hakim some of the reviews begin with it was weird or i do not buy that cat food by king crimson was a hard now and then this one review is such an intricate musty layered yet subtly murderous pan oh here avid had to read it to me this time hen ring by parulis ne playboys that i would not buy but it sounds all right some more horns in there were a helped over it e change the temple were too bet er singer too he could have come more clear with it hollos words i could he get he could change a long the lyrics in the too he was corn at a temple in there what ad just couldn't get i they got a switched around i soft mean all the way around just half way he basin ease he is now asked about adding horns changing the wars the tempo and getting a different singer ah what it is not totally that i be you face a he tried to be heard what he is very i should let to say every one it the nursing how knew about the sene the owner told avid he as really crowd of what he was doing and avid showed keen the ken's corner column in the duplex planet but keen was completely uninterested he as why do i need a souvenir of myself talking did ye know how many people were reading these i don loved really registered i mud tell him stop what i that is such an abstract thing all t ha that matter to him was he liked what we did meanwhile ken's following swelled well beyond the readership of the duplex planet other publications started picking up the column rock sheet and boson called the noise two alternative papers out of the north west rounder records said avid submit some of ken's reviews for their mail order catalogue granted avid had a lot of music world connections from playing in his band but he was not pushing for any of this exposure and when keen got to meet some of the musicians he reviewed weirdly it was keen who was the celebrity in this interactions the self wagons got in touch asking of keen could produce them local boson ban called pasties dedicated a song to him which he later reviewed he and avid appeared on a local eve show and rote island together avid even read a couple of ken's reviews on late night with coninobryan where as ken had always said he wanted to know what was going on out in the world now keen was what was going on out in the world ton san center traves of theincredible casuals and told me he liked keen cause keen talked a musician avid brought keen to one of their shows and the casual's play to davit's wedding party were keen was a guest there is a separate film with just a sniped of keen at the party on it he is wearing a gray so jacket and a white shirt with e wide collar no tie you can't hear what ken's saying over the crowd noise but he is joking around gesticulating people lean in and laugh he is a hid and he knows it i had a ball that night he said in his review of the ease beats fridge on my mind then i had to come back here and who is waiting for me at the front door but the guerilla and that wine he me when i got out of the car another result of ken's widening popularity other people wanted in on the action started sending their own maxtapes for keen to listen to gazette's avid still has them all the songs are listed on the ja card or tired on to these little sheets of paper and folded up and shoved into the jewel case one of the lists has a little note on it that says have is i do not get to put your own thing on here if not skip over it this tape was from the guitars t glenjones it is got jelly roll moron on it and elves press and this in stranger i left the resell crying l we dry man that is a western song if there ever was that is one no stranger to me on tan that is what the kat said my take me back take me right back to the airs on the desertthat kin of music gets you help e it that you got the moon a sucker sign pis of the girls walk around the little slips that you can see right through it is music that is this that takes you their voice is play that you count understand wat their say to me i know what there's sing there is person there you may not know but you will ut him in there yourself have done that many times just sat there and listened to ban's play and put the words in myself the way i hear it is easy to do if you got the music in your body man you're going to do it that is from the heart in all ken dictated six hundred ninety two music reviews giver take over just a couple of years then his health got worse he developed cancer he was transferred from the duplex nursing home to a local vie hospital avid kept visiting him encouraged other people kens fans to do the same he was at the vie as clear as can be there for while he was maybe knew hews never got t leave that maybe he knew he was getting worse ah he certainly was not gone back to the nursing ah hand it was really just a request he asked me said those reviews could you bring them in here for me not all of them are anything but just a selection of them to have he wanted them in a folder ah by his bed at the vie hospital cause i think why he knew ism an old guy that there is just been moved around and he would tell people that is me i centuries and stuff at the vie hospital he wanted some identity outside of just being a frail guy who body's breaking down in the nursing him he was ken he had such level of respect but at the vie hospital he wouldn't have had any that is i for he'd get moved into the hallway now we for to do this for you were sending you down to this room for whatever tests up now a especially for somebody who does not really have ah family aren't or an advocate ah id they were in touch with me some i en i got my name on do his chart and i a right got a call late at night it been away you may be was two in the morning or something and just i was just want to call tat that kendo an die to night it was canary twenty nine nineteen eighty fore ken was sixty eight a featured obituary ran in the boson sundae globe had lined kennel glad rock music critic began as tapped answer in thirties it did not mention his seizures were stapedes were that he used to walker toward the end of his life it did quote from one of his reviews no matter what instrument your playing said one of the quotes you cannot lose that first been ore your through avid at the time was twenty nine he's only been to one or two funerals of that point other guides from the nursing home hit certainly never had to organize one before but it was avid who called the funeral home to work of er details of the way fans of ken cycled in and out paying their respects some who had met him in the past in others who had and avid arranged for some of ken's favored music to be played straw the beech boys jonathan richmond an he took care of this one other detail that felt important i gave them the tape am the last mix tape that ken never got to hear came too late there just was not a time and as condition was deteriorating i would go and see him buy was not soon tried i get heavens on him in a listens stuff i i then gave it to the funeral director and i had put it in the pocket of his jacket he was buried with he is buried with the tape si rememberknow what was on it ah it was i ever any of the suns nah that was meant to be a thing that i would have done with him it was for him to her and that want possible they it belongs to him in that way what mist most to do with this there is this thing that happens when two friends sit and listen a music to ether lot it happened with my friend pal in me when we ere kids and he turned me on to some of the music i still listen to and it happened with kennel avid even when you go your separate ways in whatever way that happens ait is you take that person with you you are for ever informed by that friendship certain songs will always remind you of that person even when they become associated with other people in your life and when you hear those songs you think about other aspects of that friendship of that person that you really loved stuff that maybe did not occur to you as much pet when you were hanging out with them i asked avid what ken's last review was he said he was not sure because he would collect many at once and then meet them out in batches as he published the magazine but this is the last one in the last ken's corner column in issue fifty five it is the

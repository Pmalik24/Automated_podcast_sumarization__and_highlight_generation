menshpershosponserbackpressive plan protect our alpine privacy to day at expressive piantakam flashes we seen lot of disturbing pole results over the course of the last few decades but have never personally seen a more disturbing pole result than the result from the latest hazard herrispoll out over the week en now to be sure this pole says that the america public are basically in the realm of sanity ore least most of the america public are the old are o say it is the kids party something is got to be done about the kids according to this latest hazard terrispote while a strong majority of every age group agree that the october seventh terror slaughter of one thousand two hundred is relies in the kidnapping of another two hundred forty was indeed a genocidal terror attack some sixty per cent of people aged eighteen to twenty four said that genocide tear attack quote can be justified by the grievances of palistinians that is correct while two thorns of eighteen to twenty four year old degree the chassis terror tax were general and nature sit in ten still say it can be justified that is a crazy number and it gets worse every age group in america except for eighteen to twenty four year old sides with israel against comas the older you are the less crazy you are as for usual arrangement those above the age of sixty five side ninety six to four against compass for the young however the numbers are split right down the middle fifty fifty fifty per cent of people in this pole egged eighteen t twenty four support compass in actual geniecidl terrogroup over the state of israel just way it gets tough worse when asked about whether students on campus who call for the genocide of news should be punished for violating university rules most america of all age groups say yes again the older you are the more you agree with that proposition that is not because america oppose are speech it is because they realize that literally every element of speech on campus is police for micro egressions and of fencetaking why precisely would genocidal curators be exempt everyone agrees with that except again for the eighteen o twenty four year old who believe that well such speech is hatespeech they believe that seventy to thirty fifty three per cent of people aged eighteen to twenty four believe that students should be told quote they are free to call for genocide that is correct a majority of people eighteen twenty four believe students should be told they are free to call for genocide long as there calling for genocide of news yes we have discovered finally the one thing fragile young people are not fragile about saying the news should die you think were done this pole gets even whose while a majority of young people seven and ten agree that israel is trying to avoid civilian casualties and fifty eight per cent of young people agree that comas would to commit a genocide seventy six per cent of young people think compass can be negotiated with to create peace despite the fact that again the same young people will acknowledge the comas is a general terrogroup here is the kicker fifty one per cent of eighteen to twenty four year old think quotes the long try anger to the israel palestinian dispute is four quote israel to be ended and given to compass and the palistinians that is correct a majority of young people admit compass is a get social group use is human shields saleswomen commits evil atrocities on the regular all that was told a majority of them believe it and they still want israel destroyed and handed over to commons fifty one per cents say these solution to the arab is really conflict is for israel to be destroyed and handed over to commons why do all these young people thing all of these truly evil things will et to that in just one second first if all this puts yogin mine the future is uncertain and that there is a lot of trepidation about what is going to happen at the very least you might think about diversifying

should be obliterated and commons should take its place that say majority believe the commons is a genocidal tear group that committed mass rape that targets civilians and the wants to kill every jaw what the hell is going on hell thankfully this poll actually spells out the answer the biggest question and answer takes place on pay fifty six of this pole this is where we learn that america were asked a very simple question quote there is an ideology that white people are oppressors and non white people and people of certain groups have been oppressed and asaresult should be favor to day an universities and for employment you support or oppose this ideology pretty easy answer right i mean that is a really really bad ideology of course you cannot simply assume that white people are oppressors and non white people are victims that is morally imbecilic some white people a oppressors and some are victims and some non white people are oppressors and some are victims the claim that white people are by nature oppressors and that non white people are the oppressed is ridiculous on the merits after all here is a partiality of ethnicity who earn more on average than white america do india america philopino america tolenese america street lonkanamericans japan's america malaria america chines america kickstand america theist goes on and non none of those people are white well as you might expect most america believe that this interjectional ideology is quite terrible sixty five percents of america over all believe that the ideology that white people are pressers and non white people and people of certain groups ha we been pressed sixty five per cent america believe that that i ideology is bad and they oppose it now young people they supported not only do they supported they support it at a rate of seventy nine per cent two twenty one per cent eight two two only a bare majority of twenty five to thirty four year old by the way disagree with that sentiment forty nine per cento people aged twenty five to thirty four believe that white people are oppressors and none white people are victims you want to know why the younger generation hates israel because they hate the west according to those same eighteen to twenty four year old news are part of that oppress or class some sixty seven per cent of people aged eighteen to twenty four two thirds agree that qua news as say class are oppressors and should be treated as oppressors that is astonishing the evil of critical race theory are as we now call it more innocuously diversity equity and inclusion d e i the see the hereon capacity or corporation it rears its had in all of the ugliest places now we should not be all that shock by these numbers among young people for this oppressor oppressed white people verses every one else evil binary the barocobomic volition of the supposedly marginalized which for democrats always meant racial and sexual minorities is an medically strongest among young people just fifty two per cents of eighteen to twenty four year old are white in america similarly about twenty per cent of generations ears report disproportionately white say they are l g b t u plus mounties video by sin if you believe in inter sectional ideology they are a lot of people who fit right into that interjectional ideology now heres the thing demographics should not be destiny his basic voters in florid for example are voting increasingly republican it generally matter how many young people in america are white or not white because there all individuals and thy should stop thinking stupid crap no matter their ethnicity but the left corps oppressor oppressed philosophy is that all that matters is your group identity if your minority but not a new or an patient seeking to get into cologne you are a victim as the radical left winds ideologically it is no surprise that group minority identity a demographically growing piece of the america pie is driving anti white hatred in larger numbers and by proxy antituish hatred as well because young people have been indoctrinated by three generations of this trash it is becoming part and parcel of the democratic party playbook right now there is a battle for the heart and sol of the democratic party itself between the moderate liberals and the radical left the moderates still thing the system can be changed and shaped in order to accommodate the supposedly marginalize the demands of the people who feel excluded but they do not actually believe the system ought be obliterated the bid administration is supposedly on this them they wave their hands lot at equity but they do not actually seek to implement it in the ways the radicals when most love which is why see the radical left for example very angry at mobile in these days the radicals think the moderates are weak and foolish and there are more than happy to use them as their tools that is why for example the york times is suddenly all in favor of free speech but only when it comes to sun's chanting for israel obliteration according to the york times over the we can quote universities are under tremendous pressure to stamp out antisemite so but some say that is causing fear and curbing free expression freely chin campus has never been much of a priority for the never times needless to say the same weaken the new york times ran this rather longpiece former up at paeteror him's bennet of the you times wrote a sixteen thousand word essay for the economist slamming the times for their own censoriousness they destroyed his career for this great sin of platforming senator tom cotton an sitting senator who advocated in twenty twenty for using the national guard to put down violent riots here is what an wrote quote the reality is that the york times is becoming the publication through which america progressive elected talks to itself about an america that does not really exist the times is problem has matastocize from liberal bias to illiberal bias from an inclination of favor one side of the national debate to an impulse to shut down debate altogether near times in other words is a font head of censorship they are antimere speech but this is the same times suddenly concerned about free speech when you are chanting from the river to the sea or they are lying and they do not care about free speech they just are radical my hunch they are long what the radicals was is to use the tools of liberalism in order to push radical illiberal evil designed to tear down the west that is what is happen with young people are now suggesting that in the name of diversity and tolerance and equity in inclusion israel the only tolerant and diverse country in the entire midaleast ought to be destroyed and replaced with the cereal law terrorists of compass the is why young people are preaching diversity equity inclusion in the united states what they really mean is anti white hatred in the name of reparative justice quoting duo this is by he way why we seep piece after piece in the mainstremedia talking about the generation gap among young news who seem not to understand their foolishly liberal parents who spent decades telling their kids they re all for a variety of viewpoints no judgment here while kids were indoctrinated with hatred of their own parents and their own civilization take for example a story from today waster journal about a family called the workshafters gamma work chapter lived with her husband and children in jerusalem during the nineteen seventy three war the uncupor war she is arsonist her son avid one generation removed is ha reform rabbi in lexingtonkentucky who calls himself a progressive pianist this is coed for a jewfish my by birth who cares more about progressives than anything remold jewfish he then married another progressive pianist who herself quote has studied right wing religious movements and such she is troubled by echo nationalism in all of its form she is a rabid left winger and is happy to label proponents at no nationalists both of them consider themselves believers in the definitionlists mush of tycoon slam at from frequently use by news by birth who do not really believe much about autism but are looking for a here phrase to hang their antiblibical left wing social justice politics upon tycoon slam has no predicate in polacca in jewfish law it is literally a phrase in one pray that as been blown into an entire ideology that has very little to do or nothing to do with actual jewfish practice how did these progressive pianists raise their kids whlaccording to the walstrat colonel they imparted that jewfish concept of pursuing a social justice to their two children and encourage them to think critically and speak up their daughter and son empanel an malaria now hate israel and wish it to be a stop disestablished as a jewfish state emmanuelele said you would not even a tend post october seventh events that featured is rally flags now problem is not unique to just it is degeneration problem across the west liberal parents breed radical children who use the cowardice of their parents who refuse to stand for any principle other than openness and tolerance they use that as their leverage to tear down the entire system meanwhile their milk sop coward parent sit there and nowt their heads weekly as they explain as the workchafters to quote i do not agree with e manual on every political issue including aspects of this current crisis but ism tremendously proud of her for standing up for what she believes in but what if york is believe that white people and news are the oppressors what then are you still supposed to be proud that they are on thinking for themselves or have you idiotically turned your own children into radicals who hate you and everything that your own principles were based upon radicals have been playing this game since the nineteen sixties and quietly they have been winning and thy will continue to win until disaffected liberals realize they have been played for suckers and stop matching platitudes about the joy of tolerate and diversity as their own children prepare their defenestration in the name of caponized social justice in just one second the will get the latest from israel were again people keep trying to create some sort of momentum for a steel that does not exist with an actual honest to god terror groups insane gets that momentarily first are you traveling for the holidays well if pure to has a covered they just added international roaming over thirty

wireless today pure told is indeed simply smarter wireless go check him out right now pure to dot come slash chipping and this pole should be deeply deeply troubling to any one with half a brain because what it said is that an entire generation of young people has been indoctrinated to believe that one segment of society is responsible for the ills of every other segment of society and it can be divided by race it can be divided by group status well that is the death of any functioning republic that is a destructive impulse by the way one things that truly insane here is the same exact poll that shows that seventy nine per can of young people actually believe in this terrible ideology forty nine per cent of young people believe it is bad for the united states it is almost what fifty fifty on whether young people believe this ideology's bad for the united states but eight to two h they agree with the ideology anyway which suggests the it the united states very much if that is how bad things have gotten with the younger generation and again that is because of their parents tat is because an entire educational system that has been driven by the notion that you do not have to teach your kids what to think you teach them coin how to think well no it starts with teaching your kids what to think only afterwards are they qualified to think about how to think it turns out that if the only thing you teach your kids is all thoughts are equally good you have taught them nothing you are a fool if what you have taught your kids is that the essence of any good society is simply the amount of descent that takes place in the society rather than the fundamental principles upon which the society is based you should not be surprised when descents is then used as a weapon to tear down the very thing you tressure this been true since the nineteen sixties hermarcusa was a philosopher from the nineteen sixty is frankfortschool philosopher taught among other place the colombia and hazard and in the universe of californium system and he coin to term the he called repressive tolerance repressive tolerance was the idea that all ideas that oppose the left ought to be repressed because after all there was this conspiratorial system in which a very powerful group of people at the top kept everyone else down and free speech all the liberal principles were actually inventions of the powerful is the post modernist de constructionist ideology which that there are no principles there is only systems of power set means that free speeches a system of power proper rights is system of power all of that said macula have been manipulated by people at the very top level and that has to be torn down in order to reestablish some form of equality or equity or social justice and then he said the only way to do that to tear down the system is to repress people that we disagree with that is how you end up with people who purport to be on the left ore supporting comose which throws gay people off roofs that is how the other it does not matter that these people from comose would throw the gay left us off the roofs that does not matter is queers for palestine only exists as a group because of this ideology that you are either member of the oppressor class or a member of the oppressed class andthat is all that matters in life that is also how you end up justifying the myriad evils of comose cause it does not matter what they do they are always oppressed enough that they can do whatever they want your level of oppression now justifies literally anything and everything over the weaken we saw a wide variety of comes human rights violations israel for example released tape of a of an entire terror tunnel that was built by comes this is in insane insaintape hay comes built a terratunnel that is large contrive trucks through it it was built down to fifty meters underground and hundred fifty feet undergrounds void bombing on top of it the s actually tape of each ha singer's brother doomed singular driving through the terratunnel in a truck my look look a the size this tunnel the tunnel looks it looks at a tunnel in californium underneath the looks likest will sake they they use boring equipment it's actually for holes into the earth in orders that they could than t i means this thing is bolometers long four kilometers long this is where they spent all their money but do not worry comas is a piece pardner come ass by the way woodwind an election in the wetback right now if n election were held in lwessbank right now meanwhile what is comas doing with the a trucks is been a lot of prushron israel to ship more aid into the goa trip israel has not exploit extra resources in order to allow shipment of aid into the goes trip the problem is is noting distribute on the other side of the gozestrip israel ready to clear more aid to going to the guess rip what actually is happenings that aid who here it can we pretty clearly what is happening to that aid the u a e sent in aid it literally says on the side of this giant truck you a aid for those effected in goal who is riding on top o the true why look at that it is members of comes with their faces closed and they are holding weapons almost as though what israel plane which is t every bit of humanitrianad would be stolen by commas what is true because they stole all of the commanitarianade and they're using it to continue they are terror war that is ended with the complete destruction of the goes trip things are bad in the goes trip that over the week when most tragic stories of the war occurred israel accidentally the idea accidentally killed three of the hostages who were taken it'd apparently escapes they're captors and they had attempted to paint a sign on a sheet that is tat he sell it help us in's ad three hotupim meaning three hostages and israel thought that i was trap why d thy think that strap zetrocomastas most literally sets traps with fake hostages they wavewate flags hen they do not mean it they literally put dolls connected to crying sounds they the police recording next to a doll and then strap with explosives that is rally soldiers will die israel soldiers did not know what to do and they in up shooting three hostages who are tempting to signal them for their help israel investigating israel going down a bi would assume doing something about the officers who who were involved in this shooting it is a horrible tragic situation and it is entirely the fall of comose because those people would not be in goa in the first place if they would open taken into goa and meanwhile members of the left wing are hell that is obvious that israel committing human rights violations you literally have eighteen nineteen twine year of guys were going to goa and getting killed by the dozens in order to preserve the life of civilians in these areas and meanwhile the west continues to maintain that the real ones is on israel in just one second well talk about what the united states is doing ain there giving all these mix signals when it comes to israel for the usual arrangement first there is a lot to be stressed about during the

of the worst officials in the administration on this was traveling on sundae into miles for visit to israel and three person gulf nations as bide administration officials push israel to end it is large scale grounds and air campaign in the gozistrip within weeks and transitions while more focus phase in its war against compass while all offers open ism sure israel like fagot you want a way out your plans really lek if you have some magical plans by which israel can make the gozistrip safe and quiescent ism sure israel going to hear it considering they currently have tends of thousands of troops deployed even the gosestrip right now doing heavy hand to hand urban combat satin is supposed to meet with priminister mentomantongaho and israel defense minister you one gala discuss in detail what and how is daily forces will carry out a new phase that america officials and mission would involve smaller groups of elect forces you us official said goes forces would move in and out of population centers in gaze conducting more precise intelligencstrof an missions to fine and kill commas leaders rescue hostages and destroy tunnels according to those u us officials now realistically speaking the fact is that israel can have to continue the heavy ground operation for at least another couple of weeks presumably the united states is not going to continue to to push for the idea the israel should preemptively and it is military actions against compass but i have it say there is nothing more tiresome in this is true bet the we are talking about america troops harm's way in foludjral where your hung out his daily troops in harms wangaza there is nothing more tiresome then lis tending to politicians jabber about civilian casualties while armies are doing their best to protect both their own soldiers and civilians whore being used as human shields cries van dollar senator from martian he says we are seeing to many casualties again ism sure that if you had a magical said to avoid that israel would be all ears sad er venom you heard present bindslessage quite clear there take sollovin was obviously it israel o delivery a sailor message now we have learned over night the defense secretary often is on this way to the region is the message getting through well do not think it is getting through clearly enough i because we continue o see unacceptably high levels of sothiian casualties and what accost maniterrin a crisis am we still having their total sees whet question what would the will the acceptable level of cavilling casual these be given that seal's ratio of terrorist killed a civilians killed destiny lower than in any modern conflict ever in a heavy urban area it is it is its all ridiculousness it is all ridiculousness but what ire really under score is that for the west there is still this sort of base line liberal belief that if you cave to intransigent terror is somehow this makes the world ta better place while the by administrations fining to the highway that is not the truth when it comes to yeomen the soothes are holding up the shipping through the bob elmandeb straight which is place wore about ten percent of all world shipping goes through and now there is talk about not even using that particular area for shipping because of soothe pirates in the area who coming from yeomen the soothes you'll recall are a enlisted terror group the re terror group that the misadministration cam ban immediately demisted as a terror group upon entry in attempt to placate the arronians because remember the bin administration one to make a deal with on as they spread their terror tentacles liver the middle east well now according tote waste turn the press is reporting that the bid administration is contemplating the use of military force in response to continue attacks on commercial shipping by the toothy militia in yeomen it about time the toothy missile attacks pose the most significant praticglobl shipping in decades they will continue unless a global coalition unites to stop them the usual cornea destroyer operating in the red see shot down no fewer than fourteen attack thrones launch from whole control territory common on saturant alone brush worship shot down a toothy drone after a dispatch to the region to protect commercial ships this follows weeks of similar attacks use worships have felt obliged to intercept to protect themselves and other ships the soothes have said that their attacks are minded stopping is daily vessels but apparently there not just doing that their targeting commercial ships willingly they struck at saurian flacks ship in the red sea on fridge and they launch too realistic missile one of which struck another commercial ship as well this is making the red sea non navigable major commercial ship lines hardy announce they will seize sending ships into harm's way mayors which is the shipping give has stopped sending vessels throughthe mailman to strap between the red s an the gulf van has become a the foregone let us be real about this the united states and its allies should be taking strike options against the soothes to stop them from pursuing these sorts of attacks homes jufferson was was willing to use america military power against the barber pirates way back at the beginning of the nineteenth century the united states has a massive military advantage over pirates ay you are not tongue outing over yeomen a come out restructuring it notice mutation building not blowing of a few coastal bases for the soothes that is what you are talking bout here why this even a question is beyond me of course t united states should take out those who thesis of course the shut or or aid the sorties in doing it top by administration officials apparently a going to political are actively weighing those options to strike back at the soothes in yeomen the have been reluct ins respond militarily against the who the attacks on commercial shipping for fear of provoking ran fear of provoking are seriously this this is the game now your afraid of i notice that ran seems rather angry and they have for several decades this point a on is responsible for the death of thousand o america soldiers in rock around is responsible for the metastasis of terror in lebanon they responsible for t metasiv tear in the gosh trip in yeoman in syria all over the damn place and the this this bizarre notion that its it is all blowback at talllike you want's talk about bigotry the bigotry that suggests that the only reason bad people all over the world do bad things because america is mean that is idiotic it turns out people have their own interests and they pursue those on interest with alacrity particularly in the face of america weakness and let us be real about this if america cannot guarantee the freedom of the seas against a a few rag tag pirate dolts in the barbell tandem strait what they help you think china you you won't talk about what china thinking have bee a lot of talk about have the pull out from afkanison precipitous pull out from afkanistanin collafvafkanistan to the tarlatan how that inscentofies ladmerputen to take you crane or attempt to take you crane and how what is going on new crane is then going to have knock over a facts and follow on h facts with regard to china looking at titan one of the reasons why china would be concerned about taking titan is because america economic interests would be threatened i want is the producer of ninety to percent of the world sophist get a microchips not only that chines naval activity in the south china sea threatens the free shipping of the world and radically change the globeleconomy well china might be thinking pretty seriously do i want to take an deep water blue water navies the united states even in my own back yard boat is this that a confection to take on if the united states is really actually confident about trying to protect global shipping if the united states cannumen protect shipping in the red we against a bunch of pathetic pirates who the pirates illiterate jack asses why exactly with china look and america naval power and shutter there would have to believe that going up against the chines the united states is while to be a lot more wary and careful tan they would against yahoo the but still everybody everybody continues team to puts around crisp dollar take person who sang ism very worried about civilian casualties in the groom same idiot he says i work about escalation in the rest oh do you you worry about that escalation i notice the escalation is already happening from the who the are attacking ships i worried sorry you that this is about to escape and actually i mean should it askclaven terms of the united states actually attacking these worthy positions in term well i worry a lot about escalation i both in the red sharia with with the who taste was you say we shot down a their groans we all have to keep an i have the nor their front i if helpful this is why my president by n send two aircraft carriers a groups a to the reasons to prevent that kind of escalation to send a message to iron to haspola and others look i think that the administration has been smart in terms of how's responded a to those attacks but but clearly the risk of an america a being killed a in the process a it is high and that would obviously prate a a a big response for the united states or the united states could not wait until numerical is killed and just eviscerate ahchoo the without again engaging a nation building you are talking about whether the world most formidable military most formidable military in history is capable of tamping down a small kitchen fire that is what you're talking about right now in meanwhile the united states tenner continues to function the war house that it is i mean that absolutely literally we get to that in just one second first i majority of gene

were i mean it is coming from an entire culture the basically says that the chief form of human intellectual development is sax there is a wit there is an entire article from political magazine about the nations outgoing study chief here is the tetaquote sex is a normal activity and part of our human experience and this idea that all over america people are s deeply ashamed of sex then will not talk about it have you been in america lately in the last few decades ism pretty sure it is all america talk about for last several decades doctor leandromena has plenty of reasons to lie awake at night over the two years he led the sexy he's division of entity prevention he is seen sexually transmitted infections he recon levels including the highest number of civilian cases since the freeman administration sovistha he is doing an incredible job he is doing a really really good job but he says the biggest problem he is really our culture we as a society have a tremendous difficulty talking about sex and recognizing that sex is a normal activity and part f our human experience with much stigma around sex it leads right into the general population and acts a wall that prevents them from accessing the services that they need yes america giant sit break out is because people are too shy talking about sex nailed it that is probably it or alternatively we are a godless culture that has champion the animal instinct above it every part of what it means to be a meaningful human being and this is why you can do a gay porn radio in the senate and then act a victim in or culture you are a member of the marginalize you are only a senate staff for you are member of the marginalize now doctor ridiculous well t hell speaking of people i getting screwed at the senate the senate continues to puts around on this border slash crane slash israel shed swan funding bill apparently the democrats are still attempting to hull up negotiations with regard to border provisions on this giant one hundred five billion dollar spending package democrats art are not really making clear what exactly there negotiating position is publicans aren't making clear with there negotiating position is on the border representing morning in is republican antes he says lis not were close by re publicans the they cannot wait on making a border deal that is why we are putting it in there in the first place if this is an emergency you want theory want thus to move quickly has the speaker giving you any indication of a time line if the senate can get the steal he hasn't and i do not think many people have even on the senate side an mean the easiest thing to do in politics as just a way yet a wait for somebody else to pop their head out and build a frame work and and and put it all together and time is runny ow we are we are at a national security crisis point now i mean think back to be director testifying and saying every every ate ism looking at is blinking red and meanwhile senora line gram he says guys negotiations are not that close to resolution kids am nothing's happening let start with the borders a negotiation there is much focus on that you have been face on that can you bring us up to speed what is the very latest the thing t there is going to be a deal before the new year i no i think a this will go into next year have been talking to the people at the table am the white house got engage five days ago they sent over a supplemental what border security provision that did nothing to change policy women talking tom since september five days ago they faunally a the table serial an ears doing a good job ah the bottom line here is a we fill to we are being jammed we are not anywhere close to deal to what exactly our democrats doing here because again as thieve said before this would be a big wind wind for mobile if he passes a bill and gets as you crane running and is israel funding is to running is by partisan popular and bora security which aster would be good for him what exactly is he waiting for the answer is that this is a twenty twenty four election ploy the sentinel that is what this is that is why they are jamming everybody up on the border here is the calculation the jobidon and the democrats are making the calculation is that america we will want the you cranage and the israelade but the democrats cannot make a border deal with those crazy republicans because the crazy republicans our bunch of races trump that is the deal that they would rather kill the bill they'd claim at the dona trump is of racist basically that is the logic it is being carried out that involves two prongs one is claiming that republicans are propooten that they will not just pass the clean you crane bill this is a gan senator crisvanhollan idiot for marital suggesting it is a pivotal moment for america leadership in history not pivotal the t e latish pass bill be civil enough to to gran stand about it thing it is essential that we a provide military distance as you crane this is a pivot old woman a in america leadership a and history a and we need to make sure ah that we help are you cranial francs against puts aggression not just to protect their freedom ah but because it would send a terrible signal around the world ah to our allies who would no longer trust us a and to our adversaries i would be infolding if we are not doing that i do love the mix signals from van homeland when comes to israel they got we got a stop this is that is to stolen comes grins o man our allies will will just be thought they will be afraid if we abandon you crane it is allies butt why will not they ja sign the bordereau there is the once on the ordeal is they need to keep the border issuealive they thing because they think that f they kep the borders alive there can be able to pulverize the america population around the borderisshue which again is a very weird calculation being made what are they counting on there but if you look at the poles what you see is america trust republicans on emigration way more than the trustrant democrats which is why you would think that if this were nineteen ninety eight an dick morse running the clean administration there would be some sort of triangulation were democrats would sign on to border security provisions they are not doing that why the answer is they believe the dona trample stick is footdentis throne that is they believe they believe the dona trump we will make even the right wing at migration position the most america and are sympathetic too unpalatable that was the story over the weekend with regard to the true campaign right now the poles are kind of fascinating y what trump seems to be way i hadst again i was a weird state to polkas to costate it is not just a straight up democratic boots state it is a place where you get together in little rooms it groups n then your first choices and second choices if you vie for nickel hayleinchis make the run off that you can shift our vote the to mantis somethnglike tat still a possibility that the mantis could win i wall it t latest poll has trump up over thirty points in i things are getting a lot closer in new samphire however the latest pole true new hamster has trump up only fifteen forty forth twenty nine over nickel daily an there still none of the twenty one per sent out sandwiching crispy and mantis in ne samphire things are start get a little tight in new samphire for present end trumps comfort dona trump was back out on the stump and this is going to be the biggest problem in his campaign is that he is just con to say things that set things on fire here is dona trump over the week get and thou's tag metemogration now i think that this comment is being rather de literately miss red by the met because is the usual arrangement however es dona trump a you say things that set things on fire yaw that is literally is not his cheers o house is trump calling in new samphire plenty of the other light right we have gat plenty of the other let we get a lot of work to do they know when they let i think the real numbers sixteen sixteen million people into our country when they do that the get a lout of work to do they poisoning the blood of our country that whit they don they poison went to let sifteetions and prisons all over the world not just tiny south and for cannot just get three o for countries tho we they come a but all over the world that coming in to er country true africa a from a o all over the world that pouring into our country nobodies in looking an em they just come in that the crime is to to be tremendous get terrors an is con to be tear is is going to been and we built that tremendous to to the world and then we we to build more nay this is why jo bison and democrats are gambling ism not passing a bill that inclose word security because wit they are hoping is that they will be able to play comments one that trump just made there and say that what trumps trust trumps immigration policies racist get the to the coalition that dis possessed to stop from that is o their hoping now in get to what i think trump actually is saying there in his words in just one second is the again i think this is deliberate mistreat first in a world filled with in certainties you see to be prepared for any possibility you need not my patriot supply my patriot supplies

using the since twenty fifteen it did not work then i don things can work now it is part and parcel of their broader trump is laying in figure stick trump again he makes this comment where he says they are poisoning the blood of our country and he is talking about democrats it just to analyze the actual verbiage that donate trump uses right the win plate again because the one the big promise that true talks is that he never makes his antecedents clear in antecedent is the this you mean we say they if id say they inocentence they re firs to some people you do not know which people ism re fearing to if the antecedent is unclear trump does not make the accedes clip in this particular clip he sees they to refer to two separate things without actually switching the accidents feared play the clip again and washing n a stop i now it is this appruderphone but that is true overtime of try to decoy trumps he hear i hear is trump what's platoon me time when of the other light right we have hat plenty at the other let we get lot of work to do the know when they let i think the real numbers sixteen sixteen million people into our country when they do that we get a lot of work to do they poisoning the blood of our country that is what they've done they poison men had to loncitin to look it when he says they who is he talking about clearly democrats right he much as political opposition he saying they are letting every one into the country they are poisoning the but not immigrants they meaning that when you have a brand open border you are letting in anyone up to an including people on the terror watches when you are letting people through who do not have any job qualifications when you are lettingtrough members of amuse thirteen we then you as the person in charge of them migration system are poisoning the blood of the country now i do not that phraseology's again it is deliberately vague and hit is very inflammatory if red in a particular way which is have media reading it obviously he does not mean emigrants are poisoning the blood of the country he means that the people where leaving the border open are their by de grading what it means to be america which is true for any country by the way that has completely open borders country's generally speaking with welfare states should not have completely open borders everybody is figuring down rope by the way again if yo just stop tho clipright were what he is talking about is democrats then he moves on he starts talking about immigrants but he start he use the same what he was they right but that they he is now referring to are emigrants shoran prisons all over the world that just in south and the can not just tat three or to our countries we they can be but all over the world that coming in to a country from abri a from agio all over the world that pouring into our country nobody's in looking and they just come in that the crime is can to be tremendous the terrors if this con to be there s hes washing now which topics right he is not talking about the emigrants themselves he says they are coming to our country that pouring in from all the different places the crimes gin to be tremendous an the rest there's no different from anything the he is been saying by a legal immigration the whole time what the media are doing is there saying the when says a there poison the good of our country that is the quote that is the big cathquot they are using that to say that he means emigrants a supposed to democrats setting emigration policy an here is signal doing precisely this routine yesterday the mean ens guess at ruth beige out who now she she is getting a second life as a commentator here because she wrote some books on fascism and now gets to say the trump is one witisina this is facias preterit avers about leading the bad a superior a a a is the standard not sister it is natcust the nays is so fashion and idly a willing girly taboo calling a ticabatotrump is feminine an earlier speech he talked about hearing rat to i binging a infection titties and conlinessn into italy again he is muslin he is killer because whence says there poisoning the blood he means immigrant again read the comments or listen to them he is talking bout democrats setting open borders policies that is what hes talking about just to be clear chis crispy of course his jumping on this why chis charity's stone traces beyond me chis christy is going to be the rational for why down trumpwin's new samphire if he stays in right now his membership in that race is keeping mickey hailed from being neck and neck with trump but he saying in anyway for no reason that anyone can discern he is currently running by the way fourth in new samphire afteronisantis sauthenaca africa aria emigrants poisoning the blood of our country the words of the leading republiconpessineuncs o candidate your response again that is not a he is disgusting and what he is doing is dog within to america who feel absolutely under stress and strained from the economy and from the conflicts around the world he is dog wist it to blame with our people from areas that do not look us and look cake the other oil it's in alright and the by administration to the same thing they said quit to night down trump channels his roll models as he parole at of fit for praise come jungle and quote of good re gotten while running for president on a promise to rule as dictator and threaten america democracy right this is going to be the strict this is the reason they are not cutting some sort of for deal because they continue to believe strongly tat if they run against trump then any deal they caught with re publicans will look a deal with trump they would rather get nothing done in the senate they would rather let you crane and israel anti wan aid all die then give some sort of border deal apparently to the republicans they would much rather sit aside and let all that times that they can yell at trump and suggest that the republicans our fashion trumptools that is the basic idea that that is the only logic that i can i corn for why jobiton has not just cut a ordeal by now that is what literally the only rash now i can think of for why they have not just cut a ordeal which would be a net wind for him if he did it would take immigration partially off the table cause he could say he triangulated on the issue already in just one second we will get too the democratic side of the isle we are hunter biting continues to be a millstone around the biding campaign's neck if you are not a

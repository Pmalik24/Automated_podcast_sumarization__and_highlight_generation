outs new he is get a hold his breath for twenty one seconds and global warming or something all these people are politicians that bring only the best took a speaking of only the best the hunterbidan pleaddeal has apparently fallen apart hand's pretty fascinating to see what happened here because of basically reveals what a sweetheart deal this was in the first place now we were told that there is nothing wrong with the sweetheart die we ere told that hunter bison being given a diversion for gun charges not even probation and then being given probation on tax charges tax evasion felony taxcharges all that was perfectly normal it was totally normal no problem at a and any one protested at it was just because we had a problem jo bison and hunter bison as people not because we were looking at this an sang this dude seems really really corrupt and a lot of us were fearing that this plead deal basically immunized his hunter bison from further charges now there were some gabs that had emerged already pretty publicly between hunter bison and his lawyers and the dona on the other hand the deogjahad sort of implied that maybe further charges might still been the offing but hunter by he's lawyers seem very clear on the idea there would be no further charges in the offing and that his precisely where the judge in this particular case put presser she said what is this plea deal exactly you get even a gree and the answer was they do not according t the nor times judge mainland orca kicked off wednesday's hearing on hunter by is proposed pleaded with justice barmen by telling lawyers they did not need to keep popping up and down every time she asked them question this was not a reflected a reflection of informality it was a signal the choose about to subject them to three plus hours of relentless interrogation over elements of an agreement she described variously as not standard not what i normally see possibly in constitutional without legal precedent and potentially not worth the piper the prince to the judges lay have never seen anything this judge orca stunned the partisans with her scouring skepticism which led her to refused to green light to deal until she received more information from a parties an exhausted mister bison trudged out of the federal district wonton woman ton deliver looking a bit stunned as his lawyers puzzled over what to do next you areal saying yous rubber stamp the agreements of the judge ism not i a position to acceptor rejected i need tod a fur judge orca quickly zeroed in on a central component of the deal a paragraph offering hunter bison broad immunity from prosecution in perpetuity for a range of matters scrutinized by the do ja during its five yourinvestigation the judge appointed by present in trumping twenty seventeen question by prosecutes had written in a way the gave her no legal authority to reject it then in just ten minutes of incisive questioning she exposed serious differences between the two sides on what exactly the paragraph meant cries clerk bidon'sley lawyer see an indemnified his client not merely for taxing gun offense s on cover during their the inquiry but for other possible offense s stemming from his lucrative consulting deals with companies in u crane china and romania procurers however had a far narrower definition they saw hunter bisons immunity as limited to the offense is in covered during their probe of the tax return stating back to twenty fourteen and his illegal purchase of a fire arm in twenty eighteen in who is a heavy ruggeder they said when the judge asked let while to lead prosecutor in the case of the investigation was still on going he answered yes when she asked him hypothetically if the deal would precluded an investigation into possible violation of laws regulating foreign lobbying by don connected with his consulting in legal work he then replied no hunter bide then told the judge he could not agree to any deal that did not offer him brought immunity and clerk popped popped up angrily to declared the deal was now null and void apparently the ffencein prosecution for separated into two tax an they emerged into a circle to had shout a new compromised an official recess was declared clerk agreed to the narrower terms on declared his previous statements certain quit in artful but judge orca was now on convinced she think thither are some secret teal that being cut she turned her attention to the fine prints of the deal that had been struck on the gun offers requiring bisons participate end two year diversion program prohibiting him from using drugs or owning a firer shubjrectud strenuously to how a violation of its terms would be handle typically the do cred independently verify such a breech and bring charges but biding steam successfully lobby to give that power to judge nor aka herself arguing should be a more neutral barber but jug narcs suggested an arrangement could be on constitutional because that would've her prosecutorial powers the deal is a mass it is unprecedented i mean even according to the her times that an on president tod feel what the hell actually went down here well see be as gathering her was reporting from inside the sort from hearts what she had to say member you at the turned team i told the court that there was contra and ti one of t mad a turned for hunter biding a cries park sat as false was concerned a cot the plenty was all and bit i it was an extremely a conplaxlygal the scotch over the last couple of hours but i wen spoilt town to the it does it here that the two parties have been talking pasty tother for months in this respect then you at the turned office says there is an on going investigation and there could be criminal charges in the future a this gap between the prosecution and the defense is a real or is it fay there some pretty good indicators that actually the the people who are fibbing here are the members of the do jay that once this deal was exposed two public light and once the judge put pressure on them tactual say what it was the they were excusing hunter biding from they freaked out and they realized that this would be seen by everyone as a sweetheart hello explaining just one second first where currently days away from the called urban accords the greatest threats o the ostollars global dominants in past eighty years on

corrupt bargain between the do ja and under bines legal team an when got exposed to public light the do ja freaked out and then after the do ja free out then to hunter widens seems toxic weight are you reneging on the deal will share who up is a former federal prosecutor he has a good run down on what he believes happen inside the court room and annymac earthy the former federal prosecutor rite for national review among others he agrees with us here is what charm says quote they s in conversations with people who are in the court room to day and my experiences from a federal prosecutor i think i know the full story of what happened but the hunter by in plea agreement blow up this morning were with meats a little complicated typically if the government is offering to defendant that i will either drop charges or to lined to bring new charges in return for defense guilty play that plea is structured under federal rule of criminal poster a levin sea one ay in agreement t to prosecute hunter for faraviolations or other crimes in return for his pleading guilty to the taxis demeanor for example would usually be see one a pleas this open transparent subject to judicial approval et camera in hunter's case however hunter's play was structured under federal rule of criminal procedure a levin see one be which is usually just a plea in return for a joint sensing recommendation only and contain no information on its face about other potential charges and contain no clear agreement by delta to forego prosecution of other charges instead d of and hunters lawyers effectively hid that part of the agreement and what was publicly described is a pretrial diversion agreement relating to a gun charge guns hunter for being a drug user in possession of a firearms when other words the plea deal on the tax charges normally that up in clue all the different charges from which hunter was t immunized but that is not what its see in the document instead they hid the immunity stuff in the gun charges the pretrial diversion agreement as written was actually much rougher than the gun charge if hunter were to complete probation the pretrial diversion agreement prevented ganja from ever bringing charges against hunter for any crimes relating to the offenseconduct the offense conduct discussed in the plea agreement which was purposefully written to includes for in influence peddling operations in china and elsewhere when other words the pretty diversion agreement about the gun charge sad that if he completes this he will then be immunized from any charge this mentioned in the other charges in the tax charges which includes faraviolations s there trying to hide the ball here said it was not publicly available they put the facts in the pee agreement but they put their non prosecution agreement the profile diversion agreement effectively hiding the full scope of what demo was offering and hunter was obtaining through these proceedings hunter's upside from the deal was vast immunity from further prosecution if he finished a couple years of probation the public would be any the wiser because none of this was clearly stated on the face of the plea agreement as would normally be the case jury's drama tell to rat understood the lawyers were trying to painterential quarter and hide the ball instead she backed the and hunters lawyers into a corner that pulling all the details out into the open and then indicating she was not on to approve a deal as brought as what she had discovered dona then attempting to say basin save its case stated on the record the investigation in to hunter was on going and hunter remain susceptible to prosecution under far hunter's lawyers exploded they clearly believe terror as covered under the deal because is written the pretrial diversion agreement language was brought enough to cover it they bill up the deal hunter pled not guilty and that is the current state o play this is pretty amazing hunters lawyers in do are can go off the will try to cut a new deal likely narrower to sassy judge nor a up but says this procure i doubt if far or any charges related to hunters for an influence peddling will be included which could leave open the possibility of further investigations into hunter bison it fallen if this is sweetheart plea and is got completely blown up by the judge s the real question is why the sweetheart play who presided over the sweetheartpla who made the sweethartpla why was avid wife never given special council powers in order to you know pursue this prosecution thewy that he wanted to where is maricarlan in all this why was not there a special prosecutor who as appointed on the hunter bid matters why instead was this delegated to a somebody who directly answerable to the current to turn general who's directly answerable father of the of the per in this particular case it is pretty amazing the white house yesterday was trying to down play all of this green son pair worlds were s pressorcratory shirt o statement about this yesterday now i know many people have been following the news and delftware to day an going to have a lot of questions and he is when elsetey at the top before i turn it over to mi could the admiral hunter bin is a private citizen and this was a personal matter him as we have said the president the first lady they love their son and they support him as he continues to rebuilt his life this case was handled independently ins all if by that justice department under the leadership at the prosecutor appointed by the form president president for anything further as and we have been very consistent from here ad refer to department of justice and to hunters representatives who is is legal teem obviously who can address any of your questions w i on point out here hunter is not a private citizen he lives in the white house with his father he was given a big security escort to the court house where he plied not gelt hunter bisons question o questionable connections with his father on business and thy entire matter here and as far as the love his parents have for him the president in the first lady what is that is to do with the price of tee in china where is that doth anything the question here is whether hunter bison was engaged in deep an abiding corruption with his father banyan ism's can point out but they think you are a more on they truly do the white house thinks you are stupid the press think you are idiots they thing that the that hunter bison was literally spending his entire adult life going and picking up bags of cash and somehow job was magically getting richer and job was in on phone calls by witness testimony and job was being used a by hunter to threaten people but job knew nothing about this and never benefit from it in anyway that is what they want your believe because they think you are apparently incredibly incredibly stupid how stupid to they think you are we get to that and just one second first

art for hundreds of thousands of dollars than receives a seats on a presidential commission this happen to be a a very wealthy democratic s owner in clear whether she receive the seat before or after s about the paying the paintings but the the the real question is washed about the paintings the first place in the only possible answers to get closer to the bisons ranimunis an influence peddling operation obviously well correenschomp were was asked about all this and shoos well it o ens the others a big deal it'd have to look into it would you though ollienot calling ma over here here war i the som ever he i would not have to look into that i not have not been tracking the this visit you t mentioning to me noble noble it is all it is only mystery rapped in enigma rapper in a puzzle u what a puzzle box this is sike knives out or something who who knows why some y would buy garbage finger painting from enter bison for hundreds of thousands of dollars and then receive a presidential commission who i id i no for gin t be able to sole this one ever it is scan remain a dark mystery for the rest of time meanwhile green show pare was asked specifically about the fact that jo bison is very fond of cracking down on gunners where law biding well what is the deal of hunter er r i here ism going to be i think i know where this question is going and ism just going to continue to say as it release to the the case that writhing in delftware ism just going to not speak to that it is an independent matter wen asked about as support a department of justice even with the question that you are asking me it is up to it is up t if a it is one of the legal ruined matters and it is up to that process that legal process ism just not going to speak to it here that is a lie that is a lie your bin recently talks about prosecuting people to the full expense of the law for tabs ovation he is costly tongue bout people who not paying the fairshare meanwhile his son is having all his waxbill paid by jo bidet's friends if by the way the white house is pretty overtly shifted it is messaging on the hunter biding jo widen matters as chili legmen points out over real clear politics the language does an idly different yet white houseofficials said fortiferent times on wednesday nothing has changed concerning present bins long standing to nice who is ever involves in the form business dealings of i son hunter bison told fox news on campaign trail and september twenty twenty have never spoken to my son about his oversees business dealings and then he repeated that later the next month said i do not discuss business with my son but the verbid shifted in tune when en say's a spokesman for the white house councils office told the washington examiner as we have send many times before the president was not in business with his son as bi rial clear politics at the daily white use reading on wednesday while the language had shifted and if both statements for simultaneously true corner john pier then replied nothing has changed on this you could ask me a million different ways on us question nothing has change but of course those are two very different statements the president has never spoke in with his son about oversees business dealing is not the same thing as the president is not in business with his son as i pointed out the other de in business is a very vague term it does not mean anything i am not technically in business with my wife we do not jointly hold a business together we only have a join bank account charge lar finances what are you talking about it it is pretty incredible that the white house thingsthey'e going to get away with this but again with a compliment media they thing get away with pity much anything that is wives left to the washington examiner and him carney ts report on job and hunter bison's cosine's with the delftware bank years and years and years ago according to him carney as hunter goes to trial on all sorts of federal charges and as the white house squares the president has not had anything to do with hunters cup businesses hand's worth turning back the clock an recalling how tightly interwoven hunters and job's undertakings to ben let us spartan nineteen ninety six when jordan easily one reelection to the senate during that campaign he sold his homes when executive at the delftware base credicard company m b ana for asking price an the bank reimburse the beer for three are thirty thousand dollars of moving expenses as a bit shady but bison pointed out the use of praise for what it sold for however here is what the job man hunter connection gets harder to deny enter bison was the champion at the time of a bankrupts to reform that financial institutions m bank loved m bean e was enter

he is reading real rough life out there jo bison completely free of all criticism from the likes of oil be golfer despite the fact that he is no longer functional and the fact that he is pretty obviously corrupt and has been corrupt for years with the sun hunter and is one here will be golberig explain why hunter tested his own daughter in twenty nineteen sand pad was bills that is all wont please explain but know it what whenever republican target democrats was republicans are mean whenever democrat's target republican it is because those republicans must be in lead with ladrapouten or some such nonsense is people traffics on nothing but rumor and innuendo for four long years in a a de to under mind donaltrom's precedency jo bison the same rumors innuendo this actual evidence from hunter billion and his business partners talking that josinvolvemen and she is at what is the ideal no problem what soever pretty incredible stuff can meanwhile yesterday miss mconall had a pretty significant health scare is at a press conference and just sort of froze up for a long time lot people we are suspicious that he might actually be having a stroke a argroperaturnan or sterner n and he nod hies to some is e here who stern waver on his thee and then they died him way if he a hotiyewean obviously something has happening naturally were not on to get the full truth about what his happening because you never get the full truth on these matters sent it mi nerdy later c call stop speaking abruptly during the opening remarks of his weekly press conference on wednesday who is briefly escorted away my call a later said the eighty one year old feel lightheaded for a women that does not look lightheaded by the way and not he came bacsparts to span e the question in answer section of the press conference the incident startled fellow lawmakers and brought in to the open lingering concerns regarding his injury and how long he plans for main as the republicans senate leader my call again is culnelly eighty one years old nancy pollock is currently eighty two years old jobidin his currently eighty years old oral crumps currently seventy seven years old now at some point it might be hooves the america people to elects leaders who are below retirement age now that might be actually something that is worth while doing layabout just below life expectancy average life expectancy in the united states wasn't i thing the my call has been one of the most effective congressional practitioners for literally his entire career but there is something going on and he is unwell and this would make the third senator who is clearly unwell inside the united states sent him dial intine is no longer functional she is eighty nine years old and she not only she not functional everyone know she is not functional and she is still sitting in voting in the united states senate john fetderman had a massive stroke during the last campaign and he cannot string sentences together and the entire press is pretending that this is an is somehow ut a story about bravery rather can a story about people taking advantage of a person who does not have functional brain power what is amazing bout the fedderman story is that he has a democratic governor in his state who will simply appoint his replacement if he steps down the same thing is true of dial finespun and yet the stasis duo is son grain that people we will not even tell people to step down even if there is governor of the same party now what is weird about the state of kentucky is that in the state of kentucky the governor is and sheer my coal were to step down for whatever reason he would be replaced presumably by democrat i which would actually have a massive impact on on the state of the of the current constituency in the senate the same is not true wither its sagancsy for political reasons why republicans would kep my gonna in place even my coal were on healthy he can really sat with fine senor fetderman but it is it is you no again in indicator of just ow just how bad our leadership situation is that everybody in leadership position in both parties now he is really really aged now that was making h media cover to this see an ends at since group to he idea immediately said he needs to go get checked out quickly nan in robin's frozen up a thousand times i never heard anything remotely this from sane gutta when you looked at the length of time i that the senator ting to sort of it'll be unable to speak freezing as as monte described at it was concerning the action look at that take very closely and ism hoping that he will get check out as doctors will look at this as well i a petit mall or many seizure or a many stroke those types of things can cause brief symptoms that as well the bottom line as i she get checked out and shoe get checked out quickly because for some of those things timing really does make a difference gam that may very well be true but have never heard sense good to say anything that about jobidon who frequently loses trains of thought in the middle of his of his speeches ho seems to wander off into walls meanwhile prison be season idol calls she wont n further would there be impeachment proceedings of basin bid from that are you getting another would not be he freesias routinely a judo join is is constantly forgetting where he is an in your one's defending him i wish hin well i i wish no ill he health find any him an being in that ran our outside of it and if the turn we bi an there be in preachment for stating under way for senteinteraptes that is exactly right it a collect tie that questions and prayers a for it is ma canal's help it does raise the question that republicans to rays about mobile and which is one of age and i think importrly at least where i sat i think reave to checked down questions of age in our body politic and focus since that on personal fatness to some one capable observing are they a son mine and the right help to continue to serve the nation of is that is that is that you think it should be about age well yet that that makes sure that nancy blowy and an job never yet asked simple questions ever again on gan meanwhile the new economic reports out to day the g d p came in for last quarter the ecconny apparently grew at two point four per cents according to waste journal the g d ps growth that you wen for per sent the second quarter which picked up slightly from to per sent growth in the first three months of the year means the consumer spending truth the string the spring at a slower pace for both goods and services business investment also strength and from aril through tune with company spending solidly on buildings and equipment the economy remains resilient spending remains very high again what we are seeing is the aftermath of join blowing much money ins become there till tons of money in the america economy comes however our dining back the recession expectations after many had projected that downs from would start in the middle of the year in response to federalserve policy the fed did act to raise spensmark intrestraiht that twenty two year high on wednesday and chief and charge roompalld did not rule out another increase here was drone pawl yesterday announcing yet another rate height since early last year the ephilumpcy has significantly tighten the stance of monetary policy to day we took another step by raising our policy interstate a quarter senate point and we are continuing to reduce our security's holdings at a brisk pace were covered a lot of ground and the full effects of our tightening have yet to be felt looking ahead we will continued to take a dated dependent approach in determining the extent of additional policy firming the may be a appropriate well all of the of pure to be sort of up in the air and if feels the economies to find gravity right now a little bit because we had inflation rates they were up in the ten percent range for brief moment there and now the inflation rates are still i three points something per cent on the annualized basis it ispposto be at two per cent the federal reserve keeps raising the interest rates the economy keeps chugging along and i that speaks too both the fact that the economy's pretty healthy before covin and it also speaks the fact hat we blown much money into the system that still in people's pockets the if eventually things are going to hit the skids now they may not hit the skits fast and everyone sort of expectingthe be a cliff procession there be come point where boom the market just dumps but that may not in fact happen what may in facts happen is a sort of economic stagnation sets in as the spending peters out i i think they'd be fairly likely now the federalreserve does have tools to jack up spending again right if the interest rates are the highs thy been in twenty years that means they can lower the interest rates and they can jack up consumer spending if they active if they actively believe that the the interest rates have put in elation under control but do i think that we are out of the woods here with regard to the economy i have some serious scouts that we are out of the woods as an economy it feels there is some heard kind of countervailing forces that are having a facts of for example the real estate marketyowould expects when the mortgage rates got as much as they have the real estate market would dump the prices would go down the problem is because the rates are high nobody's actually selling their home there is nothing on the market is there is nothing on the market and there's nobody looking to bye and the prices just remain exactly but they were before meaning that because there is little inventory the price there still really high even though the mortal rates are really high it just means the entire market has gotten a lot smaller it the no the amount of turn over in the housing market has shrunk dramatically where is that money this not beings pent on real stay going presumably to other consumer products but it does feel at some point here people r can a run out of money and when they run out of money when the bills have to be paid then they organ to have stare putting their there house is on the market even if that means there can take a loss on them agon i feeling there other shoots to drop on the economathing a lot of other investors feel the same way they're a lot of investors apparently who our saying they can read the feds poker face according to the pastry journal there suggesting that that the federal reserve well have no reasons who increase rates again but they have no reason to say that now they feel as though the the federals are has basely done all its going to do on interest rates and people are kind of optimistic right now if you will get the doggones industrial average over the course of the last couple of days it has been very positive since the beginning of the week again i thing that is because people are getting a little more optimistic about the possibility of avoiding ourosession i i remain a little bit more skeptical of that is possible but i main i main skeptical that you can blow that much money into the economy with no actual effective consequence after do valuingpeople savings the way the you easily out it'll gain just one second

hill about you for now you may ask why my covering this far into the show would not that be the number on news nub is bullyrag ism ism's get ta put out they are right now there are no aliens on planet earth other then perhaps burneysanders there are no aliens o a that they are may be in the universe they have not found us you full say in it now put down the marker give friends motors who suggested this is all evidence that yes the aliens are real and they are here all according it to the near times even by the extraordinary standards of contemporary political theater wednesdays house overside sub committed hearing on you foes stood out there in a somber chamber of the reran house office building a former national an tulgiens official told elected representatives thou es government i sheltering alien space craft after a succession of comakers rebukes wit the characterize as decades of o necessary secrecy and government programs hat studied explain phenomena representative him birch re publican of tenners lamented a cover up he said stretched far beyond parts an politics he said the devil's been in our way an then he listed govern entities including the insult community and the pentagon he said a prevented congress from obtaining government reports about loofa lame just asked you a quick questioner doll troubles presidents of the united states was he not you recall we all recall and do you also recall that when donaltrom was presidents of the united states he settle lot of stuff do you think that if donate from actively knew that there were aliens and you egos in the possession of the united states government he would not have just feted that within five seconds do you think the government is this amazing at secrecy they are this good at secrecy for seventy years or is it that maybe there hiding much to other stuff their own military in competent or the fact that there are a spacecraft or aircraft out there from other countries that they do not know about there not very good at handling i have to acknowledge that it is a great way for congress people to grand stand and whose of both parties yesterday she had representative card most its yesterday is a dome crediflora saying it is long pastime for us to know everything that is to know about unman space vehicles in such for vacates many america have been fascinated by objects mysterious an unexplained and it is long past time that they got some answers the america public has a right to learn about technologies of unknown origins nonhuman intelligence an unexplainable phenomena those are not the words of a siphon twitter account tho that isn't direct quote from majority leader chucshumor that the america public has a right to learn about technologies of unknown origins nonhuman intelligence an unexplainable phenomena a a understand that you all want to play the lead in the next tom cruise siphimovy but yet your you you look you have nothing ism sorry you have nothing really and the evidence that is been provided far amounts to people witnessing things with human eyes that they cannot explain which is half of things that happen on the daily basis for her many people and ism and also people claiming that they have seen documents that they say say things that they have an actually seen to take the former example vacates republican congress person he says that he saw an or but beyond human capability was it the one that that that donate trump was wit the sorties with you remember tat what are we been doing ill cap and when he showed us the photo that you take an i asked why the video was not engaged why we did not have a clear system that worked here is what he said they were out on a testmission that day over the gulf of mexico and when you are on a testmission dispose to have clearer space that's post be anything that shows up and they saw a sequence of for craft in a clear diamond formation for which there is a rat are sequence that i and i alone have observed in the united states congress one of the pilots goes to check out that ti's in formation and sees a large floating what can only describe as an orb again i said not of any human capability that ism that ism aware of and when he poached he said that his had a went down he said that his fleer system melt function and that e yet to manually take this image o from one of the lenses were have the keeps happening how all of these systems tat would provide for the surveillance are they they always go down just big foot s only people of seen big foot and yet a and yet nobody seems to have gotten a really credible good view of big foot that they can then show that we only we are on a planet where every one has a weapon every single person with camera capabilities and you are telling me that that no one has yet taken credible images of any of this magically as just ten just out works again my skepticism it is largely because i feel many government actors this a way for them to avoid their day drop it really is is tat is it is a great way of of not having to actually legislate or investigate things t actually have consequences for the america people i but again it he makes everybody feel kind of spicy inside i suppose on one of the witnesses the re tired major a avid rush and that he told representing nancy maze of south caroling that actually he has evidence than non human bodies we are discovered at a crash sight non human bodies discovery to crashsight he finally found those burned barber dolls that the we thou eased the other t anyway hero if you believe we have craft craft i sated earlier do we have the bodies of the pilots he piloted this craft as have stated publicly already in my new station view a biologic came with some of these recoveries m where they i get human a not human biologic not human an that was the assessment of people of which acknowledge on the program talk to that are currently still the program g again lake maybe rushes telling the truth about what he says he has seen but also if he has seen a document in which another person testified bout something that he thought he had seen from a third sourcelike it i just ism scan go know o ashcan go know couther believe r you do not i do not believe it i do not see the evidence for it and i think all this giant waste of time apparently pressed by orchard about whether people have been murdered as part of a government effort to hide you offs rush said he could not talk about it in a public session there is more evidence that killer canton is murdering everyone around her than that government agents are going around killing people to cover up youofos again tit i represent epic burgess and republican bistoury said the concept and alien species is technologically advance enough to travel billings of light years and gets here and somehow competence enough not to survive earth and craton is something i find a little far fetched yes on that i man go yes on that can meanwhile and a in a hearing that actually made somewhat of a of a difference yesterday that should have actually been of much more concern alahandr may ours was called in front of congress again and he would not answer simple questions bout whether there is a limit to illegal entries into the united states for example individuals who do not it is there a limit yes or no argustmen ism individuals who make it claim for relief under our laws and who'll you you you already release more than two point one million illegal immigrants into this country o since you took office that is e population the size of the state of debrasca once again i would ask you what is the limit there is there one argustmen last year we expelled we remove the proximal one point for million people who did not have the legal basis to remake in the unite states the largest number in recent history the answer is there is not one right there is not there is no limit and as bill malign who covers the stuff an said the situation of the borders gotten fostering mayor's time an office by every single metric backpack yours highest migranteth's in history back back yours of heist recorded at legal crossington history one point five million plosion roadways highest number of on accompany miners and record to history f the a rampant human smuggling backs back yours highest terror washiest en counters in history record dentinal bodies in smuggling cartels enrich and control on parts of the border and yet all hunter medical siting there saying that everything works just fine in facts he said that he is he is he is doing great he says our preach to mashing the border it is working beautifully here is matrices i reproach to managing the borders securely uncomely even within our fundimently broken imigracien system is working o well i mean if you believe that one i have a bridge and bookman that is forsake already time for a quick thing that i and then some things that i hate things that i to day there is an amazing opinion piece by a person named blithe robber sin over at the washington post and it is called i was immerse in hook up culture and toll bovid force me into intimacy and this person blithe robbers in talks about how she is som a person who gets around shall we say wo i would never would have consented to having a boyfriend of covenhad force me more precisely i would have had a boy friend for about three sons then baled which is what i was about to do in march twenty twenty i was twenty nine had been dating new york city for my entire tut life which had meant in the best case in aria going to a man's house once a week having sac maybe ordering woodland then going home it was not just that i was particularly attracted men an capable of motion emotional intimacy though dog twas also that i and all the young people i knew where moron hook up culture a phrase i hate but that is also sadly accurate be for cove nineteen we dated a lot of people at once and took our time before picking just one and settling down it is what by logical anthropologist teller fissure describes has slow love though in my case id never reach the love part after years of dating this way i was becoming a guy and capable of emotional intimacy in my late twenties i decided i should least tried to call some one i some one my boy friends by pictiguy and right away i found the experience mortifying who was this person who need hot and fun the surface but also made baffling decisions who took longs get ready to go anywhere who was in conveniently an entire human being you're s eating long distance he was in malarky but march twenty twenty i sided i did not being tied to a person outside of me especially when therefore many other options i flue to see him then covet happen they stay together and apparently this i this person enjoyed actual relationships and then endear moving on of course because of course this person writes it dating long distance we would basely live together any time we we in the same state but living together for three days is very different from living together with no end point in the middle of historic period who is defending features you can legally hang out only with your housemates before my boy friend it'd spent the right at a man's foremost exclusively in the case fen in for seen it made major weather even it'd worry what my tossing in turning a noise at this my what if i fart in my sleep with my boy friend i learned the joins of cuddling with out o clock taking in the back of my mind i lead how nice it is to spend a morning thinking you are falling for someone even if those feelings are just the reflected glow of the factory eating breakfast objectively the best meal of the day during covet i learn that even if i was not constantly thrilling even if my boy friend and i were genuinely different all the ways that originally mortified me at the end of the day i just spending time with him and ism then this person says i was in two more long distance things after that the first during the delta variant way of the second with the guy message on hinge they eat or nine of am drawn those relationship t are now over although i still are a mask on the subway and wash my hand now instead of touching every grows thing in the city and then immediately eating a sandwich covet feels over too but ism grateful for how quickly i built intimacy with those men without the pandemic restrictions i do not think i would know that after my set hare cooks just food i love doing all his dishes i decided the actually is feminist i told each of those three men that i love them don't you now be even better marriage i know this is crazy talk you constructed an entire sexual revolution round the idea that people wo be happier if they hopped in out of the sack with random and then it turns out that women in particular are not particularly happy with that and when they are forced into isolation with they do by covet that shut quite it but because they have been train that marriage is bad and that long term commitments longer than a few months is bad they break up again and you have telling three doors you love them as post settling down with one do but it is incredible how the sexual revolution it is a failure on every single level and yet the people who promulgated the sexual revolution are totally in capable of seeing it they are bunch of stroppy an readings that have come up about the baby mob for example and ism maxtlakindf into them many of the strousyan readings ghastly make the argument tat the baby move is an argument against feminism because the feminist world presented by baby is really quite garbage the women are actually happy a for brief moment in kendo than they are in baby land why because baby land reflects the glow of second way feminism second my f emit has has ben terrible for women it is made women miserable instead of having a balance life it is told them to put off the most i portent parts of their life namely marriage and child bearing ins favor of the least i portent parts of their life namely making partner to major lawful and now that women are kind of waking up to it it is in was take a while for many women to wake up to it because they have been inculcate in the idea that this is virtue now the new virtue is rejecting the patriot not actively seeking continuance with the natural law rejecting the p rejecting all of that there the the search for oftenticity but with there finding women is that what w men authentically want is not what they were told by the feminist movement women authentically want and a sooner or later it getting on on a large number of women that that happens to be the case and life is going to change in fact i think that is arty starting to sedan look a time for a quick thing that i hate speaking of things that i hate now because hollywood has no ideas a hollywood has decided that the success of the baby move means it is time for a lend unjam move directing jolly pocket we have now don a mower tings all over the placebo we he the blackberry move we have the retros move we had the that the hot cheetahs move we have had a bunch movies about eighty's product deny babies rename now we are getting the jolly pocket move that is going to be directed by lend unjam who is a trash person menlena dunham's her her book in which she talks about effectively sexually abusing her small sister i it is not great bob aside from being a promulgator of precisely the worst kinds of mum of morality that the sexual revolution has to offer in series girls now they are going to have bit they are now taking what you can say at at it is most sort of t e amandine is that these are adult directors lend unjam is not into rector of children film she became famous for the extraordinarily sexually graphic h bestial girls and there taking her and they are saying why do not you do the jolly pocket move i i suppose they say that do they are almost ready to go on this apparently matellexacts say hat there is already a great script ism i doubt that because they would certainly did not have a great script for baby they are also going to on put in's development homes and friends america girl and barney i assume that america girl will actually be turned into a feminist icon who scorn to america and believes that america was founded in sixty nineteen homes and friends will be about a gay train or something and barney will be about a purple dine for railing against global climate change which is putting his friends and and family in danger because people drive cars i can only imagine this is were they are going with all this the hot wheels move by to there doing a hot wheel's move that is a going to be produced by j j arms as well shore mature this is real con set it seems parodic i this is from variety but i shall assure that this is not actually apparently o gas stupid the barney move will be produced by dance collude i apparently the a the tell executives say it is going to be more being john malkelvitch or adaptation ism not getting that is what it says in variety the hot wheels move will be grounded and giddy i i can i just cannot i cannot believe this is is real i can't is got to be fake right i there is no way there is no way ah e leg the homes and friends there they are saying the abet that this cannot be real i kit whatever it cannot it cannot be real there is thing homes and find will be directed by mark forester of run lousy and monsters ball they cannot be real it is it everybody's buying it and it is not aril fools ism superconcerned that a either everyone is really gullible or it is real and i cannot tell the difference and i'llbe asked the i literally cannot tell the difference skip ism shknalat i go because have no clue have no club already goes the rest the show continues right now you are not nor misfit it'll be speaking with the attorney for derrick covin

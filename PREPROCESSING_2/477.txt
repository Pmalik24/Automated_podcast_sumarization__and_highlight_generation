welcome to the superman japonicas science science face to s for i manner supermen and om a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine this pod cast is separate from my teaching research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desiring effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and since related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens at lentic greens is an a in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athletic greens once or twice o day is that t helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which our vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called got microfilm and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens it get the vitamins i need the minerals i need and the phobics to support my microfilm if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stucco slash supermen and claim a special offer they give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitemend three k too there are ton of stand ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if for getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient in vitemend three and k too is also important because it regulates things carvascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic greenstone come slash supermen to claim the special offer of the fivfree travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar have talk many times before on this podcast about the key roll of hydration and electrolytes for nerve sell function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium and potassium present in the preparation all of those cells function properly and all our bodily system can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the preparations of electrolytes if you to try element you can go to drink element that is element do come slash supermen and you will get a free element sample pack with your purchase there all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to element element do come slash huger this month we have been talking about the senses how we detect things in our environment the last episode was all about vision how we take light and convert that information into things that we can perceive colors and faces and motion things of that sort as well as how we use light to change our biology an ways that are subconscious that we do not realize things mood and metabolism and levels of alertness today we are going to talk about chemical sensing we are going to talk about the sense of smell our ability to detect odors in our environment wearealso onto talk about taste our ability to detect chemicals and make sense of chemicals that are put in our mouth and into our digestive tract and we are going to talk about chemicals that are made by other human beings that powerfully modulate the way that we feel our hormones in our health now that last category are sometimes called pheromones however whether not pheromones exist in humans is rather controversial there actually has not been a clear example of a true human personal effect but what is absolutely clear what is undeniable is that there a chemicals that human beings make and release in things tears on to our skin and sweat and even breath that powerfully modulate or control the biology of other individuals in fact right now even if you are completely alone your chemical environment internally is being controlled by external chemicals your nervous system and your hormones and your metabolism or being modified by things in your environment or can a talk about those it is an absolutely fascinating aspect to our biology it is one of our more primordial meaning primitive aspects of our biology but it still very active in all of us to day this episode believe it are not will have a lot of tools a lot of protocols even though ism guessing most of you can probably smell your environment just fine that what you to eat and what taste good and what does not taste good to you to day's episode is going to talk about tools that will low you to actually leverage these chemical sensing mechanisms including how you smell not but how you smell in the qualitative sense below you smell in the verb sense the action of sniffing and smelling to enhance your sense of smell and to enhance your sense of taste as well believe ore not to enhance your cognition your ability to learn and remember things everything we are going to talk about as always is grounded in quality put reviewed studies from some excellent laboratories it'll provide some resources along the way that means tools and protocols and also basic information you are going to learn a ton of neural science and a lot of biology in general and i think what you will come to realize by the end is that while we are clearly different from the other ani male there a are aspects to our biology that are very similar to that of other animals in very interesting ways before we dive into chemical sensing i wanted just briefly touch on a few things from the vision episode one is a summary of a protocol i covered thirteen protocols last episode if you have not seen that episode check it out those protocols will allow you to be more alert and to see better over time if you follow them all of the me zero cost you can find any in all of them at superman lab doc come there is a link to those videos and tools and protocols everything is time stamped the two protocols that i just want to remind everybody of a the protocol of near far viewing that all of us regardless of age should probably spend about five minutes three times a week doing some near far viewing exercises that would be bringing a pen or pencil up close to the point where you are about to cross your eyes but you do not cross your eyes and then out at some distance and then look be on that pen or other a object that you are using off as far as you can into the distance you be great if you could do this on a balcony or back and then look way off in the distance and then bring it back in this is going to exercise that accommodation reflects the change in the shape of the lens can help offset a number of things including myopia near sightedness the other one is this incredible study that showed that two hours a day outside even if you are doing other things while you are outside can help offset myopia and near sightedness trying get outside it is really the sunlight and the blue light right ruins been demonizing blue light out there but blight is great provided it is not supersuperbright a and really close to your eyes blight is terrific if it comes from sunlight two hours a day outside is going to help offset myopia near sightedness that is a lot of time i think most of us are not getting that time but since you can do other things gardening or reading or walking or running if you can get that two hours outside your visual system and your brain will benefit i also would to make one brief correction to something that i said incorrectly in the previous episode at the end of the episode i talked about lupine and how routine may help offset some moderate to severe age related macula degeneration as well i talked about how some people are supplementing with lupine even though they do not have age real macula degeneration with the idea mind that it might help offset some vision loss as they get older i said line and lupine was the correct thing to say but once or twice when i started speaking fast i said leucine and not routine i want to emphasize that lupine and a monoacid very interesting in portent for muscle building covered an previous episodes but routine el ut e i n is the moleculing compound that i was referring to in her s of supplementing forsake of vision i apologize please forgive me i miss spoke couple of you caught that right away a enlisting the episode after it went up by realized that it'd misspoken lupine for vision lupine for muscles and muscle growth and strength et camera before we dive into the contents of to day's episode i wanted just briefly touch on color vision many of you asked questions about color vision and color perception and indeed color perception is a fascinating aspect of the human visual system one of the things that makes us unique there certainly other animals out there that can detect all the colors of the rainbow some can even detect into the inhered and to the far red a that we can't see but none the less human color vision provided that somebody is not color blind is a really remarkable and if you are interested in color vision or you want to answer questions about art or about for instance why that dress that showed up on line a few years ago looks blue to you and yellow to somebody else all the answers to that a in this terrific book which is what is color fifteen questions and answers on the science of color i did not write this book i wish i had the book is by agree and on extra that e c k s t u t it is what is color fifty questions and answers on the science of color it is an absolutely fabulous book have no business relationship to them i did help them get in contact with some color vision scientists when they reached out to me and you can know that all the information in the book was vetted by excellent color vision scientists it is a really wonderful and beautiful book the illustrations are beautiful if you are somebody who is interested in design ere art or you are just curious about the science of color it is a terrific book i highly recommend it you just look up it up on line their variety of places of that will a you to access the book let us talk about sensing chemicals and how chemicals control us in our environment there are a lot of different physical stimuli there is light photons which are light energy and those land on your retinas and youretinas tell your brain about them and your brain creates this thing we call vision there are sound waves literally partials moving through the air and reverberations that create what we call sound and hearing and of course there are mechanical stimuli pressure light touch scratch tickle et camera that lands on our skin or the blowing of a breeze of that deflects the hairs on our skin and we can sense mechanical touch mechanical sensation and there are chemicals there things floating around in the environment what which we call volatile chemicals volatile sounds oftentimes e emotionally volatile but just means that they're floating around out there when you actually smell something let say you smell all a wonderfully smelling rose or cake yes you are inhaling the particles into your nose their literally little particles of those chemicals are going up into your nose and being detected by your brain also if you smell something putrid disgusting or awful use your imagination those partials are going up into your nose and being detected by neurons that are part of your brain other ways of getting chemicals into up system is by putting them in our mouth by literally taking foods and chewing them or sucking on them and breaking them down into their component parts and that is one way that we sense chemicals with thing a tongue and there are chemicals that can enter through other mucosa linings and other kind of just think damp sticky linings of your body and the main ones would be the eyes you have got your nose your eyes and your mouth but mainly when we have chemicals coming into our system is through our nose or through our mouth although sometimes through our skin certain things can go transdermal not many and through our eyes these chemicals we sometimes bring into our body into our biology through deliberate action we select to food we chew that food and we do it intentionally sometimes there coming into our body through non deliberate action we enter an environment and their smoke and we smell the smoke and as a consequence we take action sometimes we are forced to eat something because somebody tells us we should eat it or we do it to be polite there all these ways that chemicals can make into our body sometimes however other people are actively making chemicals with their body typically this would be with their breath with their tears or possibly i not underscore possibly by making what are called hormones molecules that they release into the environment typically through the breath that enter our system through our nose our eyes or our mouth that fundamentally change our biology i will explain how smell and taste and these foregone effects work but all just given example which is a very salient and interesting one that was published about ten years ago in the journal science science magazine is one of the three what we call apex journals there are lot of journals out there but for those of you that want to know science magazine nature magazine and cell are considered the three top and of apex journals they are the most stringent interns of getting papers accepted there even reviewed there they they have about a ninety five per cent rejection rate at the front gait meaning they not even review ninety five per cent of what get sent to them of the things that they do decide to review and get sent out a very small per centare of those get published very stringent this paper came out in science showing that humans men in particular in this study have a strong biological response and hormonal response to the tears of women what they did is they had women and in this case it was only women for whatever reason cry and they collected their tars then those tears were smelled by male subjects or male subjects got what was essentially the control which was the saying men that smelled these tears that were evoked by sadness had a reduction in their testosterone levels that was significant they also had a reduction in brain areas that were associated with sexual arousal now before you run off with your interpretations about what this means and criticized the study for any variety of reasons us just take a step back i will criticize the study for a variety of reasons to one is that they only used female tears and male subjects it woudhave been nice for them to also use female tears and female subjects smelling those male tears and male subject smelling those male tears and female subject smelling those and on they did not do that they did have large number of subjects that is good that adds power to the study and they did have to collect these tears by having the women watch a what was essentially a sad scene from a movie they should recruited subjects that had a high propensity for crying at sad movies which was not all women it turned out that the people that they recruited for the study were people who said yes i tend to cry when i see sad things in movies what they are really trying to do as gust just get tears that were authentically cried in response to sadness as opposed to o in putting some irritant in the eye and collecting tears that were evoked by something else just having the eyes irritated none the less what this study illustrates is that there are chemicals in tears that are evoking or changing the biology of other individuals now most of us do not think about sniffing or smelling other people's tears but you can imagine how in close couples or in family members or even close friendships et camera that we are often in close proximity to other people's tears now i did not select this study as an example because i want a focus on the effects of tears on hormones per say although i do find the results really interesting i chose it because i wanted to just emphasize or underscore the fact that chemicals that are made by other individuals are powerfully modulating our internal state and that something that most of us do not appreciate i think most of us can appreciate the fact that if we smell something putrid we tend to retract or if we smell something delicious we tend to lean into it but there are all these ways in which chemicals are affecting our biology and interpersonal communication using chemicals is not something that we hear that often about but it superinteresting let us talk about smell and what smell is and how it works i man to make this very basic but i am going to touch on some of the corps elements of the our biology here is how smell works smell starts with sniffing that may come as no surprise but no volatile chemicals can enter our nose unless we inhale them if our nose is e eluded or if we are actively exhaling its much more difficult for smells to enter our nose which is i people cover their nose when something smells bad now the way that these volatile odors come into the nose is interesting then the nose has a mucosa lining mucus that is design to trap things to actually bring things in and get stuck there at the base of your brain a you could each my imagine this or if you wanted you could you could touch the roofer your mouth for ribs the hear about two centimeters is your one factory bulbil factory bell was a collection of neurons and those neurons actually extend out of the skull out of your skull into your nose into the mucosa lining what this means and kind of a literal sense is that you have neurons that extend their little lie dendrites and acts only things are little processes as we call them out into the mucus and they respond to different dormant compounds now the olfactory neurons also send a branch deeper into the brain and they split off into three different paths one path is for what we call innate odor responses you have some hard wired aspects to the way that you smell the world that we are there from the day you are born and that will be there until the day you die these or the pathways and the neurons that respond to things smoke which as you can imagine there is a highly adaptive function to being able to detect burning things because burning things generally means lack of safety or impending threat of some kind it calls for action and indeed these neurons project to central area the brain called the eidola which is often discussed interns of fear but it is really a fear and threat detection some compound some chemicals in your environment when you smell them unless your train to overcome them because your a fire fighter you will naturally have a heighten level of alertness you will sense threat and if you are in sleep even it will wake you up e that is a good things come e an emergency system you also have neurons in your nose that respond to deodorants or comminations of deodorants that evoke a we once of desire and what we call appetitive behaviors approach behaviors that make you ant to move toward something when you smell a delicious cook or some dish that is really savory that you really or a wonderful orange and you say more it feels delicious or it smells delicious that is because of these innate pathway these pathways that require no learning whatsoever now some of the pathways from the nose these of factory irons into the brain are involved in learned associations with odors many people have this experience that they can remember the smell of their grandmother's home or their grandmother's hands even or the smell of particular items baking or on the stove in a particular environment typically these memories tend to be of a kind of nurturing sort of feeling safe and protected but one of the reasons why or faction smell is closely tied to memory is because of faction is the most ancient sense that we have or i should say chemical sensing is among the most primitive and ancient senses that we have probably almost certainly evolved before vision and before hearing but when we come into the world because we are still learning about the statistics of life about whose friendly and who is not friendly and where's a fun place to be and wheres a boring place to be that all takes a long time to learn but the olfactory system seems to imprint seems to lay down memories very early and to create these very powerful associations and if you think about it long enough and hard enough many of you can probably realize that there certain smells that evoke a memory of a particular place or person or content and that is because you also have pathways out of the nose that are not for innate behaviors bringing or repulsion or a gagging a or for that appetitive in sensation but that just remind you of a place or a thing or a context could be flowers in spring could be grandmothers home and cookies this is a very common occurrence and it is a very common occurrence because this generally exists in all of us we have pathway for innate responses and a pathway for learned responses and then we have this other pathway and in humans it is elemi controversial as to whether not it sits truly separate from the standard of factory system or whether not its own system imbedded in their but that they call the accessory or factory pathway accessories factory pathway is what in other animals is responsible for true airmen effects we will talk about true airmen effects but for example in robins and in some primates including mandrels fuse mandrel of these be noses things you may have seen the at the u look hm up if you have an seen them already m a and d a i l s mandrels there are strong foreman effects some of those include things if you take a pregnant female rodent or mandrel you take away the father that created those thesis or sheds and you introduce the scent of the urine or the fur of a novel male she will spontaneously abort or miscarry those medusas to very powerful effect in humans it still controversial whether not anything that can happen but it is a very powerful faremonal effect in other animals another example of the of a foreman effect is called the vandenburg effect named after the person who discovered this effect where you take a female of a given species that has not entered puberty you expose her to the scent or the urine from a sexually competent meaning post pubertal male and she spontaneously goes into puberty earlier something about the scent trigger something through this accessories factory system this is a true faremonal effect and creates ovulation right and menstruation or in rodent its an extra cycle not a menstrual cycle this is not to say that the exacting things happen in humans in humans as i mention earlier there are chemical sensing between individuals that may be independent of the nose and we will talk about those but those are basically the three paths by which smell odors impact us i want a talk about the act of smelling and if you are not somebody who is very interested in smell but you are somebody who's interested in making your brain work better learning faster remembering more things this nexcellal segment is for you because it turns out that how you smell meaning the act of smelling not how good or bad you smell but the act of smelling sniffing and inhalation powerfully impacts how your brain functions and what you can learn and what you cannot learn breathing generally consists of two actions inhaling and exhaling and we have the option of course to do that through you nose or our mouth have talked on previous episodes about the fact that there are great advantages to being a nasal breather and there are great disadvantages to being a mouth breather there are excellent books and data on this there is the recent book breath by names pester which is an excellent book that describe some of the positive effects of nasal breathing as well as other breathing practices there is also the book jaws by mycholegues pal garlic and san drawn with a forward by gridiron and an introduction b y robots upolsky from stamford that is a book chalk a block with heavy hitter authors that describes how being a nasal breather is beneficial for jaw structure for mine system function et camera breathing in through your nose sniffing actually has positive effects on the way that you can acquire and remember information come soul's group originally at you see berley and then at the whitesman institute has published a number of papers that like to discuss to day one of them human tonal factory cognition phase locked withinelation this was published in nature human behavior an excellent journal showed that the act of inhaling has a couple of interesting and powerful consequences first of all as we inhale the brain increases in arousal are level of alertness and attention increases when we inhale as compared to when we exile of course with every inhale there is an exile you could probably double up on your inhales if your doing size or something physiological size of talked about these before of double inhales followed by an exile something that or if your speaking sure gin a changer cadence and ratio of inhales an exhales but typically we inhale than we exile as we inhale what this paper shows is that the level of alertness goes up in the brain and this makes sense because as the most primitive and primordial sense by which we interact with our environment and bring chemicals into our system and detect our environment inhaling is a cue for the rest of the brain to essentially to pay attention to what is happening not just to the odors as the name of this paper suggests human non of factory cognition pase locked withinelation with that means is that the act of inhaling itself wakes up the brain it is not about what your perceiving or what your smelling and indeed sniffing as an action inhaling as an action has a powerful effect on your ability to be alert your ability to attend to focus and your ability to remember information when we exhale the brain goes through a subtle but none the less significant dip in level of arousal and ability to learn what does this mean how should you use this knowledge well you could imagine and i think this would be beneficial for most people to focus on nasal breathing while doing any kind of focus work that does not require that you speak or eat or invest something there is a separate paper published in the journal neral science that show that indeed if subjects human subjects are restricted to breathing through their nose they learn better then if they have the option of breathing through their mouth or a commination of their nose and mouth these are significant effects inhuman using modern techniques from excellent groups sniffing itself is a powerful modulator of our cognition an our ability to learn you can imagine all sorts of ways tat you might apply that as a tool and i suggest that you play with it a bit that if you are having a hard time staying staying awake and alert you having hard time remembering information you feel you have a kind of attention deficit nonclinical of course nasal breathing ought to help extending or making your inhales more intense ought to help now this is not really about chemical sensing person but here where it gets interesting and exciting if you are somebody who does not have a very good sense of smell or your somebody who simply wants to get better at smelling and tasting things you can actually practice sniffing i know that sounds ridiculous but it turns out that simply sniffing nothing doing something this i guess the microphone for to has a smell i guess a pen does not have a smell turns out that doing a series of inhales and of course each one is followed by an exhale ten or fifteen times and then smelling an object an or binge ore of another idem of food or even the skin of somebody else will lead to an increase in your ability to perceive those odors now they are probably two reasons for that one reason is that the brain systems of detecting things are waking up as a mere consequence of inhaling o case this is sort of the a o factory equivalent of opening your eyes wider in order to see more or less once last piso talk about opening your eyes wider actually increases your level of alertness it is not just that your level of alertness causes your eyes to be open wider open your eyes wider can actually increase your level f alertness what turns out that breathing more deeply through the nose wakes up your brain and it creates a heightened sensitivity of the neurons that relate to smell and there is a close cross over ism sure this between smell and taste if any of you have ever had a cold or you for whatever reason you have lost your sense of smell you become what they call anosmia your sense of taste suffers also will talk a little bit more about what y that is in a few minutes but as a first protocol it'd really all of you to consider becoming naval breathers while you are thing to learn while you are trying to listen while you are trying to wake up your brain in any way and learn and retain information this is a powerful tool now there are other ways to wake up your brain more as well for instance the use of smelling salts ism not recommending that you do this necessarily but there are excellent pure reviewed data showing that indeed if you use smelling salts which are mostly of the sort a that include a m on ammonia is a very toxic sent but it is toxic in away that triggers this innate pathway the pathway from the nose to the ligula and wakes up the brainbody in a major way is why they use smelling salts when people pass out this is why fighters use to use or may be sometimes still use a smelling salts in order to heighten their level of alertness is is why power lifters will in had smelling salts they work because they trigger the fear and kind of overall arousal systems of the brain this why think most people probably should not use a monitor smelling salts to try and wake up but they really do work if you ever smell smelling salts and i have i tried this they give you a serious jolt it is sixespresso infused in your bloodstream all at once you are wide awake immediately and you feel heightened sense of kind of desire to move because you release a adrenaline into your body now inhaling through your nose and doing naval breathing is not going to do that it is going to be a more subtle version of waking up your system of alerting your brain over all end for those of you that are interested in having a richer a or deep connection to the things that you smell and taste including other individuals perhaps not just food practising or enhancing your sense of sniffing your ability to sniff might sound a kind of ridiculous protocol but it is actually a kind of fun and cool experiment that you can do you just do the simple experiment of taking for instance an orange you smell it tryingauge your level of perception of how oranges its smells or lemon e demolish lemon i on is lemonoush or lemony lemony its smells then set it away do ten or fifteen inhale follow by thexhalls of course or just through the nose not can do all ten or fifteen and then smell it again you will notice that your perception of that smell the the kind of richness of that smell will be significantly increased and that again for two reasons one the brain is in a position to respond to it better your brain has been aroused by the mere act of sniffing but also the neurons that respond to that lemon odor that lemon or odor are going to respond better you can actually have a heightened experience of something and that of course will also be true for the taste system you also can really train your sense of smell to get much much better when come noble's group was at belay happen to be at graduates ton around that time and every one son awhile it look outside and there would be people crawling around on the grass with goggles on gloves on and these hoods on with our months end they look ridiculous but what they were doing is they were actually learning to follow scent trails in the world of dogs you have sight hounds that use their eyes in order to navigate and of fine things and you have sent hounds that use their nose and the sendhounds are remarkable they can be trained to detect descent these are the sniffing of the on the boy sniffing in the drug sniffing dogs in air ports there are now dogs actually that can sniff out bovid infections with a very high degree of accuracy that can be trained to that there is something about the of the bovid of and similar infections that the body produces probably in the immune response some odors and the dogs are i think as high as ninety per cent in some cases may be the ninety five per cent accuracy just remarkable there are theories that dogs can sniff out cancer the stuff all exceeds statistical significance a still a orbit mysterious in some ways but you may not ever achieve the of factory capabilities of a sent hound but what come nobles it lab did is they had people completely eliminate their visual experience by having them wear dark glasses or goggles s they could not see they could not hear they could not sense anything with with their sense of touch y a thick gloves on but they had of these mass on where just their naval passages were open and people could in a early short amount of time learn to follow a chocolate sent trail on the ground which is not something that most people want to do but what they showed using brain imaging et camera and subsequent studies is that the human brain you can learn to really enhance your sense of smell and become very astute in distinguishing whether not one particular odor combinations of odors is such that it is less than or more than a different odor for instance now why would you want to do this well if you to eat as much as i do one of the things that can really enhance your sense of pleasure from the experience of ingesting food is to enhance your sense of smell and if you do not have a great sense of smell or you have a sense of smell that is really good that it is always picking up bad odors will talk about that in a minute well then you might want to tun up your sense of smell by doing this practice of ten or fifteen breaths excuse me sniffs not breaths sniffs and then interacting with some food item or thing that your interested in smelling motifs these could be the ingredients that your cooking with i really encourage you to try really smell them you sometimes hear this as kind of a mindfulness practice wo really smell the food really taste tho food and we always hear about that as kind of a mindfulness an present thing but you actually can increase the sensitivity of your of your old factory in your taste system by doing this and it has long term effects that is what interesting this is not the kind thing you have to do every time you eat you soft have to be the weirdo an the restaurant that is picking up the had is antenna gamin it up your nostrils please do not do that you do not have to severely smell everything although it is nice sometimes to be to smell the food that you are about to eat and as you eat it but it has long term effects in terms of durability to distinguish and discriminate different types of odors and these do not even have to be very pungent foods that turns out the studies show that does not have to be some really stinky cheese there are chief shops that have walked in tor i just easily gag i cant handle it i just cannot be in there is just just overwhelms me other people they love that smell yet to tune it to york interest and experience but i think even for you faster out there everybody eats at some point everybody invests chemicals through their mouth and one of the ways that you can powerfully increase your relationship to the experience and make it much more positive is through just the occasional practice of ten or fifteen sniffs of nothing which almost sounds ridiculous how could that be but now you understand why its because the way that the sniffing action increases the alertness of the brain as well as increasing the sensitivity of the system no other system that ism aware of in our body is as a enable to these kinds of behavioral training shifts and allow them to happen quickly i would love to be able to tell you that just doing ten or fifteen near far exercises with a pen or going outside for ten or fifteen seconds each morning is going to completely change the way that you see the world but it actually is not the case you actually it requires more training a obit more effort in the visual system in the all factory system and your smell system and in your taste system just the tiniest bit of training and a mention and sniffing inhaling can radically change your relationship to food such that you actually start to feel very different as a consequence of investing those foods as well as becoming more discerning about which foods you and which ones you do not and were on to talk about that because there is a really wonderful thing that happens when you start developing a sensitive pale and a sensitive sense of smell in a way that allows you to guide your eating and smelling decisions and may be even interpersonal decisions about who you spend time with or make with or whatever in a way that is really in line with your biology in fact how well we can smell and taste things is actually a very strong indication of our brain health now that is not to say that if you have a poor sense of smell or a poor sense of taste that you are somehow brain damage or your going a you can t have dementia although sometimes early signs of dementia or loss of neurons and other regions of the brain relate to say parkensons can show up first as a loss of sense of smell it again i its not causal and it certainly not the case that every time you have a sudden loss of smell that shows necessarily braindimage i want to be very clear about that but they are often correlated there is also a lot of interests right now in loss of sense of smell because one of the early detection signs of loved nineteen was a loss of sense of smell i just briefly one to talk about loss of sense of smell and regaining sense of smell in taste because these have powerful implications for over all health and in fact can indicate something about brain damage and can even inform how quickly we might be recovering from something a concussion s o oral factory neurons these neurons in our nose that detect odors are really unique among other brain neurons because they get replenished throughout life they do not just regenerate but they get replenished regeneration as when something is damaged and it regrows these neurons are constantly turning over throughout our life spend ere constantly being replenished their dying off and their being replaced by new ones this is an amazing aspect of our brain that basically unique to these neurons one other region of the brain where there is a little bit of this maybe but these of factory neurons about every three or four weeks they die and when they die they are replaced by new ones that come from a different region of the brain a region called the subventricular zone the name is not as important but as the phenomenon but these neurons are born in the vertical the area of your brain that is a whole that contains it is not an empty whole its a whole basically that contains cerebral spinal fluid were there is a little subventricular zone there is a little zone below sub the ventricle and that zone if you are exercising regularly if your dopamine levels are high enough those little sells there are stemsells they are themselves and they spit out what are called little negro blasts those little negro blasts migrate into the front of your brain and then chili they kind of move through what is called the nostril migratory stream they can a chili along and land back in your factory bulb settle down and extend little wires into your o factory mucosa this is an ongoing process of what we call neurogenesis or the birth of new neurons now this is really interesting because other neurons in your correct in urretna in your cerebellum they do not do this they are not continually replenished throughout life but these nuronsesol factory neurons are they are special and there are number of things that seem to increase the amount of of factory neuron neurogenesis there is evidence that exercise blood flow can increase of factory neuron neurogenesis although those data are fewer in comparison to things social interactions or actually interacting with deodorants of different kinds fear somebody who does not smell things well you have a poor sense of smell your factory system does not seem very sensitive more sniffing more smelling is going to be good and then the molecule dopamine this neuromodulator that is associate with motivation and drive and in some cases if it is very very high with mania or if it is very very low with depression or parkinsins but for most people where dopamine is in essentially normal ranges dopamine is also a powerful trigger of the establishment of these new neurons and the air migration in to the factory bulb and durability to smell now you do not want to confuse correlation with causation if you are not good at smelling does that mean you have lo doom know not necessarily if you have dopamine does that mean that you have a poor sense of smell no not necessarily some people who take anti depressence of the sort that impact the dopamine system strongly well button will report a sudden meaning within a couple of days increase in their ability to smell particular odors and its a very striking effect some people when they are in a new relationship because dopamine and the hormones testosterone and estrogen are associated with novelty and the sorts of behaviors that often are associate with new relationships those three molecules dooming tostostron and estrogen can a work together and oftentimes people will say or report when their newly in love or in a new relationship that they they are just obsessed with or they just enjoy the scent of another person much that they to borrow the other persons clothing or they will sniff the other persons clothing or they can even just in the absence of the person they can imagine their smell and feel a biological response something the will talk more about these neurons turn over throughout the life span and as we age we actually can lose our sense of smell and it is likely an one underscore likely that that loss of sense of smell as we age is correlated with the loss of other neurons in therein in the ear the loss of vision loss of hearing loss of smell loss of the sense apart which are neurons is correlated with aging what we have been talking about to day as the ability to sense these odors but what i to do is empower you with tools that will allow we to keep these systems tuned up last time we take about tuning up and keeping your visual system tuned up and healthy regardless of age here were talking about really enhancing the your factory abilities your tasteabilities as well by interacting a lot with odors preferably positive odors and sniffing more inhaling more which almost sounds crazy but now you understand why even though it might sound crazy its grounded in real mechanistic biology of how the brain wakes up and responds to these chemicals now speaking of brain injury of factory dysfunction is a common theme in dramatic brain injury for the following reason these all factory neurons as i mention extend wires into the mucosa of the nose but they also extend a wire up into the skull and they extend up into the skull through what is called the cribriform plate is a swims cheese tight plate where there going through and if you get ahead hit that bone the criperform plate shears those little wires off in those neurons die now eventually they will be replaced but there's a phenomenon by which concussion in the severity of concussion and the recovery from a head injury can actually be gaged in part in part n t in hole but in part by how well or fully one recovers their sense of smell if your somebody then fortunately as suffered a concussion your sense of smell is one read out by which you might valuate whether or not your regaining some of your sensory performance of course hit will be others balance in cognition and sleep et camera but i like to refer you to a a really nice paper am which is entitled or factory dysfunction in dramatic brain injury the role of neurogenesis the first author is main m a r i n a the paper was published in a current logy and agma report this is twenty twenty i spend some time with this paper it is quite good it is a review article i reviews if the a pure reviewed reviews a and in quality journals and what they discuss is and it'll just read here briefly cause they said it better than i could o factory functioning disturbances are common falling dramatic brain injury t be i in wannabe i significant impact on the quality of life although there is no standard treatment for patients with a with the loss of smell now paraphrasing a post injury or factory training has shown promise for beneficial effects some of this involves i they go on to tell us the roll of dooming dopomeneric signalling as i mention before but what does this mean this means that if you've had a head injury or repeated head injuries that enhancing your sense of smell is one way by which you can create new means to now how to enhance your sense of smell by interacting with things that have an odor very closely and by essentially inhaling more focussing on the inhale to wake up the brain and to really focus on some of the tenants of those smells you might do for instance a a smell test by which you smell something a lemon put it down do ten inhales or smell again et camera you might also just take a more active role in thing to taste and smell your food and taste and smell various things i man please do not invest anything that is poisonous than you not must be ingesting but what i mean really tuning up this system i thing is an excellent review at which weregooed do an entire episode all about the use of the visual system in particular but also the factory system for treatment of dramatic brain injury as well as other methods but i a wanted to just mention it here because a number of people ask me about t b my and here again were in this place where the senses and our ability to sense these chemicals to these two holes in the front of our face are nostrils is a powerful read out and way to control brain function and nervous system function generally just a quick note about the use of smelling salts i have a feeling that some of you may be interested in that and its application if you or interesting that i recommend you go to the scientific literature first rather than straight to some vendor or to the a what are they qualities is still pro science he says pro science the pro science you can go to this paper which is excellent and is real science which is acute effects of ammoniaanhalents on strength and power performance in trained men it is a r animated control trial is publish in the journal strength and condition in research in twenty eighteen and should be very easy to fine i will provide a link to the called pumped idea which is a string of of a numbers and will put that in the caption if you want to go straight to that article does show a significant om what they call this is what the words they use literally in quote psyching up effect a through the a use of these ammonia inhellments and a significant increase in maximal force in force development in a variety of different a movement for those w ebethere interested in ammonia nhellents a called smelling salts a that might be a good reference the other thing i wanted to talk about with reference to odors is this miff which is that we do not actually smell things in our dreams that we do not have a sense of smell that is pure fiction anna who came up with that it is very clear that we are capable of smelling things in our sleep however when we are in red sleep rapid eye movement sleep which is the sleep that predominates toward the second half of the night our ability to wake up in response to odors is diminished it is not absent but it is diminished if smoke comes into the room we will likely wake up if the concentration of smoke is high enough regardless of the stage of sleep wherein but in red sleep we tend to be less likely to smell to sniff and that actual as measured in a number of studies that sniffing in sleep is possible if you put an odor a lemon underneath some one's nostrils in the early a portion of the night they will smell and they will later they will snifscuse me am whether nothing smell or not i guess depends on on then when the showered lass but they will definably sniff and they will report later especial if you wake them up soon after that they had a dream or percept of a the sent of a lemon for instance later in the night it is harder for that relationship to be established its likely that because of some of the paralysis associated with rapid eye movement sleep which is a healthy paralysis call sleep at tonic no one act out your dreams in remsleep that there is a less active tendency to sniff and actually this has real clinical implications the ability to sniff in response to the introduction of an odor is actually one way in which clinicians assess wether not somebody is brain is called brain dead it is not nice turn but bring dead or whether not they have the capacity to recover from things coma and other states of deep unconsciousness or i guys you call it subconsciousness what will happen is if some one has an injury in their their resencilly out cold the production of a of a sniffing reflex or sniffing response to say a lemon or some other odor presented below the nostrils is considered a sign that the brain is capable of waking up now that is not always the case but its one indication just you could use mechanic mechanic sensation so a to pinch for instance or or scraping the bottom of somebody is barefoot to see if there conscious or om shining light in their eyes these areal things that you have seen to movies intelivision or may be you have seen in real life as well well odors and chemical sensing is another way by which you can assess whether not the brain is capable of arousal and actually of factory stimulation is is one of the more prominent ones that is being used in serious clinics as a last point about specific odors and compounds that can increase arousal and alertness and this is simply through sniffing them not through investing them there are data believe are not there are good data on peppermint and the smell of peppermint mini type sense whether you them or not will increase attention and they can create the same sort of arousal response although not as intensely or as dramatically as ammonia salts can for instance by the way please do not go sniff real ammonia you could actually damage oral factory apothecium if you do that too close to the ammonia if your can u smelling salts be sure you work with some one or you know what you are getting and how you are using this you can damage your a factory pathway in ways that are pretty severe yo can also damage your vision you have ever steered up because you inhale something that was really noxious that is not a a good thing does not meany necessarily cause damage but it means that you have irritated the mucosa lining and you do not possibly even the surfaces of your eyes please be very very careful sense peppermint these ammonia smelling salts the reason they wake you up is because they trigger specific factory morons that communicate with the specific centers of the brain namely the amygdala and associated normal circuitry and pathways that trigger alertness of the same sort that a cold shower or an ice bath or sudden surprise or a stressful text message would evoke remember the systems of your body that produce arousal and alertness and attention in that cue you for optima learning act focus those are very general mechanisms they involve very basic molecules a adrenaline an epinefference same thing actually a adrenaline pin offer the number of stimuli whether it is peppermint or ammonia or a loud blast the number of stimuli that can invoke that a adrenaline response in that wake up response or near infinite and that is the beauty of your nervous system it was design to take any variety of different stimuli place them into categories and then invoke different categories of very general responses now a lot about old faction and how the sense of smell works here is another experiment that you can do it'll ask you right now do you hate or are you indifferent to the smell of microwave pop corn some people including one member of my podcast staff says it is absolutely disgusting to them they they feel its completely nauseating i do not mind it all in fact i kind of it i thing the smell of micra popcorn is kind of pleasant i do not particularly it but it certainly not unpleasant some people have a gene that makes them sensitive to the smell of things microwave popcorn such that it smells vomit i probably do not have that gene because i find the smell of microwave popcorn pretty pleasant some people hate the smell of cilantro some people in gest a asparagus and when they urinate they can smell the asparagus in a very pungent way other people cannot smell it at all these are variance indenes that in code for what are called olfactory receptors each all factory sensory neon expresses one dormant gene one gene that codes for receptor that responds to a particular odor if you do not have that gene you will not respond to that odor the reason why some people find the smell of migrate pop corn to be very noxious putrid in fact is because they have a gene that allows them to smell the kind of putrid odor within that other people who lack that get just simply cannot smell it we are not all the same with respect to our sensory experience what one person finds delicious another person might find disgusting it'll give a good example which is that i absolutely despise gorgansola and blue cheese i absorb despise it it it smells and tastes dirty moldy socks to me some people love it they crave it actually some people get a visceral response to it and we will talk about how certain tastes can actually evoke very deep biological responses even hormonal responses when we talk about taste in a few minutes but there are these odors for instance in pop corn its the molecule two acetate one proline not proline but proline that gives off to some people me a toasted smell as the sugars in the colonel's heat but the compound is also found in things white bred in jasmine rise which do not have as pungent an odor but some people smell that and it smells cat urine now there are sense musky sense and musty sense that are secreted by animals sucks and other animals of the called muscular family these would be ferrets and other animals that can spray and response to a fear or if they just want a make territory because they want ay that is mine dogs intently have sent glands of the rub on things cats have them to this musky odor some people find actually quite pleasant some people find it to be very noxious and that will depend of course on the concentration right it'll never forget the first t me costello got sprayed by a skunk and it was awful i she do not mind the smell of skunk at a distance om it is actually e limit pleasant i admit it is a limit pleasant to me it'd only the makes me too weird because if you ever read the book all's quite on the western front about world wore one there's a description in there about the smell of skunk at a distance being mildly pleasant the author of that book probably shared a similar o factory profile a to me or i to them rather but some people find even the tiniest bit of the smell of skunk or must to be noxious or awful now of course in high concentrations it is really awful and unfortuning for costello he was literally red eyed and just snorting and it was awful there is a joke about dogs at says it dogs a either get skunked one time and never again or fifty or a hundred times costello has been skunk no fewer ism not making this up has been skunk no fewer than a hundred and three times and that is because if he sees something or hear something the bushes he just goes straight and he does not learn but if you this the musky sent or musky sent well that says something about the genes that you express in your factory anurans it is in completely inherited and if you do not that see if it is really noxious or you one this responser micro popcorn will that means you have a different compliment a different a constellation if you will of genes that make up for these old factory sensory anurans and the receptors that they express let us talk about taste not whether not you have taste or you do not have taste ire's no way for me to access that but rather how we taste things meaning how we sense chemicals in food and in drink there are essentially five but scientists now believe there may be six things that we taste alone or in combination they are sweet taste salty taste bitter taste sour taste an mamma taste most of you probably heard of mama by now it is u m a m i mamma is actually the name for a particular receptor that you express on your tongue that its that detects savory taste it is the kind of thing in brazed meats sometimes people can even get the a activation of mama by tomatoes or tomato sauces what are each of these tastes and taste receptors responsible for and they well talk about the sixth ma you can guess what it is i do notion if you can guess it now i could not guess it but of the five taste each one has a specific utility or function each one has a particular group of neurons in your mouth in your tongue believe it or not that responds to particular chemicals and particular chemical structures it is a total myth complete fiction that different parts of your tongue harbor different taste receptors ow that high school textbook diagram that sweet is in one part of the tongue and sours in another and bitters in another complete fiction just total fiction related to very old studies that were performed in a very poorly controlled way no serious biologists and certainly known that works on taste would contend that that is the way that the taste receptors are organize they are completely intermixed along your tongue if you have heightened or decrees sensitivity to one of those five things i mention sweet salty bitter umamiar sour at one location your tongue at likely reflects the density of over all receptors or something going on in your brain but not the differential distribution of those receptors the sweet receptors are neurons that express a receptor that respond to sugars in the same way that you have cones photarecepters in your eye that respond to short medium or long way of length light meaning blue is green is or reddish light you have a neuron in or neurons plural in your tongue that respond to sugars and then those neurons they do not say sweet they do not actually send any sugar into the brain they send what we call a volley a berate of action potentials of electoral signals off into the brain it is an amazing system all these receptors in your tongue make up what are called the neurons that give rise to a nerve a collection of wire nerve bundles of what is called the gustatory nerve it goes from the tongue to the called nucleus of the solitary tracts and some you requested names i usually do not to conclude to any names for a sake of clarity but the gustatory nerve from the tongue goes to the nucleus of the solitary tract and then to the calamus and to insofar quarter you do not remember any of those names if you do not want to but if you want mechanism you want nerd circuits that is the circuit gustatory nerve from the tongue neuclis the solitary tract in the brainstorm than the thalamus and then insofar quarters and it is in insofar quarter this regenteror quarter that we soared out and make sense of in perceive the various taste now it is amazing because just taking a little bit of sugar or something sour a lotto lemon juice and touching it to the tongue within one hundred milliseconds i just one hundred mill seconds far less than one second you can immediately distinguish ah that sour that sweet that is bitter that is mama and that is an assessment that is made by the quarter now what to these different five receptors in cod for well sweet salty bitter mama sour but what are they really looking for what are they sensing well sweet stuff signals the presents of energy of sugars and while we are all trying or were told that we should eat less sugar for a variety of reasons the ability to sense whether or not a food has rapid energy source or could give rise to glucose is essential we have sweet receptors the salty receptors these neurons are trying to sense whether or not there are electrolihts in i given food or drink electrolytes are vitally important for the function of our nervous system an for our entire body sodium is what allows neurons to fire what allows them to be electrically active we also need potassium in magnesium those of the ions that allow the neurons to be active the salty receptors the reason that they are there is to make sure that we are getting enough but not too much salt we do not want ingest things that are far too salty bitter receptors are there to make sure we do not ingest things that are poisonous how do i know this how can i say that even though i was define not consulted at the design face how can i say that well the bitter receptors create a what we call labelled line a unique trajectory to the neurons of the brainstorm that control the gag reflects if we taste something very bitter it automatically triggers the gag reflects now some people bitter tastes actually the taste of bitter coffee children generally sweet tastes more than bitter tastes but even babies if they taste something bitter they will disimmediately spitted up is the gag reflects putrid smells will also evoke these same neurons some people are very pensive they have a very sensitive or low threshold comic reflects you can there was somebody in my laboring a we never do this intention which is laving is it was dramatic how we would have a discussion some one would say something about something kind of a gross a appropriate for the work place but none the less grows we are biologists would say some thing and they would say stops a stop om on a throw up and somepeople have a very low threshold quick gag reflects other people do not other people have a very stable stomach they do not that youknow they rarely if ever vomit the mama receptor is not sensing savory because the body loves savory it is because savory is a signal for the presence of a men acids and will talk more about this but the presence of a men acids in our gut and in a digestive system and the presence of fat acids is essential there is in fact no essential carbohydrate or sugar ism not a huge propose of ketogenicdites normal against them i think it is highly individual you have to decide what is right for you but everybody needs a men acids to survive the brain needs them end we need fat acids especially to build a healthy brain during development you need a been acids and fat acids an the sour receptor why would we have a sour receptor that we could have those really a sour candies i think they have on more and more sour over the ears i admit i do not eat candy much but i do have a particular weakness for a a really good really sour gummy peach or that if the gummy cherries are dipped in whatever that sour powder sot i was a kid who i admit i the a made thing ill li drink the powder please do not do this do not give the garbage cheer kids but i liked it is tasty but sour receptors are not there that you can invest gummy sour gummy peaches or something that hat's not why hat the system of all it is there and we know it is there to detect the presence of spoiled or fermented food fermented fruit has a sour element to it and fermented things will certainly sum fermented foods sour craft and him thee and things that sort can be very healthy for us and are very healthy in reducing inflammation their very at on that pro a quality microfilm et camera fermented fruit can be poisonous rite alcohols are poisonous in many forms to our system and the sour receptor bearing neurons communicate to an area of the brain stem that evokes the pocket response closing of the eyes and a mental shutting of the mouth and cringing away thincringes a thing now my niece whenever i seem to say something or do something it is either an iron a cringe or both in commination the sour the set the salty the bitter and the mama system we are not there that we could have this wonderful pollen of foods that we enjoy much they will allow us to do that but they are there to make sure that we bring in certain things to our system and that we do not nest other things now what is the sixth sense within the taste system not six tent generally but within the tastes on what is this putative possible six receptor i already kind hinted at it when i talked about fat acids there are now data to support the idea although there still more worth that needs to be done that we also have receptors on our tongue that sent fat and that because fat is vital for the function of our nervous system and the other organs of our body that we are sensing the fat content in food maybe this is why i can only eat half but no less than half of a jar of omen butter or penis butter in one sitting i just can unless it is not salt in which case it makes no sense to me but it is remarkable how that texture and also the flavor but that texture of fat i love butter i am guilty and castellan is defiling guilty of eating pats of butter from time to time i have no guilt about this people eat pats of cheese why should we eat a pat of butter if you think that is gross than maybe i have greater abundance of the fat receptors in my tongue may be have a fat tongue than you do but none the less the ability to sense fat here in our mouth seems to be critical you a imagine we y that is i want a talk about the tongue and the mouth as an extension of your digestive tract i know that might not be pleasant to think about but when you look at it through the lens that ism about to provide it will completely change the way you think about the gut brain and about all the stuff we've heard in these recent years about oh we have the second brain is all these neurons and are got have even chuckling through these last a few years as people gotten excited about the gutbrain not because of their excitement i think that excitement is wonderful but we always knew that the nervous system extended out of the brain and into the body and people seem can have overwhelmed and surprised by the idea that we have neurons and our gut that nonsense things sugars and fatty acids and i think those are beautiful discoveries do not get me wrong giegoboreses lap out of duke university is done beautiful study showing that within the mucosa lining of our gut we have neurons that sent fatty acids sugars and a men acids and that when we invest some thing that contains one or two or three of those things there is a signal sent i the vaguest nerve up into what is called the nodose ganglia and o d o s e and then into the brain where it secretes opening which makes us want more of that thing it makes us more motivated to pursue and eat more of that thing that is either fat or mama t savory or has a sweet taste any one or two or three of those a qualities independent of the taste now i think those are beautiful data but we now that this thing the mouth those you listenamjes about my cod fingers of my mouth as w i sound am sonly in my mouth this thing in the front of our face we use it for speaking but it is the front of our digestive tract we are essentially a series of tubes and that tube starts with your mouth and heads down into your stomach and that you would sense much of the chemical constituents of the stuff that you might bring into your body or that you might want to expel and not swallow or not interact with by being able to smell it is it pure does it smell good does it taste good is it safe is it salty is it sour that it is tormented and is on a poison me is it bitter that it could poison me is it savory that yes i want more and more of this well then you would want a trigger open that is all starting in the mouth you are to understand that you were equipped with this amazing chemical sensing apparatus we call your mouth and your tongue and those little bumps on your tongue that they call the papilla those are not your tastebuts surrounding those little papilla little rivers are these little dense and indentations and what dense and indentations do in a tissue is they allow more surface they allow you to pack more receptors down in those grooves are where all these little turns and their ah and their little processes are with these low receptors for sweet ally bit er mama sour and may be fat as well it is this incredible device that you have been equipped with that you can use to interact with various components of the outside world and decide whether not you want to bring them in or not just as you can lose those of factory neurons if you happen to get hit on the head or you have some other thing maybe it as an infection that cause loss of those one factory sensory neurons you can also lose taste receptors in your mouth if you have ever eaten something that is too hot not spicy hot but too hot you burn your tongue you burn receptors it takes about a week to recover those receptors for some people it is a low bit more quickly but if you burn your tongue badly by ingesting a soup that is too hot or a beverage that is too hot you will greatly reduce your sense of taste for essentially all taste and that is because those neuron sit very shallow beneath the tongue surface and that if you put something too hot on the you little just burn those neurons away luckily those neurons also can replenish themselves those neurons are of the parietal nervous system and all peroferald system anurans they can replenish or regenerate if you burn your mouth in about a week or loosely sooner you will be able to taste again in fact everybody's ability to taste is highly subject to training you can really enhance your ability to taste and differ and taste the different component parts of different foods simply by paying attention to what you are trying to taste this is an amazing aspect of the taste system i think more than any other system the taste system and perhaps the smell system as well can be trained that you can learn to pick out the tones if you will of different ice cream or different beverages imsomeboy who i do not drink much alchaul i occasionally have a drink or something but while ago i got to taste o bunch a differing white to keels these are different kinds of titular that are they are not brown their white and i sort of assume that altikillo was disgusting that was my assumption before doing this and the i tasted a couple white kills and rabatos aren't are not too bad i taste we a few more d the pretty soon i could really start to detect the new wants and the difference and i haven had a kill in a long time now i for of tend to not drink it all these taste but in a very short period of time a couple of days i got very good at detecting which things i liked and i could cere to pick out tones ism not a wine drinker but for those of you that are you here about you no has floral tones or bury tones or chocolate tones ye some of that is just kind of men you base and kind of marketing base om silliness om design to get you excited about what you are about to ingest but some of it is real and for p people that are skilled in om assessing wines or assessing foods not much more of an eater than a drinker you can really start to develop a sensitive polite a nuanced polite through what we call top down mechanisms this old factory quarter that takes these five may be the six fat receptor to information and tries to make sense of what is out there in the world and what what its utility is as it good is it bad to don't more of it or less than it that neural circuitry is unlike other curl circuitry and that it seems very amenable to behavioral plasticity for whatever reason and we could talk about what those reasons might be it is interesting sometimes to think about how your taste literally chemical taste is probably very different than that of other people how a for tastes you is probably very different than how it tastes the somebody else the same probably cannot be said of something vision or hearing unless your somebody who has perfect pitch or your color vision is disrupted am or youromantis shrimp chances are when we look at the same object two people are seen more or less the same object or perceiving it in a very similar way there experiments that essentially establish that now we have taste receptors and ta lot of those tastes receptors that chemical structures are known they come with on fancy names the t an or water the t one are to which were identified as the sweet and mama receptor it what s interesting is that this mama flavor is the savory flavor rather that sens by mamma receptors is very close to the receptor that detects sweet things similarly bitter is sensed by a whole other set of receptors now this it there is a fun naturally occurring experiment that a will forever change the way that you look at animals and the way certainly that i think about dogs and costello in particular carnivorous large animals tigers and some grizzly bears for instance we know that they have no ability to detect sweet they do not actually have the receptors for detecting see on their tongue but there concentration of mamma receptors of their ability to detect savory is at least five thousand times that which it is in humans in other words if i eat a little piece of stake or costello eats a little piece of stake that stake probably tastes much much more savory then it does to me dogs and tigers and bears et camera they are going to taste savory things and smell savory things with they much higher degree of sensitivity but they cannot taste sweet things other large animals which are mostly survivors the panda bear for instance charitably that thing is even a bear i got nothing against pandas i just think that they get a little bit too much of the limelight frankly am no vent pagans panda save the pandas they replenish all the pandas but candles in all their whatever have no mama receptors they cannot taste savory but they have greatly heightened density of sweet receptors there they are eating these whatever bamboo all day or of not bamboozle but bamboo all day and they can taste things and that are very sweet with a much higher degree of intensity and in general animals that are more gentle more up be that are survivors souse me or animals that have the propensity for aggression that is where you really see the divergence of the mum receptor because the associate with meat and a monoacid and where you see the enhancement of the sweet receptors for animals that eat a lot of plants and fruits and they probably taste very different to them than they do to you and meat and it is interesting to note that animals that eat meat that eat other organisms can actually extract more savory experience from that what does this mean for you are are t do associate yourself as the tiger or grizlybearer or panda or commination of both most people are omnivore however you may find it interesting that people that for instance eat a pure carnivore type diet or quite diet where they are ingesting a lot of meats therefore are sensing a lot of mama flavors and i realize not everyone whose quite eats meat but those who do that will develop a more sensitive polite and likely there are some data although early data craving for mama foods whereas people that eat a more plantable diet are likely developing a heighten sensitivity and desire for and may be even opening response to sugars and plant base foods now this is mi partial attempt to reconcile the can of online battle that seems to exist between plant base verses animal base om purely plants a purely animal base diets think most people are omnivore but its kind of interesting to think that the systems or plastic such that people might want more meat if they eat more meat people might want more plants if they eat enough plants for a long period of time and this might explain some of the chasm that exists between these two groups now this is not to say anything about the ethical or the environmental impacts of differnthings even one a get into that because the met people say that the plant base diets have as much the negative impact as the plant people say that the meat base editor that is a totally different discussion when talking about here is food craving and food seeking and one's ability to detect these mamma savory flavors is going to be enhanced by ingesting more meat and less activation of the sweet receptors in other words the more it meat you eat the more you can become a tiger to speak and the more that you avoid the see mama flavors and meats and the more that you would eat plantable foods and particular sweet foods the more you will likely suppress that mama s them and that you will have a heightened a desire for appetite for and sensing of sweet foods or foods that contain sugars what am about to tell you is going to seem crazy but is extremely interesting with respect to taste and taste receptors remember even though we can enjoy food and we can involve our sense of what is tasty or not tasty depending on life decisions environmental changes et camera the taste system just the old factory system in the visual system was lay down for the purpose of moving towards things that are good for us and moving away from things that are bad for us that is the kind of core function of the nervous system well taste receptors are not just expressed on the tongue they are expressed in other cells and other tissues as well some of you may be able to imagine foods that are delicious to you that they make your entire body feel good or foods that are horrifically awful to think about let alone taste that they create a whole body shuddering or kind of repellent type response where you just either cringe or turn your face away even in the absence of that food the sort of how i feel about pungent organs laches if you organzologies i do not judge you i just that is an individual difference i happen to love certain foods i do savory foods very much i when i think about them they just they make me feel good and i oftentimes not even associating with the taste of those foods its feels almost a visceral thing what turns out that some of the tastes receptors extend beyond the tongue that they actually can extend into portions of the got and digestive system and if that is not strange enough turns out that some of the tastes receptors are actually expressed on the ovaries and the testes what that means is that the gonads the very cells and tissues and organs in our body that make up the reproductive axis are expressing taste receptors was how do we interprets does this mean that when you eat something that is very savory or a very sweet for insane that its triggering activation of the ovaries or of the testes well it is possible now how those molecules those chemical molecules would actually get there is in clear the digestive track does not run directly to the testes are to the ovaries but none the less what this means is that chemical sensing of the very things that we detect on our tongue n that we call taste in quotes in food is also evoking cellular responses within the reproductive gonads now whether or not this under lies the positive association that we have with certain foods is not clear but i be remiss if i did not point out the obvious which is that the relationship between the sensual nature of particular foods and sensuality generally and the reproductive axis is something that is been covered in many movies therefore entire movies that are focused on the relationship between for instance chocolate and love and reproductive behaviors or a certain fest of meat and their wonderful taste and the kind of sensuality around ease of different types of foods but in general it is the sweet and the savory rarely is it the sour or the bitter the salty or the fat and not surprisingly perhaps it is the tea two ours and the tea one are the the receptors that a associated with the sweet and with the mama the savory flavors that are expressed not just on the tongue and in portions of the digestive tract but on the gonads themselves what does this mean does this mean that eating certain foods can stimulate the gonads maybe there is no data that immediately support that right now but this is an emerging area if you to read more about this there is a great review entitled taste perception from the tongue to the testes although they do also talk about a the ovaries why they did not include that in the title as i think reflection of the or bus of the author the author a in not incidentally is a fang lee last lasting el e a is a very interesting paper on published in molecular human reproduction ah you can find it easily on line down lovable also provide a link to it i just think it is fascinating that these taste receptors are expressed in other tissues and i should mention the there expressed in tissues of other areas of the body is well including the respiratory system but the richest aggregation or concentration of these receptors from main sweet of courses on the tongue but also on the gonads and i think it does speak to the possible bridge between what we think of as a a sensory or sensual experience of food and the deeper kind of visceral sense within the gut and make even within the gonads as well of something that we find extremely pleasurable or even appetitive that we want ta move toward it we are acting in a return to that general theme in the discussion about touch sensation some people for instance when they touch certain surfaces on furs or or sheep skins or velvet or soft smooth surfaces it feels good elsewhere in their body not just at the point of contact with that surface and similarly if there is the about this one the screech of chalk on a chalkboard it is it is a sound but has a very strong visceral component or sand paper f fingers finger nails on a chalk board not the sound but the feeling right exactly are whole nervous system is tune either be drawn toward a positive or repelled by aversive behaviors why there's this pushpole that exists and what ism referring to in terms of these receptors on the tongue that are also expressed on the gonads is yet another example of what it least in this case seems to be and a positive thing a desire to move toward certain foods and may been the experiences that are associate with those foods i want to talk about a particular aspect of food and a chemical reaction in cooking called the mazard reaction some of you have probably heard of the mazard reaction it spelled m a i l l a r d the d is silent do not call it the mallard reaction and it is not the mallard reaction it is the mar reaction and the mar reaction is a reaction that for the efphysionatos is a non enigmatic browning the other form of non enigmatic browning is normalization although when you hear caramel cartel in it is caramel you think sweet and indeed caramcaramalization is a sugar sugar chemical interaction that leads to a kind of nicely toasted not burnt but nicely toasted sweet taste whereas the mazard reaction is that really savory reaction that occurs when you have a sugar a monoacid reaction remember we have neurons and are gut but also neurons in our tongue and neurons deep in the brain that are comparing the amount of sugar to savory oh and the mazard reaction is very interesting of for you a chemist out there this i can be way to elementary and for you non chemists probably you be a little bit of a reach but just bar with me all these chemicals that we sense have a different structures hydrogen and oxygen and all the hide groups and all these things and basely the mazard reaction involves what is called a free alcaide if you did not chemistry do not worry about its basically got a a group there that cool sits open that allows it to interact with other things and actually through the use of heat and o the process that we called brazing shall talk about in a moment you create a what is call the keystone group now most yule now have heard a ketones to the thing about the keydogenic diet but a keystone group is actually a chemical compound that can be used for energy shot's what you will say you can use ketones for energy but if you have ever actually encountered ketones if you u for instance get liquid ketones a keystone actor and you smell it what is it smell it smells a little bit an alcohol but it has a kind of savory taste even when you smell it of there r other smells that have these taste too but for the mazard reaction which could be created for instance like if you took up piece of meat or if you are not a mediator if you took tomatoes and you cook them in a pan and you cooked it nice and slow till it simmered and almost started to brown and burial but usually if i do it it burns ism not a good cook is callstillopoints out a lot but it gets that almost tango very mama flavor and sometimes it will eve in stick to the pan if you scrape it off it actually you can taste it in your mouth as your cooking it that is the bayard reaction that is that free alcaide group and that is the production of of a keystone group when you smell ketones it smells very much that can i some people to about the ketones i will produce fruity breath and that is true if people are really far into mitosis their breath has a kind of fruity odor that is a little bit of a different thing the relationship between smell and taste is a very very close one and this is why when people drink wine they often will inhale and then sip some of that as just kind of pomp and circumstance frankly i make a big deal of it but they can sense things with their mouth the commination of odor receptors being activated in a particular way and taste receptors in the mouth being activated in a particular way triggers the activation of multiple brain areas they are located with taste and circuitry within the body that is associate with the behaviors that relate to that taste leaning toward it or leaning away from it depending on whether not s a positive or aversive that theyardreactions of very interesting a reaction involving this sugar amen acid thing but really its what its doing is heating up food such that the emend acids are more a available literally in their chemical form for detection by the groans this is a phenomenon that occurs in other domains of the taste system for instance a lot of what is happened with highly process foods is that manufactures have figured out how to trigger more dopamine response by ingestion of these sugary foods and created textures and created mentally design of foods for two purposes ism not out to the completely demonized process foods hid to that in a previous episode but process foods are really designed to take foods that ordinarily would spoil that would have a shelf life and extend their shelf life to turn foods which are not a commodity into a commodity something con be stored and used essentially as a am as a treatable purchasable syllable resource in doing that they change they have also decide to change the texture that you want to chew more of them i have this thing i do not know what it is for those a triacid crackers how why are those things get its my the texture not those layers there just kind of perfectly salty have not have one a long time so bet if i had when now it would not taste as good as ism imagining it but those comminations of texture smell and taste are what combined to activate these different brain areas that make you really want a desire something and the people who make foods process foods in particular a phenomenally good at figuring out what drives the opening system and makes you want more of these things either because of the way they taste and or because the way they trigger naans and your got that have nothing to do with t waste that simply make you desire more f the food in other words many of the foods that are process foods make you desire more of them the it is impossible to eat one chip kind of thing not because they taste good but because in your gut their activating the neurons that active dopamine which make you seek more of those foods independent of blood sugar or anything else you may actually be eating more pendular foods not because they taste good but because they feel good on your tongue and mouth and because the neurons in your gut which are totally independent of conscious taste are triggering in the release of dopamine which is a molecule that makes you seek more of and do more of anything that led to the ingestion of that food there is a fun experiment that you can do which is to completely invert your sense of sweet and sour there is actual way to do this readily when i was a rootstock i used to have a journal club at my house people come over in the evening once a month and we would read a paper typically the wears paper we could find and we would eat food and hang out get nerd did and do for fun that is wat we did and one time some one brought what is called miracle berry and this is in some psychedelic plant medicine thing miracle berry you can o purchase on line its relatively in expensive it actually causes a change in the configuration of taste receptors such that when you eat something sour it taste sweet and what is really wild as you unjust miracle berry and then you bite into a lemon maybeven the lemon peel and it tastes a sweet is a peach and this effect last several hours on definably the uncheckany warnings i do not know what sort of warnings the miracle berry carries but ism sure there is always something youyou can imagine their number papers on miracle berry a or miracle fruit it is called o but it changes your perception of sour at a perceptual level but it does that by changing the activity the receptors in the mouth and tongue now this is important as a principle and it is underscored by experiments that been done by for instance charges hookers lab at column university where they have such a genetically engineer animals such that the bitter receptor is swapped with the sweet receptor or the sweet receptor i swapped with the bitter receptor and what they show is that the actual food the experience on the tongue drives different pathways in the brain here is what they did they essentially took mice and swapped out the sweet receptor and put in a bitter receptor and then what they found is that whereas normally mice would actively seek out and even work for sugar water euros they really that if they replace the sweet receptor with the bitter receptor the mice would avoid sugar water near verse was also true that mice would drink a bitter solution avidly they liked a bitter solution if they swapped out the bitter receptor for sweet receptor what this means is that our entire experience of what we taste is dependent on how we experience that tasted the level of the tongue and a your hopefully knock in a do genetic engineering of your taste receptors but if you to do this sort of experiment you actually can do it very easily using miracle fruit the instructions of how much tensest et camera any safety concerns are usually on the package on should be easy to find and there is a lot of science to support how this works its kind of fun experiment that any one can do and will completely change your perception of any food that your custom to eating in fact you can figure out how much sweet were the sense of sweetness is contributing to your experience of a food even if you do not think of as a sweet food through this miracle fruit experiment you could take miracle fruit you cute a slice of peperoni pizza or chispitza which perhaps normally to you would taste just pizza and you will notice it tastes very different what you are detecting is how much the sense of sweet was contributing to that particular flavor now it'd to return to daimons mentioned earlier true ferimonal effects are well established in animals and one of the most remarkable daimon effects hats ever been described is one that actin have mentioned before on the sodas but all mention again just briefly which is the collage effect the college effect is the effect of a male of a given species in most cases it tended to be a rodent or a rooster mating and at some point reaching exhaustion or the inability to mate again because they just simply could not for whatever reason the college effect establishes that if you swap out the hen with a new hen or the female rat or mouse with a new one then the rat or the rooster spontaneously regains their ability to mate somehow their vigor is returned the refractory period after making that normally occurs is abolished and they can mate again turns out that the college effect runs in the opposite direction too i do not know this but i recently learned of a study it was actually done in hamsters not in in mice but it turns out that females also will female rodents will mate to exhaustion and at some point that some point souse me they will refuse to mate any longer unless you swap in a new male and then because mating and rodents involves the female being receptive there certain number of behaviors that mean that she that tell you that she is willing and wanting to mate call lordosis reflects then if there is a new male she will spontaneously regain the lordosis reflect and the desire to mate and how do this ho do we know it is a personal effect well this recovery of the desire and ability to mate both in males and in females can be evoked completely by the odor of a new male or female it does not even have to be the presentation of the actual animal that is how that it is not some visual interaction or some other interaction it is a hormonal interaction now as i mention earlier personal effects humans have been debated for a long period of time we are thought to have a vestigial meaning a kind of shrunken down a miniature accessories factory bulb called jacobson's organ were the vomeronazsal organ some people do not believe that jacobson's organ this some people do there is anatomical evidence for it in some cadavers it sits not very high up in the brain or where neural factory bulb is but it is actually in the nasal passages there's li little dense as you go up through nasal passages and there is evidence of something that vomeronazsal vomer naval is the personal organ they called jacobsn's organ if its present in humans kind of a talked in to some of the digits in the nasal passage even if that organ jacobson's organ is not there or is not responsible for the chemical signaling between individuals there is chemical signaling between human beings mention earlier the effect of tears in suppressing the areas of the brain there involved in sexual desire and testosterone of males that is a concrete result its a very good result published by an excellent group with no are existing bis going in that is just what they found there is also evidence both for and against chemical signaling between females in terms of synchronization of menstrual cycles now the original paper on this was published in the nineteen seventies by mclintoch and it essentially said that when women live together in group pouring dormitories in similar that there menstrual cycles we synchronize in that was due to what was hypothesized to be personal effects over the years that study has ben challenged many many times the more recent data point to the idea that there is chemical chemical signaling between women in ways that impact the timing of the menstrual cycle but that depending on weather not some of the women are in the ovulation phase the oblatory phase of that cycle or whether not they are in the follicular phase the phase when the physical is maturing before the egg actually a ovulates to two separate phases of the monster of the twenty day menstrual cycle will either lengthen or shorten the menstrual cycle of the person that smells those women translate into english what that means is that it is very likely it seems that something may be pheromones but may be some other chemical that is independent of hormones is being conveyed between women that are house together or spend a lot of time together to shift their menstrual cycle but it does not necessarily mean that they synchronous s i for instance if one woman is in the vehicular has of the menstrual cycle it might shorten or delay ovulation hat excuse me it might accelerate ovulation in another woman whereas if somebody is in the ovulatory phase of their cycle it might lengthen the menstrual cycle out that they the women who smells that persons sent or who smells her sweat we still do not know the origin of the chemical would ovulate later all of this is to say is that chemical chemical signaling is happening from females to males through tears we know that is that a fairmonal effect well by the strict definition of affarmon a molecule that is release from one individual that impacts the biology of another individual yes but in terms of identifying what the farm is in tears that still unknown it is not clear what the chemical compound is we reluctant as scientist to call it a true fairmonal effect the menstrual cycle and the sincurinsation the menstrual cycle effect seems to hold up under some conditions but in some cases there is a kind of clash of menstrual cycles that is created by chemicals that are emitted from one female to another there are many examples of this inhuman for instance people can recognize the t shirt of their mate if you give this experiments been done many times i know it is been challenge number of times but the date are pretty good by now that if you offer o you take a collection of of women a who are in stable relationships to somebody you offer them the smell of a hundred different shirts and they can very readily pick out their significant others sent gan that is rural faction that is not hormonal but none the less is a remarkable degree of discrimination a factory discrimination you can dilute their partner sent down to the point where they themselves cannot consciously detect the difference between the sweat or the t shirt of hundred even shirts or the mig sat i do not really smell the difference but i think its this one yet this one belongs to the person that have been with and they are much greater than chance at detecting the t shorter or identified the t shirt correctly there is no question really that there is chemical chemical signaling between humans the question is whether not its truly fairmonal in basis now you will notice the lot the examples i gave aside from the one of tears is women detecting the sense of men or of other women and it turns out that there are number of papers o the best one i think that i could find am is published in physiology and behavior and two thousand ides a review entitled sex differences in reproductive hormone influences on human odor perception by daddy debt why and camera i ensure you to check out this review it is available free as a down la will pride provide a link to it yuan get the full p d f if you want but it does seem that women are better at detecting odors in these odor disco ruination tass then are men and yes that it does vary according to where they are in their menstrual cycle and yes they also looked at people who had received gonadic to me that have their ovaries removed a number different important controls none of this surprises me none of this should surprise you it is very clear that hormones have a profound effect on enlarge number of systems in a biology and that smell and taste and the ability of sense the chemical states of others either consciously a subconsciously have a profound influence on whether or not we might want to spend time with them whether not this as somebody that we are pardoned with whether not this as somebody that we just met and a do not trust yet things of this sort and given whats at stake in terms of reproductive biology not just offspring but given they a possibility of transmission of diseases et camera of the risks of of child birth et camera it makes much sense that much of our biology is wired toward detecting in sensing whether not things and people are things that we should approach or avoid whether or not reproduction with that person is the appropriate response or suppression of the reproductive response as the appropriate response right as in the case with the tears i think these are fascinating studies it is an area that still needs a lot of work but there are some really wonderful papers on this and the one that i mention a few minutes ago sex differences in reproductive hormone influences on human motor perception is of one of the better views that are out there there also a number of other reviews for instance that talk about foreman effects and therefore impact on mood and sexual responses an things that sort and we will also provide some links to those a lot of this is still speculative but i want to say i know i sat three times but i really want o underscore because it is vitally important and people seem to get a l triggered by the notion of anemones just because we have not identified the actual chemical compound that is acting as a foreman or punitive demon does not mean that chemical chemical signalling between individuals does not exist clearly it does actually you and every other human from the time you are born until the time you die are actively seeking out and sensing and evaluating the chemicals that come from other individuals the really nice study that was done by the whitesmen institute a group there i think it was also come nobles group but another group as well as i recall looking at human human interactions when they meet for the first time it is a remarkable study because what they found was people would reach out and shake hands is the typical response prepandemic people would meet they would reach out and they would shake hands and what they observed was almost every time within just a few seconds of having shaken hands with this new individual people will touch their eyes almost without fail occasional my would touch their eyebrow occasion son touch their hair we always associate that with people having some sort of on or us having some sort of self conscious response you we want to make sure where tucked in and all you know prim improper whatever it is or looking right as the selling in my teeth this kindling but actually people are doing that even if the person they just met left the room some whole sitting there someone comes in they shake hands and the person inevitably subconsciously touches their eyes they are taking chemicals from the skin contact and they are placing it on a mucosa membrane of some sort typically not up their nose are in their mouth typically on their eyes now animals do this all the time there is a phenomenon animals called bunting if you have a overeager dog that ah when you meet them or you see them again after you've been away for the day they rub their head against you right cats will do this too its called bunting they're rubbing their sent glands on you their marking you and believe it are not your marking other people when you shake their hand and they are then taking your mark and rubbing it on themselves subconsciously we all do these kinds of behaviors and now that you are aware of it you can watch for it in your environment you can you know pay attention to people some of this is probably changed in light of the events of twenty twenty et camera but none the less we are valuating the molecules on people's breath we are evaluating the molecules on people's skin by actively rubbing it rubbing it on ourselves and we are actively involved in sensing notorious their facial expressions the size of their peoples and thing that but the chemicals that they are admitting their hormone status how they smell were detecting the hormones possibly but certainly the odors in their breath you might say well i do not actually go round sniffing people's breath an on unless if it is bad in which case it is aversive but breath is communicating a lot of signals and this hand shake cherub experiment shows that we are actively going through behaviors reflectively to wipe ourselves or smear ourselves with other people's chemicals now that might seem odd or even gross to you but a i think it is beautiful i think that it illustrates the extent to which we as human beings are in some ways among the other animals in our subconscious sometimes conscious but certainly subconscious tendency to try and o valuate our chemical environment through what we inhale through our nose what we invest through our mouth and what we actively take off other people's skin and rub on ourselves to evaluate it and what we should do about it and perhaps that person as well to day we talked a lot about or faction taste and chemical sensing between individuals i to think that you now know a lot about how your smell system works and why inhaling is a really good thing to do in general for waking up your brain and for connive function and for enhancing your sense of smell talked abdomen hance your sense of taste and we talked about chemical signalling between individuals as a way of community eating some important aspects about biology people are shaping each others biology all the time by way of these chemicals that are being traded from one body to the next through air and skin to skin contact and tears if your enjoying this podcast in your finding the information useful please subscribe on you to

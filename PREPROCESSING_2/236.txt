important to say certain things practical stuff information and instructions but also this feelings to share we need to connect it is not a homer for big revelations just when it tint the collars in the picture of you to a little bit this way or that mi color for be has been having these daily conversations with he brother demon he is been sick with cove nineteen for over a week now the conversations are totally different than that nurses video all the ways of that nurse o these barret is direct imagining every possible terrible you come one by one and discussing it be madamalarand not into that ism guessing with no evidence i you here that most of us re mark bemendemoar we would rather side step the curious possibilities for as long as possible but in the daily talks the still new information passing between them than the usually share she is in new york damar in the rest of her family are in onion he is four years younger he perhaps remains the most beautiful baby i have ever seen you my life aggressively my mum will tell you oh yet devilasim is beautiful of my baby she she makes no qualms of us that is just rude to sad you rather chit eerie but dwell i was beautiful he was pretty he was a pretty baby he ill has the som this little beauty pot right whey marrying mono had has o well am e and these lashes and when he was very little my sister and i will put him on there was a the was as short so of them short exactly child level ironing bod lives more a table and we put him on the and we would kiss him all over him until he would cry in protest her him tell it dam was relationship with the sisters to day is a faint echoer that his older sister is more expressive with her feelings family i would a bit part happen to be by himself separate island from the rest of them keeping his own counsel very quiet before he got sick been would usually text om talk to him whats a cop of times a week safer was talk abut levy show quite eat bran again from future am to each other and be marking devil whenever is teem arts on always but now there talking every day and for the first time if the radio chat the dailiness of it gives everything a different feeling the subject matter is different to ism asking him did you drink enough water to day what is your temperature did the cough go away is it is it a dry cops a we have the questions on the one hand a kind of very dry and basic but on the other i suppose because have never asked them before it feels extra special now a kind of be asking very specifically what is your temperature and to be able to track his life in this way the knowledge that it went from the he seven degrees and now it is dirty six degrees and n i mean sells he is spaciously er it just feels really a oddly intimate that i know the temperature of his body a cross and ocean even though the question seems really kind of bland on the surface what is a temperature it is a way of asking and it is away i think also circumventing the elephant in the room which is if he had a more serious case of covet nineteen is if his symptoms won more severe if things were really die we just do not talk about is when i ask about his temperature what i am asking is it is kind of a a shorthanded its half language that way you's visit visit as a euros y saying my mum often says which is a speaking from underneath your tongue and in a way i feel i am speaking from underneath my tongue to ask a really serious question but in the most blind language which is all you drinking water was the headache is asking these very basic questions that a basically pushing back my fear of what this could have been that is terrifying to me because the thing underneath it they do not saying is the thing i think ism saying i feel like am screaming it is please do not i i do not want you to die is i she is learning some new in formation about this person she knows well these daily conversations but the sink such a different side of him normal he stoic she says ut now his way more vulnerable wan more opened everybody in the family calling him all the time and asking him questions i think he wants to me foslyver in this lease the little bit i think he liked to the little bit i always see look get more annoying as he gets best and strong again boot be ow he is basically baby in an lining table and within to kissing of by be easy chico is this america life on our glass to day on our program bombs e feel in the gabs an see parts of somebody we have not seen before ut we learn it you be go settle sating round the edges though it all of or stories to day i have to say it is way bigger than that it is people declaring you thought you knew the truth but no no know you did knot not all of it and the part that you did not know changes everything how as ball harbor to say now the rest of the story stay with us i one i cannot be a hero baby certain stories get told over and over about undocumented immigrants in this country one of the bigwigs is about sacrifice about hard working people who work long hours and restaurant kitchens and farms and other go paying jobs to support their families grateful for the chance to be in the ass for the dock kids yo strive and want nothing more than college in the america dream cargo can i how we of his sense as or lots of these stories thought she could do better tost greed no to better essay there are very brief references in it to japan suicide who show when i was the senior in college i wrote an anonymous a say for the daily beast about what they wanted to call my dirty little secret that i was in documented this was in two thousand eleven button data and i was one of the first on document science to graduate harbor the essay got me some attention and agents wrote me asking if i wanted to rite a memoir i was angry a memoir i was twenty one i was fucking barber strand i had been writing professionally since i was fifteen but only about music wanted to be the guy in my fidelity and i did not want my first book to be a rueful tale about being a sickly victoria orphan with to brculoisis who did not have h social security number which is what the agents a wanted the guy who event tally ended at becoming my agent respected that did not find an interchangeable immigrant to publishes ad but bet everything i would write over the next seven years and we kept in touch i was the first person who wrote him on the morning of nonmember ninth two thousand sixteen that morning i received a bent o females from people who are really freaked out about trump winning and the males essentially were offers to hide me in their second houses and dormant or stay in their basements shit i told my partner tour trying to ant frank me by this point i had read lots of books about my grants i hated a good number of these books i could not see my family in them because i saw my parents is more than laborers as more than sufferers are dreamers i thought i could write something better and i thought i was the best person to do it i was just crazy enough because if you ere going to write about on documentute in migrants in america tell the story the full story you have to be a little bet crazy ad you certainly cant be en amerced by america not still that disqualifies yo i did not want to write anything inspirational i wanted to write for everybody who wants to step away from the bustards in a migration the talking heads the dreamers an graduation caps and gowns and read about the people underground not heroes grandams people i wanted to write about my parents and that is the story ism going to tell here the story of my parents if you asked my mother where she is from she's a hundred present going to say she's from the kingdom of god because she does not to s y that she is for maquadore a guard being one of the few south america countries that has not especially out done its self on the international stage magical realism basely skipped over it and our military dictatorship never reached the ethical status that we benorchet or a vested close there are no world mamas aquadorians to speak up other than the fool who has dulcianas on to the embassy an onion and guys niggler's father who she said was a domestic abuser if you ask my father where he is for m he will definitely say aquadore because he is sentimental about the country for reasons he is working out an therapy but if you push them i mean really push the they are both going to say there from new york if you asked them if they feel america because you are a little nark chance to prove your blood runs red white and blue tear going to say no i you new yorkers they have lived in new york since they left aquadora nineteen ninety one i do not know much about my parent decision to choose new york or even the united states as e does tarnation it is not that i have an asked them why they came to the united states it is that the answer is in as morally satisfying as most people answers are the capitate family member gammon and i other passed them for horsetails because i do not want to a fly pressure n a brush the story as far as i know go something this my parents had just got in married and their small auto body business was going well the idea of coming to america to work for a year to make just enough money to pay off their gets came up and it is seemed a good idea they left me with my dad's family when i was the year and a half old that is about as much as i know my parents did not come back after a year they were barely making ends met when i was four years old going to school and aquadore teachers began to comment on how gifted i was my parents knew equator was not the place for a gifted girl the gender politics were two fucked up and they wanted me to have all the education opportunities they hazan had that when they brought me to new york i was just shy of five when i stepped off the plain why america love academically achieving minorities and i learned quickly that the most a luring thing about me was that i was young and brown and a good student the holy trinity i went to a catch elementary school on a scholarship and we lived in queens my mother stayed home and my father drove a cap this was backwhen east new york was still gang country and he had to food his body an to a little ago me swan and hide under his steering wheeler cross

a little bluethum tack on this memory map the first place an how we visit it september element change the migration landscape forever ice was the creation of nine eleven paranoia it changed my father

dollar tip for a five dollar breakfast he always told us about those steps there were usually from porterican reception as who talked to him and punish and ask as he photos of may when he came home with one of those steps it was eating my dad back from the dad he would days to no music and he would make jokes and he would come out of his shower looking a teenager my father did not use a back he

popular vote there are times when you discover an information gap in your own past something you thought you knew everything about after a hat happened to you and then somebody comes along and says no it did not happen that at all what do you do with that new information john cold has a stop that it begins more than a decatago at a high school here shown the school was grenade hills charter high school g h c h s s in the suburbs of let huge more than forty five hundred kids in rolldright now s the largest charter school in the country and in the spring of two thousand seven it engaged in one of the most hallowed of america high school traditions senior superlatives you might have had these at your school kids vote each other most likely to succeed best smile cutest couple mark enticer was one of those kids i eve been embarrassed by mysepoatives for a ten years have d i mean i one most school spirit nobody was to win most school spirited i put all of my closeted gay energy into school spirit i do not a man like i did the morning announcements i with until council i did theater i it i loved high school he also one in a category called all around senior you were allowed to compete in two categories but no more than that and g e c is really put a lot into these superlatives there was an election usual with paper ballast but instead of announcing the winners over the intercom when posting them on a halfway bullet on board there was this event run by the senior leadership council which mark was on a big ceremony and trophies all of the winners received a little replica of the scar statue it was not unlike most all the seniors were in our auditorium and i think i actually now the realize i think i a help give them out i but i do remember reading names of some of my friends and cheering them on and all of my best friends all one things which make sense mark was popular his friends were popular but that was thirteen years ago and he had not been thinking too much about the superlatives until recently i was at home cooking dinner and i got a text for my friend a friend from high school and all i said was please thought we to doing and read this it was a casebook post posted to a private face book group for marks high school class the class of two thousand seven marked to enface book was the first he was seeing it and the text was not just a mark four other bodies from high school were on at his well we all read it and immediately we were all freaking out am i cannot believe this on i got to sick much sense am i wonder if you could just read that host do you have it there tautly am a he said eggs one more thing before i forget an the spirit of the new year i to take this opportunity to confess to all of you that i and one or two other members of senior leadership council of seven who will remain unnamed interfered with the class of two thousand seven senor supplies this is not a job we went to great lands to forge no less than thirty fill about ballast with all of our friends and acquaintances winning their respective categories we attempted to rig literally every category classic ballad stuffing with thirty forged ballast at least the perpetrator goes on to say that not every one he tried to fix the election for actually wine and the nominee for each category the choices on the ballet those were alkanet it is just the outcome that was now in question category again was confession was coming thirteen years after the fact wow i feel ice a way lifted off my shoulders having finally confess this thank you for reading oh my god were now it is not mark has been sitting around for the last thirteen years clinging to his many scar trophy the finding himself by his superlatives since high school he is port his no longer closeted energy into enter ailment worked for entertainment weekly for a long time just moved over to ethics but it is not he thinks he did not deserve his awards whether not he rigged it is interesting to think about who really was rig because me i really objectively was very school spirited and very all around senior and a couple of friends on the text thread felt the same way one of them said do you think people do not believe i had best eyes we particularly were interested because the five of us all on we all wont some different superlatives and we all thought the was pretty school because i think ultimately high school senior superlatives are am man it is complicated right they are absorb meaningless and yet at the time they are such a huge deal because they are pure voted and nobody wants their memories kind of tampered with or invalidated right subconsciously we are all thinking to ourselves oh my go what would eighteen told me have thought about meow that really at the core of all this we are all having imaginary conversations with our eighteen year old selves thinking oh my god he can never now i this will this will proud him this all unravel him to find out which probably explains what happened next in short mar posted is green shot of the confession to twitter on thinking much about it went off to the him and when he came back it had exploit more than a hundred fifty thousand likes and streets in comments at this point most of them not gases jesalums weirdly a lot of people wrote that the same thing had happened at their high school or that they themselves had rage to support election were it always suspected superlatives were raged and now here was proof at couple people pointed out something that i notice too that the perpetrator never actually apologizes in his message i did not know this was going to go viral i though this was going to be shared with four hundred people and mi high school senior class face but page and that was it this is michael barlivav rigger of high school elections confessor of high school transgressions thirty years old now still living in alley and i had about a hundred questions for him chief among them why it took him long to come clean and what it had been sitting with the weight of that guilt for many years you say at the end of the confession em i on ah i feel such a weight lifted off my shoulder cliff o mishllas yet what win is that is that did you no that was just me being a that was just me being cynical in truth there was no wait no gilt in fact michael had wanted to come clean right away but a bunch of more pressing things took his attention he was ignored with cancer actually went through treatment got better moved on it was only when he saw his former classmates talking about a potential reunion on the face book page that he thought of all this again and the thing you need to know about michael unlike mark he was a slacker senior year checked out only interested in his words smoking went and getting lay and then he found out there is a superlative for that biggest case of seniority us and i remember begging everybody in my homeroom to nominate me and i asked all my friends i really want to get senior it's i want this because he was competitive about being a slacker and organized about it he only picked four superheavy classes senior year including he says senior leadership council which ran the election he knew that no one would notice if during class he and an a complice hung out for a while near the ballad box where there also happened to be a stack of blank ballet's handy and one thing michael learned right away rigging an election can be complicated there was actually one category i remember where two girls were we are both nominated nominated for the same category and we were friends with both of them and o we just filled out an equal number of ballads for each of the because it did not want o favor i did not want a favor either one cause i them both was it a kind of thing were other people really wanted as certain superlative or ere i mean you really wanted biggest case of seniority en you were begging people in your home room to nominate you well es let was it let us not let us let us not o crazy i was not begging anybody okay msorryfolks i just pausing here can we go back to that tape we played sixty seconds ago and i remember begging everybody in my homeroom to nominate me thank you anyway votes were in belabor was stuff and it came time for that big event where they announced all the winners the whole time i was supernervous every time a new category was being announced the winners were being announced i was all man is it i being to win this one ire begin to whin this one ire begin to win this one and every time somebody was announced as the winner i was who i that i one because of me or was action the got the girl that i wanted to win did not win or i said not everybody that we tried to u to fix it for one a and then when my friend who held me rigged one his category and tat when i when my category was just it was just sweet it'll never forget it they announced the winners and the winners would go up on stage we got our trophies and then he went back stage for a picture that would go into the your book which was important to him proof of his victory it was the alit a something that i would never forget there would be a page in the year book reminding me and my friend that we interfered with this shit and that all of our friends or most of our friends on their category a wether or not they would have otherwise i kind of wanted to ah make it absurd ridiculous preposterous some of the people who won their categories absolutely should not have won their categories and that delighted him in a diabolical way it did then in it does now the lack of apology and his confession was not just an oversight what is there to apologize for what is there to apologize for honestly ya was an asked ya what i did was dishonest at was shady ya was insensitive but i would definitely do it again the exact same way really if i had absolutely i would not do anything differently i think it is going to be a net positive impact at least i hope man i hope that what people take away from this is that you should not put value into things that are arbitrary and silly popularity and who has the best hair or the best smile or who is the biggest flirt or who is most likely to become president or who is most likely to whatever it is it is just a pinion man it is completely subjective there is no meaning behind it then michael's hearts in the right place but as far as i can tell the person from michael's high school class who is most concerned about these senior superlatives his michael if you squint et it for a second he cared much about getting in a ward for carrying the least the senior rites word that he went to quote great lengths to commit electoral fraud also in the comments below his face book confession and my conversations with some of his classmates no one else seems at all invested at this point and ho one are lost we all you my lager he loose shirasport was a warded class clown in two cousin seven says he and his friends were not the least upset reading michael's face book post we kind of laughed and you about the at mi offend that la we be of you like you you we you you were the one you should have got in it i great apparently the we a e your cutie wo count o cat yo did it make you question whether or not you were actually the class clown i cure i one a saran square i think yo i up think i pul funny i can i of i you very cured in mike o very young for my a e a i had we per canowity e old do pretty much everyone i talked ho felt this way since there is no way of really knowing there were sure may be somebody else got a superlative they should not have gotten but mine was totally deserved michael for even i one get couple this is avid vagodnear he is a nursing student in colorado now and tat her warn i a because you are the cutest couple her will be getting you he was at home studying when i called him eve his got friend era was there too she is pursuing a doctor in in psychology did the other couples that were up for cutest couple had be o ream man en yo aba u rear a we work in are a a a a i i ah i to if i only knew which names michael checked off on this fatebilets i could ask those people what they thought now if all of this changed anything for them but michael refused to give me those names hit was one thing confessing to what he did in a general way but pointing to individual people and saying they would not have one if not for me that just seem mean and unnecessary did end of asking him about one person in particular mark enticer who posted michael's confession on twitter they were in senior leadership council together ye i knew mark very well he was really popular ye at this point michael took a peak in the old year book he would brought along with him for the interview ye he on most schoolspirited and he wont all around he did he win those fair and square or did he win those because you stuffed the belabor you cannot how the fuck a misemoston wallet's a ointments you to no way to know did you vote for him on those ballets that you stuffed before i answer that let us let us acknowledge that it does not matter i o we will acknowledge that it does not matter o c we sol you acknowledge that this answer ism about to give you his arbitrary but ism in to give it to you any o a good yet ya i voted for i wanted him to want cause he was a good he was a good guy yes i he was defy only one of the guys i fixed it for for shire i told mark what michael said o my guide but that the same time girl who is to say that everybody else did not think of the i guides i common i relic if if he deemed us good friends enough to have rigged it for me cool tekslote lash you have label me as muscle spirited for ten years and i would happily doesn't help myself of that yea you i i the fexesry smile as at michael as michael's find we had a good time and has go together so i it is it is nice to hear that she a believed in me enough to create gods in my ship in other words while michael worried that learning the news might make mark feel bed it did not come close in fact the opposite but here is the real effect that michael's rigging the election had in the way that he did it because it was just thirty face noplace in effect what he is done is create a superlative sized black hole of information for everyone involved he says a lot of the winters might have one anyway but they might not have lot of the losers might have lost anyway but maybe they would have won what we are left with is an extremely rare o currents i cannot think of another one in which a bran new piece of definitive clear information that the election was ray actually makes it that everyone knows less than they did before bacon to is one of the producers of our programmed story tunnel vision this mastery was first en you show back in twenty fifteen that was the of canada hosted the panamerican games but a few months before the games began somebody made a mysterious discovery close to the coranto venue for the games it was a secret tunnel and was hen just some shabby half bake construction it as tall enough to stand in thirty three feet long i support beams a pie would sealing walls it had water resistant lighting a generator a some pump to pump out ground water and at the end of the tunnel two little rooms were still under construction even more intriguing the a for a rosary and a plastic red poppy nail to the wall canadians use ta poppy to commemorate fallen soldiers for remember instead in than in sates all this got a little bit of coverage but in canada twenty fifteen it was big news no one knows who dog the thirty footling tunnel neath both of tissue pan america games in corona and is for tunnel ton o round the tanks for the come panama games as park fires and an annas territack rarely has a did tunnel received much attention no one knows i was created some one told the red gitechiand et artfully dry but it is not justistifistication the police says troubling with a lack of suspects or a motive but some thing unexplained this happens of course people of nuts answer plating about what it could be in this case the media ponder whether the tunnel would be used to pint a am at the upcoming pagan games near by that panagims a an alembics for north and south and central america may be some body was can to build a mecklab in the tunnel ran operation gramarawana they would use the tunnel to hide for an athletes from the panama games the my one a stay in canada illegally on twitter it was hash tag terror tunnel but the truth of what was going ne in that tunnel and this purpose was was nothing any of that and the way the canada ways figured it out i a firs to can i say sometimes one is reminded of what a very different country canada from the united states is part of the man hunt for whoever built the tunnel a policeman the did if he built a tunnel near the rectal enter in tenants give us a call key the granter police pointed out that it is not a legal to diggaholl apparently know a was broken from the start they said they saw no evidence of terrorism and they did not wanted jump to conclusions frinceensersa exchange between then coranto deputy chief marksanders and reporters after he showedhim a photo of that rosary and plastic copy this was found inside the actual dunno itself and it was all on the wall is that that sells wet this was the inside the until renewal the police panicle went on to v and show pictures of the stuff that they found in the tunnel a ladder and the generator in the summat and they asked public this toga anybody's memory an't main know anything about the stuff and that turned out to be exactly the right move cause watching that coverage was a guys named boo derrick he sees that ladder and i said to myself they look exactly my ta blatant i be train many thesis my i bet you any money this is mine and then thin i a sampan i say the i stet play himsampan but i could not believe i could not believe i could not believe myself i could not sleep i was thinking about the he could not sleep cause he knew who he given the stuff to baby's contractor and he went that stuff to one of his favorite in does his young is twenty two melon what was out down come to think that alto had been asking to borrow a lot of to lately he ha ski me or she for pi forgot the shall not there to many tools si i just would say case you been think boo lav out he got it outing the great worker hit loves that and other young people bobsork it than passed apparently often always wants to learn slots of questions wat do you do van you do de how you cone the how you up we sin get vats the sans between that can i do does instead of that these thisgunel can i support unbelievably youknow and i with everybody filled about ask me who is that guy this is my tat tat san a hello always i use to sell this s i the san o we i would the lent hi many tools he vent see morning after he sees the police pointing to a photo of his ladder and sompampotelovision he goes to pick abortion to bring him to work always futon gets in the track he bravura is for me in he i said melton tell me anti a that say pan i did not even ask fool question he said boo yes i de o i god boo went to the authorities an made sure that out would not get a rested or get a prison for this and then he turned a man the police talk to alto satisfied themselves that out and was not a terror story and evil criminal master mind but just some guy and the let him go and t even give him a fine though they did suggest that he not dig for tunnels panda sup who is melton why do you do it why go to the trouble well often has not given many interviews there we did all one reporter named nice cover spend a couple days with him in his family to write this long story about them in ma clan's magazine and nice was able to tell us a lot about melton melton turned on our request for an interview alto was may be two minutes from the ravine and woods were the tunnel was found in a kind of rough neighborhood in public housing nicxsas both of his parents from jamaica he lives with cause tears an older sister in a younger sister and they all lived with her their mother outing quiet in the family new says everybody ease's big talker and i think in particular his older sister o nor she she has a lot of a ideas about am how melton should be a living his life and she is not shy about considering that with him i she is a big fan of self help books and so i think melton his often in the position of of listening to an life talks as they they put it advice advice and melton found refuge ever since she was a kid in the ravine in the ravine there were no life talks from the time he was a little melton was this introspective kid who loved to build to take machines apart put the back together he fixed upon on mowers cub houses and that he said in a shored interview the nick recorded for a video that acclaim's magazine made he would go to the ravine what i soon even what els a kits run iron play having go see would play apart we go fishing but i i thin my first confound probably when else in om the months school it is going to creek walk around and this is something on my mind i want ta bod a clubhouse ad five or six ascents and i think the six once the he something the not have heard him call it the short of the future of cub house a gain here's neck the the tree house of the future that it is underground because one of the fundamental things she wanted from this was that it be it be secret it was his secret place that he could go and just relays and and be alone an not always along a grand helped melton dig the tunnel and build it excavating he thinks to dumtrucks of dirt by hand i once it was done the would go there together watch movie was in ta music barbecue a did this because something is one be din by i of i should have going out of it and the knew that if i burn tunnel it came from childhood reasons but at a same time if i buddy who knows li could folly hang out there turn that chute jumentlike a man cave a bunker when f we cone to the place cool hang o and if there's something to happen a that is disaster if some would happen i could go there as a black hold i to non a deer charge of my down even make a son new down ta to something back of to my house back wheel would go to the towel it sisters did not know inside what he was doing but they knew something was a from dance i was dinging the thing he would come home just covered and dirt tracking dirt everywhere nor thought he was building some kind of under ground house and big him about it bet he would not say is other sistertracian found the rosary i shall sitting it a bust he gave it out to pro test him since since essence shear it to me ti our lad else ready down there i know to thus every day after that everyday where go there on some tome make a prayer it everyday sounds o forget was sometimes o wheeler to have a lit prayer to some safe and stay piece of mind her the reality about his tone it was different from what people thought it was when it was first discovered by police i think what that is about is i think when we encounter something hat's in ex pliable or mysterious our imaginations we are such hacks we go t the most standard stock seeing at in a hundred teeny shows version of what something probably is all its terry tax oh its trug dealers when the reality of what this towel was it was this dreamy a i which is one of the place to get

yesterday mischolobama the democrats break class in case of emergency candidate sounded off on jobidon and here is what she said and you wonder where people where are we in this they were our hearts what is got to happen in this next selection i am terrified about what could possibly happen because our leaders matter who we select who speaks for us who holds that bully pull pit it affects us in ways that sometimes i think people take for granite she is speaking for a lot of democrats right now where deeply worried that jobidon is going to lose the upcoming election todanald trump an the at is polls show the deals from is in fact leading jobidon in virtually every swing state jobidon is deeply under water yesterday jobidon headed to manual my church in south caroling what was he doing there hell speaking bout the evils of white so premise and the magic of diversity equity and inclusion of course and who was doing at the church where the charleston masker took place where white premises murdered a bunch of black parishioners why was he there well because a selection time and jobidon knows the only way he is going to win re election is if he has heavy black turn out at the ballot box that is the whole thing that is been the secret sauce for democratic elect total victory in recent elections in two thousand just fifty three point five per cent to black voters shut up vote in to thous at aught when barokoboma is on the ballet that number jump to a record sixty point eight per cent in twenty twelve it is bite to a new record sixty two per cent then because barokobama was not on the ballot in twenty sixteen it drop back down to fifty five point nine per cent in hired plankton lost the election when jobidon one in twenty twenty that number rebounded to almost fifty nine per cent and black voters in the twenty twenty election went for jobidon fatty ninety two to eight clip voters of color over all by the way represent four in ten of robin's votes the black vote for jobidon is going be especially i portent because unlike other voters who voted just proportionately by mail in twenty twenty an probably will not so up this time in the same way black voters were the sub group most likely to shop and vote in person that means that if man and ballot's drop in the upcoming election and turn out in person stays kind of the same you would expect to see heavy black turn out because many people shut up in person in the black community to vote this way it is back to the old play book for jobidon rashes polarization this has been the play book for democrats my entire life time but it as exacerbated greatly by barokobama in two thousand twelve and join knows how to play that game because he was the vice president in two thousand twelve remember that time in two thousand twelve the said the it round yes mint rosy most milk tost republican perhaps of all tin was going to put black america in chains during the twenty twelve race remember this look at what they value tho look at through button and went three propose round wants to let the he said the first hungry days he is get the big banks once again right through on rules on can wot y put you'll back i yes it round was going to re slavery black people in the united in the united states sure that hoiden made that contention in twenty twelve and it wore in twenty twenty four fast ford twelve years begin to it again hoiden by thewy in twenty twelve at not remotely the same as jobidon and twenty twenty four anybody who believes that that man as not in a state of mental and physical decline watch the tapes of hoiden backed back from twenty twelve and watch the tapes now he was never any great shakes or attorney he was never any sort of magically brilliant human being but at least he could speak words from his face hold with some level of solidity that is all over in animates is now twenty twenty fort libido needs black votes and it was time to head to a historically black church victimized by white violence an then proclaim that he is going to stand up against all the evil white america who might vote foradonal trump we get to worth is not just one second as we

to do with the shooting at a manual came church an south caroling after all that took place into thousand fifteen donate trump was not yet president was a year before dona trumpets present brokobomofs president the time but the idea is the donate trump's ideology is the same as the ideology of the evil white to premises who shot up the church that was the idea and that is who cjobidin show up there is a really cynical play and it is a really ugly play but t something jobidon is quite familiar with the gain because he has done it before he shows up at this church and the audience begins cheering four more years now have been in form by reliable sources that christian nationalism is one of the great threats to america christian nationalism the abuse of church for political purposes of course that only means that even helical christian should not supportdonal trump es you be christian nationalism but when you cheer four more years in a historically black church well that means just that is what god wants you to do apparently that's good kind of christian nationalism her some of that e is a lot of politics and a churchright there and well he need something in his had perhaps it will go to his head perhaps it will not there is not much weft up there get the theme of his campaign is going to be the dona trump is a noisy that is can be the theme of his campaign and he is lated out in he past four days first of valley forge where he suggested that dona trump literally was a not that he is repeating noisy sloganeering and that if dona trump one the twenty twenty four election there would be no further elections and then on money when he went to the church where he suggested tat if donna trump winds white supremacy will have on hoiden led off the speech by of course talking about the masker that took place in tune of twenty fifteen in charleston south caroling here e go you sender twenty fifteen e beautiful won for wongwont won the whites canoe church pa short of gob was cars not bolt o he a by what is on to by poison hit as for too long pot is is what is that pops white si premise and in this idea that white supremacy's a wide spread ideology in the united states is absolute sure nonsense is just nonsense tat does not mean there are not dangerous white supremacist out there i know there are many of them send me to threats but the idea that that is a chief threat to the united states right now in ideology in which white people believe that they are supreme to other races in the united states there is peril pol data to suggests the white supremacy is a serious under lying problem in the united states america generally speaking do not think that but this constant harping on race which is what brokaboma began in twenty twelve remember wo thousand eight him round as a racial united not a racial divider in two thousand twelve he ran as somewhat of racial divider his entire plan in the twenty twelve election was racial polarization as to rive minority turn out against again it round the most generic republican it is possible to generic and it worked buhl can see the results of that now then the it that democrats have to tell themselves is that bite suggesting that white supremacy is a continuing vast problem in the united states there somehow making the united states a better place and that is what jobidon suggested yesterday he was talking about the bringing down of the con federate flag which happened in the after math of that shooting at manual a m you will recall that the shooter in that particular case their pictures of him with the con federate flag this turned into a nation we debate over the confederate flag and whether it should be allowed to be flown in any state monuments or urinary state monuments whatsoever i out their frankly pretty good arguments on both sides of the isle on that particular on that particular dis agreement that a lot of people who believe the confederate flag in the south was more of a cultural thing that no longer called to the original purposes of the confederacy obviously black america look to the con federate flanges at well a eyes that was the confederacy now i tougher we good arguments on both side but the notion that america race relations got better as a result of that particular debate has been belied by all o america history since then there was join playing this game your brought gown confederate win e the merit for o we can be wont to be so now if you once give credit for that somebody the person he should credit of course is one of the r publicans on the other side of the isle the governor of south cardinal the time to see hale and if you see this is a good thing the nickel halves the person who actually took to confederate flag off of monument at the at the state capital with all that said again the idea that all of this helped bringing down the them creature and race relations in the united states is obviously untrue when jordan says that this help the nation heal in element limes re yow the polestatistics agandthere is one most shocking pole statistics in modern america history these these polstatistics it said quote would you said relations between white and black people are very good somewhat good somewhat bad or very bad ad here the starts for very or somewhat good right good race relations ha as of two thousand one seventy per cent of black america said the race relations were very or somewhat good and sixty two per cent of white america said the same in two thousand three those numbers were sixty nine per cents white america said they were very good or somewhat good fifty nine per cent of black america said they were very or somewhat good in two thousand eight seventy per cent of white america sad that race relations were very or somewhat good and sixty one per cent of black america said that they were very or somewhat good in two thousand thirteen still seventy two per cent of white america said that race relations were very or somewhat good sixty six per cent of black america said they were very or somewhat good and then something happened then something happened in two thousand fourteen the black lives matter movement launch and it made the claim that america deeply races place filled with white supremacy it was again in overhang of the obomabidin twenty twelve campaign extended found in time through twenty thirteen end twenty fourteen and when the furgusin riots broke out and barocoboma decided to take the side of the rioters effectively speaking when that happened when the black lives matter movements tares make the false claim than america was races in all of itsiderations race relations absolutely plummeted in the united states in twenty thirteen seventy two per cent of white america said race relations were good and did sixty six per cento black america by twenty fifteen forty five per cents of white america said race relations were good that is a twenty seven per centare point drop and still simultaneously fifteen per cent per centare points fewer black america said race relations were good only fifty one per cent of black america said race relations were good thesis by twenty fifteen then those numbers continued to decline in twenty twenty one well jobidonis president with a democratic sennit forty three per cent voice america braces relations are good and only thirty three per cent of black america a race relations are good one third of blacks and fewer than half of whites embrace relations are good again that is from seventy two per cent avoids and sixty six percent of blacks in twenty thirteen why did that happen and the answer is the more you talk about the polarization between races the more you pretend that that is the source of america conflict the worst thing's get an our political leadership class particular and left has a heavy stock in doing particularly this and jobidon because he needs blackouts he is going to try to trains mute the white supremacy shooting that happened in charleston into it abide about canary six no i gain acting its o really awkward fit they are very few people black war white who believe that dona trump is to be vicious anti black races again one of dona trump's signal accomplishments when i just agreed with was criminal justice reform which was push forward by trump and banjoes was a black advocate obviously but this is jobidon's plate racially polarize the country for political profit that is the game folks last year because of you preborn's network of clinic saved over fifty eight thousand babies thank you to everyone who made this possible when antoinette and out chose pregnant chosen a terrible place she know how she could raise her child on her own she search for an abortion cline but god let her to a reborn clinic where so ais introduced to her baby unalterasound in that changes people's lives when she saw her baby and her at harpy she broke down crine the hers mentally reminded her a child's of blessing and antoinette chose life reborn saves two hundred babies each and every day for just twenty eight buxamonth you kinsponsfer an ultrasound and help save life when a on us her baby on the ultrasound and heres their harpy she is twice as likely two choose life just type pound to fifty a keyword baby that is pound two five zero baby or visit reborn dot come slashban that is prior dot come slashban my wife and i if for is who met all of them on ultrasound well before they were born give a mom the privilege of doing that to day and help her choose life justly pound to fifty a keycard baby that is pound two five zero baby or is it reborn dot come slashban here he was trying to link up the lost cause of the civil war at as the myth that was created by southerners in the aftermath of the civil war another is something magnificent going on withe confederacy andthat that cops had been lost in the aftermath in that the south was ruined and all of this by the lost of the civil war he is trying to link that up with canary six i mean this is some pretty astonishing stuff worbybe clear for ho on see war slavery wont decor subtredinaer er senor which again e son's con can time trying o turn law you law a li which you a law li but once again in terrible vanity cannot this time a li is about e twenty twenty alert the election you may you are voices her your warning again this is amazing of trying to link up the lost caused narrative about the civil war with donate trump claiming that he on the twenty twenty election is that that is such an insane stretch that is such it and it is viscid what he is doing it obvious this culminated in jobidin calling tonal trump a lose or two while applause at this church again when wild applause happens at a church for political figures were righting that is christian nationals when happens for jobidon it is politics here i up within i o the do not have expect titty en e e pep to ye away on i cans ha habit the words america can that is not the real for lash not to martin that not a martian america we all a in america we witness to her all those to e tact decision es talk to concede he is aloin to wild whips an sheers obviously that began concluded this speech by suggesting once again that canary seas all that canary effort frobidon it is the it just can be gaseous sex from now until the end of time for jobidon he is now connecting that to opposition to diversity equity and inclusion d i is an outgrown the postmodernist theory to you a very brief one minute synopsis of what d e i is in its history post modernism is a philosophy that says there is no such thing as truth there is just power promoted by we shall we call among others the basic idea is that any thing you believe is not actually a belief in a truth or an y system what you actually believes h reflection of you are own desire for power and that means that all the systems in america are not about whether they work whet they known whether fare whether they are not there just about the people who succeed under that system creating power structures to benefit themselves thou's first transmuted by maxis into claims about rich america were its structuring the system for their own benefit and the when that did not work it was transmuted into racial claims those racial claims became critical race theory the basic idea being that all the structures of america society are inherently race is perpetrated by white premises in order to reinforce that supremacy and that transmuted into diversity equity in inclusion the basic idea of which is that again all the systems of amebic are fundamentally broken and the way you can tell this is because there's unequal outcome by group and that can only be rectified by unequal treatment of groups that is what diversity quit e an inclusion is and this joint's pitch his pitch to black audience is is that he is going to create special carveouts four blacks that is what he is doing right here that that that is why he is saying the sort of tuff its why he is trying to link up all of this into one giant ball of miss mash here he goes can a link together in this statement canary sixth in attempt to destroy d e my and e zero summit view of america which is amazing by he way because d e eye is inherently a zero some view of america when you say d e i is the situation that we should promote what you are saying is that basically the should be racial quotas racial quotas are by their very nature zero sum if there is one slot and has to go to either of the most meritorious candidate or the most diverse candidate the not the same person in this particular senate if that happens one person gets the slot that is by definition a zero some game a meritocracy is not a zero some game because there are positive externalities to the meritocracy in other words people are bested the job get the job that helps everybody when it comes to i varsity equip inclusion there are no positive externalities there are only people who win in people who lose but that is the ops of which yo biding is preaching because he is hiding why metage i get part of a broader tack an a cane medical gay that we all have sin before the a more a rat e ma ai cape yes in o be it gas andidacamen to a ran a mom i ran to have it can destroy her a inclusion all across a mar hag he place ho and n gamer a a you e yer song er that was if you win i lo es s must be i fa get a he i fall be may be worst of all the hold you down i lift myself of among god the levels of projection here a absolutely astonishing that is literally the entire democratic playbook if i if you win i lose rat whole comes t economics if somebody succeeded it is because they must have done something wrong and we have to punish them for their success and tear them down here obvious my the one present are cruel and evil as burned sander says if you succeed it must be that i failed as oppose to if the person stormy is rich and i am also a little but richer because he is hooded his job and sold me good production service we all benefited that is precisely the opposite of the zero some economics in which democrats constantly engage wen too tits in just one second first in his twenty twenty four a lot of us are trying to get our finance is in order the some great news for home owners actually interest

for details about credit cost and terms only says that the republican philosophy is i hold you down i lift myself up who is trying to hold who down who is trying to hold who down when you suggest the the meritocracy is deeply loud and is in fact a mean foremen murder for power what you're trying to do is hold down the meritorious this person burger by curtvonegat your taking the most meritorious and you are sailing then with burdens in order to conical make things more equal most famous quotalong these lines that that springs to mine your is barocobolabeing asked in two thousand eight if increasing the capital gainstack actually lowered economic growth would he would still do it and he said yest for purposes of fairness because dragging people back down to the median is more important than everybody rising even if that rate of increase is unequal and this is in the nutshell jobiden's campaign this is why he is not can be able to lek of t yah gown is now running directly into a problem the problem that he has is that the way that he could win is theoretically to go to clintonia turd way he could you go clintonia dor way and yo could win again if you go back two elections the democrats have one in the past what you will seat is that there are many elections the democrats have one where black voters did not so up in the kinds of numbers they showed up for for barocobama for example in nineteen ninety two the black turn out rate was fifty four per cent bilklinton one in nineteen ninety six the black turn out rate was fifty per cent bilkclinton one in to thousand black turn out rat was fifty three one five per cent gorge stop be bush one but algor one the popular vote and what they could do is they could re build a cold lotion of white working class voters but gabion one do that gabion is a believer in the baracobomicolition which is four in ten democratic voters being of color and pandering to people i that is the basic idea here as of cannot let go of d ya and he also count let go of his radical racialize left wing he cannot do it now the costs of d ya are very clear to the united states your staring seat a corporations by the way who are all letting go of this yestrunonsense that is environmental social governments nonsense that is designed two essentially subsume the profitability of corporations in favor of left wing ideology and corporations are letting go of that because complete waste of money and it under mines moral and it under mines the ability of the company to do bus ness but the cops of d i are insanely high i insanely high for example at the university of michigan according to the college fixes the university of michigan has at least two hundred and forty one paid implores now focused on d i patrol clos exceed thirty million dollars annually thirty million dollars thou cover instactuition and fees foremost eighteen hundred graduate students thirteen d i staff members are more than two hundred douse dollars what exactly v they added to the universe michigan far nothing and precisely the opposite because again d i ideology which is rooted in the idea that the only reason certain group succeed in america and certain groups far is b was of inequity and evil that ideology has promoted radicalism you can see that by the way there is that in amazing clip this now making the rounds from goggles d i leader of personated adrenal parked explaining we d i is good because the opposite would be to teach people to be color blind which apparently is bad the keep telling people that over and over i frustrating and i was just on tiptoe and there is the than where parent there teaching their kids not to see color to and unlike o is that a next round of people that are gong to be joining our work for its that is next generation an are gong to be dealing with the same issues that we are dealing with now because the the do not tee cover the don't the me you do not care to acknowledge the struggles that people me fat that that is a wild statement that f you teacher is to be color blind that somehow terrible because they are not seen the struggles of the people face who it depends on what that persons actually is the person who is leading d said gull what what is the additional struggle this person is experiencing did clouding gay experience additional struggles or additional benefits thanks to her race this is insane and stay of looking t people as individuals thy look at them as members of groups and ten they suggest that this is how we ought to judge people this all o by the way least antisemitism because the cross over between d ya and antisemitism it is a vendiagram circle why whet because d is a conspiracy hear about power it suggests that the most powerful an the most successful people must have got in there through exploitation and evil and then people on the left look and they see the news are dis proportionately successful in the united states and they look at israel very to the palicinians and they see that israel is a disproportionately successful state a wildly successful state in a deeply in successful part of the world and they say well somebody must have ben victimized in order for that to happen that is the zeros view of the world and join cauntletico he cannot let go that zeros view of the world because that is how he feels he is going to win election which is why yesterday at manual ami in the middle of the speech a bunch of protestors got up and they started chancing about goa now this might be a good opportunity forgo widen to have what use to be called a sister soldier moment very famously bill canton when the is running for president in nineteen ninety two k made a statement in which he went off obsess to soldier why because in the middle of that campaign sh did not interview sis the soldier was a a h pop m c and political active is in all this and she made a comment in an interview at the washington post she as asked a question quote even the people themselveswho are perpetrating the sounds to the else riots do they think that was wise was that a wise reasons action and she said at it was wise i mean of black people kill black people every day why not have a week an kill white people white people that government in that mayor were well aware of the back that black people ware dying every day in allay under gang violence f you are gangmember and you normally killing somebody why not kill white person you think somebody thinks that white people are better are above in beyond tine when they would kill their own kine canton speaking by the way at the rainbow coalition tussle jackpots organization in nineteen ninety two rung for president responded to that quotation and to something that soldier had said in a music video where she said what if there are any good white people i have met them and coin said if you took the words white and black and you reverse them you might think avid duke was was giving et speech rain out that probably one bill canton not just the nomination but the presidency are that that was a that very widely reported at the time the sort of vista sold your moment became a buzzword n america politics a speaking truth to people in your own party or to radical but jobidon is not doing that jobidon has much protestors who get up in thy start chanting in favor of comostrate they say they want a cease fire in got they on seas far goa by the way ascot's continues to kill his rally soldiers and hold females hostage worth mentioning here by the way that the international red cross apparently refuses to spend any time trying to visit the female hostages who are being held in the worst possible conditions and an is rely soldiers wo are trying to free those hostages and kill members o commeasure dying everyday does jordan say to these radicals is your you are talking about compass is in evil group tat must be extracted does he say that does you say your belief that commas is some sort of part of the broader rascal metrics into which you have cast america is just false that it is a we that your bear idea that palsinians are brown and his relies are whites that that stupid that is not how you should think about morality to jobidon to that now he concedes them because he has to conceive to radical left to in base cause he thinks that radical left town bases is kin new to turn out in vast numbers to win him reelection by the way that sis how you booze the middle in this country it turns out sixty two per son of america one america to give more support israel and its current war against comas but here is jobidon being absolutely castrated by a bunch of radical protestors at the church we to the here is no wife was winter do not an you garages cane wane we wore we for yo es your for can get can can one got lousy of now these are munch an nuts inside the church i cause the is bunch o left wing radical cooks he could not just ignored them and said nothing instances i understand your passion by the way the sow the democratic party sees its most radical constituents there just to passionate that is really the problem rites and fergusin there to the two passionate me they the yet we doftwan them burning things ma be but they they've a point to on we can see why their man and is the same thing when you have people yelling it you about protect and commons in the gossip strip is biding willing to say anything of course not because the entire democratic party inform structures unwilling to say or do anything which just why you are seen protestors clogging up traffic lanes in new york city yesterday protestors clogs to basically every major traffic artery in new york city some three hundred we are arrested and then promptly released because that is holt works in you city her some visit a is that o the way is they black father telling people to moon but you you cannot you got to let the woks win the i ya em alone he needs to leave it schist illegal where are the cops the guy who trying hos people out o the ways wen go where he wants to go is not wrong he is corrects the way that all works in the united states if it is not in force other people will take it into their own hands who try to enforce it look at this they shut down entire free ways it is absurd they shut down the homeland tunnel they shut down the brook in brave in favor of common where are the cox where are the of throw these people in jail and all of the stops tomorrow they wont spend any time in jail beat their weaklings they are perfectly happy to do this because they know there are no consequences hes there is seen civil rights protestors n these jack ass is civil rites protestors number one or protesting for something good and number two we are wiling to go to jail for that belief these people our protesting for something evil an are not willing go to jell for that belief you don't the easy solution is arrests them and put them in jail it is not particularly difficult but democrats will not do that because they believe that these people are part of their base it is totally crazy will get to more on this in just o second first the and a

democratic party cancer say no now one o the reasons the democratic party cannot say no use by polingdid of the democratic party coalition includes a lot of people who sympathize with comose it is unfortunate is an unfortunate reality it is also one of the reasons why things that would absolutely be national stories if the tonicities were different are not national stories let me give you an example apparently on thursday night there is a girls basketball game between a school called the level school a private jewfish school in hartstale and a school called roosevelt high school a public school in yorkers they played a non league girls basketball game in the middle of the game which turn physically violin a roosevelt player told that visiting jeuishponent i support comas you effing new at according to the jerk post the jewfish school had coach held thediscussiowon t players they decide to end the game after the third quarter following the incident leffelsenior player robin boy with rote nor bed saying the right from the beginning of the game the r substantially more chaps in commons thrown at the players are noting the my have experienced in a long time patently the rosevelt players were shouting free gallstone along with t antiseptic scorers she said i have play ta sport every athletic season throughout my high school crave never experience this kind of hatred directed at one my teams before instead of responding tar t more the same we chose to separate ourselves from the situation why was in this national story if this had been and a black tee being insults by white people using the en word then thatwould be a national negatory four a week why did not hell because if you look the pictures of the game it was minorities people of color who are insulting news and that means the interjectional i the interjectional hierarchy has not been violated this is the problem d is prom with radicals inside the democratic party base and by the way this is matasticizing according to resume builder dot come in nonmember of twenty twenty two was may builder surveyed one thousand one hundred thirty one you has hiring managers ad recruiters about their views on news k findings twenty six per cent of hiring managers say they are less likely to move forward with jewfish applicants because quote news have too much power and control and twenty six per cent make sumption about weather a candidate jewfish based non appearance twenty three per cent the they want four news in their industry d e i amounts to this but that is not all d is d i also suggests of course that america systems all of them in clueing immigration system are deeply basis and the only way to rectify that is as as he says to legalize everyone who wants to cross the border everything is seen by the way by democrats in terms of this sort of racial conflict this is why mayor randan johns the man lory lightfoot of chico he says when grew abbot is sending illegal emigrants to major democratic cities he is doing be cause he targeting black people every game is played the same way in the democratic party circles is really ugly here ego what are you thoughts about the case and is this an action you would confer of takin as oil we in a look your very you are absolutely right about the intentions of governor bit he is a packing democratically rand cities an portrictly cities that are being led om by black leaders a leaders of color this is unconscionable omit is a very maggoty approach quite frankly now is tan reckless and tragedy but it is evil spirited it is evil spirited why it is apparently races it is races to ask that a sanctuary city take in the people they say they are going to provide sanctuary and this has to be what is motivating you policy at this point is yous policy is a bleeps understand their bunch of factor said the border the biggest factor of course is that the united states has changed touch laws that if you apply for asylum which means literally you arrive on the border and you say i fear to go back to my home country we will process you and will let you into the interior of the united states alahandra orcas to borpatral agents that quote above eighty five per cent of all illegal emigrants arriving the border are released into the united states now for a long time till forty two allowed people to be turned back from the border that you said were not taking you in go back to your go back the medical side of the border but that is no longer happening because title forty to his ended by the by de minister action and now above eighty five per cent of people stroking up on the border just released into the united states that is insane may area said last we on pastor a boart well more than a million migrants released into the united states annually and argued repeatedly to up to congress povidmor running theirs more than a million released into the united states annually the that two point three millions to fistic that the de chest released the other day is a li it is not true it means that over the course this administration according to medical himself at least three million people have been released into the united states board patrol agents have told me theyreleased a million now roadways which means that are probably another seventy eight hundred thousand unknown roadways if there percentages are correct before talking about under join minimum about five million people have entered the country illegally this benefits by thewy the drugcar tells the drugcar tells are making absolute bank on this sort of stuff according to the house committee on homeland security ain twenty twenty one cartels made fourteen million dollars just from human trafficking and smuggling because everybody who is crossing the border is paying the coyotes six thousand eight thousand up to twenty five thousand dollars from being smuggled across the border and by the way the drugcartalls are using those vast number of e legal migrants in order to strict border patrol from policing the other parts of the borders what they do is they drop off a huge contingents of illegal immigrants at some border patrol way station and then because of jordan all these people have to be bussed to a tentiontenter as soon as humanly possible and then possess and let into the interior of the united states as soon as humanly possible up to ninety per cent of all border patrol agents are now staffed on bussing and administrative duties we've turned them into baby sitters and meanwhile the entire border is left completely on man which means the people are rushing across the border of the ones who do not want to get caught if vas majority people walking into the country actually one to get caught they are walking across and they're waving at t word patrol agents and saying hay pick me up come taxeme but one you do not want to get caught are able to evade arrest because there are no board patrol agents anywhere along large just of the america mexico border and what is that what is that look it looks the amount of sentinel in the country extraordinarily rising according to that same homeland security committee sentinel cost as little as ten cents to produce that is a fate prescription pill late witheninel it can be sold for ten to thirty bus which means ten kilos of sentinel are with about twenty million dollars twenty million dollars cate just to explain how much sentinel is now entering the country in twenty twenty three according to border patrol itself sentinel seizures es up just what was sees is twenty seven thousand to pounds twenty seven thousand pounds sentinel that would calculate out to almost twenty four point four million dollars worth of sentinel that was card at the border and anymore is getting through then is getting caught these the sup that is getting caught at the border are morons for largely trying to bring it through ports of entry or people quart getting caught which is the minority of the people are now entering the country illegally but apparently it is races to mention any of this apparently it is bigoted to mention any of this there is no reason to leave the border open the way the border has been left open and mexico is holding jobidon over the barrel apparently according to fox news mexcofs president is now demanding twenty billion dollars basically in cash plus work permits for ten million people from south of the border in exchange for immigration help also mexico says the united states has to end it is blockade on cuba and out venizwalas actions because blopazobnador this the leader of the pelican government is in fact a pence socialist and his allied with the entire pink have that has happened from venizuayla to cuba to mexico debasitlly want the united states to surrender to him the only reason the most powerful country and earth would surrender to this is because there is an internal belief inside the united states the you half to surrender on legal migration because it is unjust the people canthus to enter the other southern boarder willie silly what a they do that jury about it secretary of woman security allahandro mayor's who ocean i do not know mayoress's personal role in this verses jobidons all i do know is that jobidon and allahan do america who made it easier to cross the southern border than any time in modern america history by far it is not close again the process is super simple you literally walk up to the border and you mayor hand and you say i do not want to go back to my home country be fear to go back to my home country and the is release you into the interior with a little posted note that says come back later but orcas on to pretend everything is normal here he was yesterday sand do not worry the migration challenges t unique the united states spoiler let it is in fact its even unique to the united states overtime course last five years cause this was not happening in twenty twenty ti number miles cider a cote order e can is not the tenet untie too restore fact too the for inherit u create her tell e we o thoeterice o ten the e her oruptici corruption and violence and extreme weather events i mean you mean the things that have driven migration for all of human history migration levels i e percentage the population in general wllobly are actually kind of similar to what they've been in the masters a how in the book out from hazard university press all about this but you not not new what is happening at our southern border right now you that is not new except in the extent the extent is bran new bran new again in reality it is highly likely that at least five million y legal emigrants have crossed america southern border and dispersed into the interior of the united states during joins tender meanwhile orcas again he keeps lying as were doing everything we can s reduced what he calls now irregular migration i know your not in a his noose not because you are releasing every one into the united states with a come back later date that would to be doing everything you can would it the maturity o pol tigress i counter a the souses port out time

absolutely false absorb falsewhen he as the majority of valmigrants encountered throughout the administration been removed that is not true title forty two allowed for that removal and then title forty to ended and then medical himself says eighty five per cent people showing up at the border are being released into the interior sot orcas now is just changing the vermin he is noplace mantic games he says when we say the released we do not there not really released they are conn what released into emigration proceedings i'llexclam what he means by this a moment it is very important to understand the when individual is release they are release you to immigration inform e proceedings were they can make claim under the loss tat congress has passed i gave lame slimithat means on a practical level what that means when he says release in emigration proceedings your imagining their kept in intention facility until there claim can be heard by a judge and with point very few of them are going to having actual sign climate and most them get expel wrong you are the way this actually works under current biding protocols is you arrive at the border waverham i said or patrology picture up takes you to attention facility they process you at the detention facility and then you are given a come back later date within seventy two hours and then you are driven to say these hyson air port where you are flown to whatever you wish to go that is what he means by emigration proceedings mean that that is that is one people in new york at arrested for going on a bridge and n there released with a open court later date was that really a punishment particularly when that the vast majority people who get that show p later ate are never on a shop again why would they they did to get expelled who they guy just disappear into the interior an ever shop again and ice is not can go get them because ice has not been tasked by the by administration with following up with any of these people the by administration is not sending ice to go round up all of the people who released when they miss their sell by date their court date the by administration has said unless you have a criminal record we are not going to do that unless you commit an act of criminality were not con to do that which is by the way why the number of deportations from the interior of the united states as radically dropped under hoiden there is only one reason to do this is ideological it is certainly not driven by america best interests it is d e i related again because d e i is just cod for america is costume our white supremisis and therefore america has to fix all of its systems by bending over backward any time there is somebody who is not white involved in a in a proceeding that be the basic idea right here and meanwhile on the true side of the isle an insane story n if you volt our public officials cannot get any more corrupt in ridiculous wrong you are according to the aplanatic journal

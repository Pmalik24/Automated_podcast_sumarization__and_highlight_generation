some people they read this old stories from three thousand years ago the iliac and the odyssey they read he in school when it just gets to them one of the producers here at arson manual was that i love the heros hector i thought agamamnon wat such a deva a i love the yet we had to translated in my satin class and in addition to translating passages i decided to make a nine by three foot mural out of magazine paper depicting abuses jersey into hell when when you say magazine paper ho mane your cutting letters at of a magazine again i i i i i was meticulously ripping teeny pieces of different colors of magazine paper and making mosaic being a and i remember that jail was on the mule for some reason es waring a white dress that kind of great is i a toga year as if she got to be died out and how when i teach your sin to twenty page research paper on any subject in the world they could do anything at all i was bodies to manual what to do the story of troy the place of the organ more happen the wall city that they pulled the organ horse in to and in doing research for this project i found out about the my name vinic schleymen dineric salami a man who also read those old stories got obsessed a he is born in germany in the eighteen hundred he's a business man a merchant and russia and then he moved to californium her in the gold rush and open a bank it said that he would carry around copies of homer a and he taught himself ancient great in two years he taught himself ancient green which is insane to me a just he could read the books and the language of prune anyway but basely he look a masses as huge fortune and once he has his fortune he decides that he is going to fine troy at the time people were not sure if it was a real place are just a a story a mantis and a and a this kind of a do question but in that period did archaeologist even exist was tat even a job ye not really job a it is a very new field the whole idea of digging up the pass and a there there are sort of hobbyist calling in it hit hes hobbies by the eighteen seventies ta figured out from various geographic clues at homer gives in the text about troys proximate to the cardinals and mount idea they feigetat were a likely location for the city might be hit was in the place of be ow called turkey and at that spot was kind of a big mound of dirt a tallyman gets going he starts to day he hires dozens and dozens of workers and when he is digging he starts to find easily hes these layers of cities that are built on top of each other they bits a pottery and foundations of buildings when a city burns to the ground that we just build another city rate on top of it a but none of them are what he is looking for what he is looking for is he wants to find easily gold silver and bronze that is the thing he thinks is going to be the signifier that this is troy because he is thinking of this treasure rich city that homer describes in the iliac and he is also thinking that were it is got o be further down has to be at the bottom right troys going to be at the bottom of this pill and he keeps digging and keeps finding more and more layers with cities yes and then he gets to the bottom of these piles of cities and that is where he finds is treasure he finds exactly what he is looking for he finds is gold he finds h silver he finds bronze a he calls it primus treasure prism being the the king of troy in the iliac but there is nothing one it that says primus you he a you'd rivals e anger someday no can know nothing that it has it hove hard proof there is troy it does not mind it which would a e really helped and as one question yet did he find a huge would horse cops that it a salt it a no he want hours would would not have survived and o the a fine w did hi show his tat the inadvertain things that happened when you street digging at the past and this is the point where salesman stop gets more complicated shaman announces to the world that he is found the city that homer was writing about he is found troy it comes internationally famous but the truth of the situation is is that the troy at the bottom of the pile with all this treasure and all this cold that actually was not troy it was not homers troy at least it shot's from thousands of years before troy would have even happened the troy that he was looking for was actually one of the cities that he had just dug through and destroyed in the process of digging through it son no that he is just digging down he reaches troys mana this his it throws it on the side is debris yet that is garbage yet and basically he destroyed a big chunk of the ancient city in trying to find the city the trove was looking for archer just understand now was just three lairs down and he dug nine later down what this means is that for any archaeologist to day who is trying to figure out anything that is going on that troy kind of screwed them over i called one of these guess on his name is brine rose and he was a director of excavations at troy for twenty five years he is not a fan of schleyman he did not really know what he was doing there is a lot of information that we have lost on account of his speed and digging when i look through his note books he will say something busting building and debris found to day list mantled now that does not tell me if it is early middle late busntein what the building looked was many rooms was at only one room what did he find there was just debriithe it was in his way debris that was in his way that schleeman would just dig up and throwing a pile on the side ye scheme on excavated extensively and he had to put the earth that he removed somewhere schleemon dumped all the earth from his trenches in the areas were i wanted dig and part of the reason that he wants to dig in that area is because there might be writing there an took schema is not me that very hard yet because there is all this dirt all these uprooted ruins that are just on top of that area and it would take years and frying says technology that does not even exist now to dig it up without doing more damage you have twenty meters of dump through which you would have to go in order to get to a deposit that might have writing of late bronze t day that something at love to be able to but for now it is just to monumental and undertaking to do it o one of the things that has always and o but me about the story is that before schleyman did they actually figured out that he was wrong oh they did yet but he still remember to this day for discovering troy and one of the things i remember from that paper i wrote was that really it ended a mad at him lake i was not at him for you we going to go fitted troy and he merit up basically kind of but when i talked with bran about it he is kind of we about it i would certainly express frustration which schlemon in the same way that an archaeologist digging at troy in a hundred years would express frustration with me oh i his attitude ye i mean i think when our an archaeologist you find a have to take the long view he know you are ware that people are on t come after you and there's a no more than you you are very were of your own limitations and that is actually or today to day on a programmed we have all kinds of people going and being up stuff from the pas full of help that divinely wet your on limitations and

cemetery just a few does not graves and they are also loved which makes sense no one is buried for long here as long as the bodies in the ground people come to visit each plot has photos on it bottles of beer and liquor potted plan handles many them lit my dad hobbles around inspecting the other graves to see who else has died since the last time who was here he ewer wad this the o o thus way whenever he recognizes a name he confirms with cru sweet to that yes the person whose name is written on the gravestone is in fact dead to not you margetone of the grave is occupied by the priest who

connected to the tat his not connected to anything in this case nothing at are that is in a minute stagabublegradion when our program continues to scared om i f mara class to day shell digging up the bones store of people unearthing things from the past trying to make sense of them we have arrived tot back three of our shell at three the case of the curious bone tie cesterbam has this story about a man obsessed with a single bone a bone that is inexplicably large really just do big to make any sense out of at all it was a fragment of a bone old had turned to stone the man trying to puzzle it out was a naturalist and professor in inland named robot plot he writes about it in this beautiful meticulous book the natural history of oxford shire published in sixteen seventy seven the curious bone he writes was quote dug out of a quarry in the parish of corneal given to me by the ingenious sir homes pennyston he writes that it seem to be some part of a thighbone except weigh too big it measured two feet and weighed almost twenty pounds this is the sixteen hundreds and no one in the world had a good explanation for a bone that big plot writes for almost nine pages in his book about this strange bone and he is methodical in trying to reason out what the becket is first he considers the possibility that maybe is not a bone at all but just some natural rock formation which is admirable it easy to jump to conclusions but the more he studies it it really does seem to be part of a colossal bone he writes that it has that capita morris inferior and quote the seat of the strong ligament that rises out of the thigh gives safe passage to the vessels descending into the leg and then inside the bone there is what looks marrow he can see the marrow preserved inside but what in the world was it from quote it will be hard to find an animal proportionable to it he writes he runs through the possibilities eliminating them one by one horse oxen too small he con sides something other people have suggested tit maybe the bone is from an elephant perhaps brought over during the roman invasions background fifty high d he spends two pages on this possibility but it seems unlikely to him he is clearly read through lots of historical accounts quote subtonics in his life where he is very particular concerning this expedition into brain mentions no such matter there was one elephant is true he writes sent as a present to king henry the third from the king of france in the year twelve fifty five and perhaps two or three other elephants brought to inland for show since then but quote whether it be likely any of these should be buried at corneal let the reader judge also if the bone is from an elephant he writes where are the tusks finally as he is writing it he explains that an actual live elephant comes to town which he examines and besides no elephant thighbone completely different shape definitely not elephant and here he can feel in starting to piece things together he is on the edge of seeing this thing he mentions other large bones after the great fire in onion in sixteen sixty six under the wreckage of saint merry wool church quote there as found a thighbone now to be seen at the king'shead tavern in greenish and kent much bigger and longer than ours and also people had been finding unusually large teeth in fact people had been finding an usually large bones for centuries there is one account by a chines scholar from the three hundreds b c but none had a satisfying explanation his remarkable reading robot plot's book to think how close he was such a stunning fact about life on this planet but you can know a lot and still not see sometimes you do not even know what you cannot see he just cannot imagine the possibility of it even when you are holding the thing in your hand by the end of the section of the book plot has reason out the one remaining possibility the only thing that makes any sense to him the bones they must have come from giants people just a little bigger which i have to say t way more sensible than the truth hvicestabou is he e competitor of our program robot plot bit in sixteen ninety six he put in figure at the how drinks or thing another need years on pod puzzled give was lost a long time ago but from the drawings scientist think it it was a megalasorist the good an cornball some one hundred seventy million years before him and yes float sort division quest we intershorteday with somebody who dug up bones from her past a then years later went back to the same sight to ding them up again susnburton explained male's husband died a few years ago they met in nineteen seventy when male was sixteen and he was forty seven and in spite of the age difference they were passionate about each other from a start it was a happy marriage that is one way to tell the story here is another male's husband died a few years ago they met in nineteen seventy when male was sixteen and he was forty seven she was his student and one evening after class he kissed her they started sleeping together he might calla predator or say he amused his power but everything turned out obey it was a happy marriage kills a writer her fullamous kills cement and years ago when she was in her forties she published a memoir that tell the story the first way now she is writing that story again and considering it from the second in not to correct the record she is trying to understand why she wrote her story the way she day the first memoir is called half a life the one she is writing now as called the other half when i wrote half a life originally yen i wrote this thing from the depths of my heart i was supposedly telling the truth which i really deeply believed i was but with the beginning of the met movement it was a kind of capitalist that made me think what if i told my story again from this vantage point from the vantage point of me being sixty six in the vantage point of the world heaving completely changed file new exactly where she wanted to start by writing down the story of their first kiss what she wrote about it when she was in her forties is not how she remembers it to day here is what she remembers to day the night of that kiss male and areola her teacher were in an art studio it was an evening class most of the other students were retires the class had ended and male was alone with areola and for the past six months she would been doing things saying i wish you were older and not making sexual advances but certainly making me where he was attracted to me and i was completely attracted to him and all i did was fan assist about him and we went into his studio supposedly he was going to give me the names of people i was about to drop out of high school moved to new york to pionartist and he was going to give me the names of other artist who would become may be mentors or hire me as insistent and as we got into the room i remember he took my missed and pulled me towards him and we kissed and i look back and i realized i had not written it that way say i had written it as if i had been the sexual pressor could you go ahead and read that how you described the scene in a a life absolutely on the last night of art class i dawdled in the hall until the other students were finished has soon as they were gone i slipped back into the class room and shut the door behind me areola was leaning against the window frame arms folded i shot yawning this time i approached him without a hint of coyness without the spark of a blush i am button the talk three buttons of my peasant blouse crossed the inksplattered floor and kissed him what why did you write it that way and nightly nightie thinks i do not know i think i viewed myself is and i i always have i viewed myself as someone who was always in charge i never felt powerless and may be a way of illustrating that was to make me the sexual pressor at least this focus to kiss went but i i have i do not honestly know i mean that is what ism writing this whole book to try to figure out why it seemed the truth then i would never have done it purposely pokey it did seem the truth when i wrote it nineteen ninety six why it seemed the truth their is what interest me one reason it seemed the truth was that later when oil and areola slept together for the first time she was the one who seduced him she is certain of that they both were but that first kiss when i look back you it he did instigate this and i do not know if i would have had the nerve it sixteen then later seventeen to have acted upon all the things that i acted upon without him being the initial instigator an making your self the instigator were you protecting him i do not think ah i think that i was trying to tell the truth of my own desire i saw him i wanted him and i went after him and i do not think i knew how to reconcile that with the idea that he kissed me first n her forties we'll wanted to wite a love story about love across a great age spam this kind of story it is alloys always told from the man's point of view jell wanted to write it from the perspective of the young woman and also not make her the victim and even though calls tell emphatically does not see herself as a victim some of the choice as she mate in writing her first memoir seems startling to r her account of a letter only center after they slept together dear jill are you ever coming back to class when she did not rest pond he called her and i first memoir we'll plays the anecdote for laughs the first time it is treated of course it is funny what forty seven year old man is gan o write a little girl at her house when her mother can open the mail but when i re wrote it this time what i saw was i saw forty seven year old man having made love to a seventeen year old girl after which he does not hear from her for a month he writes a letter to her house soliciting her again in this sort of in a take love letter and when he does not her back from that little girl again he calls her now and in to day's world we would see that as a predator going after an under age girl and when i think about that ism ism totally shocked ism shock that i did not see that the first time but the end of a story really really makes you change the beginning and i think that that is part of it i think that part of the reason that i wrote it this way is because i was having a wonderful marriage and part of the reason i wrote it this way was because in nineteen seventy when all this stuff was happening it was not as appalling for an older man to do this back in nineteen seventy nobody ever said to jell that they saw anything appalling an arnold's behavior at least not directly here to think i cannot i mean i remember going to a party one time when we were first going out where the hostess served everyone a marteniin me a glass of milk ism ism sure people noticed o my when jell looked back at the first book she was struck by the part she left out parts of scenes the messier more revealing parts but other omissions too once that are more profound about her father who was the exact same age as areola most of the first book is actually about hell's father she only needs areola about two thirds of the way through by that point her father had moved out she rarely saw him he was troubled and explosive and incapable of emotional connection essentially absent from her life i found her writing about him wrenching but weirdly incomplete it was just clear that your and teacher was a substitute for your father and many ways and you do not write explicitly about this in half a life and i wonder if he could talk about we i cannot believe i did not do it i mean ism doing it now in this version it at forty five it seemed obvious and the obvious i in those days i believe made things less literary god knows why od say but that is what i believed and i just do not think its true any more and i think the idea that a fatherless girl goes out and finds them a father and then uses that man to healed himself of having never been loved by an older man i mean maybe i did not know how to handle it at that age maybe it was impossible to do while both my father and my husband were alive what has re examining your story this done to to your picture of your husband or your memories of him or your perception of your marriage well i mean it it it changes the picture because i cannot and now look at him without realizing the lines that he crossed and at the same time i really glad that we crossed those lines i really question a lot of these these these inferences that it is always wrong it was not wrong for me and it will never change my feelings about it being in amazing marriage what what things do you say in the new book that might have been hard for him to read oh my god the whole thing i mean i i would never have written this book if he was have i mean it would be hurtful in half a life he seems he has always been a successful older man and to describe him as somebody who had a midlife crises and was struggling to find himself again i think would have been really painful for him to read areola was a painter he was struggling as an artist when roll met him but he flourished in the years that followed it is interesting to hear you say that the thing areola would be hurt by is the depiction of him as a struggling middle aged man and not the questions about his role as possible predator or aggressor i do not think he would i mean i do not think he ever thought of me but maybe he did who knows o i think that he never thought of me as some one who was not as strong is him yet and i think he would be i think he e shocked and surprised by these new dances in which ism looking back at our relationship the questions yells asking about what she included in what she left out about what she realizes now that she did not back then those questions interest me because the are questions ism asking myself rite now too ism almost exactly the same age as jill was when she wrote half a life and i have a memoir coming out in a few months the book tells the story of my adolescence that i assume it reveals just as much if not more about who i am now at forty six than who i was at sixteen it is about the eating disorders that to find my teen the years and if ism being honest my adulthood too until recently it'd never talked about this stuff with any one in that way the book is very exposing but maybe what is not there it is just as revealing i know there is a lot i cannot yet see and i wanted to talk to jill about that i know that if it'd waited another five years i would've understood more and and sometimes i wonder should have waited to tell my story until i understood it better but i do not it'd i do not think you i do not think i understand my story any better than i did at forty five coquet yet i look back at my forty five year old self and i think oh my god she she did not have this information i i see how young i was at forty five i look at my forty five year old self in much the same way that my forty five year old self looked at my sixteen year old self and it is it is it is a kind of compassionate view of who you were before you had all the information yet when you think o bout yourself at forty five how do you see your forty five year old self now differently than she saw herself ah at that point i i was still thinking about the scent of life i was still moving in this this forward motion i was at the maybe at the height of my powers and when i look back at that i realize how how delusional that is what happens is your writing at forty five from all the information experience you have had what i did not have was the experience of taking my husband all the way to death in her new book ails not just exploring the beginning of her relationship she is treating about the end of it too it is the second part of sleeping with your professor it is the en of depart in a were suddenly you go from being the young lover to the caretaker and that is an entirely different transition taking some one to death that is the most extraordinary experience there is and in some ways who kiss whom first seems really small in in the length of this journey oil always thought that the more interesting way to write memoir would be to return again and again to a monumental moment in a life rather than telling the story in order all the way thrill revisiting a story does not necessarily make it any better she says but it does make it different even when we read about the past were always telling a story about the present whether we mean to or not moss a burden as one of m missus marshal just fence what is book is a novel called

welcome to the hubermanlapcontens scum science science space to life i mender supermen and on professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine my guest to day is chis boss chis boss spent more than two decades as an agent with the f b i or federal bureau of investigation where he was a lead crisis negotiator and a member of the joint terrace task force chis is also the author of a phenomenal bestselling book entitled never split the difference in addition he has taught courses and negotiation at hazard at georgetown and at the university of southern californium as a world expert in all forms of negotiation to day chis teaches us about how to hold hard conversations where we are seeking particular outcomes or perhaps where we do not know what the optimal outcome could be he talks about this in the context of business in the context of relationships including romantic relationships but familial and work relationships as well and he talks about how we should think about ourselves in the context of negotiation that we can all arrive at the best possible outcomes indeed during to day's episode you will learn to pay attention to emotions not just other people's emotions but your own emotions in order to determine whether r not your processing the information your hearing accurately and equally important whether or not you are being heard accurately when you are in a discussion of any kind but especially heated discussions in addition we discuss the role of both physical and mental stamina in the context of difficult conversations negotiations and decision making because in the real world context oftentimes those can take place not just within a single conversation but over the course of several days or even several weeks months or years chis also teaches us about deception that is how to determine if somebody is lying by asking particular type of probe questions thanks to chis gossip both breath and depth of expertise in the negotiation process he glean during his more than two decades service in the f b i as well as his generosity in sharing that information by the end of to day's episode you will have an excellent understanding of what the negotiation proves is really all about and how to better carry out those negotiations that they can best serve you and others before we begin i t emphasize to this podcast is separate for my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my destroy effort to bring zero cosmic consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is plunge plunge makes what i believe as themes versatile at home self cooling cold plunge for deliberate cold exposure have talked numerous times on this podcast about the many benefits of deliberate cold exposure deliberate cold exposure especially deliberate cold exposure done up to the back in water can be used to achieve a number of important end points related to mental health physical health and performance plunge uses a powerful cooling filtration and sanitation unit to give you access to deliberate cold exposure in clean water whenever you want have been using a plunge for more than two years now i can tell you that it makes it very easy to get your deliberate cold exposure at home it does not require much cleaning in fact it is very easy to keep clean which is essential you oft want bacteria and other things growing in your coal plunge basically everything about the plunge is made

glasses in sun glasses that are the absolute highest quality have spent a lifetime working on the biology the visual system and i can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of challenges in order for you to be able to see clearly in different environment rock understands the biology the visual system and as design their eye glasses an single see that you always see with crystal clarity originally their glasses were designed for performance that is for running and cycling and for sport and indeed they can still be used for performance they will not slip off your face if you get sweatyeitheir extremely light wait but i should mention that rock eye glasses and some glasses come in some of the aesthetics for typically associated with performance glasses the sideboard style glasses but they also have a number of styles that you'd be perfectly comfortable wearing out to dinner or to work i wear readers at night or when i drive and i wear some glasses during the day if i happen to be driving into bright light or outside and it is just overwhelmingly bright i do not wear some glasses when i do my morning sunlight viewing to set my circadian rhythm and i suggest that you do the same if you to try rock eye glasses or some glasses you can go to rock are k a day come and enter the code supermen to save twenty per cent off your first order again that is rock are k a day come and enter the code superman at checkout and now for my conversation with crisvoss crisvoss welcome drew pleasure man have been money to talk to you on record for a while you are quite the what we call in signs and of one when somebody is a true sample size of one i realize that yes you are because you have this incredible skill set from your time in he tie you but you also have an incredible understanding in knowledge of how to communicate about that skillet that people can clean useful information from it you are also the guy that i text recall every once in a while wand have ill run myself into a jam or when i think i might be in a jam and i will not reveal details but you tell me whether not things are o k and fortunately the last couple times i reached out you said you are good thank you always happen out thank you well i have a lot of questions to day but would i to start off talking about is negotiations take many forms but if we could break those down into their broad categories that will be useful but before we do that i want to know about the mine set that you have when you go into a negotiation and whether or not there any s practice is i realize it been in this profession a long time and perhaps became reflective to you at some point but all of us at some point tor negointo negotiations business negotiations relationship negotiations et camera is there a process of getting one's mined and body right for a negotiation you are shifting from more listening unless talking or i what are the any tools that you use on the regular that could be am useful for us to keep in mind as we extend into the different categories and negotiations and waste to approaches negotiations and the there can be a couple different first of all just trying to figure what which really going on is is reallesue and then how can i get in approach where ism most likely to get the best possible outcome there is always more than meats time and there is a certain there is a certain few clear caves but the real issue is there is always a better deal or there is no deal at all first of all trying my first thinkers i want to find out whether not there is a deal at all or whether not to bay deal and then i men walk away really fast because those are going to be complete face of time it is not a see to not get to deal this is sin to take a long time can not get the deal what is ta sin to take a long time to get a bad deal i i want to no ism must try to figure real quick whether not is there cut through it on the other side of the table as somebody i could trust ism ism getting ism leading a little more inclined to dealing with the difficult people now as long as i do not give in i get i i want a diagnose early on what the possibilities are now if ism curious if ism actually interested now another aspect of the mind sad is film in a great mood if ism just going t be playful a couple of really huge personal negotiation went recently was when i was just trying to be playful i mean i was just i was in a great mood and ism join around and great negotiation is not exciting its astonishing m ism minute a contlerent conversations right now with a possible conscript o to show and i was telling to producers it of thinking to be real housewife m for to make the show properly there's in of any screaming it is that con t be bar rescue were yelling a people when i can to be house kitchen were reeling a people it is never going to be exciting but it is going to be astonishing you will get out comes were suddenly you find yourself in a place what in a world how do that just happen and i i lose a suit case in a airport the other day and ism walking into lost luggage place and ism in a great mood to om home and ism happy to be me an cumin to get a good nights sleep and even most late it that ism just happy and i you are ready to walk into this the lost luggage store where these people are batter children they expect you they know that you expect them the way for magic ane and proof your luggage is going to be there for whatever reason at when i set to say when i walking a dorms young lady's how can i help you well first of all how you could hep me as obvious cause ism been a lost luggage ire's only we reason ism infers the net's kind of a silly question and i go i need you to wave a magic wine and she just laughs and she looks at me she ins up walking me out to the carafe climbing up on the care s and she walks down o ramp the luggage comes o out of and i guarantee you they are not suppose to do that and she sticks her head and she looks around she comes back out and have never see ne these people leave the office little on walk back to the parasol and she says wait here and she she disappears into the bowels of the airport which looks a superhighway done i wright god knows what it looks on any airport and pretty soon the parasol starts up again and my bag and another bag pops of this other poor shook is in her wait alarm i have never seen anybody do this ever normally they say there is a number will call join twenty four hours and might chow up at your house and i and i look around at the there is another young lady there and i say you do not please tell her thank you for me i i got ta go cause she she does not come back out for almost ten minutes and on my way out she she comes out the door and she cities me she says how is that for way o it a magic wand and that was the magic phrase and i never would have set it to her if i was not playful in a moment and have got a couple of others when i was just playful and ism joking with people almost at my expense it is shocking astonishing well you can get pupil to dofyou if you had in the right way interesting i wonder what it tapped into but it sounds it might have tapped into her sense that everybody's always asking me for a magic wand kind of ability but finally somebody just set it directly and that we are not to of fun to to actually play that roll because normally they are restricted to their keyboard an their phone eh i love that on the opposite side of that spectrum if ever your feeling tense tress jetlag angry yew i can think about negotiations wear people are trying to keep their goes check they want to be right that break ups negotiations it is just not a we fly romantic break up that could include that but also professional break ups in the the dissolution of a of a contract or something that do you ever have to check yourself look et i needs it i man i imagine being calm is better than not being calm for most upmost all things i i d you have a process of doing that you seem my a pretty steady i have never seen you i do over all an pretty steady i well bathe late night f m de g voice that ism not sure that i coin the phrase but contofamous for to calm you down also calms to me down if i get ben out of shape em i will an a conversation could heated it'll switch into that voice with the intention of of calming you down cops tat you notes the that is the foster negotiator's voice but it will calm me down too like intentionally going to that voice tamps down the negative emotions which ism convinced make me summer in the moment interfere with my capacity o process information got reasons for that layman's reasons no scientific academic rigorous studies that have been any journals while after you are done up an i tell you something that will perhaps be astonishing to you as to why there is real nurse science behind that late i f m d g voice having an impact on other people's francs but not yet and it'll do that as it calms me down now if i can if i can make the shift the hard part is to shift into a posit one mind set if i can make that shift but i can only make it from a calm voice i also think it is the emotions are kind of a rock paper scissors sequence i do not think you can go from sadness to elation directly a sad i press down i think there is something to getting angry to pull you out a sadness and i think if you are angry you have got o go to calm next and but if i can get out of anger and go to calm then i can say something o myself the reality is this is a luxury rob or i was in a negotiation with a counterpart that i knew was deceiving lying to me and i remember saying to myself and ism lucky to be in his negotiation i mean i would not they would not be trying to hostile me if we were not really good if we did not have a product that was phenomenal i would not be targeted it at all ism actually lucky to be in this conversation if i can make that next shift he mostly than ism good the hard part is make anxious i meaning to share with you what i learned recently about sound and emotion i ism researching an episode on music in the brain fascinating topic leaving out there is a lot known and the auditory system has this property where of course their anurans nerecells that responded different frequencies of sound low low frequency no deeper tones and i frequency squeals and that sort of thothat is pretty straightforward just we have anurans that responded different different colors are different a angles of light in in the room but what i learned and i confirmed with a good friend of my stay auditory her scientist and and her surgeons names at change he was a guessed on the podcast previously is that low frequency sounds of the sort that your voice is that late night f m d j voice or responded to in the brain by anurans no surprise there but the frequency at those anurans fire is also low frequency in other words when you speak in your low voice the other persons brain hearts that and starts firing in a low frequency o in other words sitting trains to your voice not just the timing but it is actually you are essentially playing an emotional piano down in the low keys of there of their mind now when you go up to the high frequencies the anurans cannot follow that high frequency there is something special about low frequency sound that actually changes the emotional tone of the people that hear that low frequency sound this is wild right sing of course the content of the words matters too but any we there is that there is real borrow science to support the voice that you ere endowed with him that you a that you employed for your work well then and then also the point then to is it is not the other sides not making a choice it is an involuntary reaction that is right this is not something one can override except by perhaps plugging their ears right neither hearing that there their mind is getting shifted toward a state of low frequency oscillation which is one of more calm then yes that is a real thing and and were you to have a high squeaky chipmunk's voice you might not have been the negotiator you at all the who knows maybe there be another tactic there i mayn't i think back to the a what i guys it was during one of the gulf work campaigns whether they were not they trying to am squeeze out a sad and some of a his people by playing silly vanilla at high volume for hours anchors is that tactic actually used m that that was that was a panama when they were trying to get noryegais item ism only a few am only a few countries o and i i an't notion or get the and ways tell you before and the wacky yet fastening useless information round tsarism stuff that i tried that t at panama and and for whatever the mill italy guise they were plan music t and sounds and then also among h many stupid things that the if the i did a wake and late at night they tried that in the taco compound to and it was just there was one of things that the hostage negotiators were animatedly against animatedly against but they got overruled a by hunting command among the many stupid things over done at wake that was also don at wake we stupid's nonproductive posters negotiators were always against it for those you do not remember wacko wake was a branch civilians a avid corals right there was a a neflixeries tit was out about a recently that is fair about the how you went how yes sad ending he eventually set the the building a blaze healed himself in everybody else and a people inside set the building on fir including a lot of children part including some children am there a epyagens that dove not gotten over that let you talk about some different types of negotiations a oftentimes i think because your a former if behind negotiator it the derris task force this kind of thing a btendefocus on the negative negotiations it get the hostages away we will talk about that stuff a break ups business deals that have gone wrong a people lying cheating what about negotiations that are benevolent let us say that two people want to a come to it a true wind wind around what they each see to be their best interest in what is a friendship two friends taken a trip together action who is gan to pay for what whose gan to pay up front people in to pay each other back for a romantic relationship two people are considering fusing finances to some extent or moving in together what sorts of questions should people be asking themselves prior to those negotiations in particular is it very important that people know exactly what they want going into a negotiation or i can recall many times when have gone into life circumstances knowing i wanted a certain set of feelings or outcomes but not being extremely specific about i want this salary i want to live in in a west facing house on this particular location an exploration can of potentials a mi think can also take the former negotiation but how did how should people think about approaching benevolent negotiations were we are not talking about something tragic happening if it does not go through it might hurt it might be a bit high friction but stalk about how to get to a win win yet well is as couple interesting things are first of all in o the phrase win win a because win win is just great collaboration i mean point of fact it should be win win which might only be emotional win win now the phraseology win win i know that if someones opens a negotiation with me and they say right up the bad look i want ted to win wen do with you that correlates extremely highly with some one is trying to pick my pocket i if you use that phrase in the first five minutes i ready know where you come from you trying to get me to draw my guards you wen i lose and is came up on an instrgraund post i put up recent win which is essentially wat watch out for h person says wen wen not did not say win win is bad i said watch out for a person at see it also you got to be cautious if if you some f the win win mind set and people set themselves up to just get slaughtered by the person is expressing a desire for wen wen and look in a pick their pocket if i feel win when my heart you go let us do wen wend deal if in a watch am all cay what do you want and then i find myself given away the store there is a lot behind the wen wen phraseology that you have to have a complete understanding of in point to fact both sides should feel good about the outcome and is not that the definition of wen wen hell kinossorter but it is how they feel about it more than really what they got in a benevolent negotiation among friends where we going to go to eat where we going on vacation what ruder we going to take people really just want to be herd out more than anything else which operationally seems to be understand how it is on to make any difference makes all the difference in the world and how what is the best way for somebody to feel heard out well ism in to start out by telling you describing to you not telling you but describing to you what my best guess is on your perspective because it is really calibrating me actually finding out where your position is and the only way i can find out where your position actually is ism in ism in a increase you telling me if i start taking a guess at at first cause you are immediately right away you he immediately going to tell me either am right or am wrong you are gin correct me correction is a is a satisfying thing to do and you are going to be much more candid with me if you are correcting me than if ism asking you ill and your feel good about correct of me it is going it there is all these great emotional lubricrance to me getting you to correct me unto out by saying his his is what i think you are thinking his i think you are approachingness is what i think you are wanting out of this out of this not what you should be but what you probably are based on your perspective and that is going excelerat the conversation exponentially it is ridiculous how much faster things are going to go and then it becomes both an information gathering and poor building précis simultaneously instead of separately which is what makes us approach fast or even though it seems more indirect if we are getting read its say you unit get to thing a cart trip t a a to san francisco from here and i must say a my guess is you want to take the most direct rule because you hate wast in time and you problem say to me not i want to go up the pacific coast highway because is beautiful stretch e a country i realize it is going to be waste of time if we go up the pacific coast cause we get a jump off it at some point but i really want to see the scenery you would have have taken a guess or what you want and you con come back real quick and correct me and and maybe ism thinking time on the trip but have forgotten how beautiful it is to roll up the coast and when you throw that it'll be our yet it is a beautiful idea and we might not get into the shot who knows what is going to happen yet i know now now that we are having a conversation it'd rather run up the pacific coast highway before we before we go inland and make the trip and and that is how we get to a we collaborate for better better out come may be a better idea than what i had mine in the first place i love that because what you just described this hypothesis testing yes it is the way scientist or train you may people do not know this but day teach us in since not to ask questions but to start with a question how does it how does the brain developed for something and then you say a hypothesis and you test hypotheses and the figure out the right a wrong and that takes you through a set of decision trees and you eventually get at what you hope as some sort truth a and an healthy others arrive there as well an you get at consensus i love the idea of hypothesis testing in fact when you said i take the most direct out from where we are now i into angels to i san francisco ism i to take one o one not the five the five is faster s i meanly think but i one o one first while their couple really great talk and hamburger spots along the way that i sat of an my bull dog an also get to see at the coast and it makes those extra two hours completely worth it and you are exactly right and i in that working through the decision tree does not necessarily mean u presuming that the the hypothesis is right it sounds you be equally o k with the hypothesis being wrong because really what your trying do is just learn and in learning set up ya collaboration a no couple of things first of all when you talk about hypothesis d when when my son brand was involved on a companies on is ton his own now but hes always say hypothesis test your hypothesis he always use at term and even now like a we were talking about it and you just said you knew some hot dog and hamburger places a but a call cow i did not even know that end why yet i want to check those places out as how you discover new stuff in a conversation of it and also i sire people are noting to not say the words wind wind when approaching into negotiation what what do you think it is about those little catch phrases that that signal lack of authenticity or trustworthiness because you could imagine that somebody might come to you and say racists lets a i let us do some collaborative thing for social media for podcast and this can be a wind win for both of us now i know it i never say that with you but you could imagine that somebody really means that but for you it sounds it it is a flag that i there try to pull one over it is it is a it correlates really strongly with the people that a deafnike trying carryout throat and have had ice had i admit that to me candidly mas i it'll be i have experienced it the give s melody throws win went out early to me it'll say right i think i know where this is going but let me explore it and we'll a yeah this great opportunity for you that is another top and woman put you in a room with all these billions and it is going to be all this opportunity for you if you just come in and speak and you knot we do not have a budget oh have gotten that one before the the famous that the famous a the world were just work out in your favor es mass cause it is get a work out in my favor exactly right hit have been the receiving end of those offers many a time a fascinating conversely what sorts of open else am do you think established the best reporter and a you'd a benevolent discovery of a topic but when ism saying collates real strongly with people i want to do business with if if they fig it out something that they knows valuable for me and they have just done it and they've just offered it root off the bat no strings attached if they found a way to drop something on me that is valuable they did not approach me with their hand out they approach me with some sort of generosity i a a front of mine job polish runs this it'll fid call genius night work job belief was life gifts to the giver am i jug that a bunch of favors for me before i ever joined and he was trying to help me out and get my books sold and he asked me to come in and speak and he would he would done up he would emphasize my book on his pot case and a different conversations and i and i i kindly pay the fee to join cause he would done much for me this not much job could ask me fore right now cause he is done much for me that he gets a blanket pretty much yest right away what h what would want what hin cause he just generous and the generosity approach universally ism seeing a lot of really successful pop pile to lead by generosity and if you start out that if you give me five story e book on amazon no strings attached or anything that goes a long long way to somebody who wants to establish a long tum relationship o collaboration when i first opened my laboratory in a two thousand even i had a technician at the time who ad been a technician for a lot o years and there is this culture in science of people borrowing things from laboratories and not giving them back or breaking them these can be little things a small instrument or a a footsteps but as a student or postiche these of the thins that you cove it a really nice parafoil sees is a great thing you drop em once they are not they are not good any more by the way it is the the o ant to treat them with respects surgical tools have to be treated with respect that antheses are very fine instruments and people used to come by our lab all the time and borrow stuff from us and he would always lend it out e what are you doing but any time i went to go borrow something he would say do not borrow anything from anybody else because then we are going to owe them right now everybody severyand all that you are running up or budget given away these instruments that come back with the footsteps dentine even he said just trust me this is the way to do it and i do not recall ever could not duo cashing in on any of that but he was exactly right when i eventually decide to move institutions we would given away much and we would asked for very little may be nothing that it when you leave a place typically there can be a little bad blood and all we got was sorry to see you go conned it been me i would have been in a kind of a in exchange of o we ask for things we give things into have a neighborhood i for up a neighborhood where you would borrow eggs or milk from the neighbor remember those days ah o no if people do that any longer a but i think it falls well into what you are describing that when when you just do things for people ism out of goodness then sure you sort of have a a history where you could return to that they owe you but there is all ja something good about just doing things out of goodness and also not asking for much em an expecting people to provide that i i love that and i actually um i love providing good reviews for things i you on the phone when mum the air line that we do not do the same more we book our own flights but what any time i get help on the phone and if it is really great help it'll say how can i help unless i would mean a lot if you old send an meal to this to my business to saying i i did a great job or and i act yum really enjoy doing that o em i love the points you are making because they're very actionable as many of have been taking a g one daily since two thousand twelve some delighted that they're sponsoring the pod cast a one is a vitamin mineral robotic drink that is designed to me all of your foundational nutrition needs of course i try to get enough servings of vitamins and minerals through whole food sources that include vegetables and fruits every day but oftentimes i simply cannot get enough servings but with a g one ism sure to get enough fitments and minerals and the robotics that i need end it also contains adaptagence to help buffer stress simply put i always feel better when i take a g one i have more focus and energy and i sleep better and it also happens to taste right for all these reasons whenever ism asked if you could take just one supplement what would it be i answer a one if you would to try a g one they will to drink a g one doc come slash supermen to claim a special offer they will give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin d three k to again that is drink a one dot cam slash supermen shifting slightly into the more em let us call them hi friction a negotiations or the types and negotiations where there it is the potential for a truly bad outcome rank em i know you have been asked is before but some of our listeners er going to be learning about you for the first time do you recall of the many negotiations that you did while in the efbii any one particular negotiation that felt if this does not work out this is really catastrophic and would you be willing to share that with us well i learn to try to teach us early on that not everything's going to work out and the second negotiation i had not philippines a first one young man o eff shelling was grabbed by terrace group a abusive and a unit up walking away cause we we stale the bag uses long enough that we just some times if you can slow it down you wait for something good to fall out of sky and it will and that id enough happening in that case and a bad guy in's o calling the negotiator that i coached on a phone after was over the basically tell em that they still had a good relationship it was not a why is a bag i call the negotiate a responsible friend losing everything and say only good a good job which is exactly what happen we roll into a case a and i had not had anything go bad at that point of time e panic case at burghal some barrel case a by different fashion of the terrace group thirteen months later in's up in am to the three remaining hostages shot killed by friendly fire on along the way a hostages have been executed america had been executed early on and it was it was a train rack and lots of people got killed all on away and just really ridiculous bad things happening and that that was bad all the way through a we learnt o learned a lie from it a went back and checked everything we did and we did not do anything wrong that we felt based on a strategy did not did not miss anything and that was why in it up going a elaborating with the guys at hazard because my reaction was if this if we did everything we know how to do and it was not enough that means were not smart enough we got to get better and that case taught me a lot about the dynamactur really happened on the other side and the difference between you know whether to people really on your side the are government was not highly collaborative a the philippines government was not highly collaborative the everybody wanted to get their pountof flesh out of the other out of the other side i mean just everything bad that you could imagine marlin on when garmusterbero a was murdered by the ebbusif it was a national holiday in t e philippines and the cause had a history of killing people on national holidays and we were not fun of philippines and we had no idea that that day was a national holiday and we showed up at a philippines national police headquarters in manilla and it was closed now we got in not ti got it on going hostage case with bad guise threatening to kill hostages and we show up at the gates and the gates ware closed and wen put the house going on he it was the national holiday and nobody's working today an mi first of all nobody told us that secondly i do not think the baggie really care that it is the national holiday and nobody's working our negotiators nowhere to be found we got we got we got a guy there that that the previous negotiator we worked with philippines national police was not that happy that they did not have him under complete control they give us a guy that we will not tell us anything until after he is told them hes sad not conversation with the bad guise and we are actually herein about him second hand he did not show up that day and then and of course that day the babies announce are going to kill a kill a hostage and bit is a gift to country the philippines cause it is a holiday and then go all by the way they doing this on holidays and an and germisterberry ant of get his head cut off with the because of all the warring factions on our side of the table not telling each other what these going on i had assumed at that point of time that people tell us the stuff we need to know we did need to ask and and after that i got look there are not nothing here that i do not need to know i do not you fitolidies coming out in you room i know you got to tell us really learned a lot about collaboration on our side of the table and also the lack of collaboration on the other side of the table juscause we must does not mean they got their act together and the bad guise did not have their act together and ultimately the hostages one of the reason common didn't come out because internally they they had double cross each other learned a lot about what really fundamental human natured dynamics are teams and your them has not got tract together and the other them does not either what can you do is a communicator to make up for that really learned a lot about that in that case i had cases subsequent to that involved in albino when a city was killing people on a regular basis but we saw those common and we did everything we could do to keep the train from smashing into us you see a train coming down a tracks it is coming down the tracks and you do the best you can to de rail sitting sometimes you cannot have heard it said that when people take somebody captive that they either want their money their body or their life or some commination of those eats that is probably one of those three and it is very true and as the negotiator trying to rescue the hostage is it important to identify early on which of those three or which all of those three thereafter home serious they are are they willing to actually kill the hostage are they will they go for any amount of money above as number of dollars around jets figure out their threshold right i mean because the person is on the other side is gambling right their gambling there the freedom their gambling there u reputation with whoever their reputation matters to is it important to get into the mind set of the personnel negotiating with quickly using the hypothesis a generating method you ham and if a could you give a an example of how that played out in in your previous work at the am the indicators are really there i mean once you sort of a luseyour illusions about how you things i you think things should play out the a patterns of behavior are generally pretty quick i are not clear and just cause you do not the patterns withoukita we recognize the patterns and known what they are does a mean you can change what they are an alit and two thousand forest time from was very clear about telling people on deadline and we had to recognize that that there there becomes a pattern of behavior and it is usually specificity in what they say and this it this is all this is all human nature if if if you are in a business negotiation and they say w'llcan do some horrible here we gan a walk out n that is fairly non specific and if they say look if we do not get the by this specific deadline if we do not get these specific things met by the specific time that is pretty specific that its specificity you've looking for it i learn to look for it and kidnapping negotiation n we are working a case again in the philippics and a bag is say i if we do not get a ransom for the sun seventeen year old boy at the time is kidnapped you tell his father's going to losing egg and it's the you you youphamism for losing a child and early on when that threatening through on our side to the table but he is all my got they going to kill i and offs is really bad we got to make sure the family can pay the ransom ism none o now it did not hey did not say when it was going to happen they did not say how was going to happen they did not say who was going to do it the basic specificity of who but wen in wear they left themselves an out here a very clear out and we never said we were going to do it we never said when it was going to happen we never said woods child what they just trying to scare i thrown out something vague i say we it we got plenty of time to play with this we got it we got a pushes all thewy through the process and to the end now later on in that case when the family tried to deliver a ransom and it was screwed up by god knows who the bag is came up back on a phone and they said if we do not get paid to more your son dies and i sat right now that is specific and he is guy sound they mean it and we are going have to make sure the tingles down to morrow or that is the end o this kid and at that point of time we allowed the family we were in a position to allow or disallow we were in a position the awl for thoughts and our thoughts we they mean it now and you need to do something now or likely something bad going to happen and now that the is serious cause you always got a worry about awe's to refer to his a double deep to they take the money and then's and they come back and say now that was a down payment that was not the rant that was just the down payment you got to make sure you do not get double dip if you let the family pay and you got to give your honest opinion is to whiten at the n at the homage go if to pay now and our our thoughts were you pantemar you son's coming out anything the double dip is a scary thing to hear about a at a much lower level meaning more minor level a people sometimes get shaken down on line that they're password will get taken thereat people everywhere who go for the click on this lank you get a tax message we have identified that your account has been change verify you click on the lank takes you some place where you put in your logging and password and boom it is gone and then they try and sell it back to you typically through cripticcurrency because it is not traceable by the way those this negotiations can be a lot of fun if you let m i have well ism hoping that our discussion about this now is going to save some people a the trouble of having their they are accounts fact have known people who have their accounts fact and these are some smart people but what is interesting is that have also observed those situations where somebody gets to the point where they say ism just going to gin what they want and i i remember in this one particular instance saying no not do not give them the money because then there just going to say they want more there is now there is no guarantee that they are going to give you back what you want right why would they right if you think about it why would they the money funnels in under they just can pivot and go to the next thing how do you gain confidence that you are likely to be double dipped or not well first of all i got to find out if than a position to carry out the thread or there any sort of legend position begin with you now for lack of a better torments proof of life and there lot of people a to try to scam you but they do not really have the ability to scam you she got to find out wo do do some confirmation do they do they have access o your count do they do they have you at of they have your money do they have it in a position where they just trying to make you believe that they have that position of an influence on you they are lot of a lot of baggies out there that are just role an a die styling for dollars if you will and if they do not scam you when they have no severe on ya they will find somebody else that will give in there is a bit of you do not authenticity or or dare they in a position to do it and the same rule applies in any negotiation the other side is going to give in when they feel they have gotten everything they can kidnappers it'd be asked by an ambassador i asked by ani be i commander whins is going to be over when the bad guises feel they have gotten everything they could not when they did but when they felt they did our jobs just make hem feel it sooner how how hard you make it innocently on the other side everybody everybody wants to feel they did e they got a good days pay for a good days work if you let them feel their in charge and you make a more by asking em innocent how in what questions which are very hard and fatiguing to answer then you are going to get to the point where your going to get a solid outcome where you do not get double depth and there gong to be happy that it is over cause they felt they got everything they could it could be a date could be your bank account could be anything the other side is going to be satisfied with the outcome when they feel they have worked for it and business negotiations just selling your car and some you have put a price tag on your car and i got walks up toe insists it'll give you full amount right now which your reaction i should ask for more i maybe i will not sell my car every human interaction yotherside wants to feel that they earned what they got and the idea of empathy in hosts negotiation is really just to make him feel that sooner con to come back to empathy because it is such a big and important topic but have heard it said before that if somebody you do not know maybe y also somebody places a real sense of urgency on need the money now or a i need to you do something right away or else am not a threat of physical violence but that any request for a expediting something is a red flag y that it is likely to be a scam very seldom do you need to click on the link within twenty four hours right i mean how could that possibly be right that we but that is one way in which people are exploited you am that some request comes in by those or by male or tax to her maybe even person somebody says you need to do this right now or else something bad as can have capture people's sense of urgency i get them to make a mistake and then there they are left reeling because that request for something right now or else i think hits a fundamental nerve in us i know e want o help to be a rescuer right m is that a good rule of thumb for people to keep in mind it did not i think that is your great rule of thumb i mean i a friend of mine a somebody got o hold of his phone number not that long ago and a i i was getting tax from his number look ma i noisome r proms lo id i need some money from you now was a friend friend's number and i remember when i first saw it actually if when i first thought i was really busy and i felt bad that i did not back that day and then i did not hear from em again an fatwa we w never was you worked it out couple weeks later i get the text again you got real promise got to get back to me right now ism ism i decide if it is really my buddy i am going to help him right now i got to make church really my buddy an i said ay man you did not raise this at all last time i satin in vagus cause it'd seen him in vagus recently and he is a i was busy i could not bring it up and something our there is no direct confirmation of the nice we had we had breakfast together vagus then i shoot back a i and man i got to say something that was such a crazy night and i still owe you money from them that night when we are gambling i i still owe you money ism happy to help now it was not a crazy night it was breakfast and i did not o money and his next response was ye i do not worry about it you can make it up from to me with this mi tried cool we now i start making stuff up and i said and when we were it those strippers and that dog and the clown and the pony it'll never get over that and now the guys would he talking about and i said by the way and then i started thrown in some stuff about his wife and his mother and guy got insult than call me names and stop text to me and then i then i sent all those ten messages to the real guy including what it'd said about his mother and he acted me back he is got a great sense of humor's as by the way my mum does think you are attractive oh get i but i thought i started it all by just checking the source if it was my friend i would a help them immediately and i need to throw something at him that is going to confirm that it is him and then ism there for him but ism also going to have put a little bit of a curving there that that if he does not catch i know it is i know it is the tin and then ism going half fond weather incredible knowledge that people hear this an they might think oh you now that is never going to happen to me but like a said i am known family members and friends who they make the mistake they take the bat of clicking on the link and then now they are getting the shake down ism actually a good friend of mine said that her parents called at some point parents probably in their late seventy now i some one had called their house and told them that their child this woman had been kidnapped rand that they needed to send money and that if they called the police they would kill her or harm her and somewhat they started sending money and they were afraid to contact or and you can see what a bind a a loving parent would be in right they obviously do not want to get this child of theirs hurt and they obviously a willing to do whatever it takes in order to get the doctrine that as total scamp because eventually there was communication that made realized that that their daughter was perfectly out and ever even interacted with kidnappers those kinds of scamps happen pretty often i hatchet have not a friend also ye the sense of urgency but should have ben the first flag that is at that is a great point ye absolutely and it look look even if they have got you loved one the secondary issue is if you do what they want are they on a loth go which is actually a legitimate question if they really are language one of the things we learned in hostage negotiation that i applet of business negotiation there are legenmate question as get ask to you not being disrespectful you are not pushing back there is there are fair if you an't us if boy fairlygenimate questions you can ask under any circumstances which is basically if i comply is just going to work out the way that you are articulating it anything that adds communication into it which gives you more information to find out what the old titan i come looks even in kidnappings how do that how do that if you pay the on alautumgo that is a degenerate question there are example somewhere in between you know getting your instrogram account hacked your bank account hack and you god forbid your child kidnapped for instance a there is a whole practice withinthe legal profession of probing to see whether or not somebody is going to give up money to avoid a law suit for instance this is a i she a lawyer friend of mine recently described their jaw very well he said in his words first person he said i scare people for money the operate word being scary that is been an once bionic yet he is being very honest he scarce people for money's very good at it and a and he understands how other people scare people for money and he works both sides a plaintive for defense type situations but know it made me realize that you a lot of the legal profession is not came the law suit slid across the table it is the coquet hears what the lawsuit would look here e all the statutes that potentially were were violated and then there is a probe of what somebody is finances are and we know how much they're willing to pay and do they have liability insurance to they have an umbrella policy all the sorts of thing theatre theatre really it is not necessarily an illegal shake down but it is a probing as to weather or not t there is it is worth the effort diagnosing the other sensibility to pay your night and that happens really often i can give a specific example where a somebody had a incident at a dog park where their dog a a legibly ran into somebody may be charged at somebody a dog it people are standing around and the person moved and an and apparently injured their need but rather than the owner of the dog what they typically do is deliverer some set of documents that say i was a injured your dog was responsible for this am and if you do not settle up for ax number of dollars you can be sued for usually an exorbitant amount stand then there is this question that the the lawyers have to figure out is it puffery right are they saying hat moment you for four million dollars as there are not basis for that and good lawyers will say that is puffery there they are trying to scare you with a big number but a lot of people see that number ago o my goodness what are they want i i do not even now if they were injured if they were that is terrible it'd want that taking care of if my dogs responsible i want that taking care of but what it what a they need in order to make to this go way and that happens millions of times a day throughout the country and a good portion of those probably happen here in californium because there is a that is good the way the legal system is arranged that this is not somebody am it could be somebody menitlaying the law could also be somebody who is being entirely honest about there experience of being injured by somebody ease's dog under those conditions i man soundly the same set of rules apply you want to know how serious they are do they have a case to speak thus the work of the lawyers but in the messing how serious somebody is you said sit is fair you called at the eff word i that it'll never forget that it just ask a fair question that how much money do you think you deserve or a is that would not be a good example of a very direct question a or is it am how likely are you to walk away if we do not give you the money it it sir i because i could imagine there's all sorts of reasons why people would be dishonest about about answering those question well tenth i how much money you think you could deserve a you deserve is is a really good quest in not necessarily what the answer is but how they answer it i you going to get how quickly they fire back and whether not they stop and think about it how and what questions typically or best to judge the other side to reaction and answer is secondary cause how or what question causes what we would refer to is a deep thinking slow thinking dannyconoman behavorleconomics thinking stand slow slow thinking is in kept thinking you ask how or what question make the other side think first and judge the reaction to how they think about it and do they actually do they actually think about it who her they fire right back at you they give you a clearer picture of who you are dealing with where the outcome is going to go how much money do you think that you deserve if they immediately you ten million dollars i is is i get a shape don artist on the other side or they say i if they stop and think about it and they give you a thoughtful answer that is a completely different person on the other side you asking a question to get a to dig knows how they respond first the answer is second and sometimes i if it is a cut throw on the other side ism an to start patron em with how an what questions just to wear am out that is passive aggression if i if i got a cut throughout a gressoron the other side ism ant to drop into passive aggressive behavior to slow em down and wear am out one of my hostage negotiation heroes a going tome johnny pike was john to mining pike not not johnny john rockets banian johnny john to medico got all the a western hostage is out of barroom n mirage what a book called man without a gun i negotiated in person face to face with his bulla the only gang that ever did that got everybody out and in his book he wrote one of the great secrets to negotiation is learning how to exhaust the otherwise and when you have got a really dangerous adversary on the other side of it ted we y u do not go know to knows you do not argue you don't you not combat if you wear m out exhaustion and if you get somebody really combative or cutthroat on the other side start pampering on with how on what questions cause it even think about the answer tiresome out and it is passive aggressive and it is deferential and it really works if the person on the opposite side of a high friction negotiation is aggressive the goal is to slow things down fatigue them ye and get them to just either relent or to reveal something that is that is a loop ye ye if if i have to make tho deal then ism going to wear am out it'd to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor inside tracker inside tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood end and eh to help you

more about inside tracker and to enter this zerocost give away go to fitness fuels longevity dot calm to enter that is fitness fuels longevity dot calm to enter ism interested in drilling a the bit further into this process of wearing em down and the passive aggressive way of reducing the aggressors stands and i want a highlight for people that what we are talking tout hear is i manipulation to extract something were aftyou find aby the reverse we are talking about a bad actor who is aggressive an trying to am defend that bad actor what is that process of of wearing em down look there sound could you give us a couple of examples of let say ism the bad actor we could play this game i will not be very good at this am and i am saying look i want ex number of dollars why this date or you are not gingko get what you want they are going to die ore disappear is that simple and ism you no a stone wall kind of approach what is the approach that you take to wear that person down well what what a they arguing to be hound questions that a mostly hound what and there going to be legitimate questions which is how do i know you are going o follow through what does it look i could i do what you want how d i know your going to follow through get them to talk about the alternative o case if you were to whip you deliver by that date ism in to pass them to you without fail if they are just getting kind of brief answers where the person is just again this kind of rigid to on wall approach yet well and there is a phrase at we use all the time vision draws decision if if you are really going to comply if i if i give in and when i say how do i know you can you going to follow through ism not tart about the threat not trying to get you to clarify the threat trying to get you to clarify what implementation looks i need to know ism based on your reaction to that if you plan on following through if i comply you will already have that in your head or be open to it vision drives decision you have fought it through in advance what this letting the hostages go look if you would if you have no intention of ever release release in the hostage if i follow through then you not can to be able answer the question or yuan you solano throw back on me really quickly and then now i know out you got no plans on complying if i give in you not got a comply i but you still want the money then i man ask well i must post to pay if you do not have any plans for complying and if you willing to entertain a conversation about what compliance looks there was a kidnapping that the my unit worked just before i was in it in venire a whaler where they were not entirely sure that the bag as real the far i think had had the hostage they agreed on an exchange point to let the hostage go that was some distance from where they had a prettgood idea the hostage was being held they figure then i on to drag the hostage all the way this river crossing if the neck ill let him go just too much effort and then it it was one of the few times i was going to be a singable theoretically a simultaneous exchange but tegannaff son e money across a river before the hostage was let go if we agree to this right but an not can to drag this this guy all the way to this river crossing if they do not plan on levin em go and if it is a long way to drag em and they got their money do they want to drag em back even if they're ambivalent once they get there if they have gone through all the effort to get to the meeting location and the hostages there we have now just increase the chances significantly they on to go ahead comply cause its pain in the back to take m back this is all human nature stuff human nature and vestment how do you get em to engage in actions in behaviors and then verbal commandments that actually mean something to them when i was working kidnappings the very last thing we would always have the family get the babies to say at last not first but last we we would actually get a verbal promise to let em go again at the end because we have been talking to em long enough at this point of time we got a pretty good idea what they sound when they are lying in what they sound when they tell in the truth if somebody tells the truth they pretty much ten to tell the truth the same way every time if they tell the truth you talk to somebody long enough you got a line on do they ever tell the truth and if they do what is it sound people lie twenty ways they tell the truth one way we have been coach in a negotiations wit the kidnappers long enough that we know what they son when they tell the truth when they ask it the very and if we if we pay you promise to let em go it is not that they answer but how they answered t and that that will be the last thing to seal the deal you now how my continually stack the gods in your favor for implementation do you have a bodily a somatic sensor for lying of the reason i ask is years ago i had the experience of on knowing somebody and they turned out to be a generally good p person but i sensed early on that something was off i could not relax around them i just could not relax around them and and i could not tell you why but it was as if my i couldn't even identify the hero an anomy of it you me i say it was the vaguest nervous land but i teaching or anatomy and i cannot point to one pathway in the body there was something about my autonomic response that would just start cranking up when i was around them something as off as anything is of something us and and i kid you not five years later five years later i discovered a series of lies that all rachitic together that we are actually pretty meaningless in the total context of things but i remember thinking at that moment oh my goodness my my system knew the knew and it for all my knowledge of narrow science i i cannot tell you to the say what it was and in the in my biology but it had something to do with my bodily response it was not just a thought that does not quite at up when i feel can gain the run around or or this it was it was a physical sensation are you familiar with that experience yet well it is a little bit what you guise in your college are still discovering the science behind the got and what we actually teaching my company now were teaching people learn the difference between your got and your arugula for lack of a better time your feer centers and know which one is which and listen to your got your got is ridiculously accurate now where where does that information come from when your potash recently i was listening to wo talking about old factory house rite the mouse i to never thought of t hat course it the e them was a term for the u the the molecules are you putting off that that oh far mel a marmots what a piano molly you ten it get kicked out of course and that is why some of the great investigators i new would say i can jut smell it i can smell it what all is feeding you are got and what what are the senses that the science has not yet discovered you cannot you cannot make me believe i i will never believe that the life force stops at the surface of our skin that there is a energy and it we can pick up on the energy i mean our got is being fed by all these different in puts that we are aware of or that we have yet to be made aware of the tone of voice does not match their their words theta the head tell you've got a super computer in your brain you are got is incredible if you listen to it instead of your fierce centers and as soon as you start listening to you are got you cannot explain it at the time but you got you to a bad feeling in your got and later on then you saw it all at all came together where your brain was picking up these cues your your brain was probably when you are in their presence there is got o be in over somebody gives off when there when they are intentionally deceiving you do not you did not know that that that was dismal and maybe you could not have consciously smelled to be you still picking it up long answer to ism a very big believer in in the got i think there is science that we know and yet to discover that tells us that the got is just ridiculously accurate if we listen to it instead of our fierce centers i completely agree that there are on energetic exchange is that nor science cannot yet explain the field of nor science that is is starting to explorer some of these things on there is basically a three apex journals tithe most competitive journals to publish in science nature and sell and a i only mention that because there was a series of articles written in science magazine about magneto reception in humans the idea that humans can detect magnetic feel sounds quackery right turtles can detect magnetic feels they migrate by them actually long distances but the ideas that humans cannot do that and yet there are some well controlled studies where people have to guess about the orientation of a magnetic field and they do it better than chance not everyone can do it but some can do it better than chance in a way that cannot be predicted by anything else except some inherent form of magnetic reception in their nervous system there are capabilities of the nervous system that are starting to be revealed for which we do not have a lot of evidence but there is enough evidence to suggest that these things are really happening m the other example which you might find interesting is a obit a were little less esoteric but there is a beautiful paper published in one of the sell press journals a couple of years ago showing that when people listen to the same story the distance between their heart beats tends to be very similar now does not mean that the exact heart rates are similar but if you look at the distance between their heart beats they all in train to the same rhythm the same song get this there in completely separate rooms the experiments are being done on complete separate days and yet if i were to line up just you that the distance between the the heart beats for you they would line up a set of columns or dozens of individuals listening to the same story clearly there is a passage of energy from we hear and things we see that goes into our nervous system at a level that is below our conscious detection here is the last thing it'll say about this we have a series on mental health coming out not mental illness but mental health m by the a i think to be among the very finest psychiatric in the world a doctor palconti and he said we all think that the forebrain is the supercomputer he said no the subconscious is the superheat is where the real knowledge processing is happening that is the iceberg below the surface where all the real heavy lifting is taken place and that people who learn to tap into the subconscious can learn to use that information in my meaningful ways and i think that is what we inscribing he is been on with you before right he has to talk about drama in particular and he was on lech freedman's podcast as well the series that we are doing with him is not about drama per set it is really about the subconscious and the self i think you will find the series really interesting and has a number of very practical questions that one can ask themselves about they are subconscious and and can work the process of psychiatry we are excited to release that series but it cause i do not know of anything it that is been put out there into the public but but i was pleasantly surprised to hear him say we all hear that the forebrain is the supercomputer it is what drove our evolution as i none non on know it is it is the subconscious that is where our real wisdom resides and the forebrain is just the implementation device it is i i an we can convince ourselves that the were in charge i i i cannot think of a time that my got told me eh and it turned out to be b there often than not though have suppressed my response right got i override it thinking i think i made the mistake that you guys train your negotiators to avoid which as i thought well this is making me anxious in the anxiety must be me but this must be my fault r ism not able to call myself in the situation i not sleeping well et camera and and therefore this much must represent some deficiency on my part and then and lord knows as your shirt points out ism ism a very food person i have many flouts i always have three thousand peeves and at least as many flaws to match hes i want to one at least relationship but i the point being that i think our bodies really do know they know ye yo ye i agree when you are doing negotiations and you are hearing somebody is voice on the phone they are lot of cues when you are face to face they are additional use there is their face and then of course if the negotiations are being done by text over a computer of phone it is a very diminished environment f re information maybe we could talk about each of those because we live in those landscapes if t were face to face and we are negotiating am you are listening of course to what i want what ism insisting on you are working that process from your your side what a you paying attention to visually it is more than are things in a linemen there is layman's data o the words the way it said and look on people's face and how are they weight and how they play out there is a rash out there the very in scientific see thirty eight fifty five see per cent word thirty eight per cent delivery fifteen percent body language people not argue about it'll the time whether not that is accurate it's a rule them we throw that out there but i tell people the most important issue is do they line up ism not going to look for when you raise your eyebrow or wen you look up into the left ism rely just going to try to get a got feeling wether i think these things are lining up whether there an allotment whether they are out a line and then ism n to be real careful about what meaning i assigned to that know a affective us changes in your tone of voice changes in your movement wen that is one of the reasons why we do not teach reading people's body language because it is completely contextual to you and the moment i if i convince myself that you do not raise o the eyebrow means this it is out a context i was in a negotiation once though i throughout a figure to somebody and i some con look off to side and look back and accepted my offer and ism made the mistake of not saying to them the propriety thing for me to say at the time would have been seems something just cross your mind cause you only completely true observation if they looked to the side and look back something cross their mind now i read it at the moment of saying that they had more money and i found out after the fact that was wrong they were stretched to the limit the look of hesitation did not mean that they were holding stuck they were holding step back but i read it wrong and i did not bother to check on the affective cue that i saw one a my babbling about what ism babbling about is if we are in a negotiation and whether not ism listening to your tone of voice or watching your body language or your words if i see you shift at all i should pay attention that there was a shift in your affective behavior but i need to find out what was behind it as opposed to make an an assumption as to what it meant see ism going to watch only get my gut feeling and man to say sounds that's some hesitation or it looks something just cross your mind or even if i cannot attributed to specific affective move i might say if feels to something in the way that is me listening to my got it'll threw out an observation on whatever any of those might be just to go back over the ground the little bit and double check cause the other thing about negotiating in person is you are going to give me more information physically than i can actually process and if you say something that is thought provoking it'll stop and think about it and while ism stopping and thinking about what you just set i missing all your cues all the skills that we teach the labels the mirrors the opening to questions which seemed were going back and plug on the ground again we are because i did not picked up all the information a first time there just more than than i can get and i need to go back over it a couple of times with you just i get it right without making you feel interrogated you actually feel hard and you actually get to go back over it again it becomes what seems to be an inefficient process but it is actually me just doublespeak in my information for face to face ism going a but ask you to repeat but ism not got to say would you please repeat that ism an to gets you to repeat without asking you to repeat is the same true in an online text communications the same thing is truly the the problem with on line of taxes people try to bundle everything into one communication the best analogy i can think of is if your plain chess by text would you put seven moves in your contour text no you would only put one moment only try to get one point across in a text do not explain do not throw a whole bunch of stuff an dexter males they are all almost always too long and it is going to come off is cold do what you can to soften soften it i is a documentary film has bent on on my company call tactical sympathy nicnanton a one twenty two twenty three ems the him make dean f den a films who's finish last she is not out yet for ride reasons went put it out the we screen the thing in vagus last year i see it i love it ism not a good judge of a film about man whet a love it matwhstot ma but i tell that that night o man i love it this is great two days later i find out i realize there is a huge problem have already told hem it is o say i got to get em i to it i met a text i and then i in a call and we it a fix it now is o sundae tax message i sent him a two line text it is now bad time to talk i got something you do not want here two lines now what were my other options i could a called him nick and i got a great relationship i call him if he is in a position to pick up the phone does not matter what he is down he is going t answer the phone he was in the middle of hi fume can if it'd a called he would a picked up during the fume call an both conversations would have been bad he immediately fires back to me ism in a middle of hi fume call it'll call you in a half an hour he already knows he an't get alike what he is going t here ism credit him for bad news get him on the phone look i know what i said we get a problem we got to get dark on camera dark is guy in mi and my team ain't shocked that i have not made him part of the documentary this is going to be incomplete without dark we got to get dark on on film we cannot show this t anybody else till we get him on him and make a part of it immediately he is problem solving on he goes how i got to get a true to derrick or get dark to a true i need not know when we can do that i need to we got it we got and the showing the pills schedule an ell a less than a month away says i i got to get dark on camera and we got a head it ans going to take three weeks of editor i to get access to jerk's camera he goes done er dark her calender hes us done it is done we go through this whole conversation in less than ten minutes now thing of the normal negotiation ay nick how are yo what is going on to day are you in a good mood ha hay ha how the kid's doing all this time wasting conversation i to set him up with that normal he would also he could have legitimately said are you one and we have been working on this for year you did not bring this up in a year not only that you already told me two days ago at the eye showing and an vaguest that you loved it and now a year you are and a half into this project you are bringing up all these new promise that would have been the normal negotiation but since i since we got a highly last of relationship i two line text we done in ten minutes now since next the very generous my when he gets done and he says by the way you understand how much this gun a cost me is is three weeks today this is three hours as shooting in three weeks of edit air he goes but i'mhappy to do it calls him back the next day it is got a favorite ask or me you got does not matter what it is because we would gone through what would have been a very complicated negotiation it started on text and i sent him a two line text on a sundae and we get a salve that fast if i understand correctly by setting the context in a very direct and succinct way wright he goes into it in a problem solving mode with you whereas if you do the the tour of all the things that are going well in life see ye have the sort of the well keep this a p g the the u the mud sand which approach now they teach you that when you get a lari trip you of most scientist at ran skill running a business right you get a laboratory all you done is experiments and then suddenly your in charge of people managing budgets and all this stuff i m mean most scientists ninety nine present a sciences a completely unqualified to do the job they do at the level running laboratory when they start you learn it on the job and eventually you end up having let somebody go and toy and the typical thing they teach you in these online training things is you tell some that my something nice then you give them the bad news and then you tells something them something nice on exit a it is grand ta the the mud to speak sandwich right no right am this is not that what you are talking about is saying hey this is the problem you are not in a the problem or there is a problem you are not in a it that they show up with the context of solving a problem i suppose to giving them the tour of all the things are going well and then the the problem is really in contrast to that and then it is you now say you what i love about what your describing is it is it is it is direct it is honest you are not doing the a the tour of the garden before you take them down to the u to the sceptictank it is what i would call the difference between being blunt and being a straight shooter a strange shooter tells you the truth they just tell it in a way that land softly let us talk about break ups business break ups romantic break ups right you break in up with me none am but thanks for the hypothesis test no a in fact ism enjoying this conversation much as i always do ism learning its one from you that am if anything it'd to expand and deepen our relation the gala knowledge at am a platonic and an professional but expansive am what is the process of ending a relationship and again this could be romanticallytiip could be business relationship could be employer employ could be individuals could be telling a whole group or an entire group telling an individual the reason i raise this as a particular example is that ism assuming that both sides do not want the same thing one side wants to continue the other side wants to end i am it'll avoid the use of the word win n world the words winning excuse me and just ask is there a way to have that conversation in any of the contacts i just mention in a as you beautifully described it a straight shoot or manner where it is direct it is honest but it lands soft because what we are talking about here is feelings of rejection and nobody likes feeling rejected i soft know anybody likes being fired even from jobs they do not people's goes offer rain is there a may be at more specific way of asking the question is is there a way to encourage the person getting the bad news to get there ego out of the way and see that if both parties do not want it it is best for everybody involved i almost want to say no a but first hone of the caveats most of a time when pupils struggling with this they not trying to save the other side tho try to save themselves o you really try to save by post poking at soften and try to a a it is it is something that is not there i do not know that anybody has ever been fired that did not have a sense that it was coming the person that was getting ready to fire m opens up by saying how are you they know how the other person is and in a person getting ready to get fired has got some got instinct that things are going wrong you said the guts very powerful you got you got a lower the boom as quickly as you can but also as gently as you can i was involved in a non profit a number years ago ciliated with church and we tryst struggling whether not to let the executive director go or go to the minister of the church normal vincent peals protect got i my name rather calamander one of the best human beings have ever met my life phenomena grip and ism struggling with i thought firing wetness woman go was going t be bad and i thought rather was going to council me away out and and he look to mean he said there is there is no gentle way to cut somebody is head off and i thought ye ad the humane thing here is howdy to to bring it to conclusion as quickly as possible cause there is no humane way to cut somebody is head off there is no humane way in to terminate the relationship now what o the cavies maybe there are first caviar if yo cannot fire somebody never fire somebody on a fridge fire him on a money fir hem on a money they got a work week to work their way out of it you fire him on a fridge they got a week and to be miserable an to feel horrible and they cannot do anything about it caught off guard or not on a money they can pick themselves up they can start looking for new job no matter who you are i em on a ride they cannot start looking for new job on a sturdy it is two days on misery yet you going to fire somebody fire him on a money not on a fridge you got bad news her give somebody armament's coming the people are ridiculously resuming to pain if warned and then that you lower the boom and i cannot what i have to say is on to be heart breaking you cant hate me hesitate no more hen three seconds they got their guard up let em have the bad news that is the humane way to cut somebody is head off do not make do not linger do not make em think that how the kids aware you i care about you your great human being note o stuff at the beginning warn em bad news is coming and had him with the bad news rip the bandage off the pain is not if you try to rip the bandage off slowly that is excruciating you trying to save yourself if you to to terminate a relationship regardless or what it is the quicker it you do it the less painless it is the sooner people can move on stop try to save yourself realize how human beings handle pain if anything human beings are incredibly resuming if given the opportunity o brace themselves first i agree thank you for that there is a concept that a lot of people have not heard of and ism confident in saying that because i had not heard of until recently in despite spending a lot of time an the literature round dopamine and motivation and it is a term from psychology that it is being used a little bit more now and it is ego depletion yet it is an interesting concept and have been wing to run this by you for a while but i saved it for our discussion today it turns out ego depletion is a lot decision fatigue we've all heard the steeve jobs thing he wore a black turtle neck every day because it he would henhouse to when that decision we had more energy to make other decisions have been accused of doing the same because of my black long sleeve sure but there is a whole other reason for that that um some people might know but hey way it is unimportant in the moment but ego depletion is a little bit different than decision fatigue or decision but it u the idea with ego depletion it is pretty simple it is that the molecule dopamean does not many things in the brain but one of the things that it absolutely does is it holds us to got directed behavior that is associate with our sense of self i want to accomplish this i want to get to that and the whole notion of ego depletion involves the the idea and this has been a data substantiated observation that when people have to fight to be right or to defend their position for a period of time eventually that depletes and it seems to be at least in part dopamine mediated because defending one's position takes work you earlier you talk about running somebody down wearing them out and i wonder as i just throw this concept out you a cold here am whether r not that calls to mind any a examples from your work where you felt locate this person could really hold but if i just kept pressing eventually they tilt i and it is different in the kind of fatigue that comes from a conversation that starts at three in the afternoon and ends at two thirty in the morning we have all been there have been in those conversations usually they are not very pleasant and at three on the morn everyone's pealing apart you just have learned over the years yeclipit at nine thirty and you trying shift right he know one of the worst pieces of advice have ever heard am is you would never go to sleep angry be no actually a actually get sleep wake up and then revisit the problem if the situation allows that is my a that is my ism very ya a try to stay up all night trying to work something out is just counter biology ego completion am have a feeling a lot of what you did in your profession was am running down there dope men to the point where then they are operating from a different place where they are not defending the ego they are actually thinking more practically about the whole situation is is have any kind of dexter of meaning to ye no i would i would agree and i would draw the distinction a first of all in hostage negotiation there is there is two kind of hostage takings am if there is a demand a an is going to be contained and contained which is just literal definition contained is bagasse in a bank at the chasebank in brooklynd way back when you can h'm surrounded they cannot get away an contained is a kidnapping you don't now where they are contained on a location we are going to try to get our way and i contain situation probably by ego depletion were in amount getting to the point where they just i just i just going to givankas i are tired cause the going to come out were into put handcuffs on which means that if the eagle gets recharged they going o go back in tor think theyregong to think back over the deal wherein somebody out o business negotiation it is basically contained because even if you come to an agreement there is a whole implementation phase they gong to g it did you did you get you agree toy warm out cause they get tired cause he just gave in at some point of time they aregoigto get recharged and they going to get recharged where you've in implementation they either going a reckon o follow the terms of the deal or it is the slightest opportunity they arguing to deviate and yet i think eagle depletion is is a real thing and it is a bad way to get a business deal that is going to stick cause they rest and than they come back ye i different person yeye're they going to be recharged they are eagle's going to be recharged and if you get the if you it the agreement based on a depletion of their ego that battery's going to get charge back up again well it is a business deal with its personal negotiation you do not you have disagreement we the significant other who and you you follow that bad advice do not go to bed angry and you stay up till three in the morning and you think you come to a resolution but he gets a good next sleep next day they feel completely differently about what they said the right before i might have heard of that happening once or twice its ought to move your yes hate him of ya a friend explain that situation to me u earlier you mention approaching a conversation in a playful way rang all right this might isn't be life or death but let us play this a game because you can see more opportunities now we know that when we are relaxed we see the big picture when we are tense everything never on wat is your tunnel visa tunnel thinking tunnel everything we lose access to the full tool kit i you always see take really to carry yourself you are fit your in shape you always seem calm ism sure you have your moments anybody else but what are some of the things that good negotiators do all the time that when the bell goes off and they have to respond they are ready and the reason i ask is is because we have been talking about negotiations in kind of a value it is happening and how does one handle it but any athlete any teacher any parent any kid everybody has to be ready for real life circumstances and we do not always get the warning we do not get the memo that it is happening in two weeks and a sometimes the conversations around courtroom drama or the big day it implies that we we get the warning but more often than t od it is a phone caller a taxon that comes in in on it just hits us and suddenly we are in negotiations and we did not get time to prepare may we could talk about readiness and then we could talk about again maybe the as sounds trivial to you but for me i be varicose to know whether o not you have any practices of stilling yourself what those look what you have seen other people used to to be able to get themselves into the moment of being able to show their best self yet well readiness a small stakes practice for high stake's results i i will occasionally find myself in a middle of the negotiation that i did not expect i if have been thrown out stuff on a regular basis on my way during the day am formal observations what we refer to his labels couple of the label seems something just cross your mind is a label in a middle of the negotiation when i see you hesitate or look to the side how are you ready for that now it's ism on my way over he to this interview ism both talking o my lift driver the whole wag in him to talk also being careful about not happen the gas tank out completely that ism fatigued when i get here like i talk i talk up the lift drivers on a regular basis i am interactions teas gas and airport it'll throw a label at him seems a tuft day tuft day seems it in a good mood and whether right or wrong ism ism getting in ism trying to stay loose ism trying to keep the mental muscles limber and it just becomes a bit of a habit on a regular basis a occasionally it'll throw something out an it's talking about lift drivers i c him in a bad mood i get into a lift couple of weeks ago on my way home lift driver is not helpful i mean ism coming you the airport ism struggle on my bags not lift in a finger does not open up the rear i got open up the rear the vehicle myself or got a load the bags everything i get in and he is just seething unhappiness now i know that if i say what o you love about what you do for living i immediately trigger what tony robins would call a state change and ism annoyed at this my and o you know are famous a combative but ism thinking is jetton need this and i go what you love about driving for lift this i proceeds to unload on me on all his personal struggles then i feel a complete jerk for being anger at him everything that he is going through and ism just trying to get myself out of bat out of a bad mood and to keep from sending him a really negative vibe the whole way that he does not drive forty five miles an hour and a sixty five mile on our lane and make it inflict me with longer and more expensive ride because ism annoying is a customer but have got a habit of small stakes practice for high stakes results and who do i get a practise on the lift drivers on a regular basis to guy behind the donate at the hotel o the t a gas i am going through t say the grocery store clerk the yearbooks person the only way i mat my best on my negotiations is is trying to keep my negotiation mot muscles limber i interacting with people throughout the course of my day and an ideally you do not leave him better than i found him an it'll try and trying not to leave negative karma an my way trying to leave as much positive karma and my wake as possible i love that u and ism very familiar with the feeling of needing to concert my boys for podcasting or energy for things and yet ism somebody who is he think genuinely curious about what people's experiences herself i the question how is your day going it is pretty open ended it is i suppose if somebody was really upset that would be perhaps the worst question i could possibly ask from what you just described but we do not put a fine point on it too because i manipulate him with what he love about because there is it you watch them change in the moment to immediately to shift into this concept of love which is more than would you about driving fit lift would you love about driving lift i i can trigger a stay change in you instantaneously no matter what kind of moment cause this my was in a very bad mood plus additionally the download from that typically is quick i mean to get a real clear picture on who you are really really fast ism talking to a see you of a company couple of months ago there there the for lack of a better term than deliver in clean water to the world and i i that is a cool mission i dig this is an aunt encore an aunt you been more want to make a dent universe i dig that i ism trying to make a difference in the world i say to him what you love about what you do for live he immediately fires back o me i love leading teams i love leading teams and i love given sherehold is a great return on our vestment it is really important for me to give sherehold is a great return and then ye we deliver water and then he set a for thing and i thought this guys could be doing toilet paper he does not care about the mission of a company at all he is a great see you probably because you want to see you to lead teams you want to see you deliver a corporate s you to h deliver a return vestment for shareholders but that is what he is a great corporate y and not a great antre pinorlsy by him given me that download to quick that was lately honest i do i think this is a great guy yet do our for values line up my mission is more important to me than his mission is or his mission is making money now i making money but it is not number one it is a strong number too but that question instead of how are you to day to what are you love about you immediately put him in a better place plush you get some ridiculously candid answers that tells you who they are real fast what is the best way to approach our response to somebody who's asking to be heard perhaps they have got complaints a thebe about us maybe about somebody else not people are venting people seem to very on the propensity to vent spectrum somepeoplee just they vent all the time this happen that happened and you known they want to complain the a the way it is sometimes describes they love to and take other people's inventories they love to take inventories of everybody ease's mistakes they did this they did that m it is it is a lot easier some often than taking our own inventories off what we could be focussed on and do better that is that it's the universal truth in my mind but you don't people approach other people that they trust and they want event presumably to get over whatever it is that is bothering them but all too often it seems to just amplify the feelings of frustration what o you do when somebody care about n that cares about you comes toe event is it just you let them you let them vent or to u do you try and let them negotiate with themselves little bit in a way that can help them more than if you were to just let them vent ism really leery of letting people vent because a lot of times it us they never it seems to be spiral that u spirals out of control how why somebody vent they do not feel heard they feel ignored if you love been wasting er time talk they are frustrated that is the feed back i mongo give you feed back on what ism guessing cause is causing you to vent in just an observation i it is sounds this is is to drive new crazy was nobody listens to you sounds i even struggling with us for a long time sounds this as very frustrating for you what is the emotion the particular negative emotion frustration is about somebody being denied a goal in future angers about somebody is upset about some happen in a past the type of negative emotion begins the focus you win on where they is it forward thinking or is backward thinking and frustration and anger can be too very different versions of the same negative emotion but their focused on different points an time ism going to try to intuitively if i don't do not know from what you have told me i in a start take an educated guesses on making an observation on what it is to drive in you if you need decent you've been talking and people been ignore no you or you have been taking actions and people have been ignoring you ts at you need event because you communication reactions have been ignored there are some close here and the sooner that i get at the heart of what is bothering you the sooner you get to be able at at of ism going to encourage letting the steam off without trying to have correct you without giving you advise without frustrating you by not listening to you by trying to recognize verily with some motivators are which will deactivate the anger much more quickly it is the whole basis for crisis hot line to begin with people are venting and how do you most effectively vent somebody that instead of going on a ran for an hour and the rant introduce toxenton to their system rather poison themselves i think negative emotions put toxins in our system you know how to i deactivate that is quickly that you not hurting yourself as much and and you you feel hurry you feel relieved you feel listen to m in within involves me if it is a close friend who is venting to you you are involved in a situation to some degree and i might even say but it feels you probably frustrate because i have not listen to you to now you omen a tart start taking some emotionally educated guesses on what i think is driving you and ism at put in the form of label which is just an observation seems sounds lookalike then if i get it wrong and you go less not at at all i can say well that just a way it seems it just seems that way you put you in a position jo just let somebody know you see em an you are doing your best understand ism ism not a fan of venting i if if i go on a rant personally i always feel worse i want to deactivate that negativity an get get my feet back under me emotionally very useful now legs i intershared with us do you meditate i tiny little bits i mean a in trying to make my day more effective i have a gratitude exercise that i do almost every morning other ways to make myself effective actually ism looking at the non sleep deep breast practice or the because i you n i i to make use of my time and and am spiritual mi's talking to the almighty on regular basis you pray i do ye the morning and night when you need to both yet both i mean i think you knot whether not you believe in one god or a the universal whatever it is i think spiritual spirituality is an important component of health whatever you spirituality is you should recognize it and you should you will be better off if you engage in some sort of spiritual practice does not have to be in either three major religions but spirituality is component who we are ye practiced or regularizes sense of higher power or to better defend higher power it could be as you said with alined with conventional religion or just a lined with the idea that there are things outside of us that are important to pay attention to that we can all do better by being in recognition of our service to or were both something i we do pretty much that and and an leaving is is open is as possible cause er i think there is a spiritual answer to us purity i agree what about your physical training i i must say your you are an excellent shape imagine that when or along with the f b i thing i and i saw silence the lambs at the beginning shes running around a with other on agents h a shooting targets and running and lifting into an their sit ups in there that was a it was nineteen eighties film says wat dated now proxy now that they are do another stuff as well am but nothing nothing worse the basic i was the of be i the first time you got serious about fitness or prior to that where you are and were you and athlete and into fitness and what you doing now days to maintain your frankly impressive shape am be thank you for the compliments am i pul a sports athletics fitness was always a part of my life i was he disports but not particularly good atom a football basket ball a the ism a last century guy what long before the condition is i insult is evolved as it is now with interval training and an arrested a stuff which is phenomenal you know wait lifting was introduced in my high school my senior er i lifted wait some continued for college a little bit of time in a marshal are it my knee apart and college in the marshal arts but ye have fitness has always been a part of my life is much for liking to be in condition and in o spiritual regeneration of it whether i knew what it was or not om these days and on looking for every hack there is i know you do not the term a hack well e at we mechanism scientist merchant yes ye a hack sort of implies that we are using one thing to can for something different i mechanisms but the end of the day if people want to call something a hack because it gets them the result they want or that they are mere it is more appealing to to apply the tool that is what matters to me ut tools sitting in a boxdon'e do anything people using hem that ism good with the term yea what these days cold plunge son a principally ism struggling with issues with a couple of joints that i know since will eventually help me regenerates in the meantime good diet you the basic pillars diet a not a a ye not a perfect diet but by an large over all my diets pretty good am and then o that little little things spiritual keeps me in shape physically a in a cold plunge ais is challenging psychologically and physically and a sultan shifter there ads for sure and you do not need science to know that a three seconds or a minute in that cold water is gong to change your chemistry for a long while afterwards and for the better i believe once you get out people forget that they i hate the coltheult the point is not how you feel while you are in it you can feel proud of how you navigate that portion but the point is how you feel afterwards we the old the old sang why do you heat yourself in it in the hand where the hammer as it feel good when you stop i that that a spoken somebody worked to new york city for a long time a out here we price say something different am he a crystals in lava lamps or something although the are many lave lamps any more i think that the idea that californium is all hippy dippy that that is not true any more i think it is been overrun by by other a different bethels in any of that am thanks for sharing that because i think that we cannot separate the physical from the psychological right o me we have been talking about the mental and fatigue status of the people you are negotiating with oftentimes during this conversation but then of course there is how you show up to the job mean if you are run down three days and you have been in a fight with your spouse and that is still in the back your mind and your am an your hungry tired sick what m not connected to your higher power all that sings that there is no way you can be as effective at any job it it is great to here and not surprising to hear that you have a bedrock practices that you you implement spa's interesting point almost everybody i knew t it was really good and thing they did for living they probably took pretty good care f themselves yew i agree there is this that the language around self care yet i think get's really distort it ism an editorialize for a second o i think it but ism an editorializing line with with what you just said you i think self care sounds naval gazing where people think that it is all about self but it is actually taking care of oneself that we can show up better for everybody else a more energy more capacity more staying power to have those hart conversations with the people we care about and that move our life forward it is really refilling the the fuel take in my mind i supposed to the kind of a egocentric norsisistic stands tat a lot of people take towards that they and and i understand what they do you know people scroll through inseam an they see people self being every every muscle and in all the scuffing s ant ism not disparaging what people want to do but but the end of the day self care is about being more ready to do better for the world if your or if your missionary into agree completely agree do you think there is been a change in the am f b i a over the last three forty years around that i have this image in my mind of agents sitting in cars for twenty hours eating holy sand which is and an now looking through binoculars and running themselves into the ground with this kind of bull dog persistence to to solve the puzzle m put differently i imagine there are some negotiations that were very long and fatiguing am did you recall one of the longer negotiations that you had and how do you sleep at night midway through a hostage crisis long as one then i was i was directly involved in on almost they to day and our our one when when about three is days morsinids a two thousand three start of the second arc working an day was and roll the tract ins the me we and claim to et foursomes and we foursome scattered around the city had he actually done that er he was just calmed he was bluff he was bluffing he he had not done either ant start on saint prick's done got interesting a cot yon i the the thing in e that you said in was in of the philippines like national hold and holiday right interesting a for whole bunch of reasons now i and an i had to go home go to sleep a when one night and when we rein the middle of that and then it was just i do not remember having trouble going to sleep because i felt a did a good job and at we handed i handed the shift off to another hostage negotiate for the bureau was effectively the team leader vine station and since was bringing negotiator and the team that he was with i everybody's in good hands is matterfact since almost kicked me out of t scene cause i do not want to go when he just kept hand go and get some sleep go hone get some sleep and finally the fifth time he said at the man went home i felt i was leaving a things in really good hands and we work in kidnappings we expected them to go for long periods he time ans just connagot a it if you have faith in a process and you feel that you are doing the best at can be done and then i think he could sleep at night i get to answer that question you you have to be careful whether you are working a a case o siege or anything n in in the bureau that you do not run yourself into the ground and there was some cases at work in a nineties where i mean we we knocked ourselves out we would we worked harteinebody we ever saw but we occasionally we took time off too and i worked with guys tat realized that sometimes you had to go out and have a beard kick back and blossom some steam i think everybody that i ever worked with we are occasionally cautious enough to recharge the batteries and then depend upon the nature of the challenge in front of you ire was a siege in saint martin's parish and wen six days i do not think those guys got a lot of sleep that the nature those sieges in that particular thepesiege only last five or six days anyway you just got to got it out were there ever instance his where you just try to keep the person on the line they can just had i i never i never had to do that personally you had to be prepared to do that from the very beginning of any siege that you might have to get some you might have to orchestrate on assault of some sort i was fortunate enough early on of my training there is kind of a famous siege in if hostage negotiation history in onion called the princes gate siege where o legendary brutish hostage negotiated avid senses had the bad guises on a phone while the a s was hidden hide the building and remember that we were shown look there maybe come a time when you have to keep somebody on the phone when swat comes and that goes with the territory expect that is a possibility from the very beginning and it was a great siege the bad guy saline the photos of him after he was shot the phone is within his reach avid kept him on the phone have heard the tapes the a breaching explosions were going on and i slip says i got to go i got to go their suspicious noises and avid genic and his classic brutish accent said saline there are no suspicious noises now let us get back to talking about how many people are going on the bus to the air pay ban and and he went in and and i caught up with avid a number years later a had if pi pro had presidential intern from the white house in turnip with me in the bureau we are drinking in a bar with avid vanish i had a lot of stories where ism drinking to bar with somebody and in turn walked around everybody and tap avid on the shoulder and he says a chis says you kept the taraston a phone up to the moment that the essays came in a door and avid says yen i kept em on telephone even longer if the essay said had not come in soon why my telling that story if you've going to get into that line of business you got accept all the things to go with it and realize that it is not you that made the decision somebody else did you get implement the strategy do you remember it case a in sacrament where a i think it was a youth gang they a took over an electronic stored guys speech yet i remember this when i was hid and i two things that rink that stand out of my mind from when i was a kid one was the good g guys was the name of the electronic store right good guise is electron store and a bad guise us to speak went in there took them hostage and i must been a kid this must haven late at let a late days my something that u i remember that case is about nineteen ninety relate or eighty nine or ninety i knew one of the negotiators i was act was morning seventy five and as i recall they ended up opening fire on a munch of hostages who were laying down on the ground is that right they they they knew that they were getting ready to execute the hostages because they put bags over their heads and that whenever the bad guide do any thing to dehumanize the hostage it is ease you to shoot somebody with a bag over their head then it is not you cannot see their face and the bad guise had begun that process and they knew they needed to assault god forbid any one should ever be taken hostage i realize circumstances s differ but you just mention putting bags over their heads there is this notion of steeple that people will describe am post talk after something about how somebody walks into a building tells people that put zip ties on their own ankles who are going to a back room that nobody resists and that in retrospect had somebody cause a commotion they might have caused enough of a commotion to either run out or be let go am and yet of course there is a very logical part of everybody's brain i would hope the things listen this person is an aggressor there is a gun in my face do not be an idiot right cause it i we also have heard of the case in new york city that read about this in the newspaper presumably it is true a ware some one was held up a gun point in one of the women in the group that was held up sowhody can do shoot us and the person shot rings out that happens to i i do not know if there is it a fair and safe answer to give people on this but if you are told to do something by somebody and it is t all happening in real time i mean you have that ask do they want my money n my body my life or some commination of the three in real time while under presumably significant do rest i but for hostages but if they if they disobey cause a commotion is that extending their life or is it shortening their life i guess it it is very context dependent t o the only thing that i can without knowing the content anything you could do to humanize yourself and comply with what the bad as want i increases you chance of survival let us see gat order to go in a back room you could look at the hostage taker and say it'll do whatever you say ism cross you do not drop your name on them in a way that you go from being a faceless person to somebody with the name that increases a chances to survival humanization whatever you can do to c ply simultaneously become more of a human being because it is the settle what i was talking about before if you are easier to kill if you have been dehumanized your harder to kill if you have been humanized you are harder a harm may be then i can to kill you they just going they are just gone to hart you they are less likely to harm you if they know your first name how do you get is a hostage negotiator if they if they talk about a hostage i it'll say you know you mean you mean wheeler you mean rats gan i ism it'll find a way to drop the person's name into the conversation soon as if if you can humanize just by giving them to know your name you increase the chances of survivability increase the chances of being treated better it and comply it'll do what but it'll do what every sampcress is going is going to start the move the outs in your favor t at what you rescript described extends to a science i have talked before about my stands on animal research and a why i choose to no longer do it i i do think it has its place in making important discoveries that cannot be made on humans but that eventually extend to but you do not want to do it i do not want to person i do not want do it and i do not want to primate work or large carnivore work or small carnivore work but on the point i was going to make is that when you do primate work i they strongly discourage your forbid you from giving them names rang give numbers right right right right right it is t it all falls in line with what you ere what you are talking about cause the moment something has a name it moves from being a research animal to a pet of sorts and that makes it a relationship right interesting how a name turn something from a you know it elevate something to a relationship however insignificant it it is up a notch and into our empathy circuitry do which is a perhaps they appropriate seaway to talk about empathy this is a topic that a you spangly was you you a you mention tactical empathy right document you by the way when is that going to be out or do we have some sense my guess is a we will finish jump an through all the hoops and probably have out at the beginning next year were a i'mcurrently working with ln morse en dear on a couple of different projects they have been enormously support of and we have asked for their guidance on how to haw to the best time to get the doctormentary out and very happy with the people on dealing with their and actually stroke of the universe was looking out forme funny sat o circumstances and just really enjoy with the people on working with their probably first parton next year fantastic what is your take on empathy i think of empathy and the pop culture sense of somebody is feeling pain and we feel their pain but of course empathy extends way beyond that ye ye ye and that was a rramalanka ye my you olla get stamford yes i was i as really fastening by the conversation a you you had with him on that recently and n he said a lot of people you sympathy a lot of different ways sort of for their own meanings my take on empathy tactical empathy also to keep iron names out because people give me thoughts and ism one a force amount in ism very close to stepped collars prospective on it stepheno say empathy is about the transmission of information compassion is reaction to the transmission i that and by the way ism and of stepson's work i think he i think he is quite a shut and a boy is he a hard work he writes a beast i manly help it for in the morning els has fifty chaw was or something crate bat he is away the doors ye and early t will mum fit more chaos in he room then others got ya stepped my as a and and that was when i was with the p i was started collaborating with hazard because the hazard definition om was empathy was not liking the other side it was just demonstrating and understanding their perspective a bobmanucan's book beyond winnings chapter the attention between empathy and assertiveness he says h empathy is not agreeing disagreeing or even liking the other side which sort of falls into what stepping talked about in it is about the transmission of information now empathy is very compassionate thing to do but it does not necessarily equate to compassion itself if ism if i if i let you i make you feel heard by me saying to you what you are perspective on something is you gan to feel cared for you can a feel understood it is on a land with you really well i do not necessarily have to feel compassion for you i know it is a precursor to compassion i would separate it from sympathy clearly and i would even sympathy separate it from compassion although i know it is a very compassionate thing to do it is about tactical empathy is about me actively demonstrating verbally to you that i understand where you are coming from tactic from the experience can horses negotiators back up by nor science is hit people largely react negatively the smarter move for me instead of trying to reinforce a positive is the first deactivate the negative by simply calling it out calling the elephant a room out do not deny the elephant do not ignore the elephant call the elephant a room out say it probably gan a sin ism greedy if i expect that you are going to think ism over reaching and i can say i want you to think ism greedy n i say is probably in a scene greedy simply well educe ate emotional intelligence influence got instinct influence on what the other side is thinking and feeling if i can define it in that way then it becomes an unlimited skill if it requires me for to have compassion for you when i do not then that limits my ability to use sympathy and ism not interested in having that ability to be limited i wanted to be an unlimited skill if you just if you misdefine it strictly in terms of transmission of information then it is not sympathy your compassion or liking or green it has a very powerful effect it at least feels compassion to the other side it reacts with the emotional circuitry the negro chemicals that everybody has to some degree if they are alive even if there on this the spectrum they have some of that going on inside and of what have read uneven even a mental illnesses a in my last century training i saw people who re paranoids gets aphonic is a effectively be more of a wiring problem tan a chemical problem for for a layman's description and a lot of what have read said empathizes even effective with parrots gets aphasics people regardless of how disarray the circuitry in their head is it is a it helps them on some level to feel understood empathy is just about making somebody feel understood example when ism ism working terrorism we had a lot of arab museums testify an open civilian chord against a a legitimate muslin cleric who was also a criminal wo also committed crimes and i would sit down with him and it'd say tom run off the bat cause i know where they coming from you believe that there's been a succession of america governments for the last two hundred years that have been entire coming and they look at me in a go y i never said i it was true i never sat i greed i never said i disagreed by me simply articulating with their perspective on the inter action was they were startled by it it was sympathy and and a we were good at that empathy frequently in at in that time frame they would say are you are you muscle and its know i respect a religion if you need to know at ism a christian but i respect your religion and i i got no problem saying to you where you're coming from that is sympathy from my definition and then it becomes an unlimited skill i i do not have to feel it i do not have to necessarily one to do anything about it woman says there is cognate of empathy me just recognizing what your emotions are coming from there is emotional empathy me feeling your emotions and there is empathic concern me want to do something about your distress my version of tactical empathy probably brings those into play and seek whence on a continuum of sorts but none of them are precursors it just me showing to you that i understand where you coming from and it has a phenomenally favorable impact on the interaction tell me about mirroring as a tool yet mirroring is a one of the simplest easiest o and most effective of the skill tat takes the least amount of bran power it just repeating one to three's words of what somebody is just said a can be one it you should never usually be more than five hostage negotiators learnt by repeating the last one o three words of somebody is just said it does not have to be the last one o three words and a mirroring is not the body language merits not mimicking anybody physically and it is not mimicking their tone of voice or their affect or anything about him it is just repeating one o three is words we found that accesses for whatever part of brain you a that you got energize to do it it is it is a different part of the brain than labeling people are usually the good really good labeling i label must everyone my team labels a lot sounds this is to than you sounds seems you just not ready sure wore this is goon and the mirror i get a consciously make it a point to mirror and what is a mirror use for it is in place of what did you mean by that or would you please go on or i do not understand could you repeat that again it'll listen for stuff that either i do not understand or i need you to talk more about and instead of saying could you say some more about that it'll just mirror of the words now for whatever reason it connects the thoughts in your hat the message the way that lands is i heard what you said the words i got the words cause i just repeated i and i still do not understand i need a more inept explanation without using the same words that you misused because of you say i think actual pass actual pass is em is useless and i might say would you mean by that and you go i practice them is useless you repeat the same words only letter you figure that saying at latter will make it penetrate my cranium that does a work i need you to read to explain to go into more adapt to expand using different words and for whatever reason we found as hosts negotiators and i find i business that if i mirror you you will expand and you'll connect it is if i use it in that context i might use it to get you to hear yourself out loud if what you just said does not make sense it'll repeat it back word for word wen to three words and all upward and fleet it'll say that it does not expense dunno use use my tone make at land with my tones you can hear yourself out loud somebody else just pointed out to me the other day that if you talking to somebody and they are in mid thought and the kind of their voice trails off because they sort of lost their train of thought if you mirror them there that helps them get their train of thought back and expand wit is it is a ridiculously effective communication tool to get people to expand and feel heard it is simplicity put some people off there is some people that say i ans not stupe o on see what good that will do i always notice if somebody is really wants to know about mirroring my description is there both high eye cut and hi eye you and why does that work a hi eye you guys on o want nor something that is really simple that does not take any effort to do and that is what a mirror does it is really really effective it is almost no effort on your part at all interesting i must say that narrow science has a an unfortunate dirty of knowledge about how brains interact this is starting to change but most of what we know about how brain's work is from putting people into functional magnet a presence in making machines ill call them or i ism exposing them to move ease or games that they have to play et camera and then looking at reinstated activation there are a few laboratory starting to look at how people interact in real time with both people in separate em or machines that hopefully will be able to par r some of this and i ism certain that somebody hearing this will i use this knowledge to go do the experiment if not a ala run up the flagpole o som a highly qualified people at standard who could who could do this because be fun to see what is happening but have the sense that what is happening is that there is a real merge of cognition when one hearts their own words spoken back to learn that am what's at you get now got two brains processing the same information and that has to lead new places a i do not have any am on insight as to where what exactly is happening but a certainly that something is happening there evidence by the real world results that you are getting we do not anal serpents to tell us that a at to be interesting to to see and learn a bit of what is happening if there is a fusion for instance of a activation of emotional centers activation of re there is something bout hearing our own voice it is very different then hearing other people's voices most people cringe when they hear their own voice on recording am most not all am some people are in love with their own voice a i do not know these people but we know that our auditory system cancels out the hearing of our own voice did that as we are talking now our auditory system is suppressing our own voice we do not really hear ourselves speak the same way that when you speak i hear you speak yet a it is an active nor a chemical inhibition of the response and it is amazing too because as we grow up our voice changes purity and forth and other ways too that the vocal course change in thickness et camera and our voice changes but we always know self from other in terms of voice and we cancel out our actual auditory perception of our own that is fascinating and breathing and heart beat we shut down our response to self actively within the brain hat's fascinating maybe hearing back some of what we just said allows us to actually hear what we e just set ye what true an a asked why people yousometimes all somebody needs a sounding for they can they can somebody else can hear hear they can hear themselves out and get a repeated back to i and an the go way men did i just say that e interesting interesting useful indeed pro active listening tell us about proactive listening we are all told that we need to be better listeners the other day one that we got two ears in one mouth as if that is left to remind us a must per of two ears in one mouth am but i get the point they were saying hey there is value in listening and more often than not we default to broadcast but no reception we are mostly broadcast less reception am hence the a to call for nasal breathing it is useful in a lot of circumstances a cause it keeps us it gives our mouth shut a what is proactive listening how do we do it well thy what is it good ism really trying to get people out of the notion of active listening just because active listening has been overused a people of lost track of it and a most of uts taught poorly and it is interactive for its proactive and we learn to hostage negotiators first of all just a label to presenting emotion and we just assume that in t presenting emotion was always anger of some form anger upset on certain resistances taxi was under control but they were almost always negative emotion we just assume that it was defined to what was a confined to what was driving hossagetakers was negativity now if i may as i i feel an an impostor talking about nor science to you your knowledge of nor sciences is is spot on avos i must say numerous times you you have asked me about things in nursience in you you have never been off the mark ye yea you you at you clearly done your homework know we keep trying to learn about t but a layman's terminology the survival brain is largely negative ballpark i would say seventy five per cent negative your reactions are going to be negative number one i believe that is principally backed up by the experiments of nor science the f m our eyes if if if you's alluded to and then an hostile negotiation we re taught to basically label to present the emotion and then i seen from experimentation a reporting of experiments i think that first time i read about it was in a book called the upward spiral and that book is a good ten years old i think which means the nor science is evolving but primarily the experiment there that remember reading about and read about another places that if people were of undergoing of a negative emotion in my a layman's paraphrase of the experiment is a there shown a picture that induced the negative emotion in their head and then the asked people to simply call out what the emotion was and when they self labeled then the emotion diminished now the degree of diminishment varies but the percentage of time that it diminishes by simply by calling it out is just day near all the time for largely seventy five per cent negative and we can deactivate the negativity by calling it out well let us be proactive if you are human being and were engagement in a negotiation there is going to be certain very predictable negativity that is going to be there and i should be practice in calling it out anticipating the negativity's going to be there based on a circumstances highly predictable and you got instinct before you referring to when you want to say look i do not want you think i being greedy you got telling you it is highly predictable you on t come off is greedy let me be practice and say it probably in to seem i being greedy and that is the dining over to what is eminently predictable in the in reaction and just being proactive to deactivate the negative emotions that either are taking place or what are experience is found that i have not seen any science that is yet that has hat the opportunity the back this up at inoculates i can create a barrier if i call out a negative that's not there does not plant it it actually inoculates you from it if and i done this practise i i was at given a lecture couple o years ago anybody ask a question i try to find the value in the question no matter how bad the question is this poor god asked me a question that i just cannot find a single component in his question that demonstrates that he was listening or paying attention there was nothing about it that i can congratulate him on and i said this going to sound harsh because i know the answer ism getting ready to give him is going to make it sound to the group that i think he stupid i just i cannot think of a way to respond to this without saying effectively what do you think about that is got nothing to do what worth talking about s go this is going to sound harsh and i answer the question and his kind to goes old say and i start answering somebody else question and he goes that was not harsh now if i had not said this is going to sound harsh and answered the question i guarantee you my answer would have embarrass him and embarrassment is one of the worst negative emotions you can inflict on anybody and he would hate me to this day for embarrassing him i got a moment coming at me that is predictably negative and i can let it i can let that train run me down or i can call out out in advance and get a reaction were the guises i was not it bed and that is would be impact of about the emotions is about i love it and ism recalling an instance turn graduate score my graduate advise her who sadly as passed away but was a phenomenal scientist cumin just pure insisted on getting the answers could emotionally detach from the answers the she is just was it was a ninja she used to come into the laboratory when we were working on a paper and she would sit down and she would say you are going to hate me for what ism about to ask you to do and i think oh no come t have to redo all the analysis or i w i some you've monumental thing and then she would said you got a change the haunts and figure too i i godly when you mean not ate you but but was relief i wanted nothing more than to make her happy with my work because i i respected the standard that she held greatly i me she could have asked me to ouzo stand on my head and do do the experiments fifty times i would probably would have done it if i thought they would make the project better and as a consequent she would have been pleased i because she was the standard for me and a many way still is but ism wonder if she read your book because i she is to presage these ism request we you arguing to hate me and then she would asked me for some we now i hate you that is nothing but now i i wonder if if i would have been taken aback if she had just said i i hay by the way figure too needs redoing i might have been kind of bristle by that am maybe she read your book these are great tools mirroring and pact of listening tan thank you for during these course did you ever employ the family members of kidnappers friends of kidnappers as a means to ism tap into a different aspect of their psyche you because i think that we are all as human beings very context i in i can imagine that the person who kind a somebody or who am trying to steal somebody is resources is in a particular groove of t a person and and i i do think there are people in the world who are just evil but i also know because have read about it and i trust the sources that their people who have done hazardous things who love their dog and genuinely love their dog and would not harm an animal but ism not trying to give these people a pass but i could imagine that i those other facets to somebody represent really good entry points for allowing them to see the kind of incongruent in their behavior ism or is it the case that when these are high stressed situations that you just have to basically noetic attack the you do not disarm the aggressor and you are just foxing on the person as the bad actor not considering the other contacts of their lives id let lis draw distinction between a hostage takers in a contained situation and kidnappers contained upon location you probably asking about somebody in a contained situation a badges in a bank d why nation in in his tractor in washington d s very contrentutively if there a contained situation there is u saying out this is system that your employing is perfectly designed to give you the outcome that you have badly d why nation is on is tractor and d she the family's part of the system tho put him there the blunt harsh reality of that is now at that siege that went on long enough and was high profile some of his family members showed up now we can we could and and did try to use them ism walking ism walking from one place to another from the negotiation operation a full component on a way to command post fossas negotiate stops me a couple of people with hem it is nation's family and they see ism in a hurry and then ism not interested to been stopped another got to say to me something to stop me and get my om attention and they go look our brothers just hurt in in his heart he is just hurting you do not things have gone bad for a whole family and he is just hurt in his heart do not kill him over it and i looked at the negotiating i said get that on tape and we will play that for him because if we can get that on tape exactly the way they sat it that land but if we put him on a phone with them they're gong to try to reason with hem another gan to say stuff to em that did not help much they do not very well intention but it is going to be conentutive and it is probably going to make it worse you have to understand family can be extremely important if you get him to say exactly the right thing and it is probably going to need to be highly orchestrated because how it is on a land and unfortunately think if you get him in a direct conversation it will probably renew in old wound you do not family members have herd each other in ways that they have no idea even happened and the other you no family member my sent that to stay remembers when i told him manta class was not real and i have not tin you i have no memory to y the i say r know alter way we get one legumes use family members have her each other over the years that they have no idea which comes up in these live conversations and you do not know what would wound you do not even know what wounds are there that you cause and in in a contain situation a family member can be extremely helpful but it has to be it is it is a surgical shot that you have to be really really really careful with otherwise you can go the other way because wounds in pupils even or there was us psychologically a state way of viewing it because ism a big fan of the call family system's model of psychology i and you cannot look at any human being psychology positive meaning adapt if or man adapt o psychology and not look at the family system which that evolved i which is not to say that some perfectly healthy families occasion y do not have issues with a child having mental illness and and that happens but ism told that ninety nine point nine per cent of the time you can identify a family system organization or a lineage a genetic tie et camera that that makes thingstart to make sense when somebody is really struggle and and as you point out a sadly oftentimes that that involves pains of past well what thanks for sharing that because i think that am in my mind the move version of it is they bring the mother in and it is billy do not do it t as he say board mi like that might be the time when billy's really gin to let his mother know isn't i an at not what you want egoless what a complex job what a complex high stakes high consequence job what did you do to unload some of the heaviness and ism not just tarting out getting a good night sleep or having a a beer with your to workers after although those things sure important rolls for m for people i realize a do you think we can dump the hard stuff in our head in our hearts in a way that allows us to be functional cause you knot people in your line of work and i think just any one in the world you you live long enough you can you are on experience it's loss yet you are gong to get kicked inland a got yet and you argon to see people you care about get kicked in they got there that is there is much beauty to life as well but but that is the reality did you you have tools processes that you use to want do not the baggage that you can lean into your relationships an your relationship yourself with with restored sense of optimism i yet i think mostly most of people that have always worked around we been very re enforcing of one another commercially i emotionally friendship wise you do not been able to laugh with each other taken it easy on each other can people tin a laughter and genuine understanding with with without the you now somebody trying to tell you that you did wrong have been lucky enough to the find myself in those groups most to a time or we would we just evolved it that is just the way that we were we were attracted to one another emotionally psychologically because of that that is probably it mostly i mean have tried to par some o these emotions out recently ism not particularly proud of anything have ever that done but i always felt it was a privilege i you must be proud of your accomplishments i do not know that it is pride but there is there is other satisfaction that i get out of it and thinking about what drives me also now you no tat ism running a company and ism and i got people also onto answers that are trying to do the best for the employs what we encouraging one another that whatever were doing people feel good about it and i tried to take a lot of that from what i learned is not ifpiaage and and a hostage negotiator and people that i was around and we did joke with each other lot and we did a play tricks on each other good good natured humor avoid the people that are running you down but be able to you do not take take care some good natured ribbing every now and then i and i think humorous is a one way another combined with hard work and an appreciation for what your doing a most probably been most of the mental health long a way occasional bourbon love it a we did a whole episode on alcohol and people er can hear me say love it and then away here ism supporting out risen but day to say as long as you are not an alcoholic as long as you are of age a probably two drinks week as or last is safe a make em make em good high quality drinks if you are gan to have them consume them in the right context or do not consume them in all but a that is what i said we of it i i i support your your love of bourbon a ism not bourbon drinker but a tell me a little bit more about what you are up to lately you alluded to it a moment ago tat your running teams theater doing a lot say you are you are in charge of a lot of people now helping people help people a providing lot of service in the world through a lot of different channels a first of all i want to say that your book never split the difference one of my favorite books thank you a i do not say that lightly i do not endorse books very often but the books i do indorse i love love love i also have to say that it is a toss up between your book never split the dis difference and the body keeps the score e the award for best titles of any book those is amazing titles amazing amazing titles tall was a writ to writer came up with the title yet it was phenomenal title that in the body keep the keeps the score just because it is there much contained in in the title and then the book a exceeds expectations a really amazing book people should listen to it read it if they have not already you are doing a lot more right now than ism been just writing although i will not hear about your other book projects as well but before you list off the number of things you are doing tell me first about fireside cause this sounds a really interesting ism endeavor that frankly even heard of before ism what is fireside a brand news social media platform a it is essentially an interact of podcast it is a subscription service found by fallen fate and mark cuba found have been friends for number years she was bugle's youngest employ she is an antropanewr dynamic smart hard charge in parson and it is sort grew out of what is inadequate in some of the social media a set her out there trying to combine the best ideas of a few different thanks and found suggested it to me and i thought it'll jump in because she is a visionary and what is turned out to be as it is effectively weekly interactive group coach and you you get the a off your phone or your android whatever platform your phone is on and in you log in we do an hour once a week and it is you are getting group coaching and then you get ask questions and it is got of idea component to it if you want ask a question we we are going to bring you up on quote stage and i get to see you and talk directly to you en you get a see me and talk directly to me or a i interviewed marked human a couple of weeks ago when people got to come on and a ask mark questions or ask me questions and what it is turned out to beat is one of sort of a a the that the next level of how to get better at negotiations after you have read the book and probably taken the master class where do you go next one of the people that came on the podcast here the day the the the fireside am episode they said well i don't have enough money yet to go to your in person training events castles are expensive and this is to i going to get better in the in a meantime and work my way in that direction and the monthly coaching if you were to sign up for group coaching from us on a regular basis on a monthly basis it would promptly easily cost you for what were providing twenty five thirty thousand dollars a month and this is a thousand a year at scale it is an opportunity interact directly with me and the members on my team once a week an get group coaching and it is and it is just kind of fun we are get o kick out of it and people that really really care about interacting well with people guy comes on the first episode i did and he said besides the fact that you help me make a lot more money you help me save my marriage and he just needed to know how to talk more genuinely and honestly with his wife in a way the male made felt hard and he did not really have a good way to do that beforehand and i was just that is a lot i do not i don i know how to respond to that or than just be grateful that people can say stop that to us the fireside things cortical were still experimenting with it it is an interact podcast group coaching it is fun grate i mean i would say a the changing lives there i mean the saving o marriages i no small deal and i think that the ability to communicate am directly with people also imagine gives them the opportune to implement that the tools that you are providing in real time it is one thing to here about something and and try it but then a you can give fee back in real time or you on these these fireside chats directly or members of your team now i i do we do one every week and ism once a on and the other thing too i can explain something one way and if for whatever reason it does not land in your contact you cannot quite get it that is what we found about the inner act if nature of its somebody comes on and ask a question in their contact and that it'll answer it an go i oke i that helped you get you get to hear people you who is struggling with it the way you are but i have not put it in your contact yet and that is the other thing that is great about a can i live one we at a guest on here who told me that there are amazing data supporting the fact that people follow the medical and health advice of doctors that they can relate to far more than they follow the medical and health advice of the physicians that they feel are not them i and oftentimes this can include the physician or health care provider being someone that they would aspire to be but oftentimes it is just some common report they both baseball or they both to cook or to garden and that sets a bridge where then the patient is willing to do all these things that ordinarily they would be resistant to r and and there really good data to support this and i i that that really stuck with me cause it says that it is s not just about the information or the the delivery rout of the information that the contact and that reports even along something is o you your am not a major a a a major sports fan on most things but all our bills fan or something me too that can be the difference between somebody doing all the things to lower the blicprashure the day and changing their die a all those things verses not making the changes report is a magic yes kind of a magic component could changes things a will fireside sene lake a great opportunity for people to not just ask questions but to build report with you in members of your team a man a check it out lord knows a i need help import my communications and ceria certain domains o life believe me i get the memos a fact a what other writing projects are you involved in if any a were were been going with this a companion a operations manual for tactical empathy which getting it right is important it is sort of companion book that never spit the difference that is probably at least a year and a half out from being done in the meantime we just do we do a lot of online training you know we got a we got a news letter we put out weakly for for people to get our latest cunning ends application thoughts as much as possible we would put an information out that we charge for a lot and we put out a lot of free stuff ism i ism thrown out ideas on instograham but we are constantly trying to put information out there that that people can collaborate better specific we just finished a book for residential real estate agents a friend of mine steeve shoal we put that out last nonmember that is sort of niche but it is mostly the black son method for real estate agents cause every conversation therein is a difficult emotional conversation see see of a house as all most trustful moments of anybody's life salmon or buying we just put that out in the meantime we are spread a gospel as much as possible will certainly point out the various places people can find you and and the different venue for for learning more i want to say that am numerous times throughout to day's conversation you threw out the words sounds it has not opener and i have to say have this cant crazy idea in the back of my mind i i believe that am simple feel tested tools a immensely powerful not just for resolving negotiations but really for changing the way that people into act with each other and themselves and e nous if i have one wish a for the world a on the basis of our conversation it how amazing would it be if kids learned early on to talk to one another from that sounds perspective because i think that would naturally a orient them toward listening right or at least offering a hypothesis of what they heard and how poorly they might be listening and then getting a defensive stance response that informs them about the act accuracy your lack of accuracy a and on and on i fee that the sounds a question sounds you feel blank or sounds you believe blank just seems to me the a one of the one of the most potent tools in the universe and i sure

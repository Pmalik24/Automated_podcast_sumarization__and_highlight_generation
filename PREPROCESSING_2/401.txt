welcome to the superman lad podcast ecus science science pace to s for recently the superman labpodcast hosted a live event at the winter theater in loss angels it was entitled the brainbody contract the first part of the evening was a lecture about science and science space tools for mental health physical health and performance the second half was a question in answer period in which the audience asked me questions from the podcast or related to their own interests or things that they have glean from social media who just general questions about mental health physical health and performance and i answers those questions for them we wanted to make the recorded version of that question in answer session available to everybody regardless of who could attend what follows is the question answer period from the winter theater brainbody contract live superman lab event want to be sure to thank the sponsors from that event they were eight sleep which makes smart mattress covers with heating and cooling capacity i started sleeping on an eight sleep mattress cover about eight months ago and it is completely transformed by sleep i sleep much deeper i wake up far less during the middle of the night if at all and i wake up feeling far better than i ever have even after the same amount of sleep in fact i love my eight sleep much that when i travel now am quite bothered that urban bees and hotels do not have eightsleep mattress covers on them and have even shipped my eightsleep mattress cover out to meet me in the location that i arrive to that i get the best possible sleep if you ant a try eight sleeping go to eight sleep dot calm slash supermen to save up to four hundred dollars off their sleep fit holiday bundle which includes their new pod three cover eight sleep currently ships in the u essay canada united kingdom select countries in the w and australia again that is eight sleep do calm slash supermen i to also thank our supplement partner momentous they make the very highest quality supplements they ship internationally and they've formulated supplements as single ingredient formulations that match what is discussed on the superman lab podcast if you are interested in any of those supplements please go to livemomentous do calm slash supermen and now without further ado the question answer period from the superman lab live event in lot evangelists what occurs in the mine body when you have eighty high t o thermals to address it without medication thank you for this question attention defies at hyperactivity disorder used to be called eh d d the hyperactivity part is a little misleading and again ism not a cognition here here is what we know works for some people and yet there always going to be side effects any kind of chemical manipulation which is at we know that people kids and adults with eighty eight t rashly have a tremendouscapacity to focus if they with they focussing on you take a kid with eighty ti cannot focus and you give them their favorite vidiogame and there are a later the threshold to access the dopamine system is higher and domain has this incredible ability to focus the brain another aspects of the nervous system you do not certainly if people require medication ism not going to tell you to stop taking that medication but the focus training exercises that have been explored mainly in china but there trying to be explored in over here as well do seem to be of benefit and these are as they sound they use them in schools in china now which are literally visual focus exercises your mental focus that is your ability to focus on in cognitively follows your visual focus and of course your stress will anchor your youth century put you in a sotustraw few of the world yes there are a non medication base treatments by medication on assuming you mean prescription medication there of course supplement base medications that will increase dopamine mainly altirasine again this is something that the carefully about before you start tampering with you are dopamine system but it is the the eltirasine is the recurs or to dopamine will raise your dopamine levels but i believe and you will hear me say this as many times as necessary that one should if you can rely on behavioral tools first then of course sleep in nutritionist tare prerequisite again for all mental health physical health performance you simply cannot neglect those and then and only then if those all of that is into working to rely on supplement base tools or on prescription medication it is clear that vive ants after all riddling et camera work radiate but of some people house to rely on more subtle forms of pharmacologic manipulation eltiracine and this focusing exercise a essentially consists of spending one to three minutes trying to maintain visual focus and yes you are allowed to blink i do not know why we we tend to steric something we do not blink but om do notify your eyes dry out and that can increase your ability to focus cognitively and it works and keep in mind that focusing always involves a refocusing we covered a beautiful data set not collected by my lab by windy sizuki's habit and why you that it roughly ten minute it is ash thirteen minute a my meditation of the sort where you just focus on your breathing has been shown to improve focus significantly why do not we here about this more were she is now dean of arts and sciences and why you and all the students are hearing about it hopefully they're doing it but it takes a obit of discipline for some reason ten minute a tight medication is something that very few people follow consistently but if your looking for non medication base treatments radiate the ordyour somebody who just struggles with focus the focusing exercise or the meditation i just described i can be very useful say the data ye thinks for bring up peacetime bridging or people familiar with what peacetime bridging i have not talked a lot about it cat this is a thanks for bringing that up a we a she have an episode on meditation coming up soon where i cover it and i talked about it long ago and then i kind of abandoned it because well we wanted more data and and it is a pretty interesting technique you no if you think about not the nervous system an vision in particular but if you are not a sighted person your low vision or no vision you could do this with your hearing but i reassume most people here are sited if not just translate this to the auditory system you have this incredible ability to close your eyes and focus for instance on people told about the third eyes cent or u no focusing right behind your forehead you know why people do that when they meditate the reason is that you actually have no sensation in your brain it is the one place to focus your attention for which you abandoned sensation right if i think about any portion of my body or my breathing ism either ism going to sense what is happening ism going to perceive my inn inner landscape sillcalled interception or my outer if i look out into the world it is extereception when you focus your attention with your eyes closed just you do have to close your eyes just behind your forehead you are focusing on your thinking right sort of obvious but i do not at least to me had never been stated that clearly again one of the problems with some of the more traditional practices but also the problem with science is that there is a shrouding of everything in very complex language which sucks why is it is suck because it is a separator you el eliminate the number of people that can be brought to potentially useful practices and i do not it when people including myself over use mechanism and descriptions of fancy phrases to mask basic principles simplest language i think is is a ah it tends to unify people around the practices when you focus on this called thirds center right or a spotlight behind your forehead or on your breath it is lo tricky with the breath but when you focus ion your frontal quarters there is nothing to sense because there is no censoring our on there there is no touch there is no pain nothing that is why in these gory movies you can take the skull off and ere in nersurgeries there poking around and there the prison's flag of blind i no an aesthetic now anaesthetic does not require asset there is no sensoria or runs cannot sense anything there space time bridging involves it is esentilia meditation butts really a perceptible exercise i think that is where we are goinguith this is it is starts by closing your eyes and focusing on that location for which there is no sensation there is only thug and then opening your eyes and focusing on a location may be about the distance of your hand and you focus also on your breathing to you sort of imagine a kind of a s teacher between that you can split your attention to these two locations you thinking about your body and you are thinking bout a location outside of you and then you while continuing to think about your body called interception focus on your breathing you focus further out and then further out and then further out and then ultimately the little cartoon or men where the we are just a little blue dot floating in a big universe and it is must make all your problems go away i it kind o works because what you have done is you have expanded your perception an go only i the stuff that is happening in here is really important when ism focused on what is happening n here but when ism focused on what is going on and that the kind of the vastness of all this and were just a little in a pale blue dot and all that it changes your perception not just your visual perception obviously changing your visual perception changes your connive perception which changes your emotional experience the peacetime bridging is a is a perceptual exercise were you step from focussing internally to focussing externally at a short distance than a further distance further distance further distance and then trying to imagine yourself in this larger landscape itsownds very mystical but it is ashy very norobiological and it capture something really amazing why is the tea in there the time space time bridging cause this is space but time is in there because when you focus in close you are slicing of time is finer you notice the subtle fluctuations in your breathing and things that are happening up close whereas when you focus further out your perception of time actually changes which is why in panoramic vision we are calm and when you think about we are just a pale blue do and we most only live to about eighty five or nine hundred years old and then what is happening right now my boss being in it jury and all that does not really matter because the earth is spending and all that kind of stuff which is all true and is the stuff of philosophy and mindfulness and i think is beautiful what you are really doing is you are changing your time perception by changing your space perception peacetime bridging is very useful because most people get locked at one step one of these stations especially under conditions of stress and people who have a trouble focussing ism glad you brought this up in this context of eighty eight ten people have a hard time focusing whether not they have eighty weighed e or not tend to skip back and forth between different space time domains as we call them in science this is a simple exercise that you can do focusing internally then stepping out externally then stepping back in all the while paying attention to your inner and the landscape just simply by focussing on your breathing am it is a tool that we are still collecting date on in terms of its utility but people are already using it and am i do not think of is meditation i think of it is a perceptional exercise thanks for asking the cause ha teenage our what ore five things you would recommend to physically feel my best ism a fifteen year old surf or who attends high school and place soccer it something you are doing a lot of things right to physically feel your best bouquet ism in a grasp at some context here that ism not that is not within reach ism assuming if you are doing all these things you are holy doing a bunch of other things too and the going to be demands on you that you y some of them you do not want to do school on things that are going to have varying levels of joy and delight and demand of things you do not want to do i i i don't want a default always to the simplest of tools but i i certainly think that even as a fifteen year old if you are not already getting a lots and lots of sleep that is going to be great tell your parents that i said you should get lots and lots of sleep by your not sleeping through classes i am a professor after all i could not a i tell you otherwise i would say if i could travel back in time as a fifteen year old i would encourage you to cultivate some sort of mindfulness practise i know the sounds a little cricket but having some awareness of you are thinking about your thinking is good but ism actually not going to say sit down and meditate for ten minutes a day or do amnesty are ism ism actually not going to tell you that i think given how plastic your brain is how much it is changing at fifteen i would encourage you and maybe would set a timer for this to actually develop just a really keen awareness of what stresses you out what relaxes you what delights you et camera and just a simply develop in awareness of that because those are your intend and i certainly had a meditation practice as a youth mostly given to me because i was a little hay wire and i needed it and it worked pretty well but i think in retrospect what i wish i had developed was more of a sense of nohow i navigated stress or things and things i enjoyed in things i did not enjoy and i would just encourage you to have a general awareness trying detect and learn about what braises your dental and what raises you are dope o me n what raises your are tone and and then start thinking about tools but again the awareness is going to be very valuable and gosh as a fifteen year old you are in this amazing blessed period of heightenerol plasticity should we all be lucky enjoy it next question please clarity on a adrenalin regarding cold water should we wait to feel the rise of a adrenalin the get me out here feeling an the full of it before bailing yes provided it does not kill you i i do not want to say cold water it is hard to kill yourself with cold water provide your heads above in you breathing but the it is i my podcasperuse is always i i cannot help that the anyway it is it is a great tool and different days it will feel different for instance doing cold any kind of a adrenalin and deliberate cold exposure or a adrenalin increasing activity early in the day you might find that you are more quottinquat resilient than later in other words the wall a really do not want to do this this is actually interesting for i think it extends beyond cold water let say you really do not want to do something pay attention to the fact that maybe it is not the right thing to do but assuming it something that you should do but you do not want to do you are already in the first was of a define you do not experience it necessarily as heighten levels of stress you might experience it as heighten levels of fatigue or a hard time shifting on that kind of activation state that is require to move through the thing but i do encourage you to take advantage of that of course and we have an episode coming out to morrow actually that answers questions should you train if you are sick and what if you traveling and there is contact always but i think that you do want to experience if you want to get the most out of the cold water exposure and to be more specific the adrenalin then you want to get to that point of i really want to get out here but i know i can stay in safely but i really want to get out of here and it is it is a little hard to explain but there is just much learning in those short moments about where your mind goes and this sounds very kind of again subjective and maybe a all wish you washy but you can realize great things about yourself in those moments you can find insight in those moments also keep in mind that the degree of discomfort not just physical but mental discomfort is directly predictive of the pain to pleasure wave that you will experience afterwards the reason's feel good when you get out of the ice bath and your showered off i yous do the warm shower after i do not do this end on cold thing i do not know just seems to painful and then take a warm shower and in you feel great and that is the surge of dopamine that we know based on a paper publishing the urban journal physiology last many hours and it is a one hundred to two hundred per cent increase in dopamine is not a subtle of fact and then people say will wait is that dreaming in to crash my dona mean system know because it is a nice slow rise in fact i am actually not aware of many things besides love and delight that can create this long so arc of dopamine lasting many hours maybe you are aware of other things if you are let me know but it turns out that long arc is a a true anti depressant and my colleague get stamford doctor onolympki who is ahead of our do diagnosis diction clinic has talked about in her amazing not dopamine nation about patience of hers that if really help themselves along and out of the more depressive phases of r working through a diction and in just depression in general through directed cold water therapy i you know ism obviously a fanatic about it in the sense that it is a powerful relatively safe if done properly safe if done properly way to modulate your internal dope hopefully i answered your question next question place i sorry i caught it rays and went off the fall as well yes i think you should get out once your once your you have accomplish something do not get out when panic unless its dangerous are how can you train your brain to feel more confident moments where you tend to feel intimidated ah o we es hard question am because context is tricky here cause i do not know what the context is and confidence on short time scales and then long time scales to confidence in school confidence and career those are those are long long our things were as confidence to be able to do something in the short term is different but remember those action sequences that trigger the release of dopamine do not bemean have mainly talked about the dark side of dopamine but i fully also talked about that to upward spiral that dopamine can cause mainly by thinking about delight and things that you really enjoy the that carries over and i would say that you want i you want to micro slice the demands of what is maybe got you back on your heels a bit am i she could frendamine who is here to night i think also my friend pat yo he has a great way of ai you now conceptualizing this which is it for most all endeavors were either feel back on our heels flatfooted or forward center of mass we can really do something we are flatfoot o were back on our heels and sometimes getting from back on our heels at let us call that lack of confidence to just you know on to feet and confident enough to move forward or at least stay in the in the game that is going to require you could lean on different tools i cannot say which would be ideal for the circumstance were you have in mind but i do think that having away to calm yourself we will give you access to more resources internal resources we know this this was something i meant to bring up during the discussion about fear versus love et camera trying to acts as delight and love when we are in a state of fear or stress or anxiety the rule set the options available to us and indeed our creativity is greatly diminished and this has to do with the way that the prefrontal quarter inter acts with an airy the wrinkled the insula which relates to our internal landscape and there is his weird phenomenon which is it normally our brain our thinking rain and or rule setting brain can it leads our the brain parts that control and pay attention to how we feel internally and that is why for instance if you feel will nervous you can still do something it's some point you get stressed enough and we know this from work by my collie davit is beagle it reverses and these areas of the brain that are paying attention how flushed my faces are with an am sweating or my breathing shall start to shut down creative decision making i would say the way to have more confidence is to learn to control that stress and keep the part of your brain the prefrontal quarters is that part that can come up with new rules that can be funny that can be creative that keeps that brain part leading the way thing about this is the provuntal quarter is or the coach and the rest your raiders a the players and if you get too stressed the players start to lead the game in the coach follows now drags them along i would encourage you to focus on real time stress modulation and to raise your strestthreshold using the sorts of too we talked about and to register your winds i did not get into this and too much detail but one of the amazing things about the dopamine system is that it is highly subject to your interpretation if you tell yourself that a fail was a win and you can see or conceptualize some way in which that is actually true you get to tap into the dopamine system you might think that is crazy you can cheat your own brain you can cheat your own negro chemistry and indeed you can you can change the time space time reference and we see this with examples nelson men dell are victor frank you you read their stories right trapped in little sells it confined imprisoned and they come up with new ways to access the dopamine system aby now not thinking about what they are not getting but thinking about what they can control in their immediate experience many many examples of this throughout literature and history and the dopamine system is the life for system i do not say that in any loose way dopamine is life force it is the wish in the desire to continue it is persistence and if you can think about what might seem a failure and really spend some time thinking about not the potential winds on the outside but how you can conceptualize that is a potential win internally you really do get to achieve an internal chemical win and that chemical win sets you up for more real winds for that make sense it is incredible how contextualize the dopamine system is but if it were not why would it matter if we are talking about money or mates or food or job or school you do not get fifty reward systems and motivation systems you get one and that is the dopamine system next question please what is the competing mechanism behind bilateral eve movement m dear that helps resolve psychological drama the competing mechanism ah well let me let me try an answer as best i can a nutty understand the full extent of the question be lime e m dear moving your eyes from side to side right then then recounting a drama is a very caiman and actually one of the for approve treatments that are behavior of for drama ism it is contain seriously in the psychiatric and cytological community for good reason it tends to work best for single event dramas as appose entire childhoods ism no joke there mean some yule of their entire childhood with dramatic other people they experience a drama a single event drama or repeated periods of the same were similar type of drama i movements from side to side have been shown in a number of studies to very potently reduce the activity of a brain structure can the amygdala which most people are familiar with because of the character from the starworts move idea there is a nursing to somewhere on the the the that team it is indeed a threat detection center and when you move through space not outer space but when you walk this your eyes actually generate these settle side topside shifts unless your focusing on a specific target and my lab and other laboratories have found that that leads to a very potent quieting of the threat detection system and then e m dear is essentially a process of pairing that calmer state with no threat detection system activated with the recount of something that normally would be quite triggering it is you have heard of pavlova conditioning a bell rings in the animal gets fed and animal salivates eventually just the bell will awoke the salvation you are doing the reverse of that it is called behavioral defenses action as underlying mechanism et camera but the ideas to pair a calm state with recount of something it has been shown to be successful there are people who think that the side topside i movements and the recount of drama may actually be invoking some form of hypnosis i my colleague avid spells your expert and clinical hypnosis is appeared on my podcast retros podcast ana yew other podcast and talks about this it is not stageshypnosis its clinical hypnosis there may be something going on there m dear yen some people get great relief from it other people do not what is kind of nice is that this i movements from side to side or simply taking a walk as fellas you are not looking at your phone and not allowing your eyes to move from side to side is a very good way to shut down the fear in stress system taking a walk i think it is relaxing for obvious reasons and there a data showing that you knowpart the reason why animal sir coth at the door and what to go for walk may not actually be the exercisers kind of an anxiety in an an anxiety relief that occurs of course they i have to go the bathroom to one of cowbell's great joys in life was just pein on everything outdoors thankfully the psychological aroma rewiring unfortunate the have not been a lot of brain imaging studies long looking at this long term of how will m do our works what i think it is going to happen in the next few years by the way is it is not going to be a discussion around should you do m dear should you do trains cranial magnetic stimulation should you do behavior other it is going o be commination therapies commination there he's including pharmacologic manipulations to essentially give a boost to the systems that encourage mineral plasticity dopamine in stone and and gentlemen and then also then perform e m d are if you want to talk about what is happening in the landscape of clinical trials on some of the psychedelics on happy to talk about it they are still e legal but they are being used in clinical trials and very interesting stuff is happening there locate next question please what no research or interventions are you must excite about in the realm of o wit a wellness what i think is going to be very interesting in the next few years really reflects my an obsession that you have seen a little bit of to night but the thing i thing it is going to be most useful and have seen this in science before and i think we are going to see it in health in wellness is that they're all these tools and all these people and he saying this and she saying that and what we are going to star paying attention to is what are the common themes right i it and a broader and more important theme is going t be one of modulation verses mediation what do i mean well if some one were to pull a fire alarm right now please do not that will shift our attention and make it hard to focus in what ism saying and knowing me iplogust say up here talking do we think that fire alarms mediate attention mum they modulate it right if it were very very cold in this room it was when we first got here to night there arctic cold helthleet's warmed up a bit e it has not ism sorry sorry ye i attempted to ye i almost thought may we all just do bunch your breathing to heat up a grentalin release but now these days getting groups of people all breathe on each other s to exactly i can see that might go the wrong way in terms of what people interpret the the idea here is that certain things directly mediate something a physiological side directly calms you down quickly it mediates the coming response getting good sleep makes you less easily triggered it modulates stress but is sleeping directly mediating stress control no and i think this is really important and this brings up the topic of the got brain axis the got is rich with these little bugs bacteria trillions of them which is an ere thought to me but also the surface of your skin the surface of your eyes you have a skin microbes ma naval microbyom every mucosa lining has a microbyom in fact think about this it is this is a crazy but worth while tangent have you ever bit in the inside your mouth it is socks right and get a cot an a hurt but guess what the inside of your mouth heels without a scar but that weird right you cut anywhere else on your body and depending on how well you heel and your age in your immune status you get a scar your mouth is filled with bacteria and it is open to the world but the got microfilm provided it is healthy provides and incredible ability to heel quickly and ism not somebody who is done a lot of acupuncture have went a few times and others interesting science happening on macupunctubut what is the first thing they do when you walk in there hun and then they got my at and they have this cool intuition that is not based on western mechanistic science it is more of an intuition based on millions if not billions of data points that have been put into these charts it is pretty cool right and what they are looking at i believe and from what colleagues who work on microbyom tell me is than look at the pallor of your tongue in particular in the back and get a sense of whether not the microfilm there is of the appropriate stuff but they do not go lack basilisk andembsi they all onto ills right but they ow you are just biotic instead they get a sense now parents of small babies learn to detect all sorts of things coming out of essential every orifice of the child as a read out of health because the child does not have language and a down martin unfortunately learn to do this too for better for worst pride for better right we have this intuition about got health but got health would be another example where it is very clear now that fiber can be helpful but it is mostly consuming these fermented foods that been used in for ages but louder fomentifoods of the not kimchi sour crowd comboocha et camera all these things the depending on which culture you are in they come in different forms certain yogurts et camera that allow that got to be healthy and it modulates a huge number of systems i do not think that you are going to cure depression by a busting you are got microfilm but if you are got microbiota are not wealth and you improve that it will indeed shift the narrow transmitter systems of your brain and give you a elevated mood that should not come as of surprise any more but i think that the whole world things i cosh it must be the serotonin in the gut no it is actually not ceratoid got it is that the it is got microbioto create chemicals that actually become serotonin in the brain or become opening in the brain and i think that the got microbyom i would put in the same category although not quite as important i put i in the category sleep it modulates a huge number of other processes it does not mediate them sunlight sleep healthy got microbioum exercise good nutrition social connection these things all create this general milk or environment of health i would to see more distinction between modulating and mediating to affects and tools out there because i i also see a lot of unnecessary argument you are there is no example that improving your got microfilm curious depressions ism course there is not but there really good examples if your got micro boom is off that improving it can improve mood which in depending on where you are on that spectrum of depression can really relieve things i think that that the future of health you know we hear much about personalize medicine and matched your gene but we knowing of the basic most people do not even have the basics right and if you watch or listen to the podcast long enough hopefully certain theme starts a kind of repeat themselves but a key theme that a you learn in science you teach your students your lets does it modulator t doesn't mediate it you need to be careful with your language there and there is great information and or as we say interpretational power there if you understand the difference then i think we can go a long way by making that distinction modulating verses mediating ether probably other things that modulate health that ism overlooking now just because of a the the flow that ism in the cool it ye the cool palmer cooling o get i promise to talk about cot palmer cooling well it'll do it now palmer cooling they change the clean form at loci sit is is teaching in the classroom all right very briefly the palmer cooling which is essentially placing you can cool the core of the body most quickly by placing cold objects on the hands the bottoms of the feet or on the top of the face because of the arrangement of musculature normally you got this arteries calories pains things but in at those locations in the body you skip the capillaries and you can basely you are not really passing cool into the body but your cooling off the core of the body more quickly and if you do that in between sets of exercise or during a rod nor cycling you can dramatically increase your ability to continue actually use the cool it for cognitive work but you do not need a cool it a sorry commit guys e you can just get a a a thing of ice water or just very cold water and you i know it sounds trivially easy your actually just cooling your core by putting your hands or even one ha and on a relatively cold thing of water or ice but not cold that it constricts the the vascular sure there this is the incredible work of my collie at stamford doctor crap heller why would not more people do this if you can double the amount of endurant believe it are not or double the number of sets of exercise you can do or feel more alert and do more connive work why would not more people do it because people just do not do it and it sounds crazy it really sounds crazy but it is a real thing and i wish more people do it the athletes at stamford do it people toe military do it people no no and they and they use it enjoy it it is just its a it is a it is almost seems too off target from the what you are trying to accomplish i do not know for some reason people are finally on board breathing in a specific way as a useful too a few years ago anyone was into that man just think of how far we have come it is incredible people tike about psychedelics meditation breathing i think the pandemic for all it is pains and what a challenging period for all sorts of reasons did wake people up to the idea that you have to take control over your health because there is no magic ferry coming to do it for to you and with all do respect there is no government agency that is on drop off the kit at your front door o here is i take o carry herself it is just it is just nock an i happen and it would not happen under any circumstances it is a personal responsibility issue huh e all rightful what lessons from escapeboarding the failure part the failure failure failure i mean for me youscae work never was a goodscapeboarder still have close friends in that community an a a photographer and guide does all the visuals and the other gone what dote visuals for a podcast mike play backing cries an martin are all of that community i think that for me that community was really a as a mice will sometimes say escape orders hate everything meaning they have a very high threshold for what they consider acceptable it is not just what you do it is how you do it superimportant and i thinking narrow science a there a lot of there is a lot of stuff in science in general they're a lot ere many papers and there is many experiments i how you navigate that landscape i think it it help me develop a sense of taste but the taste that ism referring to is not necessarily a taste of which sciences cooler not cool that too but it came through a few times to night when i strung about my mentors i picked back then scapeboardin cause i really the people and also you did not need your parents to to to a game and that work for me and y cant make your own case and i do think it is very important to the extent that you can in science and in everything to surround yourself with the kinds of people that you just really enjoy being around and to me the podcast running a lad feels a lot scape boarding it is the same energy it is the same petrochemical systems firing s the at that is a yo one next u favorite fine oh oh i know that is inappropriate i i do have a fireman's story but it is inappropriate ain't it maybe some time is what i do not drink good decision making well i read all a firemen books to i had the pleasure i never met him i hews dead before i was born but my my dad did and he had good firemen stories and they are inappropriate the cool thing about firemen right was that he didn't really care if people understood the specifics of what he was talking about he just wanted people to get turned on to how amazing physics was and he love general principles and one of the things e now the example that sometimes given out in o how many your familiar with the binmen books but surelyoure joking mister firemen ore what you care what other people think all o that is of it is wonderful he picked locks we worked at lost almost labs they are working on the am and he basicity well there and elsewhere and every morning the offices used to come in and he would spread all the top secret papers out on the floor he'll break into the safes at night and then they were perplex who could do the he safe cracking literally national security secrets just for fun prankster he also bongo drum naked on the roof of calpac and he did most of his writing of therms in strip clubs fact learn to draw late in life was really in to flotation tanks and very curious about but never did psychedelic that is was i understand but one of the the cool firemen factoids is that when he was a kid he he talked about when he was a child that has dad used to take him bird watching and he say all that is a whatever scrub jay and that is a whatever whatever thrush and that's and his dad said no do not cloud your mind with naming and taxi on me that is not meaningful because then what a it is the different youknow the pigmy thrush or the the lesser this or that the more import thing is to start to identify principles of my certain birds behave one way and certain birds behave another and to start fining the the commonalities and the regularities and that is a theme that i obviously tonight of tried to impose and it is actually something that i cannot do in pod cast necessarily cause i cannot thread across forty episodes or something that in the same way that i could in an evening this that is an appropriate firemen story also it just seem a delightful guy and he is cannicoli's a little bit street city the thick accent he was from far rock way but he did not really care much what people thought or he did and he pretended he did not careful when people tell you they do not care what people think i think he did to the extent that it is still a low him to get the message out there o k next question please my horse w ell of this i delight in all things animals but a specially horses because my high school groveling had a horse an i you know they do that thing were i people ow horses can detect how they know more about you than and i get to the horse in the horse any tithe this and it is a litmus test have can't groom in with a horse was very intimidating remain actually i felt i had to compete with the horse she spend all this time with the horse is very large very anyway eventually i broke the horse the oke my horse does the double in heal long hail often he is a bit of a stress guy warm blood ye warmblooded ice to work at the barn ya i used to shovel aneurin work at the barn she brought her horse to college that is it i should followed her off to call never would have gone to college if she had gone to college and the horses are interesting animals they do tell you lot the the worse does the double in healing hail often he is a bit of a stress god you suppose the physiological street regulator transients we absolutely absolutely in fact i mention warm blood for it'd have a college at stamford a she is amazing er name is sumaconal and she is an expert in dog phonetics s you can imagine ism always asking her questions and we talk about dogs and we talk about horses because she also think she raises warm bloods and you hear about hot bloods and warm bloods and you also if you have any familiarity with dogs their dogs costello we are a newcliar boy could go off and costly mi open an eye that is the bulldog economy of effort they are not going to get activated unless there is a reason to do it they are very as we call parts sympathetic dominant that we saw of autonomic arousal is just really really relaxed getting them into action is more of a more of an effort they're other animals the whip it right we are the italic greyhound they lis it here always cold that or very sympathetic dominant and then a horse within a breed or within a species there is a range and humans also out within a range i think any one who is had children will tell you he or she has been this ins birth calm easy going or really easily stressed i think that see saw wean get into to night too much but there is a a concept with the autonomic regulation of of a hinge do not think much about being really stressed out or really relax but certain animals the hinges tighten that the the we saw just kind of tilt's hello like costello a bull dog is almost seems a different animal then a whip it there very different and within the the camera horses ism not an expert in horse genetics but they are selected for not just for their physical attributes but for there psychological or temperament attributes and you see this in dogs to in fact the reason i picked costello and elves can verify the stories i read i wanted a dog for many years and i went there and there were all these puppies and i was i heard you need to take them in the other room and one by one and if it barks for its siblings than you us thy puppy walking and all the dogs are running around crazy was read around christian time canellas and the running round and then there is one in the back and he is taking advantage of the fact that all the other ones a wen he is just eating out of all their more s i i want that one i took that chubby little bastard in the next room and i thought o k he is going to bark for his siblings an lay down ain't took a nap not i this one i want this one why did i want that one will this complete the the principle which is i wanted a dog that because ism not that and ism was very interested in a dog i could take care of but also a dog that would helpregulate my nervous system and for me having a dog that as opposed to a whip it or something that was getting constantly around his i a very calming effect and to this day memory of his snoring still puts me to sleep i think that your your horse probably haw it count idols a little bit higherthing about the a p m revile bit higher t a given her more our p m at a given speed that is way i thing about the autonomic system how d you reset that well this is why a lot of exercise is good right it is ailing my girl friend's horse was crazy it was gilded late and it was crazy almost a nuts but at e at ponseright it was not nuts but it was crazy it was gilded late next coition is there any science behind staying motivated or developing discipline wo this represents kind of the higher tear of where i think things are going to going the next for yours were we are going to start seeing this convergence of psychology and biology where we can get to these harder concepts i to think that we can stay motivated through a simple process that now will make sense to you because the last thing i covered was toggling back and forth between durability to be gritty and lean in cold of infraction maybe in atoll anger fear competitiveness et camera that kind of earn grinding in but that the for re sustaining fuel the sort of hybrid version right hired fuel motel would be one in which you can access that but that is a topleadable and not renewable resource without a lot of rest meaning working hard out of anger determination and can a grit will work but when you are depended you have to stop for a long while whereas if you can access this delight system which is really one of dopamine and seratonean both in other words and i want to think of a not of a different way to put this but to trying thing about what sorts of things and tools allow you to be and feel most loving i know it sounds weak but it is anything but we to be most loving in the verb sense of the word toward what you are doing actually used to use this trick in college when it'd encounter a topic i hated i would tell myself ism really ism just in a fall in love with this by trying to find the gems within it sometimes it work sometimes it did not but the wish to do it that way i suppose to oceamgers can a grind this out at least for me at the time was a powerful tool motivation and discipline is a tricky one that sort of that just do it thing you need tools to modulate your stress and to get your sleep do all the basic things right set the right contact for you to be in your best chance of being disciplined and that it is it self is its own form o discipline but in terms of continual motivation you are not in o manage to go against the grain for very long people have managed to go against challenge for very long time for very long times in fact i was reading recently about the psychology of people been kidnap and they have this odd trick that they used if you heard about this is sort stocklums indium but they actually convince themselves to fall in love with their captors and then they come up with new ways to escape the sacantacool u there is something about mentally feeling your trying to go from back on your heels to flat footed it does that is very energetically costly again the these systems are very susceptible to the watch call contacts are top down regulation awfully that helps i known is a little bit abstract i wish i could give you one minute exercise or making motivated but o but we to talk about tools would get a adrenaline going and things that but spend some time thinking about what would allow you to sustain effort through positive feelings it is not a like concept at all o next question please what would be your biggest piece of advice for achieving one's dreams boy that is a tough one gain this is game a the abstract ism a believer in this idea of a kind of a seed message sober green is talked a lot about this that we can all kind of think back to a event or stage of our life typically it is before puberty for other reasons that our kind of interesting but where we we delight in something right it for me it was fish and o my see now i do not need to work on fish it is it was not about the fish i hope that came through i me a superior really cool but it is not about the fish it is something about the way they moved it was something about the way that it tickled might excitement i ease get dropped off at this bottle potshot in californiaavenue poll to called monies potshot my mouses child carriage you drop me off there and i this book and i would log all the tropical fish and which ones could be with which ones and then i would i was obsessed right but for me it was something about organizing and being able to make reliable predictions it was about parsimony it was about principles as opposed to en the color's delighted me in all that kind of stop it the equipment lighten me but then i at puberty amen it was something else and and then i went to college it was something else and i got girl for in it was something else it changes over time but this is why i recommended to that young fifteen year old person that they learn to tap into that sense of this is cool this feels i know not everyone else thinks at school maybe they do this feels good i actually have of somatic experience of this ism not a very somatically oriented person i more up here but i actually c know if ism on to something if this left arm just kind of starts fidgeting it is i want a move or it some people you can start to identify ways in which you suddenly have this positive energy it is not a fear energy it is almost a magnetism to things and just do not be confused and or is directed in thinking that it is that thing it is that i yen energy or that attraction to something that feels right that is your i wish we hade these divining rod to find water that is your tool it is unpen i you want a grow your and ten i how do you follow your dreams i i never thought i do a podcast i never thought's become a borrow scientist you you have to be willing course to take risks and and to iterate quickly but not quickly that you you fail out of the game et camera if you do get back in et camera but it is really about developing in awareness now the anything is you are not going to find this by going up a mountain and sitting there or waiting for your passion ta just kind of rocket beau now to is sort piano fall under your head it is not in i happen that way you have to interact with the sensory world and different kinds of people and you have to be a little bit of a adventurer in a safe way of course an adventurer and learn to recognize the signals and some people are very intone with us them the others in amazing podcast with rireuben recently on organs podastsery talks about the creative processes kind of this we it seems whatever going on in that bear to his is connects to the world and he can just there that is where you need to go and that is but that is part of the magic is you do not really know an because it is it is all energetic it is all energetic and when i say energetic i do not mean in the mystical sense i mean you have to learn to sens those fluctuations and energies some people can sends them very easily because their very mellow an if something gets really excited they notice as a big delta as we say inch big change other people they ride hunt a high all the time and everything's exciting to them and they miss a lot of the subtle fluctuations in what is really special and right for them in fact mania it is characterize by hyper elevated levels of opening and everything's a good idea right and depression is the opposite nothing's a good idea nothing's on to work right and those are the extremes and those are rough conditions obviously but for most people it is about learning to detect those subtle fluctuations an every time every single time you find somebody who is exceptional at their craft en doing well in life look can a lot of people are exceptional their craft but not necessarily doing well on the whole those people have a kind of a intuition about what feels good to them this here is noble prize when her in chemistry is my colly caroling curtsy and all i know of her except the fact that she is amazing chemist is they did this interview with her and she said that when everyone go out and college she was finding excuses to stay home and read organ at chemistry now ad to me something a bad night but for her it was pure delight and she is wired for that and ti think her work is going to be vitally important and transformation for humanity i really do how do you succeed in in get chasing your dreams you succeed in identifying what they are but you do not know at the outset you want a fined the energy to find the right path and continually course correct when you will undoubtedly be off your path that is the such what have done i still look for the feeling of delighting in costello or the subtle fish that is what ism am looking for it is not a templet i have to match but that is my ya i know what that feels it is a texture it is if you thing about a bunch of different textures of sand paper it is this one that just feel really god and you are comparing everything to that it cause the system that involves all these chemicals you will find it if you learn to pay attention to it but you will not find it sitting staring at your bellybutton er look going up amount you have to be incensory experience in order to find it reflection is good but you been to get into action of all right well o k am syliciban a opinion of the psychedelics generally we just sad an episode with my colic join willies whose a tripleboard certified neurologist psychiatric is a hunting about working at stamford is also very humbling cause you are what were these people that freeboard certifications that the syliciban first while not for everybody people with psychosis it is stilly legal decriminalized certain places obviously the cautionary notes of people who have druggadiction issues or other kinds of edition issues need to be thoughtful about diving into a narrow chemical landscape that but it does appear that the that the clinical trials on one macro dose this is what is interesting to me ampoule to about microdosing sylisivon but the data at least according to matter johns who is also on the podcast the data for microdosig are not really there frankly the data on single session mackrodose the sort of heroic doses that have ben talked about in the psychic the psychonot community for depression and to some extent past and for eating disorders and for inland sort of end of life preparation are quite encouraging in fact the current data suggested about two thirds of people achieve lasting relief from one session now keep in mind those are guided sessions with physicians in the room et camera i do think there is a potential hazard of all psychedelics which is they alter this includes end ma or especially mi mat they alter the chemical landscape in you such that a lot of things can serve as a tractors in that state meaning you can get really into the sound of music in an emdimasession feel connected to that and waste the opportunity for some more meaningful transform very wiring and i i do think that that is worth paying attention to that is the the the usefulness of having at their peptic guide there they can continually steer you back to what at least for you is the more meaningful work but it is very encouraging and join willies who i trust this an again trouble board certify died eddy said the in the studies of lifetime perceived individual in societal risk of all the compounds out there except for canine sylicivon is at the bottom of the list whereas things in a heroine cocaine algal hall o them headman said at the top of ta list a she a'lcall quite high on that list at certain mounts of consumption ism very excited about what is happening in the landscape of sylicivon but ism not excited about the microdosing data very excite about the single heroic dose data a one interesting their thing there perhaps what seem is to be the uniting feature of a successful syllicil sylicibons gives me session is that at some point the person feels as if it too much of a autonomic thing they it cut get to this point and then they are encourage to coming let go and ism fascinated by this concept of letting go because yo manor sciences we do not know what that means but seems being able to ride the wave of of autonomic arousal from top to bottom seems to be very powerful for roman depression treatment and this is interesting a lot of people think that one of the major issues in humans nowadays is were stressed about a lot of things but we never actually get to go into the full stress response and then let it relax again and catharsis was big at one point scream therapisteve jobbing to scream therapies that whether not catharsis is healthy or not as been debated but the date are to pointing the fact that it may be provided that the catharsis is not obviously on damaging himself for somebody else make wish all be screaming llotmore why does my desire to eat disappear after i use the sand of interesting i can go in hungry and get out with no desire to eat u i can only speculate the sand or any kind of deliberate heat exposure that is uncomfortable releases the molecule dying orphan is a tally the same molecule that is released in under conditions of alcohol withdrawal i makes you feel agitated and not good and then there is this rebound but the way it feels good is later it causes this regulation in the call mulepioid receptors you're the chemicals that you have your called indigenous opioid not that opioid that i relate o the period crisis but the ones that you naturally make are able to have a more robust of fact after the sand dinorphan is an appetites suppressing and for reasons related to kind of general discomfort in the bodies that is the only reason i can speculate there are a number of other things that sand does including massive increases in growthornmone provided you do not sand too much you do at once a week for four twenty minute sessions space five minutes apart u you get these enormous increases in growthormona if you start doing it more often you get still significant but smaller increases in growthormon and my team this is how the podcast goes to at some point rob just goes it is enough if you think that the episodes are long now they would be a lot longer isn't i just want it am before we part i know it is a sundae night and people have to go i want to think everyone for coming out to night i know that at least for me ism still sort of a baffled but pleasantly that people i interesting investing time to come out and here a hours of a a nerd me talk about science and tools and ism delighted that people are hopefully gleaning some useful information pile see two pass along the information i did not invent this stuff as i mention before i was not consulted the design phase i have no domain over it this is the stuff of mother nature whatever other beliefs you have they are here in us of course i be remiss if i did not finish by saying have a wonderful night and thank you for your interest in science

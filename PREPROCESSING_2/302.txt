i do not think at least that i was a loser when i was growing up but the thing is as much as i say that that dit happened had this birthday party that only one person went to and that thanking a hold stronger than anything that can possibly say convince her that i was not a loser oo certain days has symbolic meting whether we went on to er not that is was import i thing to overcome and say go big

progress we are a nation whose national holidays usually more about getting together with family and friends than actually commemorating the past when liberty rob around i do not think that many of us review the history of haymaker square or the flight for the right hour workday even in this crowd i will confess that i was actually well into my twenties before i fully understood that veteran's day and memorial day are actually two separate holidays with separate meanings and not just one holiday that comes around the lot this does not mean that our big national holidays do not contain deep commemorative meaning to us is us i think that the meaning is often personal sorrow was one of our contributing editors she says this year her family broke with all its traditions on thanksgiving i watched into an entirely new era as a family when i invited my mama dad to come to new york city to have thanksgiving at my house i never expected them to say yes not only had they never been to new york they had never been east of the mississippi nor had they ever visited me have always had these fantasies about being an normal family in which the parents come to town and their idol matter spends their entire visit day dreaming of suicide ism here totiyou that dreams really do come true i was terrified we would have enough to talk about in the interest of harmony there is a tacit agreement in my family the following subjects are best avoided in any conversation longer than a minute and a half national politics state and local politics any music by any person whew never head lined at the grand one okay my personal life and the called god five whole days when i visit ten back home in mutant conversation is in a problem because we go to the movies every afternoon that way we can be together but without the bird not actually talking to each other him yo lea ones does the talking for us less's heart that is a public service not my sister my is bringing her shall we sate lively seven month old sun own along the sentiment not an option which means five days together just us no movies we are headed into uncharted and possibly possible lands pioneers in a new world it is thanksgiving the pilgrims had the mayflower i buy a gravy boat it is lucky that as coming with mammadad my still lives six blocks away from them in bowman she would act as interpreter in go between among my parents an me squat tammies has been can has decided to stay home and on wanna to go dear hunting with his brother every one else arrives at my apartment and cheese my and own a bunking with meet i walk my parents run the corner to check them into their hotel on twenty third here we are says mom stopping under the owning of the cheese hotel there she tans a woman who's favorite book is called simply matter right on the spot where the cops called sidvishes out and handcuffs after his grand was found stab to death on their hotel room floor no mother i say taking her arm and directing her down the block to the cheese a boy a hotel where they go to the trouble the clean the rooms each day tit is around this time old twenty minutes into their trip that my dad starts making wise cracks boy kid betcha cannot wait till we are out o here my father a man who moved us sixteen hundred miles away from our oklahome a relative he would not have to see them any more makes a joke on average every two hours he is here about how much i anticipating the skin they'lsay would by i find this charming but disturbingly true i do not know what to say by half way through the first say i i cover i need not have worried about what we would talk about with the baby preventing us from seen movies when you have a baby around the baby is the move we occupy and entire entertaining hour just cruel non narrative cruel then there is the sight seeing first stop ell's island the thing about going to ell's island is that it is a lot going to ell's plan perhaps two helped you better under stand the emigrant experience they make you stand in line for the canned ferry for an hour and a had in the windy could by the time we step on to the island we are huddled mass's yearning to be in our great grandmother plan pass through here on her way from sweden we watch a biddy on the health inspections given to emigrants walk past oodles of forces of men in hats an women in shall then no one says anything i gnome my father and mother and sister a thinking what ism thinking the thinking about when we moved away from oklahome into montane how unknown that was how strange and lonesome i read a letter in a display case that says and i never saw my mother again and i think of my grandfather how we just drove off leaving and behind waving to us in the rear view mirror and here we are in new york because here i am in new york because ever since glen's father brought her here every generation moves away from the one before it is curious that we amaricans have a holiday thanksgiving that is all about people who left their homes were a life of their own choosing a life that was different from their parents lives and how to we celebrate it by hanging out with our parents it is as if on the fourth of puli we injured our in to peens from the brutish by playing cricket and nibbling on crumpets thanksgiving morning my parents take own to see the maces parade while my and i start making dinner let me repeat that my mother leaves while i cook specifically corn bred dressing a dish my mot here has made everythanksgivings once before i was born to her credit she has not in cured about my process since she owned to ass me if she should bring corn meal an her suit case as an oak keep my to m only uses quite corn meal process by the shown me company in mi stogy she does not even consider my corn bread to be corn bread at all because i make it with yellow corn meal and heresy sugar you do not make corn bread she told me in the same deflated voice she uses to describe my hair you make johnny cake ism standing at the cutting board chopping sage and it hits me what it mean that she is letting me be in charge of the dressing i am going to die being in charge of the dressing means era grown up for real and being a grown up for real means your getting old and getting old means you are deathanitly finally totally going to die my mother is a grandmother and my sister is a mother and i have decided the dressing well be yellow this year their for we will all be dead some day happy holidays i have invited to my new york friends to join is for dinner and i was a little nervous about how everyone would get along to my delight the meal is smooth and congenial my friends and i talk about the west nice virus killing birds on long island my father count ears with a lovely anecdote about and open copper pit in be that filled up with can tainted bring water and killed to under fifty get and one day there is nothing eating one dead bird an talking about bunch other dead birds ilia bring people together the next morning rite about the ti own starts to cry while me tainiously my mother jams the bathroom door and my fathers on his hands and knees crying at open with a penknife a cloud passes over me once or twice a day i am enveloped inside what i to call the impenetrable shield of melancholy this shield it is impenetrable hence the name i cannot speak and while i can feel myself frees up i cannot do anything about it everybody in the family goes through these little spells i just happen to be the spooky one at this particular moment when people ask me if ism the black sheep of the family always say that no were all black sheet every few hours there her i look over at my dad nervously crunching his fingers together if yew were at home for thanksgiving he ignoring us and spending all is time an his shop the thing that unites us is that all four of us our home body clostrafoks who prefer to be alone and our suspicious of other people the trait that bines us together as a family preferring to keep to ourselves makes it difficult to be together as a family paradoxically its et these times that i feel closest to them that i understand them best that i love them most it is just surprising we ever breed the next day we do the most typical thing we could possibly do as a family we split up by the time we all recon bean on sturdy eve meg my ragged mother become ambitious with her sight seeing that i can tell she is decided that she is never coming back you got one to goo to rock teller enter i ask and she says yow because who

own force of personality the charming most of the videos made of the cemetery lack is kind of character much that it reminds you just how hard it is to do to capture somebody on film a times your hart

is my birthday and ill li if i want to or is it all in a minute e noble great international wen our programmed continues is america life an are glass each we can our program of course we choose some theme bring your variety of different kinds of stories on that theme to day's programmed to commemorate our filthier an the air birthday's anniversaries milestones of all sorts have we mark them what they mean even when we want them to mean nothing our program to day taped on our fifth anniversary tour of new york boson chicagoing of angels and i have to say we are honored at this point it to have a special birthday greeting for the she recorded by one of my radio heroes terry grow of fresh are which incredibly you celebrating it is twenty fifth year on the air of this here it makes us just look little kids up here she recorded o this special message for us from her studio at w a of we in philadelphia five years suppose after five years i was still all bright eyed and onto mystic you know kid after twenty five years and this crazy public radio gam you see a few thing you see a side of people you sometimes wish a had do not get me started the boos the drugs the crazy parties the units ears five years weave that a lot to learn still i guess yea congratulations whatever beefcake ghat three birthday present this a hotel in solid city called the anniversary an before this building became an institution devoted to commemorating years of marriage the building was the salt city jail insert your own cheap joke here that de a the hotel is on an anniversary or a birthday or other big day what we want is fantasy there is a room with a drawbridge and a night in armor design to look sleeping beauty's castle here is a hayloft room and a swims family robins tree house and a treasure island sweet that one has a ship's mass and a crow's nest and sails stretching across the room you walk the gang pint to jump into which cause i bring on this up because i think of the anniversary in as a testament to the difficulty of introspection its as if when a big commemorative day arrives the notion of using that moment to look back take stock try to gain a perspective on who we have been and who we are that notion is inherently difficult and possibly painful that many of us we prefer to leave reality completely looking back though can be what we need more than anything runs banks has this story here's the other of numerous boy we great have we woken him it is about ten p m and ism one of three facet middle aged guys crossing south main street and light snow headed for a quick drink at the reeks we have just finished a thirty second degree induction ceremony at the masonic hall and the old capital theater building and need a blow ism the tall figure in the middle war and low and i guess it is my story ism telling although you could say it was gale forth notes story since meeting her that night after half a lifetime is what got me started ism wearing remnants of make up from the ceremony in which i betrayed and arab prince red lips streaks of black on my face here and there not quite washed off because of no cold cream at the hall the guy's tease me about what a terrific nigger i make that is the way they talk and i try to the fleck their teasing by ignoring it because ism not as prejudice as they are even though ism pleased on the less it is an acting job the thirty second degree and not many guys are good at it we are friends and business men colleagues i sal plumbing and heating supplies my friends mammy gibbon is in real estate and the other rick buckingham is a chevy dealer we enter the reeks a small restaurant and fern bar pass through the dining room into the bar and back regulars because we are regulars greeting the green in his help small comforts mammy and rick kid uselessly and one of the waitresses the pretty little blond kid and make a crack or two about the new gay water whose in the far corner by the kitchen door and cannot hear them why's guys the green says to me what is with the grease paint theater group i tell him he is not a mason i think he is orthodox cathlicer something but he knows what we do as we pass one table in particular this elderly lady in the group looks me straight in the eyes which gets my attention because otherwise she is just some old lady then for a split second i think i know her but decide not and keep going she is a large baggy bright eyed woman in her late seventies possibly early eighties old mammy rick and i belly up to the bar order drinks the usual comment on the snow out side and feel safe and contented in each others company we reflect on our lies and ex lies and our grown kids all elsewhere i peak a found the divider at her thin silver blue here dollars at her throat liver spots on her long flat cheeks but the hell an old lady shes with family some kind of celebration two sons they look in their forties with their lies and aboard teen h girl all five of them over wat dull dutiful and contrast to the old woman who despite age looks smart aware all draft up in a maroon nit wolfs suit clearly an attractive woman once i drift from mammy and rick asked the green who is the old lady what is the occasion the old lady's diet says the green we should live long right her no i guess not the waitresses in the gay waiter sing happy birthday making a scene but the place is almost empty anyhow from the snow and everybody seems to it and the old lady smile serenely i say to mammy and rick i think i know the old gall from some place but cannot remember beware customer says mammy munching peanuts rick says the same customer and they go on as before probably an old girl friend mammy adds aha i say back a selthixs nips game on levy has their attention double over time finally the nix wan in its time to go home guess is now piling up we pull on our coats pay the bartender and as we leave the old lady's party is also getting ready to go and when i pass their table she catches my sleeve says my name says it with a question mark warren warren low i say yet hi and smile but still i do not remember her then she says ism gale fortunate warren i knew you years ago she says and she smiles fondly and then everything comes back or almost everything do you remember me she ask sure sure i do of course i do gale have you been she is it is been a while she bawd still smiling what is that on your face make up yet been doing little theater did not have any cold cream to get it all off i say lamely she says ism glad you are still acting and then she introduces me to her family that this is my family howdy i say and start to introduced my friends salmi and rick but they are already at the door mammy says long warren do not do anything i would not do and rick gives a wave and there out it is your birthday gale happy birthday she says why thank you the others are all standing you pulling on their coats except for gale who still has not let go of my sleeve which she tugs and then says to me sit down a minute warren i have not seen you in what thirty years imagine ma the sun says it is late the so i draw up a chair next to gale and letting go of the dumb pretences i suddenly find myself struggling to see in her eyes the woman i knew for a few months when i was a kid barely twenty one and she was almost fifty and married and here too fat eyes were her skinneighteng age sons but i cannot see through the old lady's face to the woman she was then if that woman is gone then is the boy this boy she looks up at one of her sponson says dicky you go without me warren will give me a ride will not you warren she says turning to me ism staying at dicky's house up on the heights that is not out of your way is no ism up on the heights too all in woods just moved into a condo there dicky says fine a little worried he looks he is used to losing arguments with his mother the green in his crew star cleaning up while gale and i talk a few minutes more although her eyes are wet and red rimmed she is not teeny she is smiling it is as if there are translucent shells over her bright blue eyes even now when i look hard i can glimpse her the way she was slipping around back there and the shadows she had heavy dark red hair clear white skin smoothest porcelain broad shoulders and she was tall for a woman almost as tall as i was i remember exactly from when she and her husband once took me along with them to a of w party and she and i danced while he played cards when we knew each other warren i was the age you are now yet i guess that is strange to think about is not it ire you divorced you looked it yet divorce couple of years now kid's three girls all grown up ism even a grandpa it was not want your happy marriage is not by a slingshot i do not think i want to hear about all that oh we what do you want t hear about let us have one drank in one short talk for old time's sake then you may drive me to my son's home i say fine and asked the reeks at the register tapping out if it is too late for a nightcap he shrugs why not and gale asked for a sherry and i forged order the usual vodka and tonic the reeks shoots back to the bar poor as the drinks himself because the bar tender is wiping down the cooler and returns and sets them down before us on a house he says and goes back to counting the night's take it is odd is not it that we never ran into each other before this she says all these years you came up here to conquer and i stayed there inportsmith you've after the boys left frank's job was there yet well i guess fifty miles is a long way sometimes i as frank i asked realizing as soon as i say it that he was at least ten years older than she and is probably dead by now he died frank died in nineteen eighty too oh yes ism sorry to hear that i want to ask you something warren i hope you will not mind if i speak personally with you no shoot i take a belt from my drink i never dared to ask you then you would have embarrassed you the i thought because you were scared of what we were doing together in sure of yourself yet no kidding i was what twenty one you were well not scared but let us say impressive married with kids a sophisticated woman of the world you seem to me and i was is apprentice plumber working on my first job away from home a kid you were more than that warren that is why i took to you easily you were very sensitive i thought's some day you would become a famous actor i wanted to encourage you you did i laugh nervously because i do not know where this conversation is going and take another pull from my drink and say have done lots of acting over the years all local stuff some of it pretty serious no big deal but i kept it up i do not do much nowadays of course but you did encourage me gale you did and ism truly grateful for that she sips her sherry with purse lips a bird good she says warren were you a virgin then when you met me oh yes well that is that is quite a question is not it i laugh is that what you have been wondering all these years were you the first woman i ever made love with well that is haggle i do not think anybody's ever asked me that before and here we are thirty years later ism smiling at her but the air is rushing out of me i just want to now dear you never said it one way or the other we shared a big secret but we never really talked about our own secrets we talked about the theater and we had our little love affair and then you went on and i stayed with frank and grew old older you ware not old as old as you are now warren yet but ism not old well were you what a virgin you do not have to answer if it embarrasses you i hold off a few seconds the waitress and the new kid an the bar tender of all left and only the green is here perched on u stool in the bar watching night line i could tell her the truth or i could lie or i could beg off the question altogether it is hard to know what is right finally i say yes i was i was a virgin when i met you it was the first time for me i tell her and she sits back in her chair and looks me full in the face and smiles as if have just given her the perfect birthday gift the one no one else thought she wanted the the gift she never dared to ask for it is a beautiful smile grateful and proud and seems to go all the way back to the day we first mat she reaches over and places her small crackled hand on mine she says i never knew for sure but whenever i think back on those days and remember how we used to meet in your room i always pretend that for you it was the first time i even pretended it back then when it was happening it meant something to me for a few moments neither of us speaks then i break the spell what you say we shove off they need to closest place up and the snow's coming down hard she agrees and i help her slide into her coat my car is parked only half way down the block but it is a slow walk to it because the side walk is a little slippery and she is very careful when we are in the car and moving north on main street we remain silent for a while and finally i say to her gal there's something have wondered all these years myself is there yes but you do not have to tell me if it embarrasses you worn dear you reach a certain age nothing embarrasses you yet well i guess that is true what is it oh say i wondered if except for me you stayed faithful to frank and before me no hesitation she says yes i was faithful to frank before you and after except for my husband you were the only man i loved i do not believe her but i know why she his lied to me this time it is my turn to smile and reach over and place my hand on hers the rest of the way we do not talk except for her giving me directions to her son's house which is a plain brick ranch on a curving side street up by the old armory the porch light is on but the rest of the house is day it is late i say to her it is i get out and come around and help her from the car and then walk her up the path to the door she gets her key from her purse and unlocks the door and turns around and looks up at me she is not as tall as she used to me ism very happy that we saw each other to night she says we probably will not see each other again well we can if you want to you're still a very sweet man warn ism glad of that i was not wrong about you i do not know what to say i want to kiss her though and i do i lean down put my arms around her and kiss her on the lips very gently then little more and she kisses me back with just enough pressure against me to let me know that she is remembering everything too we whole each other that for a long time then i step away and she turns opens the door and takes one last look back at me shes smiles you still got make up on she says what is the play i forgot to ass oh i say thinking fast because ism remembering that she is catholic and probably does not think much of the masons hello i say that is nice and you are the moor yes still smiling she gives me a slow pushing wave with her hand as if dismissing me and goes inside driving home is all i can do to keep from crine times come times gone times never returning i say to myself what is here in front of me is all have got i inside and as i drive my cars through the blowing snow it does not seem much except for the kindness that have just exchanged with an old lady i

welcome to the superman ladponcas a science science space to ne i mender supermen and of a professor of neurobiology an opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day i have the pleasure of introducing doctor crew heller as my guest on the superman lad podcast doctor heller is a professor of biology and negro sciences at stamford his laboratory works on a range of topics including thermal regulation down centrum and circadian rhythms today we talk about thermal regulation how the body heats and cools itself and maintains what we call homeostasis which is an equilibrium of processes that keeps our neuron's healthy or organs functioning well and as doctor heller teaches us thermal regulation can be leverage in order to greatly increase our performance in athletics and mental performance as well learning to control your corody temperature is one of the most if not most powerful thing that you can do to optimize mental and physical performance regardless of the environment that you're in he also dispels many common myths about heating and cooling the body including the idea that putting a cold pack on your head or neck is the potable way to cool down quickly in fact as doctor heller tells us it actually can be counter productive and lead to hyper thermic it is a fascinating conversation from which i learned a tremendous amount of new information and we did not even get in to the other incredibly interesting work that doctor heller does on down drum and circadian rhythms and sleep its we hope to have him back in the future to discuss those topics as you will soon see doctor heller is a wealth of knowledge on all things human physiology biology and human performance it is no surprise then that he is bee chair of the biology department at stamford for many years as well as director of the human biology program if your interested in human biology and how to improve your performance in any context or setting athletic or otherwise i think you will very much enjoy to day's conversation before we begin it'd t emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching an research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cosmic consumer information about science and since related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd tho thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens athletic greens is an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand an twelve son delighted that their sponsoring the podcast therereason i started taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athletigreens once or twice a day is that it helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which our vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called up microfilm and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essential with every biological system relevant to health throughout or brain and body with out lentic greens i get the vitamins i need the minerals i need and the phobics to support my microbic if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock come slash supermen and claim a special offer hell give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin d three k too therefore ton of stand ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if wore getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient incitement three and k too is also important because it regulates things cardiovascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic greenstone come slash supermen to claim the special offer of the i free travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar have talk many times before on this pod cast about the key roll of hydration and electrolytes for nerve sell function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium and potassium present in the preparation all of those cells function properly and all our bodily system can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the preparations of electrolytes if you to try element you can go to drink element that is element do come slash supermen and you will get a free element sample pack with your purchase there all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to element element do come slash superman and now for my discussion with doctor crag heller great to have you here good to be here patsies been a long time coming i know that i and many people have a lot of questions about the use of cold one of the things that happened in recent years is that for many reasons people have become interested in things taking cold showers and taking ice baths for many different purposes sometimes this is introduce as just a general health tonic but other times people get specific about how it can improve brazilin or it can improve one's metabolism could you just tell me a little bit about what happens when i get into a cold shower were an ice bath what are some of the basic responses at the level of metabolism ovary psychologically we do not know exactly it will very from person of person but what happens when i submerge myself into an ice bath if have never done it before well first of all you get a tremendous shock and what that is going to translate into is a bit of a shot of a adrenalin and i think this is really the called benefit but i would not call it a benefit of the cry chambers you go into a riot chamber and it is a shocks or get a shot of a adrenalin sure you gan to feel different when you come out you have gat a shot of a drennalan but it does not necessarily translate into any benefit in terms of your physiology your performance and forth now if you take a cold bath or cold shower a couple things are happening one is you are going to stimulate azo constriction if anything it is going to make a little more difficult for your body to get rid of heat because you are shutting off your avenues of heat loss if you are in a true cold bath the over all surface are of your body is great that it does not matter if you vassal constricted you are still going to loose heat one vizir constriction the constriction of is it calories vessels and arteries all constrict or just one or to well this is an area of controversy in general when people talk of as of constriction they talk of the over all skin surface and that is not true the primary sites of heat loss which we are going to get into are the palms of your hands the souls of your feat and the upper part of your face and the reason these are avenues for heat loss is there underlain by special blood vessels and these blood vessels are able to shunt the blood from the arteries which coming from the heart directly to the veins which are returning to the heart and by passing the capillaries which are the nutritive vessels but high resistance you can tell when you shake some one's hand what his are her thermal statuses the hands hot or its cold feeling that an and of the reason why humans evolved this practice of a shaking hand assessing each others level of anxiety we all know that a limp handshake is pretty a indicative of something and a firm hand shake is indicatives of something as is the crushing hand shake for that matter i really do not know what the evolutionary origin of handshaking is other than to get your hand away from your weapon perhaps like but couple questions before we get into the specialized a a vascular compartments on the souls the palms and and the upper face a you mention who body immersion into an ice bath or very cold water up to the neck versus a cold shower is it is there something fundamentally different about those two besides the fact that they both provide the release of a adrenalin is there anything that is that really important to understand about the difference in the physiological response evoked by by cold shower verses immersion in cold well there are differences that are more physical than anything else if you are in a cold bath and you are still you develop a boundary layer if you are in a shower you cannot develop a boundary kid you explain when the boundary layers yes if you it is best to explain it in terms of a hot bath was everybody's experience that you get into a hot bath and o my god it is really hot almost painful and then you sit down and eventually it does not feel hot any more because the still water which is close to your skin is coming into equilibrium with your skin it is having a blanket on you or an insulator on you and then if you move around you disturb that still water layer you feel the hot temperature again i see if i were to get into a cold ice bath or very cold beta body of water of some kind and stay still it'd likely feel warmer at least until i her you are not going to be losing as much heat i see rind then when i m move all around o flail around then you are going to lose party got it but i think getting back to your original question about benefits a you have to keep in mind whether you are talking about aerobic activity or anerobic activity if you are referring to performance and exercise and forth if you are doing aerobic activity that you can sustain for a long time your production of heat is rising gradually and is being distributed throughout your body eventually your body temperatures going to come up to a level that is going to impair your performance the benefit of a cold bath or a cold shower before heroic activity is you increase the capacity of your body mass to absorb that excess heat i we could you say that on in a in a rough sense that a pro to call that one might use if they con a head out for a a long run even on a reasonably warm day not not super hot one maybe it is super hot would be to take a cool shower before they go run would that be benefit shore it will take them longer to get to the sweat point and to heat up and what will that translate you in terms of a pet worm you increase your well could increase your speed or depends on how you use that benefit some people are pacers they will go at the same pace and then they will go farther or some people are a what is a pacers and regulators and and no pacers or forces they will take that advantage and use it up as fast as they can they will go faster but not necessarily farther i see as far as i know not many athletes at least notions that i know are getting into cool bodies water taking cold showers before they had out to train but it sounds there to be a real performance benefit there it could be a benefit i know a we are going to talk about our acknowledge it for cooling but at one point a i do not know f they are using it now but are cross country team when they would go to compete in a very hot place they would do their warm up exercises they are stretching then they would extract heat before the beginning of the race they i to think of it is you have greater scope for heat absorption interesting about how long a would one need to take one of these showers are cold immersions be foreheading out for run roughly speaking we do not have to get into details because everyone is performance level and regiment as can be different where they live as going to be different et camera it is not as long as you think it is minutes couple minutes yet for because what is going to happen is a as your your temperature goes down you will eventually shut off your heat loss and that heaps it from going below normal you can if your if you warmed up and your temperature has risen by half a degree let say i does not take more than a few minutes to extract that heat if your lasso dilated interesting and what about for the anerobic the the strength alright for the anerobic the and let us say they are doing several several they are doing several sets and how many reps whatever they are doing they are your temperature enough on arise at fast because it is only certain muscles which are being used but the temperature of those muscles will go up it is a local effect it is a local effect my let let us forsake of to day of made for this discussion less if we assume that the a basic work out even though people do variation on this is five sets of five or ten sets of ten for those listening it would be o five sets of ten a five rap repetitions or ten sets of ten repetitions ten by ten five give five no if somebody lets ay is doing a a large body compound movement barbell squats where there they are lot of large body movements impinging in its et camera a but for instance the the biceps are not they are involved but more less indirectly right the fact is going to be to heat up the quadriceps heat up the hand strings heat up the gluts this con o thing right i see and then during rest that heat will leave the muscle but it is not fast and certainly the heat cannot leave the muscle very fast while you are working out because when the muscle contracts it squeezes the blood vessels and the only way heat gets out of a muscle is in the blood and your muscle metabolism can go up fifty or sixty fold during anerobic activity that means the heat production in the muscle goes up fifty or sixty fold the blood flow to that muscle cannot go up fifty or sixty for you literally have the capacity to cook your muscles come this is probably in proper time is a mention briefly what the underlying mechanism of this is could you just we wire return to the specifics of what one can do to mitigate this heating up but am could music plain the relationship between energy production a t p and private kines and the role of heat there sure am we do not get something for nothing a steam engine most of the energy in our food is lost as heat we are roughly about twenty per cent of ancient of the energy that we take in in our food about twenty per cent of that can go into doing work and the rest of it is lost is heat now we are mama's we use that heat to keep our body temperature considerably above the environment but if you raise body temperature a few degrees higher you are in trouble that is hyperthermia individual muscles can reach hypothermic limits before you might experience it in the whole body to keep you from damaging your muscle by hyperthermia we have failsafe mechanisms and one of those failsafe mechanisms is an endgame which is critical for getting fuel other words the results of metabolism of glucose getting that fuel into the mitochondria which is making our major coinage of energy exchange e t p that particular ensile is temperature sensitive when the muscle temperature gets above thirty nine or thirty and five it shuts off and that essentially shuts off the fuel supply to the mitochondria that is when you cannot do one more wreck f you failure could we say that muscle one n one component o muscular failure is over heating of the massive locally red probe the other things too a well if you aft you lack oxygen but our oxygen delivery is pretty good to the to to the muscle if you run out of locos ya that is going to impair you but the most immediate the most immediate impairment of muscle activity muscle fatigue in other words is the rise in temperature of the muscle am i want to talk about how that muscle fails locally but i this burning question in my mind that i cannot seem to answer for myself ism hoping you can answer t for me et say ism doing a five sets of five with squats i hit muscular failure at a given weight and according to what i now know it is my quadrsaps and the muscles associated men with the squat that if file because of this heat triggering this mechanism trigger by heat that shuts off the muscle but my biceps are nice and cool ere tell me they are at they are they are not doing too much work it is only indirect works why is it that i cannot set the the bar down in the squat rat walk over and do barbell curls with the same intensity that i could if i were to do those barbell cornels fresh we had not having done anything prior well you will still have a fatigue curve with the earth upper body and that will be influenced by any rising temperature that has been generated by your lower body exercise temperature in both cases is the limiting factor it is we one a limiting factor it is one limiting i find that amazing i find then amazing because i always thought naively that the reason muscles fail is because we quote do not have the strength to do another repetition thought it is the you lack likeagin or some ability to access that glikagen but of course we still have glakagen o it is navy for me to think that because if i wait three minuteman go back i can do those repetition r gan the glikeagen was not restored in that three minutes i obviously it was there right i realize there might be other mechanisms involved sounds heat is if not the dominant mechanism that prevents more work it is one of them it is one of them and it is of quick one it is a fast one it can happen with lets say you are a really experienced weight lifter you may be doing very very highlights with sets of five or six yet to be clear for the audience ism not doing very highways not particularly strain not superweek bile not particularly strong but crews referring in the general sense too it to you it why why is it that if i finish a set of squats i cannot simply cool off my quadriceps by throwing a nice cool towel on my quadriceps why would wise that not the best way to go about it because your body surface is a very good insulator cay we we think we do not have fur and therefore were not insulated but the skin the pasha the teethe muscles under death underneath that there all very good insulators and that is why i said earlier that the way the heat gets out of the muscle is in the blood i want a step through a couple other portals by which one might think that heating and cooling would be ideal and then get back to the sure special ice surfaces on tithe hands the feet in the face if throwing a cold towel or ice even ice cold towel on my quadriceps is not gin a work are standing in front of the fan because ism insulated from that cool i cannot cool off my blood fast enough what about drinking sixteen ounces of ice water sure you can do that you can calculate how much heat that can absorb and you cannot continue drinking leaders of ice water you are going to dilute your you are blood and have other problems but yes it will help sure it will help but it is not does not have the the full capacity you will need what about an ice pack to the back of my neck or to my head r saying the cold sponge over the head i ism deliberately moving through these options because these are the ones that we see most oft and were actual just watching the olympic track and feel trial yet last night pinole again ism a huge track and field fan and om there were lot of i there were lot of ponies on the backs of backs am before and between and after events and am how good is that or how poor is that as a strategy since now we know that being over heated locally and systemically throughout the body is is a serious limiting factor on performance but you have to understand something about our thermal regulatory system we have a thermostat just you have a thermostat in your house and that thermostat is in the brain eh do we know the specific side yes yes it is called the peptic anterior hypothalamus it does many things in terms of physiological regulation but it serves as a thermostat now that thermostat has to have information it has to have in put where does that then put come from it comes from our over all body surface where we sent temperature one of the things that can happen when you are over heated is that you can send in a cold stimulus to your thermostat and that sort of running to cool your house by putting a wet washcloth over your thermostat no it is it is doing the wrong thing we have actually had experiences where we have had people exercising getting over heated and then cooling the body surface and they say i feels great this is fantastic and their your temperatures going out i think this is such an important point for so wat i i was wand in a laboratory where there were always battles over the temperature in the lands people were always putting ice tacks on thermostats for putting hands towards thermostats and trying to play this game good to know we were all being foolish am you've though were gerbil just m putting a cold towel over my torso we are putting ice on the back of my upper back you are saying could actually heat up my for it it at least decrease your heat loss your rate of heat loss as work you are going to raise yes sou a little later i know and that is a natural portals for heat loss you can think of the natural porters portals for heat loss as our air conditioners eh the thermostats in the brain and the information from the thermos to the thermostat is coming from the over all body surface what can happen if you let us say cool the torso with an ice tass you can actually cause azo constriction of your portals your heat lost portals that is what impairs the rate at which your losing are not feels good now back to the head that is really interesting the major blood flow to the brain comes up four arteries through the neck a there's the corroded arteries in there is the repeal arteries when you put a cold towel around the neck you are going to be putting a cold stimulus into the brain well that is great for protecting the brain you won't protect the brain but it is also going to make you feel cooler than you are you will think you are ready to go again quickly when you have just essentially a cooled the thermostat this is an important point and there is a lot of interest nowadays and people doing marathons and tear even som you'll do these altars alter rounding which i guess is everything longer than a marathon and go and go postman standing last man last woman standing kind of things you are saying that if somebody is hypothermic they could trick themselves into subjectively thinking that they are cooling off but i count go cross and that they can go further but their brain could cook well if they stop the cooling then that hot blood from the body cops going to go to the brain interesting well many a it is a bit of a of a tension but many people report after long bouts of exercise or even just very intense bouts of exercise feeling a kind of brain fog or mental fatigue i i assume t at that was due to lowered brain oxygenation post exercise but is it possible that there is some post exercise effects on heating and cooling of the brain that might impact cognition or i should say negatively impact cognition it is certainly possible because we know that a arising temperature decreases cognitive capacity you can experience at yourself you get wont a treadmill they would follow your temperature and then just do a simple activity adding in subtracting you get to about thirty nine degrees you cannot do that any more you cannot just calculate hell how long you have been on the treadmill that the phrase cool common collected is come fact that is the gull in in all pursuits straight i want to talk about these portals ecauseyou have mention them a few times before i ask about what the portals are exactly and how they work and how they can be lavish for performance i just there is a question that mi neurobiologiself cannot resist but ask we have this thermostat n the preopticarea of the hypothalamus which is interesting to me that great the medial peptic areas also one that is known to be a sexually dimorphic dependent on testosterone exposure early in life or et camera although am people should just note that it is not actually testosterone that creates these sexual dimorphism these difference is actually testosterone converted into estrogen a that rectally estrogen is the effector a which is fascinating none the less we have got this area that acts is a thermostat and you said it is collecting information from the whole body does that mean that there are pathways as the neral scientists you you and i refer to them as these these afferent or input pathways from the body to the peptic area is there a map of our body in the preopticaria cause that yet i have to m aging that you cannot have the information just coming from the left shoulder just from the right to it sounds you need a pretty probably a pretty crude map but that you need a complete map of the body surface thereat you do not need a complete map in the hypothalamus mean that thermal afferent information you mention it also goes to the symadisan's my cortex if an ice cube has touched you on the back but that does not new barely translate into a change in lets say you are shivering or or sweating the information it is going to the hypothalamus is more integrated representation of of body temperature it sort of an average of what is is an asset log if i were to let say i get hot on a hot day and a policies when we are summer can yet and wen to a sports camp and you're here actually and we run around crazy n than we get into the shade if we could but were you know possibles rainfarucles ore kids were putting ice cubes down each other a sheets or somthan a but that is an average because other parts of the body are not expose the mouth is exposed to the ice in the physical case are the the cold cubes are in the hands as you said it feels really good it feels but it sounds it its feels deceptively good because in reality it still be quite warm internally absolutely ye person yet you can feel great and have a dangerously hypothermic temperature but i should say that when you get into the dangers o things get bedfast what are some of the symptoms that people could be on the lookout for for hyper tor me essentially it is it is almost ironic that if individuals are transfer transitioning into heat stroke they actually azo constrict and they stop sweating and that is a pathological situation i i could not begin to explain it but essentially you are just feeling exhausted your feeling a miserable a the heart rate is very high your heart rate goes up as your your temperature goes up called cardiac drift you just feel rotten but that is why since since it is not an it is not a danger signal hat you can translate immediately into do ism going into heat stroke that is why people can overcome their bad feeling with motivation to continue going to work harder there have been a number of my profile athletic deaths do to heat stroke that were doing practice not competition when people are really trying to but in practice which shows they were just motivated to push let us talk about these magnificent portals that not just humans but other animals mammals are equipped death i if putting cold on the neck or on the head or on the torso is not optimal i what is optimal and i maybe walk us through a they as to why we would have these portals located where they are and then we can talk about how one might leverage them for performance where the portals are are in the glabrous skin big word ka glamorous just means no hair it is the hairless skin you say well ism most of my body is without hair no your most your body has hair folicals we are camels mammals have fur we have lost the for but we still have those that hairy skin fend type all over our body except except for those skin surfaces where are mammal relatives did not have fur the pads of the feet and for the primates air part of the face for rabbits no portions of the ears the inner surface boners for bears and of the tongue bars have big tongues fugetungs an don know that either and in thaclass the maria a picking match with a born the via anyway am our mammaopmemalian relatives cant lose heat over their over all body surface probably very early on and mamelon evolution they evolved these special blood vessels in the limited surface areas that do not have fur and as i said what these blood vessels are are shunts between the arteries in the veins arteries in veins are both low resistance vessels you can have high flow rate capillaries which normally are between arteries in veins are high resistance because they are very tiny is it is it fair to say that i what i was taught is that blood flows blunt from arteries then to capillaries and then to veins again back to the heart it sort of from the heart through arteries then through these little capillaries which like little lesstoaries and streams and then to the veins back to the heart is that is that generally ana lucky to what i learn in basic physiologist still still i would not i would not get an a in your class no maybe a the ears the but not enough a that is excellent o and you are saying in this glabrous or beneath the glabyra skin there are these shunt and those go directly from arteries to vein we you mu skip the the alleys is and ins actually is on i as i say that in the skin you know when i feel the pads of my hands how deep to the surface do these do these vessels real they are below the obviously i the sure that the the epidermis also if you are worm and you look at yous palmer hands they are fairly red the babier hands are you do not have these vessels in the baiter hands now if you take a a glass a water tumbler right and you grab it you can see if you squeeze a little bit the hand goes white that is because you have shut off that blood flow no interesting i want yo that little comic sir if you are bicycling on a hot day you do not want to be grabbing your handlebars all the time you want a periodically well this is important i know you of you are a privy to some really amazing results that were in a talk about but i actually heard you say this during this lecture recently of that staffer held about a human performance that we but we are both part of and you mention this that if your cycling and you are working hard and you want to be able to do more work it we now know why you want to remain cool in order to continue to do work and if you get too warm that is bad that gripping the handlebars too tightly will actually limit your performance right and that is probably also true on the relation or any other cold i bi for the she or or any like that right loosen the grip or if you safely can one t actually expose your hand it is to the world now what about for people wearing gloves what but the to me that just seems crazy based on everything you are telling me well gloves definitely impede heat loss from the hands just as folks impede heat loss from the feat if you want a maximize your heat loss you want to have as thin of protectors as possible on your hands and course the feet er more problematical because he have to be using them in certain way some people run barefoot well yoathat is at that is become somewhat popular it seems a con i came and when they have those those things but they looked ridiculous that i think most people just we are willing to take the performance hindrance of regular shoes actual be had a tractcoacher at standard who for a while was famous for introducing a training with out chose running interest and he thought it was because it changed the posture of runner and i think it was true to the fact that it was increasing the capacity of his runners to lose heat interesting ya meeting up at the level of the hands obviously gan hinder performance if i can have with running i notice om i ran cross country briefly in high school and and not particularly well at that but that we were told to run as if we were holding in a crackers in our in our fingers or something very lightly and to keep hands kindly stop running this would actually be more benefic can performance then r then we are gripping a throne which is probably what mirth people are doing now i icomiht are interesting and i once it'll tell you the e experience i had once i was in plasma in the winter and i went out running and i absent minded forgot gloves and i realize this f er a short period running because the backs of my hands were aching from the cold the palms of my hands were sweating and were hot ho making amazing these compartments are a real thing and you mention the upper half of the fails that is where our primate ancestors do not have fur and the bottoms of our feet a let us just take a moment talk about some of them or amazing results that have been associated with proper cooling of these glazer skin surfaces a let me introduce one more thing short of as you asked earlier about the pouring of water on the head it one of the things which is not appreciated fully is that the blood which is refusing these special blood vessels in the face above the beard line that is the nondairy skin that blood then returns in the venue supply to the hart but it actually does it in a very strange way it actually goes through what are called a blocking on the name tow think your time these are blood vessels that go through the skull it and that is why the scout bleeds lot if you cut cut the scout and these blood vessels which are called what is a emergent but it is not emergent it is a word that means leaving an these blood vessels were primarily thought to be ways that blood is leaving a the brain but when you are over heated the direction of flow in those blood vessels reverses the cool blood that is coming from your facial region goes into that circulation and actually is a cooling source for the brain you can cool the brain you can have a cooling effect on the brain by pouring water on on your head interesting that practice which we at least for me i most commonly associate with a combat sports were some one the fighter goes to their corner they usually sit down on a on a stool unless they are trying to a i do some mental a warfare from the corner in which case they they do not even take a seat and that there a corner crew will will squeeze a a glove a excuse me a son full of cold water over the ear a that you are saying is somewhat effective in cooling the brain it is one of the natural mechanisms for a cooling the brain i want to return to this at some point as well but is there any known benefit to cooling the brain in terms of offsetting physical damage offsetting the negative effects of concussion because one of the reasons why a fighters will stand get a a cool on the back in a cold bite on the back of the back er on the head is not just to cool them down but the theory is that it might offset some of the damage of anurans a i just cannot comment on that i am aware of those ideas but their controversial one of the things that you want to do for injury to the brain is to decrease swelling and one of the ways that you decrease swelling in many parts of the body is too cool a a it it decreases inflammation that decreases the blood flow youknow i i think it is a really interesting topic and at something that should be investigated akindhard to investigate yet am interesting ones i hear these stories and have seen the data i believe the stories a maybe tell us a story about an observation that your group has made with respect to anerobic exercise and he and this prop and proper a cooling of the these glamorous surfaces and wen talk about the technology am maybe give us the dips example first e g corse that nothing most people familiar with dips here staid i guess get raisin lower your a raising over your body raisin lower your by mass usually with your legs dangling down sometimes people strong enough to attach a weight there and they will do it is essentially i compound upper body exerciserigh am one dip would not be particularly impressive for most people a hundred would be very impressive am twenty would be impressive for some et camera what happens whens a skilled they comes in and does dips for multiple sets and then what happens when they cool properly using the glamorous skin surfaces a this was a story that occurred early on in our investigations when we first made the discoveries that cooling has a benefit to increase your work volume your capacity to do more reps i the word got over i think to the forty miners camp and one of their players grew clerk who was a tight end at the time he had been tight end at standard a he decided or i do not know if he was asked or what a to come over and check it out a grew came over and we said great what are you would at what what ex activity do you to do he said dips i can do a lot of dips i can do forty dips in a first set and i can probably do five set sets a usual work out for me and said o we he came over to the him one day and that is exactly what he did he did forty dips first set and than maybe twenty five and fifteen and no down down do you recall roughly what kind of rest periods he was taking between yet we we since we we standardized the respire to three minutes because that is what we had set on for cooling as the untruths a good long restperied yet it it is a lot is got yet it is usually a longer rest period than many a people would per up during work use they want to make them no me o tower to take as much at as ta fossil gan several days later he came back and his first set he did i think may be forty two a little bit better but now people were standing round watching there was a little impetus there don't show off so then is second set was i do not remember the numbers but very much above the second set on the control day this was after we cooled his socage we does allies when is he doing quit the cooling he is he is sitting down and putting his hands in the devices that we had built which were cooling the palms of his hands for how long does that cooling take can he do it inside of a three minute rest pye that is what we were tout we standard ice the o go the interval for resting or cooling a to three minutes o cat but the the point is he got to his fifth set and he and all of the sets were above what he had done on the previous day and he said am not tired i can do another set and then i can do another set i can do another set i can do another set from one day to two or three days later with cooling he doubled the total work volume he doubled the total number of dips by adding more sat and more repetitions to i set right then he kept coming back a for four more weeks a twice a week and by the end of that month he was doing three hundred dips also what present he tripled he trembled and tripled as to here is here is a professional athlete at pique physical conditioning and he triples a may what he can do amazing and in terms of his ability to recover am did was that explored or disguise at all am because minor standing is that if we cause enough stress to a muscle during anerobic training we provide the stimulus for compensatory regrowth et camera but if we do more work we sensually scale up the mount of recovery that is needed or the recovery time ism a very curious about weather not he needed longer to recover between these superperforming work out that is very interesting that was a major discovery which we did not realize we were making at the time there is this phenomenon your referring to as delayed on set muscle soreness does and this is due to those little microtaires and forth that ark happening as we extend our work out capacity volume e we have had this experience many times that an athlete or any one will come in to the lab and they will exceed but their previous goals were their previous expectations and i can always see the words coming out of their mouth ism going to be sore to morrow they never are interest and we have actually demonstrated that with a naive group we had a class a physical conditioning class and a we had half of them at the first days of the class we had to establish there true capacity what they could do this were pretty heavy work outs for these new recruits and a we gave half of teethe benefit of cooling and the other have not and then we had them record their subjective levels of delayed on set muscle ones and they those that were cool did not have significant muscle soreness amazing and i know there also published result and we will provide links to some of these papers for people in seeing similar effects a i should say similar performance enhancing effects using m bench presses i bench pass or pushups or other other sorts of things maybe could give us an example from the realm of endurance work or or a robin work a running cycling things of that sort well one of the problems we for us is that our equipment now is not really portable i mean it is portable in the sense you can carry it to the him or to the football field be you not in to run but other run with him a for we r bicycle with all the wen or the cooling handles on bicycles ye that would be that would be good but one one i tolerant activity is golfing people have put it on their golf carts and the that will really heat up that much ingulf they do not to to be disparaging in the golfers but the way i thconceptionalized golf it is a swing and then a walk and then a and then a cart ride and then a meal i probably just offended all the golfers out there well we what one time we had we were doing work for the for the a department of defense and they wanted to check it out whether not what we were doing was really worth while they sent out a team of special a special of soldiers to be our subjects tested out they were here for a week they that was a fun we it there do some work with those guise there they are hard driving ya the they also of an bree at they they deftly have if they have an off er as quits which it is buried deep within their nervous system they do not to hit that that quits witch the guy who wrote the final report he gave an addendum to the report he said well it'll tell you this after have gotten home it is added that techno they took the technology with them wanted to tell ya that is that sounds of bar i and and using it it as added twenty yards to every club in my bag and that is no eimsmall west it is blowing people to hit for the get the golf all further interest you'll right for the for the a golf an players out there and the it then nod that is the that is a reward to get back from crag for all my m my little knocks on golf she i do not have any knock on gold i just do not think about it as a sport where meeting up is a limiting factor since they are getting more more out of their drive what is what he thinks going on there well they can be heating up and there was not been out right they are wert got one a hot day and he the forth but let me just tell you one more serious a story about golfers and that is individuals with multiple sorosis or exceedingly temperature sensitive i did not know they may still be mobile abut they have to stay in cool locations and not increase their exercise to any great extent but we have had a subjects that have with multiposcorosas who just essentially put the device on their golf cart near back out playing golf in the middle of the summer o that is great that is great do anything the allows people to have normal levels right of om livelihood and om and recreation is great we always thing about performance as the at these kind of pain o we levels and on pushing harder but anything they lots people to be to be mob rig function was great what is your favored example of endurance and feel free to give us the extreme one and them we will talk about averages at am to be you t make sure we are thorough about averages verses exceptions right we have not done a lot in feel been out out doors a most of our endurance has been in a hot room w treadmill work and forth the very first experiment we had i think may be eighteen subjects just off the street may we just recruited people in the always come on in and do this and what were found is we could for this group with one trial with am without cooling we could double their endurance walking on the tread mill walking up hill in the treadmill in the heat may be forty degrees can be in temperature forty to recentigrate what is that experiment look your having people walk on and incline it is really warm some people a just can a hit the quit but an and say have had enough and get off the tread mil it with proper cooling when are they doing the cooling there they are doing it continuously i see because in the laboratory we can suspend devices from the ceiling for example now we do have prototype wearable devices we did them ain response to meals from a bola workers a number of years ago in a sierra lean they said we have read about your work with assets cannot you do something for us and we are in the personal protective gear and we cannot be in the hormone for more than fifteen or twenty minutes that was started us on the a challenge of developing wearable systems that could go under the p p e a were published that work now that is great were non nothing the military special operators that are out in the desert and other locations are provably excited about this technology well once they get on thin petit is command that is it is coming ye i think some people might wonder if they are all these studies and there these incredible results over the years a why have not we heard more about in i will ask your opinion on that as well but all just editorialize a but s that the the best laboratory work an it is practical applications oftentimes requires many studies and oftentimes there is not a portal to speak a to get that information out into the technology sector s there is it a company that is developing this technology for people to use a wright to purchase in years ism we mights whet just tell us now what is the name of that company and and do they have a website people a on want to know a where can they get this magical technology and and is there a poor man's version of it as well well the company arterial a r t e r i a and the website is w w w dot cool it dot come cool it is just c o o l m i t to go it not come it is a great website when i went there it says that right now the technology is only available to professional sports teams in military is that truewell where we stand now is a the new version of the technology is sort of inmate at test versions we got it into the hands of people who had use the technology before there is a animal a teamster using that there is a a college teamsters a limits there is the a navy seal a a major d baseball the end a a the national tennis association they have locations where now they are trying this out and reporting back house at working how could you change it how could you improve it great and forth that is that is where we are but on the website you can actually sign up for being one who will be able to get one when they are finally manufactured they are now being made in fairly small lots because you want o change things sure realize how it can be improved yet this is stamford after all you want it get the technology right i i to joke that a one of the reads i liking it stamford much is that not only are my colleagues amazing and there forward thinking but they are all perfectionists and that the perfection is mind that is it has to be perfect before i can go go live to speak who think there will be a lot of interest let us talk about the technology in a lite more detail for a moment and then what's talk about whether not cruder forms of that technology exist either for sake of safety and or performance what is am the the cool men as i understand is it it is a it is a it it is a glove and h put your hand into u you hold on to a surface and that surface u cools you cools your hand and write thereby through this o specialize a portal coolest your corody temperature and all all the muscles of the body subjectively if i were to do this right ow would i think that it was ice cold or would i think it was just cool just cool i see ice cold is too cold people always ask why cannot you just stick your hand in a bucket of ice water it is too cold what that does is that causes reflects of as o constriction of the very portals that you are trying to maximize the heat loss from you stick your and in cold water and when it comes out it is cold you just sealed up all the heat era are o right what i sort of recommended to someone at one point they said well when i am running can i just carry a frozen juice can and it will gradually melt i said well know because that is going to decrease the heat loss from that head but if every couple minutes you switched hands that it might work well i have a feeling that there are people now doing that well i trying trying this a how long in in the cool it at the proper tater a how long a are people putting their hands into the it but we once again had just standardized on three minutes and part of the reason for that is that the heat law the rate of heat loss is an exponentially declining curve and three minutes sort of gets the best part of the curve you can go longer and get more benefit but the biggest bang for the buck is in the first too three minutes you mention a number of impressive organization sports steams in military that are using this this is not something that i typically see on the side lines of games although to be ass i have n looked very carefully a ism guessing that there are probably keeping the technology somewhat under wraps where and how are they doing this of they running back to the locker room i mean that the military speciaoppars are doing there thing but interns of the athletes a is it possible hypothetically the athletes are doing this am somewhat in incognito i it is possible but i really do not know a people have mentioned here at standard a they do not see the football team using it well the football team here at afford as mostly playing in cold weather cool weather night games are cool even date games are not very hot frequently here but when they go to a hot place arizonare you tall at least our coach a shaw says that they take it with them and that when they find the benefits when they use i interesting is there a poor persons a poor men are woman's version of this you mention the juice can passing back and forth you mention cooling the hands a number of people said to me after learning a little bit about this science and technology that they have experience some big effects a positive of facts of of cooling by and i confess have done this digging i i a package of frozen blueberries an you con passing back and were but you ma hands now t alkingto you i realize i probably did not do it long enough i proud was i was only doing maybe thirty seconds passing it back and forth between my hands and then going back into says i did see a performance enhancing e fact if absolutely but i realize i probably was not optimizing the photo call if you were going to give a u a crude photo call for let us us to say for the him because with running it is a little bit tricky but what would that look if people want just play with this i in some sort of fashion well that it yet i it is would be experimental sure and yet none of that is can very controlled your idea frozen peas is a good idea and i think since there is been no actual study of that you would have to be you working out what is the best for you but one way to figure it out is that if after you hold the cold pease in one hand and you switch it o the other hand if some one then comes and feels your hand is it warmer cold if it is cold it means you vase constricted if it is warm it means the hot blood is still going there we do that in the lav and the key is for its to novas a constrict right o ki there is a last out there folks if you in to try this in kind of crude fashion at least until the a the cool it is available more broadly to the general public you could a sass you want a sass weather not the your palm's actually feel cool to the touch by somebody else tour and if it does that means you you have essentially shut down the porter your sealing in more night which is bad what about putting this cold pack of some sort on the face or or the feet more the feet i work out at home i i do not often work out barefooted but i suppose i could they did in the seventies in those get were walking around and without shoes in squatting without you a without any shoos or stocks on could i put my feet on them you you could if you has simply had a water profuse pad and you were circulating cool water through it i you could just put your feet on it part of the problem is it you do not want if let us say you have just a cold pack of something the problem is back to boundary layers again if you do not have a convect of stream of the cooling medium the heat sink is not as effective because they'll be a boundary layer developed between the heat sink material and your skin a that decrease is it is it is efficacy i see a may you just for a moment talk about convection a radiation in convection and just make that clear if i put my hands let us it is a cold night and a met a camp fire and i take my hands and i put them out to the fire there getting radiation you are getting radiation in i rid and and then if it is a windy warm night not get enough that is the that is example give us ha good example of convection a convection saris is in a cool breeze yon the windchill faitor that is do to convection but in terms of heat transfer between two objects if you have convection of the medium whether it is blood on the inside and water on the outside you increase the heat exchange if you have convection on both side right this is why just planting my feet on to o packages affront my bare feet on two packages frozen piece there is really no opportunity for circulation roll any in therefore he transfers it is not really optimal which is i and i b once again it depends on the surface area to get any benefit at all we have a study t we published a which was investigating the standard treatment for hyperthermia in the field and the standard treatment the the is recommended by medical organizations is you take cold packs and you put them in the axial the groin the axial the rathe rathe arm pay arm pits you have the groin which is thin skin lots of asciclatur r and he and the neck what we did is we did studies in which we made people hypodermic and then we measured the rate at which we could cool them by putting those positions in the it those heat exchange bags in the recommended location verses on the labor skin versus palm sols an face the the cooling rate was double we we put the same ice packs the same cold packs on the ahead mortals rather than a the axial the groin in the face well are the neck well face hands and bottoms of feet will cool you twice as fast that were putting my cold packs into your arm pits your groin or back of neck i to give the analogy of if your car is over heating and you have a hose garden hose where should you spray your cooling system should you spray the radiator or should you spray the tubes going in and out of the radiator well the rational pul putting these cold packs in the axil at the groin in the neck is that you are getting close to the major arteries sure that is going to be effective but it is much more effective if you actually increase the heat lost capacity of the radiating surface the radiators you cool the hot stuff heading toward the for that that is essentially what the standard operating procedure is that you hit the arteries amid the veins arteries in veins ain't just tell a be story that om illustrates how almost everybody gets this stuff wrong and bummest as an opportunity to ask you about heating deliberate heating as opposed to deliberate cooling about four months ago a friend o mine at incidentally a a guy who did nine years in the seal teams really skilled cold water swimmer we went out for swimming the morning a ism not nearly i even close to the being in the same universe of his a out put potential we do these swims ism familiar with them i got enough blubber on me that ism stay warm enough in the cold pacific nowt suits we do the morning cult cold swim for about a mile or and we brought with us a i young kid that i know real well that hangs out with us sometimes an trains with us who is got very little body fat he is just exceptionally lean despite eating everything inside right teen age great at the great kid great swimmer we are out there swimming and at some point we are talking him in it is clear that he is gone hypothermic he is learn his words he is not doing while we get him on to the beach his teeth are turning yellow he is quaking he is not he is got am you his saliva is taking on that consistency that is clear take he is type hermit we go the lifeguard station lifeguard says oke let us get his vitals lets do all this meanwhile trying stand next to him and heat him up by heating up his torso wit there we are pressing against this guy our friend trying to heat him up they get a blanket on him he is ism realizing he was barefoot his face was exposed although we did cover his head with the blanket and he eventually came back we got some warm liquids into him and he was oke he was fine i none this mother is ever inlet him swim with us again a if if i ever disappear and go missing it is because of that incident anyway ah he did great he recovered he is back in the water and doing well but i realize that pretty much everything from the point where we got back on the beach until he was backed an normal was we did incorrectly we heated as torso we left his extremities exposed and we bassoon we were doing the right thing and the life guard is a skilled life guard at a major public beach i guess the simple question is did we get everything wrong did we get anything right and what would have been the better option to heat up a hypothermic person in that or similar situation wellies interesting you asked that because that is the way we got into this area of investigation a i worked on how the hypothalamus regulates body temperature neral physiology and one day we were having a discussion with a colleague in the department of ataraxia and ta he jokingly said to my collar he said i you guy thinkyou ow much about temperature i bet you could not solve a problem we have in the recovery room what is that well the patients come out of surgery their hypothermic and it takes us hours to get them to stop shivering what do they do in the recovery room exactly what you suggest ad they put in warm blankets they put an heat lamps and it takes them an hour or two hours to get these patients to stop shivering to bring them back up so we say out's a trivial problem no it is a hard problem it is a hard problem because when your under anesthesia your vara dilated when you come out of anesthesia your hypothermic and you vast constrict that makes it very difficult to get heat into the body we got the idea well if we could just take one appendix an arm and we put it in a a environment wrapped in a heating pad and a negative pressure your suction that would pull more blood into that limb that blood would get heated and it would warm the body up faster my college built a prototype device you could not get such a device into the hospital these days were with our anesthesiologist friend we took it into the recovery room and and first thing the patient said no way not put that on my patient but he prevailed and first patient inside not shiver at all first patient was back to normal temperature for temperature in i think it was eight minutes a maze or nine minutes is this now standard practice none no no this is another exam nowhere i do not get upset about the although i it is upsetting to know that it is not but i think that it is yet another case where a fundamental problem exist there is a a science base solution that make sense at the level of physiology engineering and practise and yet it is hoping not right and i mean we cold that we that is a whole other discussion as to what the limitations are well perhaps in an i know number of our listeners are in the health car and meter ye he professions well as military lies and just also standard other types of jobs civilians of a doing other types of work a it would be wonderful if people understood this am once again is there a a is there a home grown technology that people could use if somebody is hypothermic what is going to be the best way for them to warm up as e in me holding a a nice warm a mug of coco or something that but not not too hot i guess is there again the idea well actual you can go harder on the on the labor skin no becks it will dilate because it takes the heat away faster no but back to the anaemia what you can do as you can use a warm pads they have them in at all hospitals they have circulating water perfused pads o water bottle ti was the eat letipically they will slide them under your lower back or something li put them and put them on the feet sure that that will do it but turns out that we discovered through this work that it had nothing to do with the whole arm it was only the hand and that is when we came to the realization of these special blood vessels we did not discover the blood vessels there described in grays and anime but nobody knew what they were for ran you mention bears earlier in other hairy animals am do they have these navies yet as well an suppose we have not to find navies we have been pretty get about the know acrnymsthroal navies is curia venue and estimates a connection between the arteries in the veins i actually use this thatknowlegey have a bull dog bulldog master has a very high am propensity for overheating as that their terrible dumping heat and bulldogs are great at pushing themselves to the point of exhaustion or death it happens and now we do what we call palm or cooling are i cannot help myself where it'll take costelloand lower him into a cool body of water just the just the boys of his puzzle thought think animals anstinctually no to do this and we will go and stand and by a bodies of water they do not often lie down all the way a some do year but they seem to know that is a great way to cool themselves off ye absolutely and they get the advantage that their am that their palms and their feet are essentially the same thing we we actually built devices for dogs did you really and tried them on i did a od sled dogs and the work beautifully they had little back packs with the equipment and pads on all their feet and and they work u amazing is a along the lines of heating deliberate heating wearing a nit am cap is something that you see more of that on the east coast you knot you run around boson in new inland ye with a with a nit cap have always done that that the start of my runs to trying warm ut more epically and then i take it off a shed layers as i go am is that a rational practise the way i just strived it n cause warming up is important to there is a certain amount of quoting g warming up that is required to lubricate joints or at least to get the sense that joints are lubricated and and to be able to move more easily e do you still recommend that people warm up peanut i think we are misled by the term warm up as if the major purpose is to raise temperature a i dot's not aware of any data on this but i i do think that the major contribution is increasing flexibility u you are going to avoid having damage a joints and and tendons and ligaments and forth abut also a they ability of the mite tundra to produce a energy a can be impaired at low lower temperatures and you have to keep in mind that we say our body temperatures thirty seven degrees but that is not true arris across the day it is well it varies in parts of your body men my hands and arms are not at thirty seven degrees right now they are much lower that is an interesting question what is the best way to measure door body temperature well the best for temperature is that what we use is a sovageal we put a thermal couple up the nose about two feet down hisophica that is about the level of your heart not him or i i though no and to some of those bovids job taco per you a an o man is you going any for that felt my brain was getting tickle a and it's tourism a tympanic is a pretty good to the ear dear ait is not fool proof because you have to actually have it aimed properly at the tympanum and frequently what your getting is your getting sort of a mixture of tympanic plus our canal temperature and the and for those listening and for those watching the tympanic is not in a bed the pink that this part of the ear the outer part of the the tympanic as can be near the tall heady towards the tympanic memory an a yes ism sticking my finger in my ear because that is a where it the later we would actually have i to go to measure your temperature when we are walking into restaurants and other places nowadays an their shining the later at our forehead that is probably giving a pretty crude read out of temperature it is but there is much less insolation between your brain and your forehead skin than there is between your biceps and your griskin if you are going to measure a surface temperature that is where you do it and we do temperatures in the in for red we we take in for red videos of athletes and and are our subjects and of course the face lights up e of we are not i imagine there is can be a technology coming soon where you can point your am smart watch are your smart zoning yourself an you are going to get a heat man right that is got if if somebody out there has not already invented this ut for the typical folks outside military somebody please invent that because a i think there is growing interest in temperature a based on the work that you are doing an also forsake of come something i do want a touch on which is sleep in metabolism although we do not want to open up those portals all the way because we need a several days to cover it a o get putting on the the cap am what about some of the helmets and gloves that are used in typical sports do you think that those can be improved in order to improve performance in terms of their ventilation ability or keeping palmer surfaces a open for instance you mentioned about the the knit cap in in cold weather especially and that is significant because you do lose a lot of heat from your head a but it is a constant heat lost it is not variable your labor skin a if you decrease that heat loss you are going to be warmer sure that that that has not impact now in terms of helmets they should be ventilated i mean they should have enough a space in them and holds in them that air can circulate you do not want to insolate athormagly insolate your your scalp that is going to decrease heat loss quite considerable now just for arresting individual the brain is about twenty percent of your metabolism that is that is a lot of heat production y absolutely am i realize there is a question that i fail to ask earlier am that is i burning in my mind now and i think is likely burning in the minds of some of the listeners which is you if you do this cooling in between sets in the him the ether he performance enhancing a fat you do not get tho delayed on set muscle soreness which is great presumably the body is adapting e getting better as the consequence of being able to do more work after unite time or to go harder in some ray of course am you get that adaptation does that mean that you see a performance enhancing a fact even when you do not cool if you have previously done the cooling work outs you know prince let say i can do ten sets of ten dips which i i to think i can ay get you to go try it or know if have done that recently i do the cooling id i cool for three minutes between sets and let us say i i get to the point where i can you your twenty for ten sets of tenets of twenty repetitions and then i do not cool will i be able to match or approximate my new better performance you keep your games it is a true conditioning effect you respond to the increased work volume by all of those me mechanisms you mentioned may s you increase the number of contractual elements in your muscles may muscles get bigger amazing we had an experiment hat involves some of our female a students not athletes but just regular they refreshment actually and a the experiment was a ten sets of push ups to muscle failure whither without cooling same regimen three minutes of of cooling in between sets of push up some of those young ladies reached over eight hundred push ups now the total duration of the work out can be getting much longer as he combo the doing former no it does not take you longer well miner i mean a pushup is pretty falsity fanon you do ten sets the maximum an forty five minutes total an most lot that is a lot of pushup that is a lot of push oms now the interesting thing is they came in one day and they said doctor hello you cost us a lot of money why we had a formal dense this week and we all had to buy new sleeveless dress is nice to get iron ha good prom to have am let us tell about steroids anabas e steroids am we are heading into an olympics every time the olympics rolls around here about these cases of people getting pop does they call it or caught for anabas e steroids there some accusations out there now there will be at more they will this will get am handled in the press and and the various organizations clearly athletes and non athletes use anabolic steroids and typically anabolic steroids are of the testosterone variety there are derivatives et camera and those derivatives do different things in anabolicers intergenic et camera but typically the idea is as least as i understand it in talking to some of these individuals am is that they allow people to train more because they recover faster they are able to synthesize more proline because they are basically getting a second puberty because as we all no drink puberty there is a lot of growth of the body am and of course there a lot of negative effects of abuse of these things and they are banned from from very sports organizations especially i should mentioning combat sports it is is especially concerning because in combat sports a performance enhancement means that you can harm somebody more than you would be able to otherwise i suppose ton other such sorts of sports just to conceptualize it and a men ism not taking a moral stance on any of this i just want in ask you when you compare palmer cooling to animal e steroids in terms of him performance what do you see well we do not do research on steroids but there is a lot of research in the literature a lot of that as research in the strength conditioning magazines is not very scientific none we my i name be scientific at alright right but we did do an analysis of reputable papers and we did find a i think it was probably eight or nine ten studies on bench press increase in bench press performance on steroids or not the to males or females well well this were all males but it'll get back to the females the bottom line is that in all of these independent studies there rate of improvement was approximately one per cent per week now have just told you about studies in which we have had three hundred per cent increase in a months is it is an enormous yet enormous difference why would you endanger your health as well as your or legal ability to compete with such an ineffective tool yow no i i think it is the the notion of performance enhancement is is a really interesting one because people clearly pay attention o nutrition sleep is now something that i think everybody but especially athletes are paying attention tor am and i predict that temperature will be one of the more m powerful a parameters that people are going to be focussing on ye it is because it because of the magnitude of the effects that your describing and and also because much of the versatility around performance as you mention has to do with when you go to a new environment yo everyone has their home environment worked out pretty well sleep well in your own bed at home you when you can control everything your performance is always great this withing military special operators are particularly interesting group because their whole world is centered around bleat and hi performance at with very high risk high consequence under variable conditions the essence of their work is variable unpredictable conditions am you mention female athletes and generous ism curious about this yow because everybody has always said to us hell you only use male subjects and obviously they have this testosterone background u know they have higher levels of destalstron that is why you get these results we did a comparative study on females we get the same results impressive and these are are stamford athletes or also these were not staffer you they were stamford students but not athlete wo we we have done of course work on some athletes but in general we do not do research on our teams are our city teams they have their own protocols they have their own training program at they do not us to get theythey do not know work wit some of these folks and the coaches and the very slept with good reason also and the reason i ask is that i i when you see these a packed or or division one college athletes and then you see their peers have bit there is there is clearly a a a a difference rite a mint they they are pat agreed at throughout right am and more typical folks a also have different golds they may not want to get infinitely stronger or perform more endurance work ti want to ask you a couple of things about shivering and metabolism cause i think there very interesting and am sufficiently related my understanding is that shiver is an adaptation that is design to heat us up if a that we have brown fat that is in compartments around our body that are activated by shiver or activated by shiver and that shivering is useful for increasing metabolism is that true and does it require that cold be the stimulus to twosonarios i'llgive you expo event i put some one into cold water of some sort and then i make them get out or i have them stand near and then they start shivering minourstanding is that the their metabolism will increase what if i take someone and i just have them shiver but they're not exposed by come kind of a deliberate shivering will that also create a substantial increase in metabolism sure deliberate shivering without cold is essentially what happens when you get a fever your set point goes up in your hypothalamus and you actually even know your normal body temperature your thermostat is telling you you are too cold increase your metabolisms or shiver sure shivering is a is a good way of increasing metabolism but it only can take metabolism up may be three or four times resting the where is a exercise can take you up we ten times got it i do not ask a couple of more random questions and a seemingly random do bears actually hibernate oh yet the true hibernation well tension how you to find true a a bear actually we have done a lot of work on bears we wee do you also put the nose thermal couple down in the safe we implant them surgically the anacetize when you re inland the yes look kind of bears an black bears and did this with colleagues at university of plasma an d were analyzing the data now but what we have done as we have were had now a total of eighteen bears and we implant them with e e g e g g a temperature censers and sometimes we actually measure their oxygen consumption these are bears in the wile these are bears in the wire but they are brought in a to universe of plasma where we keep them in an outdoor enclosure their hibernating in an estop in a enclosure and we are recording this electrophysiological date to continuously for six months making how do not i get on this portion e cannoigan urgings om work together going forward and ten you can academe on t o this phrotoclase yourights i right now it is a matter of just analyzing the gigabytes terabytes of data that have been collected but anyway you asked about hibernation a bears only go down to about thirty three thirty four degree renegade for temperature and that is been argued that well they cannot go lower because they have much in solution their big their surface volume ray so and forth and that is not true they shiver if if we have a day a minus forty which you get in in plasma they will go through periods of shivering and maintain a for temperature on thirty three thirty for now the ground squirrels and the markets which are small smaller animals they will drop down to a body temperature maybe within a degree of the environment they can go down to one or two degree celebrate just above freezing adoring bad s of hibernation they will stay in hibernation for seven or eight days and how come back up to normal body temperature for a day than loo go back down and what an the other join that day when they are warming out again thee rearrange their nest a eat if they have stored food some species store lots of food others just depend on their fat a a former mentor my my my masters to reenter and a a colleagues front of yours serving hooker you see surely told me a story once toll me a law stories tells great stories as he told me that when an animal comes out of hibernation periodically that it is a very dramatic thing to observe that it is not they wake up in yawn and look around but it is i a complete epileptic seizure what what is going to shivering it is just a resgerramatic shiver at the low temperatures they cannot shiver because the felt of temperature on the conduction of the of the nerves and the muscle faso they are shuttle down base cut now there they use brown fat active ate brown fat and then when they get up to a temperature of may be fifteen sixteen degrees integrate than the shivering starts and it gets very very violent but they are still asleep do we shiver in our sleep i would imagine we do but it probably wakes us up interesting the brown fat is kind of kindling the brown fat is a a tissue which has lots of stored energy cause it is fat but unlike our white fat are regular fat it also has lots of these little power houses might o conduit and lots of blood supply essentially it is a tissue just to produce heat that is what it is there for now in these hibernates there are big patches of brown fat at certain locations that are critical around the heart for example a for us the brown fat is sort of distribute it for many many years it was thought human don't have brown fat but indeed we do it is just not localized in to discreet fat pads it is in a ground squirrels marmots i do not know whether the phrase fat pats is satisfying to say but it is fat pads om speaking of fat pads a i was taught that we have by the internet i should say not by the internal that we have brown fat between our slap alae in our upper neck is is that truly a source of brown enrichment for brown fat if you are grown squirrel it is complete this is all the drawings out there case when ism the ism hearing you say is that brown fat as actually distributed in patin human us distributed along with other a fat tissue it is it is not as discreet is the reason ism ism can a shocked and amused and a troubled by this is because there is a somewhat standard protocol in the e performance well ness whatever a world what everyone o call it of putting ice packs on the upper back as he way to stimulate brown fat thermogenesis i ism hearing some some a nails of concern from from the physiologist tell me why it sounds that is probably not the best way to stimulate brown fat activation well is put it this way you are not attacking anyone yes ethically because the whole yet believes this don lit ut it may not be totally an pacifier false a think of what that is doing if you put ice right there where you are spinal cord is close to the surface that is where you're going to hit the vertebral arteries you are essentially putting a cold source into the brain to the hypotholemis hypatholemis says you are to a cold it is going to turn on shivering and around fat would there be a better sight forsake of activating brown fat a palmer cool a i i cannot say because the activation of brown fat is sympathetic nervous system response any lowering of your temperature that will let the thermos that say you are too cold is going to turn on sympathetic now people will have perhaps different a bounce of brown fat a new born have more brown fat and at a cause the bluebirds cannot shiver correct i do not know oke that that what i read i do not know yet an i realize the i read that in what i believe to be credible sources it could be i just do not know it depends on if it is really new born i can agree because you do not have all of the a motor pathways connected up meet it that is something that occurs in early a days of life and is probably one of the functions of red sleep a a which infants have a lot of right but how to activate brown fat if you are consistently exposed to cold if you live in the arctic an you go out jogging in the winter it maybe that will increase the amount of brown fat you have if you live in the tropics maybe you have less pro i do not know i do not know of any studies which have looked into that n ice headache sometimes it'll drink a cold beverage are all a eat ice cream in my head will brains free lit is brain frees and speaking special forces i stacking i a we all see the images at the seals seal training slash a screening in tornado where there going in know the pacific which is very cold but a i know they also spend some time in the very cold waters of zodiac plasma you mention plasma a brain freeze called ice headache is a a common occurrence there o in tho situations but we all experience thus we ice scream get that brain frees i can feel it know oh it subjectively i can induce it what is going on there and i you would always just rub my tongue on the roof of my mouth is there something that's doing that is a functional there just to try an alleviate a good question the thing is that the roof of your mouth is very close to your hypothalamus if indeed it is a popsycle that is giving you the brain frees it may be direct cooling effect from the roof of your mouth you put your tongue there your insulating the roof of your mouth i do not know ism guess t but what is it but the sort what is the source of the brain frees is it at vast constriction it it is a it it it is a vasomotor change whether it is constriction i think it is more likely of so an increase in blood pressure which will essentially cause an expansion of the arteries and active a pain receptors we do not have pain receptors in the neural tissue in the brain we have them in the meninges and predominantly associated with the the blood vessels the walls of the blood vessels if you have something which will dramatically increase were blood pressure going to the brain you are likely to get we have had some preliminary data i even hate to mention this because we have not been able to pursue it systematically but we have had some experience with people with my grain that say if they use one of our devout devices to heat that the my grain goes away and ado not know the the is derange a lot of people suffer from my grain another loved to are hot types of my grain i been reading a lot about this lately because i get many questions about my grain m but i hate to say anything sure and and we will dis underscore this is preliminary a people are have been great about am understanding that when we say preliminary we mean as not pass through the the required philters to call it hart hard fact yet but yo do not we do not even have a decent data set just these are anecdote rework anecdota and too what i don't you've to call it that because then if you we don't want to give it more weight than it deserves but that is interesting m the ice headache and the increase in blood pressures interesting because the only thing that have heard is similar to it is something that comes from you bothy f these competitions where people eat these very hot chilly peppers let's carbon can ego thing i guess for reasons that that escape me that eating really hot peppers in every once in a while some will eat one of these and get what is called thunder clap headache where a headache comes on extremely quickly and quickly that it is caused is severe rather that it is been known to cause stroke and brain damage these very very very hot peppers if you are not acclimated to them and maybe even if you are have been chon ta to cause asdics a rain damage ye some good evidence for this a i do want o talk about a something that we we have not touched on yet which is neat non exercise induced thermogenesis right the an non activity associate thermolysis and the fighters right that the classic work of rothwell in stock and the idea that sometpeople who overeat are burning off that energy by way of shaking their knee are moving around alonthies of the kind anger they quote you underquote quit nervous types but a they quoted in those studies a huge degree of colonic burn eight hundred twenty five hundred calories pray burned above those who sit rather still does that seem far fetch those are older data but any any comment on meat a non exercise induced a thermogenesis well i do think it is a pretty straightforward that if you increase muscle activity of any kind your increasing your energy consumption and your heat production and now the the really extreme example is hyper and hypothyroidism a people their hyperthiroiter fidgety you know they have very metabolicrit and there hot and people their hypothermic are cool there not they do not move very much any kind of muscle activity increases and when you say now it is not much activity but remember it is only twenty per cent effective eighty per cent of the energy is going to heat it may not exert much energy to tap your foot but four times the amount of energy that is going into the movement is being lost is heat that is a very interesting coplemore quick questions there is a lot of excitement these days or at else usage these days of called energy drinks free work out drinks many of these contain thermogenic compound o canine things there is a a culture now of taking a argentine nothings that support argentine beat new and a a he'll vituline things to dilate the blood vessels sometimes this is for sake of of increasing blood load of the muscles during resistance exercised but a lot of these are thermoganic it is the increase body temperature and are is it possible that some of these energy drinks are actually a wore similar sixasprassoer whatever it is are acting to prevent optimal performance a reduced performance i do not think that the the temperature rise is that ideally do not know a but what it does is it makes you more jittery and you're going to increase that neat that you are talking about a duress another thing and that is that a when you are exercising your muscle and it becomes slightly a hypoxia mean is the oxygen supplies is is not enough the muscle releases a decisive and what a decisive does in the muscle is cause the blood vessels to open up to dilate it is a way of increasing the blood flow to the muscle and therefore the oxygen supply to the muscle affine and is an a essentially an a medicine an agonizing antagonist in if the under the strict logic in getting affine will reduce a denizens release and were will reduce oxygen utilization of the muscle right that would lead me to believe that motivational support aside that affine will hinder muscular performance i would think but i i cannot give you an authoritative answer of that a were just what were just ism going through the et the logic in the gymnastics around that i think it is a fascinating area that that deserves attention because the question of what one can ingest in order to perform better to say nothing of unihormal augmentation but a has often leads back to stimulants and if those stimulants must of which include affine of some sort or inhibiting the adenosine system and the denying system is supporting the oxygenation of muscle then i would imagine that avoiding them might be the better option i just am not aware of data that would this is a general phenomenon of the denizens and and bloodshot has of course a different effect in the brain a denizen cause sleep affine keeps you awake and if you stay awake you are going to have a higher men of colic grate than how go to sleep nothing as you say energy drinks the question is in of what really is it is in them wit is usually a cocktail of things am i do not take these i do not them at all but there usually a combination of vena dilators stimuli affine some sort of stay a source of glucose you sometimes ha force of glucose and sometimes not and often times there are there are vest dilators am and there are compounds that are thought to be called the neurotics mart drugs that basically increase a seat calling or door u an afferentren that transmission am you known that in the eighties and nineties om the data three agonists clambutar all were very popular but they were all band those are all band from from a although people use them recreational which i do not recommend there actually a number of deaths due to dehydration overheating and as well as cardiac effects am before we wrap up i i know you have done a ton of work on sleep i think were can have to do another episode about your work on sleep because you the amount of data that you produce the is v at actually i first got to know you in your work am relate to sleep in temperature we all here nowadays that it is good to see the room that you sleep in cool keep it dark have talked a number of times on outcasts episodes about ism the role of light in shifting it circadian rhythms i have two questions related to sleep one is are there any thing that mayor may not relate to temperature but that you think are very useful for getting better sleep that you do not hear that much about i that people might want a consider or try realizing that there lotteries that we people do not seem it great but what are some things that you do not her that much about these days that you wish people knew well the sleep medicine community now puts a lot more emphasis on cognitive behavior therapy then on pharmacology what congaed behavior therapy does is it essentially increases your sleep hygiene there are certain just general rules have a regular bedtime and a regular arousal time do not be skipping back and forth all the time carousel you mean wake up time wickotime spoken a true phisieanother thing is do not use screens within a couple hours of bedtime because screens are prompredominantly rich in blue light and what that does is you mention the circadian system that effects your circadian system that pushes off your circadian stimulus for sleep another thing is of course relax been do not work right up till the time your going to bed take some time to do something relaxing and then temperature you you have mention that and for many people a warm bath is is really conducive to to to good sleep and people are now swearing by a cooler environment for sleep and that make sense in terms of the circadian effect on body temperature or circadian clock is affecting our thermostat at the time we go to bed our thermostat is on its way down to a lower set point what happens you go to bed your feeling a little bit cool you pile on lots of blankets and then what happens is you wake up a little bit littering your hots you throw them off it is because your thermostat as set downward now why is it better to have a cool environment it is better to have a cool environment because it is easier to thermal regulate you n go to rope in the summer time and the hotel room still have these big comforters is a down comforters how do you deal with that you stick out your h and in your legs e have always so i one leg that is s hang hangs out of the ye but that is there your heat lost surfaces right if your in a cool environment you can take advantage of that you can take advantages i passively regulating your body temperature y do not have to a rat get up and wake up and sail my got i got it change the covers or blankets or whatever you if you are in a warm environment what can you do we need the sleep with one hand in the cool it a right and right now that is not available yet was it is not available have never have never heard about it that why have always heard you want to sleep in a cool room or get the room cold but i never realized why that is useful which is as your you are saying that then you can move you our these glazer her uses asking an now you can even also than an your make a sunder the blanket complete very very interesting that finally a rational science grounded explanation for why we need to sleep in a cool room was always thoughtful of your temperature's going down anyway to h he to sleep in a cool room what about wearing socks while you sleep that was big a few years ago where they said you ne should but socks on now i would think that is probably the wrong advise right well i do not know if it is wrong advice a there is an old old study a it was supported by i think a kitty bower the the sleeping bag company and what the study showed but what the study was asking is were what are the most temperature sensitive spots in the body where do you feel cold and what that showed was it was to toes exits any sample water with your tow you i see that it is the the socks a mentally are promoting thermal comfort i insulating that airy that is quite sennit enough horse if it is too warm you are not going to put socks on right well rig thank you much you gave much information that is actionable and interesting i know a lot of people are going to be really interested in the palmer cooling technology i from cool it we will be sure to provide resources to the web sight that people can register interest i do encourage people to play around with to speak the a the palmer cooling am technology that we all have which a these glazer surfaces and i i just one to thank you for taking time out of your busy scasualthe share is notcomition it it was fun it was lots of in i certainly learned a lot i know a lot of people are going to

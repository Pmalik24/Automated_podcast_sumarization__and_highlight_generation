welcome to the hubermanladponcas s o science science space to i maindrhubermen and ism a professor of neurobiology and theology at stamford school of medicine today i have the pleasure of introducing doctor same hoar as my guest on the superman labpodcast doctor hater is the chief of the section on light andcircadian rhythms at the national institute of mental health an bethezto mainland doctor hater has many important discoveries to his name he was one of a handful of groups that discovered the light sensing anurans in the eye that set the circadian clock s is a fundamental discovery made in the early two thousands that led to an enormous number of additional discoveries on how light regulates are sleep are mine system are mood mental health metabolism feeding and many other important processes if ever there was somebody who understands how all of these processes interact and can inform best practises for our daily behaviors its doctor hater during our discussion to day doctor hater answers questions that are absolutely essential for us to know about or health and well being for instance how to a line ore sleep schedule with our activity schedule such as exercise and how to a line light activity and exercise with or feeding rhythms he presents in new model of how light activity and feeding rhythms converge to support optimal health and when those are not a lined correctly how our mental and physical health can suffer it is a discussion that is rich with scientific mechanism made clearly of course everybody can understand as well as specific protocols to deal with shifts in daylength shifts in activity and in order to optimize sleep metabolism and well being of various kind i learn much from same as i always do he is an absolute wealth of knowledge on all things related to light and circadian rhythms physiology and narrow science i do not think you will find anyone else as knowlogable about these topics as summer and ism delighted that he joined us here on the podcast to share this information before we begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and since related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens athletic greens is an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink i been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve son delighted that their sponsoring the podcast there eaten i started taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athletigreens once or twice o day is that it helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which ore vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called got microfilm and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essential with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body with out lentic greens i get the vitamins i need the minerals i need and the probes to support my microfilm if you to try ut lentic greens you can go to athletic green stock am slash supermen and claim a special offer they give you i free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin d three k too there are ton of stand ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if fore getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still decision in vitamin d three and k to is also important because it regulates things carevascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic greenstone cam slash supermen to claim the special offer of the free travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar have take many times before on this pod cast about the key roll of hydration and electrolytes for nerve self function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium in potassium present in the preparation all of those cells function properly and all our bodily system can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and dehydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the preparations of electrolytes if you to try element you can go to drink element that is element do calm slash supermen and you will get a free element sample pack with your purchase there all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to element element do calm slash supermen and now my conversation with doctor summer hater same thanks for sitting downs ma o leisure ow we go way back a you are best known in scientific circles for your work on how light impacts mood learning feeding hunger sleep and these sorts of topic just o kick the ball out on to the field to speak how does light in pacts the way we feel when i get up in the morning i have the opportunity to interact with light in certain ways or to avoid light and certain ways i have the opportunity interact with sunlight or with artificial light if you could just wad us in to what the relationship is between light and these things mood and hunger at camera i me yod dualism the evict of lives provision when you wake o nu till era beautiful ocean light is essential the sunrise the sun sad blue sky beautiful mountains that is your conscious perception of light but light has a completely different aspect that is independent of conscious vision or image forming functions and that is how it regulates many important functions in your body i think the best that is well studied and well known is your circadian clock and the word circadian comes from the worst circle which is approximate and the anis day it is an approximate day why is is an approximate day because if i put you or any other human being who have normal circadian clock in a constant conditions with no information about feeding time about sleep time about what time it is outside you still have it daily with but it is not exactly twenty four hours it will shift out of the solar day because it is not exactly twenty four hours and since the name sir you just to ask your quick question about that when you say you have the us about twenty four hour rhythm how does that rhythm show up in the tissues of our bad great great quacionso it shows up at every level that we know i studied chose up at the level of the cell it chose up at the level of the tissue and it chose up at your behavior the most obvious for you is your sleep wakcycle you sleep and know your awake and sleep at the twenty four hour rhythms and if you measure the sleep cycle of a humans who are maintained in constant conditions you will see that the period length of the sleep with en on average is more than twenty four hours an humans twenty four point two hours you will be drifting point two hours every day out of the solar if you do not get the sunlight the the sun light at just that approximate day to an exact day now you behavior is at busted to the light dark environment or the solar day because if i within correctly if i were to going to a cave yet or i were to be in constant light y and i did not close my eyes y in constant light that i would still sleep in one coherent bout yes and i oil still be awake for more or less one coherent not marly now but the total deration of my day to speak would be a little be longer than twenty four hours perfect but if i m an in a condition most people are where the sun goes up on the sun goes down and i have some understanding of that sunrise and sunset you man have to have the understanding you do not have to have conscious understanding you have the detective march circadian fortis trainmen is the word we use in training the circadian clock to the aortic environment is completely subconscious your not aware of it it is not vision where or image forming where you actually know what your looking it is all heir thalamic it is part of the brain that is not consciously driven you actually do not know what it happens en does not happen and that would well get into when i tell you why life affects your mood and why sometimes people do not know how to deal with life to improve their for exam i this is a subconscious vision yes o ka a before you tell us about how light in pacts mood curious what is the relevant of adjusting this clock from a little bet longer than twenty four hours to twenty four hours having it seems a small difference twenty four ours and forty minutes or twenty four hours what we that is what is the relevant an me why should we care about that short let do the ma if you shift out point two hours the day in five days you shifting out one hour your literally one hour off in your social behavior in five days in ten days your two hours off and if you're an organism that is living in the while shifting out of the right face of the cycle you could either miss food or you could become food it is really essential for survive i think it is one of the strongest aspect of survival for animals to have the anticipation and the adjustment to the solar so and for humans as well when you say animals a massing that applies a as ya i see even though its just a short at bit longer than twenty four if you if that accumulates over days than you could find yourself very much out of pase with the rest of your your species is and so we say its point two hours in five days is one hour in twenty five days could be five or six hours you could be in new york and your feeling as if you travels from new york to onion you old be having jetlag in new york even though you din do egetlac travel it is very important for the adjustment and if we have time maybe could talk about why this is important for seasonality because also it unless animals to anticipate the changing season and the more your high in in the north or the out the more that this these weather changes occur very harshly and you have to be ready for them and that happens in in n as as well we will defy get into season ally a orcas we let ta subconscious vision that alines us with the turn of the earth how does that work what is the what is the that machinery that allows that to happen and how does the machinery work yes we know we knew that in mama's including us we are mouths humans that the eyes are required for this function if humans are born without eyes or thematic nerves a damage humans are not able to adjust to the solar cycle we know that the eyes are required and since we thought we knew about the eyes lot before two thousand we though well maybe for the year two thous before the years the yes we thought it is this for receptors in your retina that alow you to see in in the human recon us there are two times of fortrceptors they are gold rods and cones because of their shape and these rods and cons simply take the futon energy which lights me off and they change it in a way to an electrical signal that allow us to build the image of the environment in our cortexes subconsciously consciously in the situation osispision riotous imageforming vision its its a visual cortices and association associative cortexes which arlogu to bi conscious perception of the environment however people have found including me with the work of divide person and into proves that there is a subset of ganglinselves the ganglanselves are the selves that leave the retina their con leave the retina and project to the brains these worth of stop to only real rod an conformation from the light interment to the brain we find that i small subset of these ganglianselves are themselves for receptors that were completely messed in the retina and these are the foot receptors that really like environment subconsciously to the arias in the brain that have and housed the circadian clock or the circadian casemaker which and just all the clocks in our bodies to the central brain clock that allows them to entrain to the twenty four hour mi disarm incredible inner as i recall case i was a graduation at the time in the year two thousand there is the landmark discovery may by you ago provencio avid person and others that these sells exist that can communicate day and night information to the brain yin this very small subbed of sells since then have heard but maybe you can confirm er refute that this system that connects the eyes to the rest of the brain is actually the most ancient form of vision that this is probably the form of vision that some early version of human beings had before they had pattern vision before they could see colors and shapes and motion an and all that and that the the that the same sells that perform ten all are actually similar to insect eyes i think i heard avid persons say once that we she hae a little bit of fun the fly my in our eye what he talking about ye it is rely interesting actually because these same ipiargisees we discovered they contribute ta little bit image formation and now work from to finish men specifically have proven that they do contribute to image forming functions tut they contribute to very am limited aspect of impish formation it fits your hypothesis that these are an ancient fotreseptes the other thing that adds to that hypothesis is that they are expressed involves that do not have any modification that make them look fotreseptr our the for receptors that i told you about that are important for vision image formation they have very specialized structures that allow them to pack these structures with fortopigments these are the foot detecting prolines they could detect they his sensitivity of fortune that pass through them these i piargisis do not h the new foteceptors do not have these specialized structures they just really meed the look light at the time we thought the need the lord light to be activated that is why we think they are ancient and that is why you think they a just to ancient functions that are as important as regulating your buy sir cardiac clock to the color environment to color they or to the radars you mentioned ipiargisees intrinsically for offensives these our selves the connected eye the brain that behaved for he receptors essentially and then you mention a melons which is the actual pigment that converts the light into the electricosano more or less and my understanding is that melonobsen was identified first in frog mana force yes that that mean than we have to pieces of frog skin in our eyes honestly avid person say you have e flying your eye because et sons better the more accurate i think is that you have a frog skin in your eye is not as catchy but really melanoses really the name melons and is from piano sit open it is melonopsn because it was found in the frog milanosides the frogs cant change their color depending on light and milonopsen drive this response when ignashou prevent your first discover the absence in frogs luckily he was marten to see if they are express in the frog eye they were express in the frog eye and it was appears to be retinal ganglia selves which i told you then that connect they to the brain he had the insight to go and see if they are express in the monkey ye and he found that they are also express in what appears to be recon gangasells and really that what opened the field wide open then the f it person that the seminal experiment where he went to the brain where the central oscillator that the oscillator the drive car cabin them in the bring the super cosmetic nucleus that has been known for many years to receive retinal import and he labeled the sells a project there and then he found that even if you destroy rows and cons you could get light responses from these sells you could imagine he he really fainted when he a that these sell can respond independent completely in the absence of on anconimpi'll never forget reading those papers an two thousand two thousand one i was at the meaning in d we when geisha the ignacio i we call mega show this image of this that what is frog galena fords in the human eye heels i ow my goodness's is the en a and i want to get into how light chicane control creating rights momently but i think a it is worth mentioning now that a people who are pattern vision blinds people who cannot see and no conscious vision but have eyes many of them still have the cells these melonobsen intrinsically for sense themselves and can ut essentially match or in train as we say on to they a light dark side in fact they possibly have no problems in circadian for entrapment they have enormousleep was y call but the tolly blind but they are totally image mind and what is really interesting is that and this story i heard from tracksislers i give him credit that some of these people who are image rid usually they get dry eyes and they give them low of pain and doctors used to think of the since they are image blind and their getting dry erewhile do not you just remove their eyes they not using them animal and the minute they would remove their eyes they start having sicklical sleep problems indicating that now they are not in training to the light dark cycle and our having sicklical jetlag when their clock shifts through the light dark cycle bat's really interesting and are i hear from a number of blind people i know in my various a aspects of my job and they lot of them have issues with with sleep i think impart because they do not realize that they too need to see lighted particular times of day or night in order to isle interstadial able who thing that is a perfect an seaway for us to talk about how light and viewing light can impact our sleep wake rhythms and then we who move into some of the other ways in which like can impact other forms of body function ye i i love the way you set it up because one of the most interesting and difficult aspect of trying to educate people about light effect on subconscious vision is that is subconscious we all aware of what we think is intensity because we see the room but if you talk to people who know how to take photographs and self that they know that the intensity's varies greatly but our system because we have to see the same way in very bright conditions and very dim conditions we not very good at estimating and intensity consciously when you try to tell people about intensity really struggle because they think they know intensities but they really do not becoming light intend light intensity that the ones himself have an incredible ability to adapt to different light conditions you can see at all different conditions otherwise it be disaster if you do not change the the setting on your camera and you go from inside the room to the outside it becomes completely whit you do not see anything if your cones don't adapt to the environment then you let them be able to see in this room and in on the be thing but the problem is your your ipiargi seize the selves that we talked about they measure intensity pretty well they really know what intensity is they have a very good linear measurement of intensity they do not adapt as well they do not adapt actually that much to be honest that tells you that subconsciously the system is used to measuring light intensity in a natural environment because when you are not in the natural invite we do not have you no industrialize lighting then you your system is functioning very well but now when we change these environments we could really miss up ourself you have to teach people how to understand intensity and that is something that you have to explain to people and i think i love to do it myself i do it in what is called the lowest amount of flight required to allow you to see comfortably you have to do this as an funny experiment o get explaining me how this goes grand maybe we could break it up in the day an two an three or four part let us say i assuming that most people wake up in the morning i suppose to night shift workers et camera we can talk about y later but wake up in the morning sos divide the day in the quarters what is what is the proper way to interact with light in the first part of the day i honestlyving the easiest thing is waking out get as much light as you into your eyes yah it is rely nice your system is prime if your in train is prime to get light the sun should be out most animals n the white they actually seem to tract that the sun the sun has a use influence on life on both is actually life on earth is because of sun that is easy in the morning when you wake up we need light o cities what it what behavior or practise the the you recommend does it let us say somebody is in a condition where there is lot a cloud cover ye is it important to get outside i have to tell you the cloudiest days can a be much more brighter than you wo you could ask any photographer it cloudy day unless it is really dark dark clos usually cloudy days have much more bright outside that inside the room even when you have good lighting inside the rule i think in the outside is usually even when is cloudy you can get enough intensity to help you adjust your sickle to the day night cycle how halloing do you u y these are general rules of thumbed along you recommend people go out is do it daily you possibly need very if you do it daily because you remember this things can happen on a daily man its rets a the ugly cracking and on a regular absolutely it is it is forgot counting its tracking out say fifteen minutes if you do not do it daily you may want i increase it and we talk about when you travel what you could do but but you have fifteen minutes should be fun you do it more it does not hurt and through a window i was my understandings that through window it dramatically decreases the amount of light energy and d it depends of how how thick the windows a and how darkthey are it but it is also nice to go outside and to feel the season sun glasses of i do not use sun glasses i a but you have the your gordanian for yo men you knows de ya whereas my let iselrery sensitive a not i but i personally if i in the shade or if it is not incredibly bright i try to especially in the morning amen also an early persons we have to depreciate early under you water i wake pat for thirty in the morning ti in is in is o not out yet is what you do s urn on artificial lights i usually do not turn on artificial light because i know the sun is going to come up eventually but thus we i do not the change in the timing that they do you ma what you you between for thirty am an seven am i me i us i conputeoasion sorosis get enough light bun but in reality i me as long as you old let your body get the morning sunlight which i think it is really to me and i there is no evidence but to me this says if you look at all animals plans this morning sum light seems to be very important and i i we do not have experiments to show it but i have got feeling that it has a use impact humans wo ladies users davit the tempered sleep there shown that these early morning like flashes can adjust the a amount of sleep that one will get makes it easier to get absolve absolute o we son and and there can writ also did this beautiful camping experiments that show i may measyou to describe us as a r wonderful expert they are beautiful expandhish yo took this you no college students that have the late onset of sleep and at waking time and then he said lest camping and just do not use any artificial light and you could go to sleep as as as late or as early as you want and wake up as let's early and he fond the you shift in the sleep pattern just by exposing them to the light narxycle i mean n lasted and it last even after they came back ai two days of camping recent the circus e always but it it lasted ya it is pretty amazing ya it is really incredible ora get bright light of some sort early in the day i really sunlight even on a cloudy day it is going oust brighter than in your light o that's easy get si thenar and the other thing thatould to mention to people if it you think it is very dim outside testes very cloudy stay longer remember intensity is only one common duration is also important because remember that the circadian system is not the image system in the mist system you have to change every second because you looking at different objects you have to change your procession but for the circadian system it is trying to figure out where am i in the daylight sickle the more you give them the information the better you are if it is very bright you do not need lot because this clearly an a make you fire crazy but if it is not bright stay longer stay for one hour you not have your coffee outside or something that it is just going help but then yo said something extremely important which is that the circadian system is trying to figure out when you are in time exact not where you are in for used where you are in time a went when you are o no now i was in correcting you have just meant that it the i think fundamentally that is the the e the incredible thing about the system y that you have this clock the twenty four our clock in your brain but it needs to be sincranized to the outside could we go a little deeper into the as circadian seeing behavior and come up with some general rules of thumbs let us say it is a very bright day extremely bright yo no clouds the sun's out you said ten minutes fifteen minutes and it'll tell you if your sensitive do not you do not even have to be in the sun you could be in the shade this going to be many fortunes out there in the shade is going to be perfect you do not even have to see the sun you do not have to have the sun you not grateful frighten indeed that is a different storey you could do this for your skin and and dunno protectors kin that is not my very o expertise but for for that effect on the circadian system as long as your outside in the shade and sunny day ten to fifteen minutes should be amplamand and then let us let say it is kind of overcast am i now it is not particularly brighter tit is in our solid cloud cover but in othodisee that the sun is out but your it is not is bright how long do you think it would take is set the clock ten to fifteen should be sufficient stay for half an hours say for forty five minutes if it is very dark rot yes day for long one and if for some reason one finds themselves very far north and it is very very dense a cloud cover how long and at what point should somebody consider using an artificial light source to medic the sunlight were honestly this is where we do not have a lot of information still because this is where we cannot discuss this may be in more detail that if you put a humans in artificial conditions the circadian system is very sensitive to light but in reality in the real environment light also is affecting other aspects that are independent of the setting of the circadian base been of and these which recall the direct effect of light or move for example that is very hard to figure out what intensity you need to use and we have not done enough expression the system has been discovered just recently but i would say if you use bright light in the morning i mean it is hard for me to give numbers can get complicated am but were i mean if you are honestly if your that far north and your the winter and you when i get make sure you done use these light boxes i a would suggest that personally my that is is i use it is shall not design for circling in setting but i have a a nine hundred and thirty locks light pad that i bought and i bought it a it is the very portable compared to the a don simulating light i you don't which i which are quite expensive finely and i i put it there and i a just basically when i wake up in the morning i use that until the sun comes out and then i make sure once the sun is out i go outside but i keep that thing on all day and i do not know if that is good or bad is a good or bad i honestly i do not think being exposed to bright light in the days can ever be bad because really you are outside in the day in unless the worst can o happen if the temperature is very high your body's going to say do not be highdrate and go to sleep you you could tell actually sometimes when it is very hard the more you get exposed to bright light the sleepier you feel in the afternoon which is counter intuitive so yo bet was to protect u seething against duration i think if you think about the human evolution from near the equate in them between noon and a certain time in the afternoon it would have been very hard for you to maintain physiological home eustatic function being active at this very high temperature time i think nap being was away that is we thing it has i measure function o you still napping was away to somehow take your way from that dangerous tone and may be thus wide people in the north say in the winter we can wake up in the morning cause they do not have this long light they sleep at more at night but in the summer they say we feel we cannot but sleep we have to put all these dark curtains i think venturing that of that much nor north has been came up with problem because the volution was used to certain light in varment that was completely changed with a human with other animals i think that lived there longer a they have come up with very interesting adaptation of actually measuring even very small changes in the light in the light intensities that still occur aside even if your near that the the pols even though its always light but there is a change in the light intensity across with the ightcycle your system if it is linger and remember i told you that might be oversees are incredibly linear can still measure all this is lower light than rigor life if if if the organism has the ability to do that more yes it is interesting have spent much time a learning from you fortunately about these cells and yet i never really appreciated until now how on the one hand they are tracking the amount of high to understand when we are in time relative to the twenty four hour cycle but also that you keep mentioning this this linger measurement of intensity that they really are trying to figure out when we are in time by measuring the intensity of light in course the sun is the most intend source of light available to us wo was i think we om have nail down that first part of the day basically its get ten to thirty minutes depending on how bright it is and trying you that as as often as possible to give the system of regulars the es ti system is really about and an you see that even for the effect on depression is about multiple days is is you do not have to worry if you is tat one day stay longer if you an but if your in hurry and you want to do other stuff that is a great our comedy you might want a come assay with some extra time if you yesterday or two and this why i have heard you say before it is entirely possible to get severely jetlag without travelling absolutely simply by staying in being on your phone too much not getting the sunlight and you sow the during the pandemic lot of people mention that the sleep was cycle suffer not a because if your not going out and if you staying at home and you do not have big windows and you waking late waking up late and then your using very bright light till late at night your body's get a shift and now your days gan a start instead of really when the sun comes up the say at six o'clock in the morning scans rules gan start at eleven o'clock in the morning that is what your bodies can a think is the beginning of the day then you not gently be able to sleep at ten o'clock at night because now that is really for for your body is completely different timing and you could see this happened during the pandemic at the very high scale people get delayed in their sleep wakesica look in am there is this idea of chronotypes that we all each intrinsically have a a best rhythm of either being a morning person acts of an early person or a night hour or more of a kind of standard you nor to better round ten thirty up around seven type something and the and i think there are now good day that rig me if am wrong from the nationalstitutes mental health and elsewhere showing that the more we delicate from that intrinsic rhythm the more mental healthishes and physical dealfish starts acraou there is great dater on this and there s couple of things that complicate this the first is the people who usually are late they tell you that the society does not accommide well let by wat an whet we mean pul the wake off late and go so sleep late and wake a late the they have an overwhelmingly higher level of depression and failures a mi clearly a men the reason the people say sleep early wake up early or better because you man notice that people who wake up go t sleep early and wake up early they do better in life they notice that i just performer they prefer but the question is is is that in transmit to the system or is that society because society start things usually early only that is the hart when discriminate again slave i we in a way we discriminate right but the other explanation is can rites experiment that these late riser if they were truly chronotipically late why would they shift easily when you put them in the but if you were really chronotifically late and there is a face relation between the light dark environment and your certain clock then doing this camping experiment should not have cause much changes because it is not that you you light scan affect in a certain way is that this is the relationship that your body decided that i am elate sleeper late waking i am honestly am still an an unable to figure out how much of this late waking out is controlled by the light in firemen and how much is interest am sure there are differences but are they as big as we see in the endearment because you have people that go out to sleep a seven p ma wake up at one am these are clearly advance face people go to sleep at seven p m and wake up at one an a and feel good doing that ism not sure they feel good but lost the time you talk to people they say they are high achievers but they suffer because they they wake they go to seven p m wake up advance face sleeps entry they call it the re call it asindrom but but then you have people who would not be able to sleep til five a m and and not be able to wake up ti three p m right and ism not sure that the circadian system is that variable in the human population cumin clearly their army be some tonetic factors that make a small presenters of everything with bel chase but i think most of the time the light environment may parole and once as you as we have talked about this is a long term effect of flight once you get into a rhythm and i i do not mean it as upon in reality once you get into rhythm it is hard to break out of that wo them because if you star sleeping late and waking up lad you are not getting the morning sunlight right and you your just can a be lad and if you me waking up early you are getting the morning slight you are getting what size a said er said his last name long the one instaffrd who did the the a ladies it sis deil he as she work for side class as is earn was an teewelas theses an ins ins internal ye both phenomenal scientists who what walk it seems to me is the case is that the only way to really now if you are meant to be in early bird as they call at an early person or lay person or somewhere in between is to get morning sunlight and figure out whatever not that makes you feel better and to understand to be educated about how to measure intensity how to measure i put it town rotation cause you either get measuring defies but you cannot depends i ha on your eye to measure intense cause i how we do that your you keep coming back to this she that tells me that is important it is the obviously they're as free as an a light meter where you can walk around and hold the on down and see how many locks b are in these are who implicated because you have to point them to specific reeling how how do people start to develop in in fugitive sense of the measurement of intensity ye i think at one point i posted on instragram how i keep my night time at home and i found out that my night vision is very strong i found out that i especially in the winter i only need candle light i literally use the tee lights and i put fifteen or twenty of them an moment and its nice i could see it clearly does not affect my cicadas do in your cats and and my want voice just real it just great right but i do not expect people to have the same night vision as me the simp i may i tell people do the experiments if you put three or four lights in your come switch to sit for fifteen minutes you hast too of switch to off let us say you using fight and see after fifteen minutes you will not recognize yo switches thou off my got feeling is that most people would need at least ten times less light than they use at night to see the problem people use it because most the time they did see the morning limelight they are actually hungry for light without their knowledge they come switch all these lights on but at the long time because they wok up late i can now now i understand this morning light young goes way beyond also setting your clock it is also away to determine how much how little light you need later in the day and we and we'egong to talk about this in a moment but how little light you get later in the day is a very strong determinant of things when you'll wake up whether not you wake up feeling refreshed et camera let us that is that is why yell ism going to break it on youshal antre that ism going to tell you i think there is something else that people to need to think about which is the try part take model that this mote incorporate three components which you take about in details that a lot us humans and all animals to incorporate the circadian clock and it is relation to light the home you static drive and the direct effect of the environment which includes tress light old and of they have to be incorporated together if you think that is what i think right now if you think of one along you will always miss something and when you think of them as a whole thinks really become clear it is actually quite i maze gan we will definitely want to hear about your try par tight theory tan can going to detail about this homy astatic mechanisms i wont to make sure that for people who are ism thinking now ism sure about light and how it impacts them the morning light suing behavior i to think we have tack down clearly and and thank you for that because there is much information out there and a have try to relay that information of course you are my primary source for all things si circadian as well as came and others of course a ma walker but think you have made that very very clear no but say have got my morning sunlight made my bright artificial light and throughout the day you said to get a lot of light am working at my desk may be it'll it'll go out during the day a few times but ism working at my computer ism doing things is there anything about light young in the middle of the day that people should keep in mind work an they just sort of free style it depending on what they do most people are not a in a dark room yer hum el i got feeling if you got your morning son light you walk from your cars slowly or you walk to work you did not where son glasses when the miss were still dim in the morning that you could free stilt that even if you do not get a lot of light there is a way to just you now in the day you do not have to just worry about getting lot of bright light but personally i to do that si go out at lunch and and have my lunch outside as well this reminds the body t here it is even brighter now but the evidence is that you could literally help your circadian clock by giving lights at donna dust but again if you think of the trypartic mole this may be important for to circadian cock but is it important for your mood that is where i think you e or the home eustatic drive that is where you need to think about it for the clock for in training your clock you literally can in train it only by the don sunlight you action do not need doorman us on can leer forget that yean i appreciate that your distinguishing between circadian effects and other effects of light y a being very precise we yet is is appreciated until we hear about this tryparti model which we will cover for for the sake of the discussion am let us treat the light viewing behavior as what are the benefits were drawbacks o viewing light for all biological purposes not a circa an adding in the morning it is clearly gan set the clock and then during the day if i understand correctly the ideas to get as much bright light as you can because you are feeding it sounds a sort of a light hunger exactly i see i love this way to put i think there is a weird light hunger considering that were not for the synthetic organisms there is a weird light hungers in animals that they need to measure they need they they need measure and i think that relates to the season because the holy production cycle of animals can a depend on the avelablityov food in the environment and if you do not know when the seasons can happen they do not have calenders it is cannot be very hard to survive i think that is why we have the slight hunger that is i measure hypothesis is not be destined interesting then afternoon and evening start to approach have had this weird experience may be you can am psychologically or an biologically dig not me now same where if i go into a moving in the afternoon a matinée and i come out and it is dark i notice a significant drop in my mood and my ability to go to sleep whereas if i get some view of the light in the evening does not have to be the sun settle the sunsets or nights but i get some light pulse in the afternoon that i have no trouble whatsoever for tan is happens in the daily on on a single time to to watch em more or less an as interest and then you mention the camping experiment were when they went camping there seeing the sunrise in the sunset what should people do in the afternoon slash evening time in terns their light during behavior i mean the best think to does to let the natural light creep in into darkness right that would be the best but clearly that would be if you you want a go home you want a read you a to t our cads you will not to your family i think it is nice to extend to day i do not think that is long if you somehow can blow that light from a fix acting your circadian cop should people use blue blockers in the evening i personally do not light any blockers that take a single wavering for flight because again if you think of a holistic holistic approach yes the blue blockers cannot prevent you from affecting your circanding clock very much but then your vision is going to be distorted because we always see in full spectrum the sun has this beautiful spectra right and then when you start seeing without the blue things look yellow and it cannot get really wear right i mean i i personally have tried the blue blocker and i could not even wear them i i thought they were just really horrendous to be honest longe lines of blue lockers i think a lot of people mistakenly wear them all day long o my god that would be lot of people to that look people do that they think the the blue light is bad i think that the honor that the concept blue lighting bad an led to the a lot of product development and a lot of people just assuming that viewing blue light is what was giving them had i when in fact it might have just been looking at screens a at that come distance o here's the problem right i mean the blue light got the bad reputation because people who gave a pure blue light show that e cause a usually retinal damage but again if you using blue light in its pure form it has a law of energy because it sure or wavering but were talking about full spectrum light there are ways now where you could change the specter of the light and keep it white between day and night and change the content of the color without you noticing you do not even have the affect your vision sow would do you go about doing that you just lower the level of the blue you do not have to eliminate such as damn light this the blue but keep then increase the yellow but keep all the colors in i certain weight y you could have different warmness of weight and people know how to do this physics knowhow to do this people work with light knowhow to do this o maybe somebody in the well ness slash i i do not the word but by out hacking or an optical community will do that sitting it is a really importanight i see many have a worthy blue honors i do not know why why they look who thing the discern in formed i think yea drink that ism to be honest it is easy right it is easier to explain somebody if i pareses respondmostly to blue remove blue you define right right but that is not as simple as that because they also rescue to an con import s you want a actually and we could going to dead us that is boring for you messengers but it also affect that adaptation properties of the whole retina you do not one to do something drastic that you take just one color of the sector it just seems very counter intuitive to me to be honest you have told me before is well that just because these intrinsically for a sensitive circadian sailing gangling selves respond best blue light if the light is bright enough because they also get in put from other come one's of the eye it does not matter if you block the blues ye you an your looking a bright light at night you are going to destruct your sircariasicle and and that is why did not one are going to the boring details but himself the full receptors have a wite rage of responsiveness they are most sensitive to blue life but that does not been they do not respond to green light or to shorter than you light they respond to very very wide specter with different sensitivity unless you understand the system just removing for eighty in things going to do grin any matters yet i your home is a cave that night placeacuen when i say with some its and i i with handles that arid and you and your a a i wen your we and your at and your lovely life ye i know is also a phenomenal scientist in her own writ m she is and but you do keep your home quite dim to dark at night in fact i did go to to meetings with with some of my friends who work on this and they really struggled with me they said we could have broken our legs living in the same light in varmint that you do i am an extreme but i measure it for myself and i ask tragyou my wife if she is of here with it she also light the dimness both of us can see well in in dim conditions and and that helps us along am but i think you have to measures for yourself you really have to do it is a very simple experiment just tried to dim the light as much as you can i i call it the minimum amount of light you require to see comfortably and that is how you want your environment i a early at night this is what i think is the game changer if you reach to level where its just barely your literally on the cost of seeing uncomfortably verst the seeing very comfortably you are going to be very much better than i do not to make it completely dark i think complete darkness induce anxiety inhuman to be honest i do not complete darkness am it lo do not complete darkness they a in animal even nocturnal animals do not complete darkness i may we have studies in animals that nocturnal that if you put them in complete darkness for several weeks they they cold they have severe anxiety and depression effect keep the big this am house red light that is very dim if you wont a keep the room for sleeping red light that is very dim has very small effect on on oncircandan clerk and below ten locks of thread light literally does not affect sleep at all there are ways to do it it just we need to educate the public and i feel you literally need ye whole a lecture to just expend to the people how to deal with light because it is not as simple as people think well that is what we are doing here you are stepping through a piece by piece and am and there is more doing that is because it is not as simple saying just block to light or get a lot of light during the day and i mean lentlemo a ad not in perspective to tell it we only have three different cones in our rete that respond to three different colors recall them red cones for simplicity green cones and blue calls yet we have only three of these but we could see massive plait of colors that tells you something if the system was just simply about a single color and is just just removing for eight your just blue is sufficient then we should only see in red yellow and blue we should not see all the different hues of color but because the system is not that we see all these different colors and that is why is important to remind people that the white light is made of many different colors it is actually the rain not has why you see the rainbow is made of many colors white light is never truly white it is made of more of different colors it is the pink flood album cop exactly come exactly exact a dim at night maybe dim red light ideal your candle light find that minimum required light level when petit just make sure when you lower the light sit for at least ten fifty minutes let your system adapt because if you had it bright light and you switched off surely you get a suffer because your system did adapt it was use to very bright light you want to engage your rods which take a long time to dark adapt that is why i tell you just wait a little bet do not just with o of it i do not see put it on put it off sit down wait for ten minutes ideally fifteen minutes and then see how you see and then once you do that you will notice that actually a i could see quite well even with much less light what d you do regarding screens ye that is that is the hardest thing again i mean there are beautiful programs that changed the whole intensity and color of the screen the could have dim your screen at night to the lowest part i mean yes you will not see it when you wake up in the morning but the yuan increase intensity try to decrease i mean just what we were taking about think of light intensity duration color and time of thin you really have to keep these four things together wrist we have room together at a couple of meetings from times time no longer because one of us not to be named has a severe snoring as you at the other one sud of homicide not a wen guess who that was i whet have seen you check your one after dark once or twice and and you did it by sort of pointing your phone away i on you rid a tendentan rashly a hora ha choking but i you de it quite a better half choking but it hail make sense that e not you shine a flash light in your eyes much brighter than yo light i do not la oi on direct line her if you just look the side most of the lights gulag this way and your own mistimes you one and as silly as that might seem to people listening having what it means is that getting bright light in your eyes at night is something that you really want to avoid and but there is the reality then and even when i chick sometimes if i if i have something and i chick it fastens we should of fast am also well in sages as a were o the duration right duration intensity color and time of ne ideally i would not in i forms an eye pass i do not use i pa that night because it is hart to lower it enough cause it is a huge but even my eyeful i try not to use it that night and once it becomes a thirty or nine i do not look at it at all unless its work super yellow company which er ads on twenty four hour rebut that is only for the big soccrfen we this has been incredibly a noon illuminating on let us talk about the relationship between light and some of these other non circadian or judo circadian effects and and we will come try in link those but you had a what i consider absolutely landmark beautiful paper publish in nature a few years ago showing that if you disrupt the exposure to light for the timing of the exposure to light that their dramatic effects on the stress system and on the learning an memory system we could talk about each of those separately ere together what water the effects on stress and the effects on learning when light viewing behavior and sleep wake cycles are disrupted now just to remind you you know that but to mind you and listeners that i was trained as a circadian bowses i really was indictor native intothinking that light has to a fix the clock which then cops all these different effects that is that is what i believe that my dog math's would have made me really happy and then taro the gates and caraaltenus joined the lab and said n we started discussing the law of dada said what if there is a direct effect of flight that we are missing independent of the circandicso this is not an easy question to as to answer because as we have been talking on the long light affect the circadian clock how could you give light at different times of the day and not miss up the circadian cook luckily we came up with such away and that is why it was important to do these experiment the way we did them and we prove that this light dark cycle does not disrupt the clock there is still a circadian with them and does not go sleep does not go sleep deprivation and yet surprisingly if you give light at the on time of the day even without disrupting the circadian clock or without goes in sleep deprivation as you mention you get use mood changes in in the organisms and you get learning medicine this really and at the time people have really hit us hard i mean it was really hard to publish this work and and you ye why i came out in nature in the end you prevailed a but i will not make sure that arishansiur your saying that yes there are effects of light on the circadian rather asleep meaning sleep in wake wakefulness yes and their timing however their direct effects of light on mood that can be dissociated from the effect upon on sleeping waking find interpreter correctly that could mean that when we view light and how much light could make us feel happier or less happy or even depressed stars learning et camera bingo even if we are sleeping and waking up at the appropriate time into i mean eventually because we talking about the whole system eventually when you start having the other prone you also develop sleep problems but your absolutely right and in fact now research from their fernandisin the lab have found that now we know that the actually required different bray regions we do not only have a theory we do not only have light environment that show they can be dissociate we know that the use completely different brain regions the es the end that i told you about earlier the place where the central pace maker is the one that receives direct input from the retina through the ipageceives to adjust your circadian clock is not the area that receives the light input for mod regulation it is a completely different brain ragi whats the brain region cold the by region we cold tat the very having hear uncles am not sure how good or bad the name but doesmaris the pitch be and what is really amazing dis region also received direct input from the ipiagises but projects to areas in the brain that unknown to regulate mood including the ventral meal prefrontal prefrontal quarter which has been studied for many years to be impacted in a human depression just by by this amazing serendipity to find that a region that is deep in the advance brain the me the prefrontal quarter is your executive brain one of the most elaborated in humans to see that they receive input from these ancient fortoreceptor stunning to us and told us how much we did not understand the importance of light on a human behavior how is that finding in form daily protocols for you were for other people i realize you cannot keep to at always from one paper to daily portals but if light indeed does control forefront a quartics executive function learning stars a and mood wo and what i am waking up that is we an of sleeping that is why should i do different that is why we came up with the try partake to because yes we could think about just a pushing the clock with lights in and being dark throughout the day but that me not be important for your physiological function now if we include these other effects of light that is why prefer to still get a low of light in the day i do not want a be in very dim condition throughout the day as even though it does not affect your clock as you beautifully said and it may affect your mood and learning and memory stay affect your alertness level which can allow you to learn better it may affect your how static drive may be your homeostatic fact will go higher you could sleep earlier it is important to think of light as stimulating all these brain regions which means producing more activity which in reality this is how peoplethink of the hemostatic drive that the more active you are the more the hemostatic drive is built up the better you sleep that is why we came up with the try part model because as t e circadian biologists i only thought of light through the circadian clock affecting behavior as a sleep oblige the only thought of the hemostatic drive affecting sleep affecting behavior and for people who study light for vision and and other from they thought only of the environmental put but now if you put them altogether you get with the strip partake model where it is really mine bugging and it makes much sense the organism does not want a depend on a single component but if you could incorporate these three together you could have a beautiful system that is well adapted let me tell you the sleep wakes right we know there is a how eustatic drive to affect sleep we have beautiful talks about that which is pacey the longer doorway way more obvious that is your how eustatic dry we have talked about the circadian influence of sleep and the fact that light dark cycle affect the circadian system which eventually affect sleep these two components are were understood now the third factor is your direct light or environmental imputhow much stress how much light you get from there also can highly impact sleep even if you have a good circadian and hemostatic drive if you getting rough light at the long time of the day or of your being stressed and thinking ate then your sleeps cannot suffer you have to think of the three together to have a beautiful sleep a exile and that is why we came up with the try parted mora the same thing happens with feeling i could beautifully put it to people your hunger your energy level is measured by the fruit newbies your daily stick of food is again dependent on the sea and an light dark in put we find that if food is not available there is yet the third input that is not depend on their sign not depend on the arcuate depending on a completely bray different brain regions the animal can actually start looking or the human cast looking for food when it scars even at time when they are not supposed to be acted that is how the organism think they have to evaluate multiple inputs for them to decide what is the best physiological out come at that moment at that sees i say am i want t get into fruit and feeding but just to keep a measure we can you keep our hands around the a try airtight model finershan correctly we have got the circadian influence then you have also got the drive to sleep my is one of the ways that i think that can be best understood is if somebody ever pulls in all night or they get tired around eleven or twelve or and then very tired around three for i am but then even if you stay up some time ride around seven or eight a m your normal wake up time you start to feel alert again exam was because the sleep drive is extremely strong but there is a circadian rhythm that tries wakefulness on me locate that is two of the components before we get into the feeding component i wants to about these direct effects of light on mood ora giegofernandasdata and this perry hobenular strath sue let us just for the moment satisfied the try part of the try parttiht model and just focus on what are the direct effects of light on mood and the way that i interpret what you set far as that the protocol that emerges from this if one is trying to optimize their mood is yes see light view light i should say early in the day in order to set your circadian clock maybe also in the evening as well and of course avoid light at night at get end as dim as possible however you said it is also a good idea to get as much bright light during the day as you safely can in order to improve your mood independently of regulating your sleep lakeside and that is a hypuscleses here is the problem the it is not get to be as satisfying as the circadian is that as this brad region has been discovered very recently habenula the very happy you to we have known about it a long time but nobody knew what it did we knew about the habitual but that is why the name is confusing it is actually not the habituates o it is the very have gone near then it is near thewhenche is called the member hotel lucky i should a i do not why maybecause if you do that it is not a get the case for wherever after the perry habenour learnucleus we should probably call the hoar end i bananas bersonaan this is nerdy asides attribution stuff but ism just going to call the hot nucleus am wicapedia lighted up a o case this structure is taking light and independent of sleep rhythms in circle rhythms it is driving chiton end how does it do that is this through the opening system the cere an ready we still recently we have an identified division very well we don't know what like dust wait we do not know how wit to act this is an area that desire for discoveries and we are working on this fight dow but that is why it is not such fine this is the function of sleep why do we sleep we no sleep is very important to us but we still do not have it satisfying function of why tho we sleep right see we have a we questions the while questions i think it is our our good friend and colleague at universe washing in rusbeen elder who always says when somebody ask why that the best answer is just to say i was not consulted the nine exactly by none of us really now not the point is maybe i should have sit why what is the function of sleep it is still very hard to know why would what is the reason organisms have to go off line for long people assume its for repair assume its for learning and memory assume all kind of sup but there is really no clear function for sleeping there is no clear function for sleeping m if you toke to people there are hypotheses we all we knows that if you do not sleep we your sand is very fraction you get stop you and you could die you right i mean it it is really bad if you do not sleep but we do not know what is the function what is the what is that sleep have gone to organisms that could not have done with rest what if you just could rest without sleeping just sit down an rest well t my labs trying to figure out whether not these non sleep deep rest protocols can compensate for for sleep in not women sly sleep is better but many people are not got getting the sleep that they need but i but one and if people are sensing that sambar and i are about to start talking over each other and arguing that is always the go when e look right unlike other scientists i interact with when simmer and i get together it is considers successful conversation if we get into a big fight and the ow for a big meal were i pick the restaurant one let us talk about food and eating and appetite you had yet another yes i i greatly admire your your success in in this way yet another incredible discovery showing that therefore directs of direct excuse me effects of light on appetite and feeding behavior to may you could u summarize those results and o for and honestly that paper is the one that allowed us to come with the try part they noble because we were thinking completely wrong about it we wanted this experiment it it be fun for your audience to hear why we started this experiment remember that when we discover the ipiargesees we figured if they are the only real really to entrap the circadian clock then you could kill them and have an animal opposite to the one that we spoke or human opposite to the one that we spoke about early were instead of having no pattern vision and half circadian for in trainmen we could produce an animal that half pattern vision but no circanding fort in train a circadian blind circadian blind but water sited and we succeeded in that the problem when you have these animals which have told you many times already is that they do not adjust to the day night cycle doing experiments on them become very complicated a what is there behavior if you do not have these cells are they wake in then sleep they a things drift the humans we have stoke to think there in lost vagus they know a her work be a the day up later every night they come either depend the o'clock if it is the o'clock is shorter they come in earlier if their clock is longer they come into the really mass they they really do not justice if they were in the while there be eliminated in i see trig there's noway thin so me and the egosarti token were like what if we use none light in training agent and what is the stringing man light in training avion for we thought that the light defective animals well have more sensitivyted to food and train because as more than me this is an area that you worked really well on for vision if your image blind your hearing and and som to sensually get improved right the the lack of vision improves your hearing and sensation but we found actually that if you do not have the light system actually your feeding ai the food ability to untrained the animal got completely to the ground completely opposite to what we predicted light viewing and feeding behavior are interacting in ways that support one another and that is why we came with the tripartite motor we figure is different than sensation of the environment when you sense with vision vision and hearing inter act but your vision is a real full mortality you want to see that is what vision want to do you want to hear that is what hearing want to do you want to sense that is what sensing one to do but for the circadian system light food all the in training avion they somehow have to inter act to keep a coherent system you do not just assume if you remove light this one is going to be stronger know they need to know each others the light informs when the animals can i eat o what i about this much is that in the other in the world outside of science in which i i do not really exist in but that i i see a lot of this kind of wellness stuff at is all this mine body integration stuff it is interesting because people view the body more as a system by the system of organs that interact as opposed to the way that standard science and medical profession is you wart on the liver or your our nose and throat or hasten long or brain that is a realer way of thinking you but the biology is integrated y am in and for somebody whose interested in affecting their eating behavior something that your familiar wit and that we will talk more about your experiences of in a moment how should they use light in order to adjust their eating behavior now that have told you about all this interaction between the different inputs of car candid clock just you think about it as an engineer what would be the best thing the best thing is to know when your food times happen in the day when should you get light and where is your circa when is your circadian clock in your system right if you eat at very specific times of the day that is another signal that is telling your body your clock your in a certain time of the day if your having lunch at the great time every day and you are getting bright now you have too systems that are informing you o'clock your o'clock is get to be better regular meal time regularly mean tiles that fit your circadian clock and in fact if you do that when when i started doing this and it help me lose way is that ism exposing myself to the right amount o fly darcycle ism eating at regular time it is amazing you would be not hungry we sale a you eat at noon you will not feel any hunger at the living forty five and then all of some the hunger just this is clearly not an enervation because that could not be that drafty i know the desire to eat is mainly driven by these i these cusses hormone us that are very exquisitely time to exact sleep wake cycle but also to light exactly and in the while you could imagine why energy left us through the accurate is arcuate you cation explain the people what the arcuate is cause i do not think we have done that adequately the ancient new places an area of the hypothalamus that drives hunger and feeding behavior and what we are talking about is the fact that it is taking us from your viewing of light believe it or not is impacting your level of hunger and a this is a a nontrivial way in which you are timing of hunger and amount of hunger is regulated by when and how much light you view let me ask you a couple prawn i just this is really before ask me sorry and i sold began afire but to me is is the the interesting thing to think about it in the while when you did not have that visibility of food that we have the fruit playing you imfortantrol because if you are not if you were not successful in getting food then the arcs gan i tell you look you have to take risk and go get food because your energy lefter is very long and that is great that tums of great desert about that but i think what is missing is the fact in humans wen not getting to a situation most of us we not getting to a situation where we have lo energy levels most of the time actual we eat not because we want to because we are really have lo energy but because we want to eat i think that is why i feel that the timing is very important for us because we always have enough energy lev for stay i may i enjoy eating much that it'll eat just for the sensation of chewing thru i may i i enjoy the taste too and i enjoy the social aspects an tower are a part of it but i i literally enjoy the physical as on chewing absolutely ah which explains a lot am of how regular are you war do you recommend people be about meal times because what ism hearing is that light viewing behavior is pretty straight for get a lot of light in the morning and throughout the day minimize it in the evening and at night generally speaking forsake of mood incircaten rhythm but forsake of regulating timing and quality i i should also say of food in take because people clearly make better choices about food in take when they a anticipating a meal and they are not constantly hungry and the ability to regulate hunger for particular phases of the circadian cycle is is quite valuable for all people not just people trying to loose with but all people are we talking about down to the minute a ineptly right pluses twelve noon is my normal lunch let us say a bluer mines half an hour book eat about between eleven thirty and twelve thirty if if that is the time and depends if you also do multiple meals remember time meals that is decision that somebody came up with i do not know why nowadays people fewer people are doing that now i you and our friend such and as wore rid i mean you could have two meals you could have very multiples meals not or distributed across your active time i i agree with such is found us work that try to avoid eating when your system is suppose to be axing when you are supposed to be a not active time limit your eating to the active time if your a your cycle and that seem to be an sort cashes doing some beautiful stuff on ness that seem to be incredibly important for a aspect of the circadian and for health and for the i mean such in i were referring to such an and as work you wrote a beautiful book called the circadian code maybe summer with with some luck you will write a book as well am meaning the world would be lucky to have that book a but such ins at a really strongly point to the fact that liver health brain health metabolic factors and indicant factors and in o very systems and organs all seem to benefit from having a period of each twenty four hour day and which we are not eating anything and then eating at very regular sometimes let us talk about eating an meal times and let us move a little bit away from the the science for the moment although we will return to it and talk a lot bit more about your experience a with eating and meal times a you look it in good shape lately thank you i know you've been putting work in to it yet we talk a lot and you've been exercising and you have been a be eating well meaning quality food youth came back from jordan where and assuming the food is amazement it is the food is amazing and honestly usually i gain an oifweight in jordan but this time i in gain any weight which was ready nice or yet you have you have d when i met you you were probably about hundred pounds heavier than you are now a two hundred and seventy five pounds of two hundred nineteen no it is grave had a lot of bigger than in you've a lot of vigor now but i know that you undertook a very specific protocol in order to lose the way based on your understanding of the circadian system men of light and appetite and mood a maybe you could just tell us also bit about what that casual looks and we realize that this is not a prescriptive for everybody but you found what worked for you may be just describe those and geology i followed my circadian cycle right a what we have talked about i i did height at night i slept at regular ours i at my measure food in breakfast on launch when am really active and am really hungry and at night when i avoid dinner because my circadian system really shuts off at three ism an early person you could give me anything i would eat before three after three nothing appeals to me any one my system is shut off but what time are you going to sleeping what i me a also an my cases i should have put this i may i go to sleep literally at nine a nine p m i mean i literally five minutes after nine p m ism completely out and i wake up between four thirty and five m if i extended i got six a m but very rarely defense of how tired i was and that as i recall was in important set of changes for you i be able to regulate your foodies absolutely because then ism having very big breakfast at and again for different people as different i have a big breakfast at seven a m maximum i have a big breakfast coffee and all the stuff then i have some simple shark around ten then i have regularly lunch at noon or between noon to on then i have another snack at three and the hardest time to regulate the food is between twelve and three this is one am i really feel hungry oiler equivalent of kind of late evening from us yes thou me mud pally between seven and ten p exactly exactly and then at night am am completely not hungry but usually as you said the bureau the the enjoyment of food when my wife kids cook some really beautiful india food i eat but ism not hungry and i notice if i eat with that i usually gain wat but if i regulate that at night i also loose wat there is a combination of all these things that help you a just is this a ta the input of food that i put o fly in put of the clock and the drive to hunger ye i appreciate you sharing that tend and i will not emphasized that some people are not hungry early in the day they might be late shifted people and which case eating later in the dey w w work well work as long as they do not eat early in the morning that is just you have to work with your scandal with your active cad ye you not been talking bout this awfuline for years am glad work finally having this discussion publicly now we were talking out really is finding your ideal sleeps casual exactly ens a finding your ideal eating scare exactly and understanding how those two things interact and do the nice thing as you said finding them out is going help you to under want had de interact because we know from the try parted to that they are all interconnected and for each person they can a be interconnected differently for each person you would er o for me if i exercise at night am gan a miss up my whole system blend you exercise morning morning works cat for me i mean it is amazing morning exercise for me works great if i tried one time because it was easier for me to exercise at night before i leave when the traffic is therefor that i sign i think that miss me out because i could sleep well and i count wake up well and that lit to more changes my woo i ain't wait again actually believe it or not even though i was exercising i think this really makes me think that you have to think of the trypartat noble to sleep where is the best times and what is the best interrelation between the different component as you beautifully said tween your meal times your light exposure and your sleep that works for you you will thank you that usually servers in salting me to day he is complimenting me of any compliment in right back by saying i this is the first time that have ever really understood how yes li can control sleep pelican in control mood yes i can in pact feeling but that it is really about doing the self exploration to a line those in the way that works bast in what am hearing tell me from wrong but when am hearing is that once you understand what gives you the best sleep wake cycle then you should exercise during the period of time in which you feel most alert en if it works for your casual i really you would also eat during the time in which you feel most alert and then stop eating and stop luring behavior as you had towards sleep the only thing i would say that complicates all of this and that is what makes me sad is your light exposure mind personal you s that the people's light exposed right this is what complicates it because your not going to be able to figure all this out if you are shifting yourself out of your comforts on by viewing by wearing light at the wrong times the day let us say this say you are if you were under an idle natural conditions your person who would sleep later than me let stay will sleep at midnight and wake up at right a m this say you do not eat anything till noon and as you said you eat late in the evening then this would be perfect for you but now see what happens if you now you include the life component now if you push your sleep for midnight before i m now your waking up in the morning and you you are actually really not the morning your working poor at noon instead of eight o'clock and the time were you not supposed to be hungry now you get a start eating directly at moon or something that or even delay and now you shifting your whole cycle and you do not know if this interaction between your sleep feeding and the light dark environment it'll sleep i be mentioned or uses and that is the problem that people have to as ism hearing that what i m realizing is most of us probably me included a messing up at least one two or three of these compose but that the that the the probe the way the to figure out what is right for oneself is to start manipulating light exposure and i ism going a be honest am bias cause i believe that life is the stronger is the strongest time given and we lot of people disagree some people think feeding is i always thought that light was the primary zit giver the primary ya at lot of people think it is food lot of people even sometimes mention social inter actthey read the literature i i agree with you i i tote tat you admit my understanding is that light is the most powerful driver of the things for that is a i think we need to regulate this first and everything else fits and the nice thing is that you sleep we cycle and exercise tell you really bluntly if you're doing a trip or not tell me more about that i tell you more when i shifted my exercise honestly thinks fell upon never before when you moved from exercising early in the t the morning the ya it completely fill up art for me i did not enjoy exercise that night my pan talents for exercise was a asked ism talking with an equals one d ism aware of this a never tested this empirically but at least to me it really missed up everything i start an having prombicaus my buy temperature would go up and that well affect my sleep by possibly was running in the him with low of lights for maybe the light was a combonan but for me exercising in the morning it is much better for me but lot of people cannot even think of exercising the morning it depends on when you feel comfortable in your sleep recycle and your exercise i think that tells you if your sister is in in sinkriy with one a that is really interesting your i we were good friends are our friend pat davit ether we both now did nine years and sill teams and he is one of these people says he is happy to he go for runners when any time between four thirty i m and six i m an my all train in the afternoon too cause naris seating gun not to whatever any time that is part of the find type but he feels best doing that right ism amid i exercise midmorning and ism happy skip eating until twelve or one and i to go to sleeper on eleven thirty twelve cause ism a normal human being rather than you who goes to bed at nab yo at actually i never asking what rat beats i deal to sleep time have asked in this we be around eight thirty or nine one a a never yes yes but he has a two young children two years old and a new born and the cycle is destroy a that is no right i mean that the effect of child very and i think the we could talk about this that is more complicated but that is pretty pretty much i ye i m i think we need to come up with a new name for a prototype because chronicireal implies there is just about sleep and wake being an early murder a night owl and what were also talking about is how exercise and eating match on to those and the was relation ran the phases between from composes as you said cause they interest because they inti highland they do not have to be in the same face let us save my light and food could be very close t each others your life and food could be different right the cases do not have to b t cant be planting you have to find this for yourself you may you may be a person who eats late at night exercises late at night or you may be a person of exercise early eat later it does not as long as the face is is good that is what you that is what you have to find out and if i understand erectly when you time at face relationship it means you want to lump exercise feeding and light for asleep and sleep in a way that as i coherent and total system makes you feel really good temporally in great order absolute ya that is and i think that at i could tell you to me is literally getting exposed to som clearly in the morning clearly at noon i go out i keep my windows in the office completely open eating mostly in the early time of the day and exercising and literally at the end part of the day am literally in a more thoughtful vegetative state i really cannot a after five i tell my science if you want o tell me anything complicated you wasting your time my brain just does not function even though i only sleep at night but ism really starting to shut off ram down really i mean it is i could send e man to about brainless stuff but my power my energy to to do powerful stuff really drop tremendously all my students who know me very while they put the meetings with me early in the morning case they notices went on everything for me and for me is very tired it could be different from is very cluster in the morning is all tied together and literally the remaining part seems to be just day you not vegetative sting yet you and my a body castellan who in fortune pass away recently and that in a did not that a sell was allowed good friends yeas sorry to break it to you with a here ya he he had a good long life and he he went easy but he had a circadian clock the basing with a sleep around twenty four hours o day an minimal activity interspersed every third day or an you do have this morning vigor yes and that ism that i think other people can have more of an afternoon victor do you think that this can change across the life spend that it is the the rumor is that teen ages naturally want to sleep in later and stay up later do you think that social with or do you think that that is actually by large meet that is a tough question i mean that it it it could be both one thinks withal words means that it seems that if anything with age this morning it rigor gets stronger seen you ant people become more of morning more or wise i were you i think that is good because for me am already a very shifted morning i do not want a best one of the seven p m to one m sleepers at some point n on the other hand it is it is also cone a nice because it is quiet in you can get ya but honestly from four thirty to seven thirty in my wife wake up it is it can be very long yes your chief at but it is quite outside it is you know it i i do not want to be at one the with is i do not con tell same is more social than i am that is in that is true you on should touch on that actually your wife is she follows a different casual ya and and a social within is important let i think but what should we do how she conceptioalises and how should we just ourselves according to the so and i honestly love this this this hypotheses that people came up with an and pats kids reminded me off because kids are really gan a the slip your sleep weeks ice it seems there say wrong attraction that usually people who attract each others have actually different sleep wakes actual and the idea being is that this loss to take care of their kids through you the tininess islands have a peaceful merit and have these vomarishin to i me reader had give me outrageous or may be this is but it seems evolution make sense that if you want to protect your protect your kids you do not want everybody to be morning trigger and than the kids do not have you want the distributed as at say an it is a reasonable argument i heard that one of the reasons that people think that the clock is not exactly twenty four hours but is twenty four hours plusher minus twenty minutes or is because we believe that we evolved in clans or groups villages whatever that were about a hundred to two hundred people and in order to have protection around the early morning hours when wee car ontepredation and in the late night hours that you would want some individuals of of our species to be naturally more night hours and some more early people your ism theory of parenting is is similar in that way i the social rhythm is is a powerful rhythm though meaning if i go out and ism tired let us say ism tiredly nine thirty a do not one a go out li cnanlytis say something about that i think the social with is powerful at the obvious levels it affects your sleep it affects how much you wake up or et but ism not sure is as powerful as people think on the cloknow eventually tail mess up the clock because now if your doing a law of social at nice getting in a flite eating at the long time of the day eventually you cannot have an effect but i do not think thus the social interactions himself have been shown to affect your clock very slowly for some reason that is good to know we i for be hearing this the proxy getting the impression ism the night owl and then same is the one it is in bed at nine and then a wakes up at four but having attended many meetings with samurai can tell you that he is the party animal let us talk about that i mean least talk about the fat the year h o the partner if he's up until two dancing at these at these various meetings which have seen have cash good dancer ism told but what should we do when we do stay u very late for whatever reason could be because we had to take midnight trip to the hospital that unfortunate reason or could be because you are in the presence of people that you do not see very often and you a and you go out for a really nice night out on the town and you and you get to sleep round two thirty or three in the morning how should one get back on scandal do you force yourself to then get up an i you light at the normal time that you would get up in you order you allow yourself to sleep in what what is the promo i would allow myself to sleeping and remember this is a long term if this is something that you live with for a long period and and remember i told about the experts we did with the mod these require two weeks of that lights caul to cause m mod disturbances these do not happen just in single day this is the way you justify staying out late every one well in that the meetings you seen me have done this for five or six days continuously but what you did not see that when i came back to my home it took me two weeks as if i did e jetlag i really do suffer for two weeks after doing the six crazy art of staying up at big drinking at the room him of the day it is not that a completely of care with it when i go back everything goes back it takes me actually literally two weeks to recover from the car cade rite meeting that you seen me parting a a at some poles and of ironic circling i know rathe making you a tolly destructing the ferritin sir but a sciences i human beings to in i i think if you do it at very little occasions i think you should not worry too much that this would have lasting in pact and the good news is that if you readjust you scandal you could come back with the problem is when you maintain these wrongs caul for pronto and becomes chronic prolong peers of tam that is when you have the problems and the accumulation of the problems when you have sleeping problem ye produce metallic problem have hauler problems to produce lack of exercise and you could see how things conspire out very quickly and then it would be hard to come back to it or certainly sleep disruption is both a symptom of and yes a cause of almost all absolute mental health deserves right and certainly the metabolic and germs that people are talking about nowadays and all of this it all finals back to light this is not remarkable yes and we have these devices and i i use my phone and i use my computer but do you think that the mere dimming of the screen or not interacting with screens aft with it say ninety minutes or two hours before bedtime according to what were saying to day this should have a profound effect an in dot always and i really believe it dos and i again i think spat has j did the this is inventions where you get a pouch where you put you for in a parch is when by summers referring to is our friend pat am this a for me guilty member that we that i was also very impressive person in landscape of business and family et camera real a superhuman from aby any regard am has this habit of taking his pone and putting into a seal pouch yon evening it basically and in his war he sends you actually these the sea only an batches and and that i think is is a great idea because not only it pul take away the light from you but it also take away the distraction because you want to repair and recover and sleep just that and if you have your for dinging all the time or or the light flashing from it is you just not getting enough sleep and your coming yourself measure problems i never ask you this but i realized now that i i should have long ago but it'll ask you now when how did you get into all the staff yah i mean honestly i i first of all i wanted to become a you now wanted to study genetics and i knew i wanted to do page the ingenatics but i only got except n one universe at the time and i joined the learning and memory lav and i learning and memory at the beginning i worked on the snails on a pleaseyecarifonican and started looking at learning and memory but then the same lab was looking at this daily variation i was really stark you never think about it outside the science it really struck me that organisms can measure day bylogicaly that was very shocking to me and i just really got attracted and i wanted to see why does this happen what is the effect of different times of the and i just struck with it it just it was my blowing for me who was in medical school that eve never heard about it before it is really amazing medicine i think still now we are very good at looking at stafspacially but we very bad at looking at temporal aspects we always fee no to see images static images specially inform me i taken ear i measure after measurable a exactly rat we do not think of them pol and and you talk to on hogwash now and is telling you the importance of croon medicine or crone formed come to whatever the word is and it just it really just getting the the drugs at the right time of the days can be essential for our heart you thing that cannot come from using better trackers am or arrange whoopstraps these hands i i love the trackers but i think there's even more exciting discoveries now you could take a single blood sample and measure many biological components and figure where you are in the circadian lo something that was very hard to do before if you have i marker to know where you are in the clock you could actually under stand more the effect of everything exercise feeling blighting pot what is the marker there are some papers from e i what is an utilize and from a thin crater were they measure multiple are inane that unknown to tell you what face of the clock is or multiple e protects or biological reactions and depending on e combination of fact that not a single fact that you could tell where you are in the circadian clot they could instead of just measuring temperature or rigatoni just one measurement and millions silly is also complicated by the fact that million is acted by light and and temperature your temperature an sleep can be easily dissociative right when you travels different times when your sleep at different times in the temperature will s having multiple components measure will give you better determination of your circadian face and understanding your circadian pase in humans we will tell you what is the effect of giving certain drugs at certain times of the circa face or in the future this is going to be studied at e much high level when you can better in the face in relation to old other staff it is striking to me that in all animals besides humans if they deviate too much from the appropriate exposure to light and light dark cycle they essentially do not mate end or die and or get killed off but in humans we are able to override that at least to some extent but the ways in which we suffer appear to be things obesity metabolic drums a re productive sindrums that are accompany the other centrums you o enteron centrums and woodland depressive disorders is there any effort at the level of the the nationally or re laboratories t your where of to try in use light in order to improve mood and mental health i mean honestly this is my mouth this is the thing that i think people because it is i i say do not take people take a forgot and not a man you take piss the important i am just making it that really we have an opportunity your right now with the incredible advances of eddy lives of changing sector flight of regulating intensities and just to assai just as for simple changes you could really improve sleep wakes kcal proactivity and still you could actually get more done because as we have talked about when you have all these master now you have to sleep more but your sleep is fragment it is not very good and you cant for as n toucans as locus we do not have alertness when you need the alertness having all these you could allow you to do even more actually and the and unless and that is that the exciting part of him one of the questions i get asked most often about is about eighty eight the i think there is a lot of self prescribed as well as clinically prescribed eighty eighty people r having a tremendously difficult time focussing and not just because their sleepy they just cannot seem to anchor their attention and there can be multiple reasons for this but there are now several clinical trials on going using light to try an anchor people's attention and mood and well being f or sake of focus and i think that while i love this saying that a you mention you take a futon not a pill and with do respect to the need for farmicology for some certain people think most people just having really died in their relationship to light in a way that allows them to rule out whether or not they need abdication absolutely that is the best way to put it i cannot after that let us talk about get lag but not in the contact of okay if somebody is travelling from rope to japan or from the second because that very tremendously right on me there's as many different veriatovs on travel as there are individuals out there and with grilse jobs et camera but rather let us talk about what or the two or three things that people can do to a just they scar quickly yesterday i called you and said luck i know somebody whose travelling six hours i will not even mention in which direction cause i do not want people to anchor to that example and you describe some very simple tools a viewing light a little bit earlier than normal and getting on the local foods casual et camera that would allow them to shift more quickly and the reason i want to have this conversation is yes for the travellers and for the a the shift workers but mostly because of the fact that you have proven again and again that people are disrupted in their circadian behavior at home what are the aside from what we have already talked about how can one a just quickly to a new casual let us a fall classes are starting you start new job r you have a babier or popular whatever what is the best way to shift the clock quickly it is very simple as we have to yesterday imagine you are i in the outside with no environment to with no industrial light if you if yourbody thinks you are in early evening and you see a bright light what does this tell you oh wait this is not early evening yet it is still early afternoon or late afternoon i have to delay myth clock to go back to late after if you get light early in the evening it delays your clock what does you need that makes you want t go a sleep later yes it delays yourclock you are in new york right people in italy have an advance clock because they they are six hours ahead of us if you're in new york and you get light early in the evening you delay even further from italy now your delaying away from italy now the same thing happens let us say you though down came of and you thought it is already dawn but it was less say three o'clock in the morning or four o'clock in the morning and then you get the bright light and you say await a minute do not it is not up yet i should advance my clock or at night but ism getting bright light i should run because don is already up then later in the night later in your night and actually just happens that humans you get a temperature n a dear later and then i temper temperature in your body after that lights tat advancing your o'clock if you want to go to italy instead of getting light early in the evening you want to get light after the temperature lo you could advance you o'clock even before you go to italy and you catching up to the italic's just by using one is as simple as that or you could do it for every region you could early how much there are advance of you you could know how much these like sifts happened pray and you can calculate what you what you need to do very simple ma to adjust either in direction of delay if your going from new you californium when a delay your clock or advancing if you are going from new york to italy in order to make that of visual and because a lot of people are listening to this not looking at our invidious we will put a a a doubt of a zero coss down loadable a figure of this on the he mermen lab dor come web sight relate to this episode but i think i can summarize it in on in language as well if i understand correctly what your saying is if your typical wake up time is a seven a m then your low point temperature probably occur somewhere round five a m and if you view light righter back around then it is going to essentially advance your clock because then your your body thinks a its seven o'clock to advance your o'clock by one to two hours but if i were to you light say at three a m then it would probably delay my clock ya ye and then us say i land in a new scandal i wanted just to newscadula sad in manage to do anything with my light viewing before i went out didn't i did not anticipate the trip suddenly on a new scared i was told that one of the ways to help shift the clock and to avoid eastern tasting issues is to eat on the local scared to start basically behaving a local even though your striating clock will take a lit of time to catch up absolutely but you have to remember the lie right let us let us now that we explain this very simply let take a very simple example right new york to italy that is simple example new york time italy time six hour difference right let us say you fly from new york at night you reach italy at eight o'clock in the morning what is the time in your new york time you although you read six hours a six you to and it is to a m when you land italy you want to avoid light the play car you could eat but you really do not want to get agamic as otherwise it is can are la an delays can e send you to californium instead of sending you to italy right and this is such a key point if any one's confused about this we will put some diagrams up but what same saying is crucial just because getting bright light in your eyes early in the day is really beneficial when your home when you travel to a new times on you have to take into account what your body thinks what excuse me you ha t to take into account where your body thinks you are and f you are looking at the italic sunrise having just flown from new york to italy and you did not prepare for that trip by waking up a little bit earlier in anticipation mulpoplte and movie light it to a excuse me it's at six or seven a m italic time beautiful italic sunrise you are going to delay your clock you are going to basically throw yourself back to californium but you are in italy you're it throw your biology back to californium and you are going to be up in the middle of the italic night and you are in to be is a miserable it'll tell a brief a an it jook use i called summer in desperation a few years ago i travelled to abudabby and why you abudabby to give a seminar twelve hours out of phase it's a twelve hour flip and i thought i could just muscle it i thought it'll get up just view sunlight when the sun comes up and i fell apart mentally and physically and summer came to my rescue i call them i said i do not know what to do and he said go to the him wet at the local dawn work out eat and then view sunlight starting the next day and that easily got me on to cancel i used food and exercise to adjust myself because my life young activity was just completely to wack i mean an an we take about other detail your have to caudate it but you are absolutely right i mean it is it is very important to avoid getting the own light information when you are trying to just your body because otherwise it shifts yo the other to the other side absolute going will you are one of these people that has such vigor it is onethese things were having known you all these years you have a tremendous capacity for work and for soccer and for arguing respect full arguing and sometimes you knows getting worse with h ye well we cut talk about that offline but i think a lot of your vigor and a lot of your ability to work hard and focus and really do many things at an impressive level is because you think about these issues and you you think about when you are going to be optimal for focus when you are going to be optimal for exercise when and the when is the key it is and i think a lot of people live in the landscape of feeling there something broken inside them because they cannot focus in tit up to lunches remember it is all subconscious these effects and under you are absolute rest no honestly joking aside about age i really agree with you that i think part of the rest and i continue to be able to do this that i really think about it and i make sure that i keep everything aline and and tot actually house me along i don suffer in sleep i do not suffer in waking up i never use a time or to wake out i mean people say are not you scared you have to give a texture at eight or seven pit animals that is noway ism going to go beyond that it just even if i try i cannot sleep beyond six am in my regular times it just its outran happen by fourthirty my eyes are wide a awake on bed it is just system is aline it works a lot of times people will say how come my go to sleep i fall sleep fine but that i wake up at three or four in the morning in cannot fall back asleep is it possible that those people were supposed to go to bed at eight p m it is possible i mean it is possible it is also possible that sometimes people pul wake up and go back to sleep but but ya i mean it is possible a or it is possible that their clock is completely saline that they are getting may be in that time that night when they are suppose and then they possibly feel sleepy in the day there all these are possible combination that is interesting adman considered i mean that what they think is the sleep their body is out of whack with the light our cycle that it actually a henna or or the weaker part of the sleep i mean you see this in in when you travel to different times on before you are just you go to sleep really well but two hours later you fully out two hours if you were tired and this is your regular sleep there is no way you get a wake up in two hours then you feel very sleepinater in the day or something that it depends of how your whole system is aline to the n mar that is very interesting idea i i i think that is on a resinate with a lot of people i wake up every morning around am three or four i generally use about men than i fall back a sleep very very deeply does not seem to disrupt my daytime wakefulness am and i think a our people of sass over that that waking up and worry their summing wrong provided they can go back all exile its if you cant go use the auto go back sleep that should not be a prommaybe some people when they go to use the bottom the use very bright light and then they get an alerting signal if if you maybe that i could be as simple as that that affix you maybe when you wake up you put times o fly or start reading your eyes there is all these combination that we still do not know about that could be affecting their sleep wake three them an their sleep maintenance do use millstone and at you take mellatoneen i do not need it to be on in my case there is no reason to use it because i could guarantee you that by maybe eight o'clock my persona has already started to go up and by the time i sleep my ketone is very high because i do not use e more fights after sunset and light in habits millstone and life really blunksma ton an level but you hear thesis that the pine gland a caltsofies as we get older is that anything about i en give heard about that but i do not know how what does i mean there is not very clear evidence that affix the sleep i do not know much about it to be on sir the evidence that have seen is that yester some falsification around the pine just because o were it sits in the in the brain am it is close to some agony on o structures but i do not there is any evidence that it has negative effects the mean if if you still have you could measure men atone an that should tell you if it has the i such an easy thing to do i think this is more of a of a internet wellness thing that hones but that got outside the manage her absolutely right yen i sounds terrible calcification years that the thing right a the hard thing i ye exactly a let us talk about seasonality a little bed i learned and i do not know if this is still true a but that most suicides occur in aril in the spring i think there is a poems as arils the cruelest month i think it bees the poem begins a a the data that suicides are more frequent it is particular times of year and if is the spring that time of year i mean lot of people talk about this and and one of the hypothesis that is that the winter months that are very bad for mood say people not wanting to do anything and they have they get into such deep level of depression that when the sun comes up they get actually the energy to act on their depression with sons really terrible and it is terrible throats that is the idea that the lack of light toast the winter was them to go into such depression that they do not feel doing anything and when the light comes in with rigor in the spring it gives them that after all the depression they suffered gives them that push too to take that san final i and i guess what other seasonable effects have been demonstrated in human t i mean i think in humans is not very clear because we do not think about seasonality but if you start thinking about us i think we goes through maser season or changes i really do i think our eating paten change across the i could tell you that me thinking about this there is a clear changes that happens to me across the year but for animals this is really essential because for animals they have to time their mating behavior is when they deliver their the progeny in the most abundant amount of food and artificial light is causing maser disruption because if you change the way these animals are receiving height information they either start making much earlier or much later and their numbers dwindle and they get into the rangers of really completely getting enumerated or teamed o human birthrights are dealing going down i me not in he you in the ours insogiary the at others not other right an but or the rather effects of seasonality on humans that we are aware of i honestly you could see it honestly could see it perfectly i thing in in stand navy i mean you could talk to people and who live in sure they get seasonable depression what season depression is one but actually when you start asking them questions they tell you in the winter they barely could wake up they barely have the energy for even depression even people who do not get season a depression they will tell you our energy loveless lower our i belief it go to work is is not the same and in the summer most people actually sleep very little they tell you we we really can we feel demonic we have all this energy and nothing in negative way in if on we right i mean but if you want a sleep we have to put these curtain i think in these situations you could really appreciate the seasonably of humans i think we kind of destroyed our seasonality because we do not get exposed to that much natural light we have all this artificial light but i think honestly one of the think that is gan a happened if they follow you recommendations about giving light at the same time giving food giving ego less be clear those of your regiment will a me a just a an just heir attribution what say is that this is gan a cause them to also experience some changes across the seas an because now they get us see the sun differently if you get a go out in the morning in the summer you get a get tin much brought that is why do not the change in time i know people think all because your buy us to because i think we sorry the change you return by daylight save and daylight saving it is such a bad idea because it disrupt that rhythm that your having cause i think your buy if you keep that writhen you will see the whole seasonality and i look at it from a different aspect than other people it really and people say on by us because i morning person and i may be true but this situation conspiracy but morning people but this is if you think about it and the is a situation were you are getting light perfectly well and then allofson they delay by one hour because and then even though it is the summer your buddy now if your still not a busting think always what happened what kind of happened o ism glad you bringing thyself because i always thought in what is the big deal one hour right one hour slept yo springs of tarot at just one our but the but this goes back to the beginning of our discussion it is not just one right because it is one hour across that one day but lore isle cumulative effect on the clock and the the three elements of your la try partite model it ut our hemostatic sleep and the exact effects a and when it is close it is sometimes hard to if figure out how to adjusted perfectly because were already sleep deprived in our society and then you shifted by i it just it all accumulates and it has no benefit i you work at a major government organization national institute mental health i on we you campaign for i have no idea a may it makes loan saying who we go campaign you last to and it it makes sense to have the summer light goes up at nine p m the light goes down where i live in baltimore at nine p m and then all of sudden when you really want to see the light longer in the day shift the other way and now it goes orison at six seem why do you do these drastic changes will let it blend across the whole season yes later earlier at night but it is at least consistent it goes in a very consistent matter i just do not understand why they do this it makes no sons well i think that the reason they do it is because they do not understand the by alit shot because one hour seems trivial unless you understand that the deprecations of that one hour shift because what is also clear now by ton what your saying is that that one hour shift is taking you out of alinement with the natural light dark cycle in exactly the wrong direction it is pushing people to get even later in the summer when light is going to push later anyway it does not make sense you put it beautifully i just ramble and this is on or you made it you made it clear having it is literally it made you it make people who are having problem having an advance sleep war them because they are delayed now you give them this hour to make them even more delayed you push them even later in the daylight since it just does not makes of at all i think twenty twenty two should be the year that we a balloon man ten saying to day for me honestly well i sand well also if it has a plosive effect on the what is essentially an epidemic of mental health issues and other issues related to improper interactions with light that i think us is a well work while cause and aloud can we car for once wee in a fight with some with another omen lo warming battles pop with olein the circadian people house ti to give them credit have been trying for years to abolish day light saving yet the premiers they all go to sleep an nine p m and wake up it four m we never see them another cicinion a community has done in amazing job of figuring out what we need and then the challenge of course is making sure that people get what they need and making sure that at a societal level we are not and solving ourself into the rand the retest problem is that the late waking people they think that really and ism on try to put in a better way now they think of because your morning for us and you want to see the sun early you want me to suffer it dropping but that is not the case because what happens is when they shifted back after the daylight saving now they get a make you suffer really badly because now is going to be earlier right in the fall in the fall where there is nothing o light i they even the same way try to convince them that actually this at the end cause it more trouble when you need the line for your late sexual in the full when they shifted back then they say keep in daylight saving all the time and that has been proven that is very back people have done studies that literally too tries close to each others and a is that word the whole year on daylight saving has much more problems eve n in cancerades in depression you do not want to do that that is what trying to convince people that you need to prevent that is which and you do not need they light saving at all that is where the problem happens interesting i had not thought about that but yes you lay risers that in the fall when they when that is you fall back as they see spring forward fall back you tall back the clock it is really compounding the problem that all the hangers and it is really nice if you think keep it consistent in the spring you get the lo when u get the equinox and then the days start going up and then even in the summers are going the and then the fall you get the other equinox and go back it is very symmetrical right it goes into short day longer loon tan short day again but now you getting these barms in both sides of the spring and for why would you do that something that is beautifully symmetrical beautifully smooth you putting bumps into it while en we and not just beautiful because it is there but i but evolved a meanly this is this an my of all the fir season aery's our monster even apart from the exact equator every part of the earth have seasonality and one of briefly touch on something which is individual anchenetic variation in sensitivity to light as an not chronotyte but a first o all very basic question an do people with light eyes light colored eyes are they more sensitive to light than people with darker pigmented eyes i mean honestly it makes sense they'll be more because if you think of of my dark pupil it is blocking moon light if you have light pupil yes for vision it may not be very obvious but for something that is measuring the to to flight you getting more light than me you probably need less light to be effective as as somebody whose darker and and that maybe could explain why sometimes high to people say i do not want o going to very bright conditions because it is really bright yell i cannot i cannot even be at a came without one of these reflective tables are a metal table unless i have very dark sone glasses of there bright it is painful thing whereas some people you we sat outside their meals an a fine i soon nose cave your dining toughness no does i of it is really t a pupil blocks more light i think it is possible that is as simple as the pupil blocking for light can have sensitivity but you question is also goes deeper are there more sensitivity differences an and my understanding would be you woulds think that it may be depends on how effective yourselves are in responding to light how how healthy your i pirogi sees are i would but there is not many studies to show that what is really clear that is happening is that patience with my cooler they seem to have different sensitivities to light it seems that at least people who have a psychological o a changes they may have difference to the sensitivity of light where are those differences in a particular direction i do not remember the exact after we can look in out ye e i you know and people have heard me say the ad museum to the point where they actually roll their eyes but that these are the only two pieces of brain on pointing to my eyes folks that a outside the craning of vault they are to pieces of brain that it basically inform the brain about whether not to be alert or slip but you can imagine that those two low pieces of brain that we call eyes would have genetic variations e rot i color is genetically mogul is that determined am that there would be genetic variations based on whether or not your ancestry of all near the equate or further from the equator i ma you see more blue eyes and scanniavy a yo e i man i the lack of light the said you need more less in ambition because there's not in a fly try that is the idea of the changing color a h i do not liker with you i may i think this is an hairier that will be studied later and will be imperially determine the problem we have in this field right now which i think is the biggest problem is we do not have a way to measure the i piano see sensitivities inhuman we still it is easy to measure you rot con function if you go to on obtemetres they measure all the details i contrasted a look at the char you scout the the scan charily look at the letters of the gan we ye but for the none subconscious we still do not have a good measuring systems to figure out what is and sensitivity what is summer sensitivity what is this person density and i think were starting to work on something that to hopefully developed these signings but till developed them it is cannot be very hard to figure out if there is a sensitivity difference how de de relax an on men a woman darken in lithe and older you normal verse a psychologically on effect and stuff that fascinating o and every time you talk i learned much it is a o in the best way the best sense of of the term its et i it is a waterfall of knowledge as a final question i have a question about sensitivity of a whole other kind and that is the sensitivity to spicy food now the reason ism asking this question what seemingly out of the blue is that i made the mistake once of having summer cook for me and i said not to spicy and he said cane not to spicy ashes that woken not too spicy and it almost killed me i use lie two or three days a lot about biology outside the visual system light et camera you've been around a while are there known genetic were an inherited of any kind sensitivities to you spicy food to things red peppers an causation because what you call mild my friend almost put me into the hospital i think this i silver using ocean i mad the god the glow the ikon true to i cold water swims a as tin but then that o change it is at i a in a distill that is li before i matrass i was you and at once i thought o et look spice up i is tat yo ho spicy my fools civil cilduaro to it its to a forgive you easy were you thing is that marriage coffin you o go as the coly of maybe that maybe that is the seen yo ye summer this has been am an amazing march through the importance of light not just for regulating sleep in wakefulness but also for food timing the interactions with mood the interactions with exercise ism certain that people are going to start thinking about how to change the relationship with light as a way to anchor everything that they do in that is important to their health and i just on behalf of all of them ant and just directly for me as your friend and as a colleague for many years now m i just want to say thank you for the incredible work your doing and for sharing with us thank you much an actually no thinking about all of this an you said i should write the book i should write the book an come de try partake motel i think that would put old descooners together would be very intrusting to do at someone you should write a book you would read they will probably try and change the titles to food mood and you i is tin as a but then fleeing little pain the trinary model or whatever i but regardless of what it is called i you absolute yo write a book and am and if you would summer to write a book or if you to learn more about hand let us talk lover about where people can find you your laboratories of the nationalistitutes of mental health he is head of the chronology unit all these things that have mentioned earlier but i you are active on tittering instrogram i what is your a twitter handle it is at samrhatar and welling we will provide a length for that and in the shown a the yes a the truer samrhatand i think the same for integral and summer i has been coaxed on instead he does post from time to time mostly pictures of food that is am incredibly spicy a but also information about chronobiology he comes on for an instergram live every one's in while with me and ism defy give him a fall ow there and o and on twitter and am and ism sure that he will be happy to answer questions a and isn't entertain any and all discussions about chronobiology absolutely a great thank you summer ass thank you a thank you for joining me for my conversation with doctor summer hater i hope you found it as interesting and informative as i did if you are enjoying this podcast and we are learning from it pal are subscribed our tube channel in addition please leave us comments and feed back in the common

welcome to the superman o science science tanto e i may are supermen and om a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine today my guest is doctor norland willies doctor willies is a medical doctor and professor of psychatrian behavioral sciences at stamford university school of medicine his laboratory and clinic focus on depression and other mood disorders they focus specifically on the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation which is a brain stimulation technique that can either activate or quiet specific brain circuits as well as circuits within the body in order to treat depression and other mood disorders other laboratories in clinics use t names what sets apart the work of norland willies in colleagues is that they combine t names with other treatments and some of those treatments are among the more cutting edge tat you have probably heard about these days including eibogine syllisiben m d me alibis d m t and other drugs that at this point in time are experimental in terms of clinical trials but that at least the preliminary data show hold great promise for the treatment of depression and other mood disorders in the course my discussion with doctor willies we covered things such as the history of each of these drugs how they came to be in their current status in terms of their clinical use and legality we also talk about their safety profiles both in children and in adults and we talk about what the future of psychedelic research and clinical use really lookalike for instance we discuss how a number of laboratories in clinics are modifying psychedelics to remove some of their hallucinogenic properties while maintaining some of their anti depress in or anti aroma properties you will also learn bout some fascinating research in doctor willies laboratory foison enemies which is a drug that is increasingly being used to treat depression and contrary to common belief the effects of redefine in terms of relieving depression may not actually arise from its dissociative effects one thing the you will find extraordinary about doctor willies is that not only does he have vast knowledge of the various treatments for depression but that he and his laboratory are really combining these treatments in the most potent way that is combining psychedelic treatments with brain machine interface or combining brain machine interface with particular learning protocols that is neuron plasticity protocols which can directly change the brain an specific ways to day your going to learn a tremendous amount about the neural circuitry underlying depression as well as positive moods you will also learn about all the various drugs that i described and you are really going to learn about the current status and future of the treatment of mood disorders today you will also learn about a number of ongoing studies in doctor willies's laboratory is show mention that they are recruiting subjects for these studies if you go to b see which stands for brain stimulation laboratory that b s eld to stamford d e d u you have the opportunity to apply for one of these clinical trials for the treatment of depression and other mood disorders i confess that the conversation with doctor will let's was for me one of the more stimulating and informative conversations have ever had about psychedelics which is simply to say that his breadth and depth of knowledge on that topic is incredible and his breadth and depth of knowledge in terms of the underlying brain science and how it can all be combined with clinical applications is also extraordinary imam sure that by the end of to day's episode you are going to come away with a tremendous amount of knowledge about the clinical and nonclinical uses of those substances and you're going to understand a lot more about how the healthy and diseased brain work before we begin i emphasize of this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zerocostic consumer information about science and science rely t tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is element element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar nowsalt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called neurons in fact in order for your neurons to function properly all three electrolytes need to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to deposits in cognitive and physical performance element contains a science bactolectrolite ratio of one thousand milligrams that one gram of sodium two undermilegrams of potassium and sixty milligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kin of physical training and after physical training as well especially if have been sweating lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is elements doctor slash supermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element element doctor slash supermen and now for my discussion with doctor nomen willies thanks fore joining today am really cited to have this conversation it is in a long time coming and i have a lot of questions about different compounds psychedelics in particular but before we get into that discussion when i ask you about depression broadly speaking intractable depression how common depression is or is not i heard you say in a wonderful talk that you gave that depression is perhaps demos debilitating condition world wide and yet in contrast to other medical conditions cancer we actually have a fairly limited number of tools to approach depression and yet number of tools in the potency of those tools is growing if si could educate us on depression i really appreciated absolute depression is e a condition that am it has a lot of a lot of the manifestations you can have hand have a a depression that is primarily loss of interest you can have folks who feel very anxious in the cold of overactive you can have people who do not have any anxiety at all in their very underactive in they have low motivation to do anything you new we you have this huge range of symptoms that are in that umbrella of depression and some of our work is actually work with with folks he conformists and in cornel and try to actually get a biotypes based off of her imaging to see if we can conparsout the different depression can of real presentations in the in see that clinically and also see that in the brain depression is a the most disabling condition world wide a what is interesting about depression is it is both a risk factor a four other illnesses and it makes other medical and psychiatric illness hes worst right recently the america heart association added depression is the fourth a major risfactor for corner artery disease right it alongside the risfactors that we know high pretension his blood pressure hyperlipidemia high collateral and a in diabetes in high blood sugar those three have been on the list for a long time and depression in yow being added the list is the fourth one and a you really interesting rights an addition to taking medications to address as other three ristfactors we really have to be thinking about a how do you treat folks with depression to reduce their risk of having a heart attack in the future and you another some of that is being worked on now but we do not have a complete solution to thinking about that at this time and then the other thing that is interesting is once you have our hart attack in t in the individuals in having a hart attack the risk of having depression after the hart attack is higher than the normal population right and a lot of what we are doing in the lab actually is a is measuring o brain heart connections and we can actually with transcranial magnetic stimulation of form of brain stimulation we can actually decelerate the heart rain capture that ferrate discoloration am over the mood regulatory regions and actually a direct probe of that connection some it is it is interesting and as you said a second ago it is a it is a very disabling condition moderate depressions about is disabling is is having a heart attack acutely having a heart attack severe depressions is disabling is having cancer without treatment and in dying from from a cancer without treatment and it is a it is consider appreciated just how disabling depression is in that way and i think a important as stigma is consistently con o being reduced over the years for final illness a oriental illnesses than the idea that we can start really putting more funding and putting more focus the federal level private foundation over whatever it is at a giving university to to thinking about a developing treatments we been very interested in a very particular a clinical set of problems around the the most severe and the most circuity am settings that t a focus of depression in up being in and that is in you know emergency settings where they go in to impatient units and a you know in the rest of medicine if it is bigamous hart attar if i start having chest pain right now and and you bring me to a primary caredoctor's office r can i have a certain number of tests and treatments right but very limited cause it is an out patient a facility if you bring me to the emergency room after that therefore more tests and more treatments if you put me in the ice to you are in the catholic where they do am in massive procedures the heart there more tests and more treatments in psychiatry as we elevate the acuity of an individual you go from being just depressed to being depressed now thinking about into your life the number of treatments actually go down on average in some sonar's the go out but on average they go down and there are no tests right and we have been very focussed on that particular problem somebody that maybe was doing you fairly one with a pretty moderate depression in an the depression gets worse and then they end up an emergency setting and there the field really has not developed a way of a you have consistently being able to treat that problem in focusing up being the same standard oral anti depressence that they have been getting out patient and in i came to this because i you have duel trained as a neurologists and psychiatrists went back and forth between urology and psychiatry saw that neurology we have all these ways of treating acute brain base problems and really wanted to emulate that in psychiatry in fined ways to develop an engineer you you k a brain base solutions there is a lot o unpack there one thing that you said on is it'd to fast on a bit more because i think we hear that the brain and the heart are connected but you described believe a a direct relationship between areas and the brain associated with emotion and heartright yes and that makes perfect logical sense to me but i think a at the same time youmany people out there what we think of the relationship between the the heart in the mind as and of woo or kind of u a soft biology but hear your talking about an actual physical connection between a what marry of the brain is it the the the the first place where the stimulation goes as called the dor lateral referral quarter its kind of the sense of control kind of governor of the brain and then i in then what we know is it when you use a magnet house con of what we call far was law this idea of a using a magnetic pulse to induce can electrical current in electrically conducting substances in this case brain tissue but not skull or got a scalper any of that or here you avoid all that just the brain tissue then you have a direct depolarization of martial anurans the surface of the brains anurans in this dorcylateral prefrontal and if you do that in the actual scanner which we can do you can see that that distributes down into the enter lingulate and the insula and the emigdula and ultimately the tract goes into something call the nucleus track to solitaries and ultimately into the vaguest nerve and to the heart that the heart a very consistently seems to be the indorgan of the adorcylateral prefrontal quarter if you measure heart rate in standard ways that pathologist metis your tartrate and you stimulate over this left or collateral you get a deceleration of the hartratents very time lock to the stimulation it is a two second train of stimulation at one second you see the deceleration it goes down about ten beats terminate and then you'll drift back up is a break for eight seconds on the stimulation drift back up from the stimulation goes back ain and then the hart rate goes back down d you see the hart rate just do this ten beats permit at every train and we know if you do that over visual quarter you do not get that motor quotation get any of those findings its really specific to this kind of control region of the brain and yet seems to it is our work other other folks wort martinarnsan in a in in rope a the netherlands work showing the same connections thatching's been replicated for five times you mentioned left dorsylateral prefrontal quarter any time i hear about lateralization of function i get particularly curious om because boys we have two a mere symmetric sides of the brain o the rare exceptions to this the panel and thing's of that sort to at are only there is only one a pineal am what is special about the left dorslateral prefrontal quarter does this have anything to o with handedness right hand our left hand be we no right hand and left hand dress has a lot to do with lateralization of function for language am a topic for another time but am why do you think the left dor collateral prefrontal quarter would be connected to the heart a in this way ye yet i think left or collateral a is is thought to be the the side that when you excite it when you can a am do excusatory stimulation potentiation sort of stimulation that you can reduce depressive symptoms and i got by the mike fox at hazard is demonstrated if you have m strokes in the brain that a that cause depression you put them on the human connection hundred your a thousand patient map and you ask the question whether all functionally connected to left dorcylateral if you take lesions it caused mania in individuals you put those all the human connective map and asked what they are all the one commonage they're all connected to its the right does the lateral and there seems to be a hemispheric a you balancing of mood a between these two brain regions and we know this from an experimental standpoint too because you can take individuals with depression and you can excite the left or you can inhibit the right and the they are both antitoprescent you can a excite the right and that antimonic and some studies and this idea hat there is this hemispheric balancing of mood is is quite interesting that is incredibly interesting and just am people know if if you curries what the connective is tat connective as the term that was built out of this notion of genomes o being a large as collections of sequencing and mapping of genes there prodromes of propenes of a connectors as a call connectomics of connections between your owns of the human connection project is on going am and i find that incredible that within the connection project that can identify these regularities of right verses left or sendal prefrontal quarter especially since a give looked at a fair number of brains u from humans not sernlinize many as you have a and if you look at the architecture of the layers the relatives and even the narrow chemicals of which cells are expressing a dopamine or keratose and are receiving in put from areas that make dopamine seirtonan that different on the right and left side and yet here we are talking about a a count of an accelerator and a break if you ow the r on on depression and mania using what at least by my eye and think other people's i look to be badly the same set of bits the same parts lest nor less what gives that these properties to the right and left or sendal prefrontal quarters at the inputs they receive is tit something that we learn during development or do you think that we come into the world with these am hemispheric by ass fence it is a great question and it has not been worked out which your original question was around and i left handed individual which as twenty five per cent of those folks and up having a right brain dominance or one per cent of right handed people have a right brain dominance if it is flit right and that you know unfortunately that study still has not been done at the level cause that would be probably pretty helpful for teasing some of this out but it is it is a it is still you not still being sorted outright we we know enough to know this phenomenon exists because we can use teams is a probe and do this sort of these sorts of manipulations but a to my knowledge there has not been anybody that is gotten interested in it that they have been able to get a mechanism of why that is buts a but it it is can a impure my true in the sense that you can push and pull on those systems or in this in the case of of strokes that jokes have in the kind of get their brains and and their brain images and look at were the strokes landed those con of causal bits of information point to this this a a symmetry interesting well in that case going with what we do know that stimulation of dor salt prefrontal quarter slows the heart wait down transiently but it slows it down and seems to alleviate at lea some symptoms of depression leads me to the question of why would that be the case is it does it tell us anything fundamental about depression that a anxiety is inherent to depression i think of faster heart rate is parting parcel with a wit hat with a anxiety am in my laboratory we have studied fear a bit in animals and in humans and we ism often observe bricky martial where somebody or in animal as afraid of something and rather than the heart rate speeding up it actually slows down something that most people do not i think about or recognize at but am give in that stimulation of dorsalatr prefrontal quarter slows the heart rat down and can alleviate depressive symptoms and that there are other ways to slow the heart down i have two questions what o you thinks this tells us about the basic architecture of depression wand its physiology at the little of the heart and does the circuit run in the opposite direction too if one were to have were find other ways to slow the heart wait down say with a batablocker am does that help alleviate depression et dontsagret questions the a i it is the second question first a we know that a n for ism going trials of this a if you stimulate in the vaguest nerve a in an implanted pages nerve stimulator you can actually a you have this the a parent am parts of the the vaguest am you project ultimately up to the de el pi see through the singular through these anterinsoluce or that same that obviously the same tract right and you can a stimulate there and alleviate depression which seems very unusual right your stimulating a cranial nerve down on the neck but if you can get up into the brain you actually can improve depressive symptoms and your more evidence that this is have a could of a whole track and system and a if you stimulate in part of that system it appears that you can i improved mood would if i were somebody who did not have a stimulating electrode in my vaguest nerve and i a was dealing with minor depression and i decided i wanted to take some other approach to slow my heart rate my the vaguest for instance am email emphasized breathing or deliberately slow cadence breathing i things of that sort is there any evidence that behavior interventions of the kinds am can alleviate depression or some symptoms of depression and is there any evidence that does indeed feed back to the door s ta don't prefrontal quarter to achieve some of that alleviation absolutely yes there is hies number of studies a implicating to yet pet the dorcylateral and and say meditation a mindfulness that sort of thing and in the small studies but but pretty well design studies suggesting that behavioral interventions in mild depression textually work quite well there seems to be a volitional threshold for depression where at some point you you start losing you you go from being completely in total volition to having o semi volition you have thoughts that you really have a hard time controlling and that sort of thing and you go through that threshold at some point it gets harder and harder for those sorts of things to contikick in and work in the extreme form of that is catatonia right were people in a very severe form of depression get nonstick motorcally it may obviously cannot they have no control and a or very limited control and i think there is a threshold in which these sorts of interventions will work exercise seems to really be a good treatment for for mild depression and it may work though the mechanism you are describing right as is we all know athletes hold a lower resting tartrate a then folks that that are not if your you were athlete you had a lower resting heartrite you stopped exercising and a couple years later your resting heartbeat in many cases goes up big and maybe that is a maybe that is part of the process ism not aware of any studies specifically a looking at dorsylateral prefrontal a physiology proposed exercise but it would be a great study i think that would be really helpful to understanding that especially if you had a correlation of changes a can a lowering if say heartrite with mode improvements a the there is been a lot of work with tartrate very ability and a in depression and studies or can a point towards it it is not not every study is is is you ka a positive for this but a but quite a few studies say basically that lower heartwrate versatility is a associated with been a moderate ta severe depression man that may be part of that mechanism of that heart brain a risk ism both in true enelabit perplexed by this relationship between heartbeat and depression on the face of it would think of depression as depressed a lower tartrate might make somebody more depressed even mention catatonic ore somebody that just does not seem motivated or excited to do anything when i think of mania's elevated tartrate and e being excited on the other hand i realize that anxiety which brings about ideas elevated tartrate is also built into depression which brings me back to what you said earlier which is that when we say depression are we really talking about four or five differ that's run disorders at to this for lack of a better word and for what percentage of people that have depression does some approach to reducing heart rate work whether not its stimulation of the dorsal left dorsalato prefrontal quartets a by way of transtranniung manic stimulation or by taking a beat of locker or by stimulating the vaguest at can we throw out a number a rough number does that holp thirty percent an per cent how period long lasting is that that relief end to be clear the a the discoloration the cultrate is in the moment when the stimulation is happening but it is not something that is necessarily maintained chronically it is more of an indicator that you are in the right not work more than it is than it appears to be itself central the mechanism that hurry versatility piece may be in there is some studies that link the to but the actual decelerations seems to be much more of a marker that you are in the right system but very well could be that the heart rate system in the mood system to sit next to each other in the stimulation it is both if you look it how much to the variance and the mood is explained by the heart rate deceleration it is not it is not a huge it is not a huge about right it only explains a a small percentage and it is it is unlikely that simply cult simply reducing the tartrate and in fact for many years proprannel a in these sorts of drugsacts the were implicating causing depression and that that is been kind of debunked but it is it is unlikely it is simply dickering the hart rates can improve depression but what it does tell you is that if you are in that area that is the mood regulatory area there is some prof sympathetic cortical kind of process that is going on that gets in and in causes is to happen in it is it is independent of mood you take a normal healthy a individual and you can do this and they are going to decelerate their tartrate ism glad you mention the parts sympathetic nervous system which horses the must people think of its the rest and digest of the con of calming side of the autonomic nervous system as of hearing you say all this and in particular what you just told me which is that it is not as if having a lower heart rate protects you against depression or a higher heart rate is associate with depression although at the extremes that might be true but rather it is something about the regulatory network the ability to control your own nervous system to some extent and when i think about the autonomic nervous system i to thing about as a see saw yet of you n alertness and calmness and when your sleep it is for aloticalmness when you panicking it is a lot of alertness to the but that and i do not think this has ever been defined and when it at teach met the medical student tat staffer nor anatomy i my wishes that some day it'll be able to explain what the whingeing that process would be rater not the ends of the easily we know what the sympathetic nervous system as in what it is to wake us up and make us panic or make us feel nicely alert and calm we know what puts up some one into sleep or a coma or makes them feel relaxed but what ships from one side of the seas out to the other and the tightness of that hinge seems to me what you are describing that that depression is sort of a lack of control over inner state that when ism stress i cannot get myself out of it an when ism feeling completely collapsed with exhaustion i cannot get out of bed and as are motivated to do the very things that would help me get out of depression a a work out or social connection er thing meet a equality meal these kinds of things this is perhaps the first time that have ever am heard about a potential circuit for the hinge as ism referring to it dis as it make yes taxis all absent yet is on make sure that ism terrain in this directly an beyond yes seen in some studies if you do the same i identical stimulation on the right or slander yo get an acceleration you are just kind of further confirming this idea of lateralization i that that even it appears that even the referral aortic in a cortical i areas seem to be literalized in this in this way and i it is am it is less a the right finding is is more variable depending upon the study the lefts very consistent a s were talk about turns crisis man that its stimulation for getting into these networks and and i also just want to take a brief tangent say i as have heard you say this before i think it is did of what you are saying that it is really not about stimulation of areas it is or any specific brain area or vaguest nerve being important per say it is really about a network a connection a series of connections think that is really important for people to understanding is a and of a new emerging theme really the other thing that to me seems extremely important furs to consider is what ex what are these lateral prefrontal cortexes doing are they involved for instance sensation sensing the heart rate are they involved in thinking and planning and this gets down to a very simple question that i know a lot of people have which is can we talk ourselves out of depression if it is mild can we a talk ourselves into a manic state or an excited state a positively excidestate that does not qualifies mania y other airs the brain i i think of the is responsible for perception or for for motor control but here we are in this mysterious frontal cortexarea which people say executive function plan in et camera are we talking about thoughts are we talking about structure thoughts or we talking about dream thoughts what in the world is going on in the pretonic or ye and here i seen my career you knowing nor sins and i still i i still cannot really understand what it is doing and made be its doing fifty things the outs agree its a great question you ti one of the other studies that that we w working on addition to the depression work is actually trying to change trait hypnotizabilities soil itspeele and i have been working on this an a he is found and a publishes ten years ago that a different part of the left or collateral amid functionally connected with the inter the dockland there singular a with a lot of functional connectivity and high hypnotizable and not much in low hypnotizable and that is a different con of a different sub region within this bigger brain region we call left or collateral prefennal quarter then the part that seems to be important for regulating mood and the left or collateral seems to have connections that are location specific within the over all consumed brain region that connect to various parts of the singular and seem to regulate it it in if you knock out the left or collateral prefennal quarter and you have people do the strip task for instance which is a a task where you have it is a simple task or we know this you have people name the color of words and if i if i look at a wat you if i look at one of the cards that they will show you it will have the word red in red and that is very easy and that is a called a congruent and then the incongruent is red in the color blue and you have to name you have to say the the word you do not am name the color yet o suppress a respond ye exactly and a s are you do you name the color and you and you see the word written am in a different way and basically a if you if you stimulate in a way that inhibits the left or lateral prefrontal quarters are either one you can actually knock out the ability to do that well and it will take longer for people in the incongruent cards to a to be able to name it and they have a they have a t cone of a time delay that is greater than they had before they got stimulated that is a art of the the prefenal quarter that is different in the part of the prefenal quarter that is involved an mood regulation the nice thing about amass as that you can go through an you can fined these areas there functionally defined through brain imaging and you can perturbed them and answer the question you are talking about how do i understand this part of the referral quarter and its function this part and we were able to stimulate an in inhibitory way within the left dor scylateral prefer quarter that is involved with you have this sort of connive control am area and we were able to knock that area out and a an increased trait hypnotizeability people had a greater am hypnotize ability after they got active stimulation verses when they got sham and it suggests that that brain circuit is involved in the a in the process of what hypo a therapeutic hypnosis ins a being but it is a very different region within the left or collateral than say we do when we do these very intensive our stimulation approaches the treat severe depression and we are able to get people out of depression am you with the part of this o the dor cultural it seems to be lower in the younoaccono more lateral am in dam and am inferior on the a do pic in connected with the subgenus after lingulate the party enter singular the processes emotion it'd to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called g one is a vitamin mineral robotic drink that covers all f your foundational nutritional needs have been taking athletic green since two thousand and twelve am delighted that their sponsoring the pod cast he reason i start taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athletic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets to me the robotics that i need for got health our god is very important its populated by got microbioda that communicate with the brain the immune system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long turn health and those probiatics unathletic greens are optimal and vital for macrobiotic health in addition athletic greens contains a number of adaptedins fitments and minerals that make sure that all my foundational nutritional needs are met and it tastegript if you to tryathletic greens you can go to athletic green s do calm slash supermen and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you are on the road in the car on the plain et camera and they will give you a year supply of vitamin d the k too again that is athletic greensdok calm slash supermen to get the five free travel packs and the year supply a item and three k to bey somewhat you told us about the strip task and the rule of the prefonte corotecson strip task to me the true task is a rule switching gan saying in one moment that the rule is you read whatever the word says and then then you switcion in you say the rule now is you tell me what color the word is written in and you suppress whatever is the word says centra of a rule in some sense is a a that is a a transient we adopted belief system i could imagine that in depression which has all sorts of back story to in am that of course the psychiatrist psychologist or friend can pull on that thread for instance somebody might believe that they are bad am or that they do not deserve love i try to bring this into the typical language that tom or that they will never succeed or that even if they keep succeeding it is just going to get harder and harder and it will never feel good these are sort of rules the strip was try some levellers at they are rules that are more pervasive over time unfortunately but i could imagine that if the p c is also contains some sort of maps or anger than related to rules of emotionality or self representation or things that we have heard at think there must be date out there the saying that en whatever we heard in middle school when someone made fun of us we can remember that cause i can remember things that people said am about a jacket i wore one day or something in the fourth grate a crazy i did not even the jacket om now i think you was kind to cool but anyway the point being that we have an intense memory for these things a set up a sort of rule or a question maybe i do not really know how to dress instance maybe that is why always wear the same lecture but in all seriousness it seems that the dorsal prefrontal quarter is in this amazing position to access rules which our beliefs and believed our rules and then for moments or longer to switch those rules and for somebody who is depressed to just simply look themselves in the mirror and say you are great you are fantastic that is it feels a lie if you feel garbage to say that it does not fit with the rule that is saying that card is not red that card is green when your eyes tell you that it is that it is red and and it seems there is something about prefrontal quarter that that in principle gives flexibility to rules based on what we know on is true task given its inactivity can we assume that the talk therapy that occurs in a the psychatrous office or with a friend or through journalling out something om because we do know that reporting things about trimer difficult circumstances wore the rules that we contain and attend to hide inside of us about how we feel miserable about ourselves or anything really that in restricting that that somehow it allows us to do a sort of stripe task on our beliefs is that is that a a e tremendousleep ism just trying to program this in the contexts of what but what i and most will think of its depression yet foam because the network components are vitally important but i guess what give trifid gout is what er the what are the the algorithms that govern e prefrontal quartan absolutely an a in a kind of standard cognate behavioral therapy session i what what ta the therapist is trying to do as identify those beliefs and ta and you con determine how how fix the are you knave theireflexible as you are saying and then a then help folks to find another explanation for them and to a into kind of re emigrate that potential other explanation in to the their memory system ad a what were i think teamast' really interesting actually had a lot of patients who have told me mi my therapists told me that i was not trying hard enough in therapy and and a i i really am trying hard but these are in a moderate pretty severe depress patience and as soon as we get them well with with the teams approaches you con of rapid in a five day approach in the next sweet mud codein and see them another will say i i did all we can as i looked at my therapy books and now i can understand it in i actually see mamas is a way of having exogenous sorts of cognitive functions that in milder forms of depression we can pull off with psychotherapy you know this idea of being able to concern that referral quarter on and have it govern these deeper regions in depression the deeper regions govern the referral quarter the the precede the referral quarter timinguise we have get some at and in review now or were seeing that in depressed individuals the re responsive to our rapid tames approach we call stamford accelerated intelligent or modulation therapy or er center say if you look at the brain before people get this they will they will have a temporal delay where the lingulate is in front of the deal p c and in people that are normal healthy controls no depression the dor collateral prefenal quarter is temporally in front of the after lingulate with effective treatment we can flit the timing of things the dorcylateral is in front of the after lingulate just an normal person do you not talking about fit obviously physically moving these structures bra by in time tine or activation in one case is the coach telling the player what to do unit avens at lit a play or telling the coach what to do and you you restore order to the game you restore order to the game and in and in what it looks is to depression to your point is a untie consentaneous content that simivolitional its being concentrated out of this conflict o detection system the singular that seems to to a to since conflict and con of feed that information gets overactive and depression and do and then in depression it looks the left or collateral does not sufficiently clamp down on it in what therapy appears to do is to cold of restore that what we see with tams over that region is we just exogenously do the same sort of thing we restore the governments of the left orcylateral over the lingulate area and that is correlated with treatment improvement the degree in which you can re time deregulate in time the left or collateral over the lingulate the more of an antopress an effect you have can we therefore say in in true terms that the dorcylateral prefrontal quarter really is the governor of how we interpret physiological signals and spontaneous thoughts it is it it places a lends that the rest of the brain sees things through and in you can you can do these experiments for you you can put a normal healthy control person in the in the sea inner and you can make them feel to have a loss of control and then you can see that region come off line writing experimentally manipulate the system and can of buffing it up the it is almost teams is almost exercise for the brain great your your can of exercising this region over and over again with a physiologically relevant signal and con turning that system on and what is interesting i we think really interesting for for this show is to you we had a couple of folks a o privy five or six folks that have actually told me this where if they weren't early enough in the week we have this very dense stimulation approach for we can stimulate people really rapidly over a five day block we do not discriminate when they get better to when they stop if they they get better on day won we still give them the other four days because it is in the protocol to do that we cannot we are were getting to appoint we can tell how long it it is on to take ere not there yet and every time somebody gets better at day waned too at the beginning when we first art do in this we would say we are not sure you we think this a safe to keep going but what you want to do and everybody was now i wen to keep going and the by widnesday the totally zero down on the depression scales even better than most people walking around really no anxiety no no depression anything by thursday the first i that the told me that it came in and he said i was driving back to my hotel and i decided to go to the beach and i just sat there and i was totally present in the present moment for an hour and he is i read about this in my mindfulness books but i experienced it last night ism never experienced anything this before and i was that is interesting my cut a was not surer then and then i did not tell any you i obgustsany more patience about that than about five ever the last couple of years when they get they remit early in the week by the end of the week they are going to the beach and there totally having what people describes a pretty mindful present moment sort of experience it's really interesting what that is and man i do not have full on scientific data to tell you but it it is just it is a it is an interesting anecdote i that that folks when you push them through this point of of feeling con of clinically well that some people in to reporting the additional said of features in you mention the cingula and the intersingulat in particular because now i feel for the first time in my career i have some sense of what presently contacts somonnection to be doing ah besides providing a bumper for the for the rest of the the brain is the lingulate it seems is it is a more primitive structure in the sense that it is it is under the ideally it is under the regulation of this top down control from peoplente quarter n it what is mapped in the singular in ends for the none sciences out there when i say mapped i we were tat put's one in a scanner and focusing on lingulate or put an electron in there but what makes the neurons in their fire what what sorts of things in the it dean in the mine and out in the world a light up for lack of a better phrase the lingulate what does the singular ye yes that soup task those incongruent word color associations the the dorsal part of that a for obsessive compulsive disorterof patients certain certain con of triggers you will you will see some some of their imaging studies point to tenter lingulate a in the con of very crude psycho surgery world fifty years ago the enter singulatomy was a way of treating a obsessive compulsive disorterat as that area seems to be overactive in people who are experiencing obsessive compulsive disorder you can in of walk the singular raps around this white matter track bundles at raps round that also there's a part that is above that around that below that and depending upon how a most how much of the a the conflict task has an emotional component the more a ventral and subgenus that a that activation is the dorsal part of the after lingulate seems to be kind of more of a pure cognitive may be a obsessive compulsive distorter sort of area whereas you stark getting into mood sorts of triggers facial expression a conflicts ore your posed a that the mother's an emotional strip task for you show the word happy and then you have a face of of a person that looks mad than that is another way of having the same sort of strop conflict that seems to be more perigenual subgenus areas rites you can find of you can trigger the lingulate based off the level of emotional vigilance from none down to a lot and a in that seems to be how the how it is distributed there are tartrate count components to it autonomic components in their too there is something called aconnectic mutism you radon a a a word certified hero socages beaver behavioral neurologist and have seen lot of these what we calls ever cases and neurology where people have these unusual neurological presentations and one of em is a e a connection mutism give a glioma sitting in the inner hemispheric fissure and at conniving a pressure on the lingulate people can get into an almost catatonic looking state where they con of get stock and they do not speak and and that tells you something about how the how the singular works as well rights it is if it is a if it is not functioning than people have a hard time conconnecting with reality it seems to need to be constantly on on line to be able to interact to the exterior world is not involved in some of the dissociative states that sometimes people who are very traitor or depressed experience you said catatonia ben can extreme one but a m i know someone for instance at when they get really strait and it can even be of some one yells at them or someone is angry evenest ones angry with them ere they perceive some one's angry them there is a development a back story to why they they likely feel this way they or just i cannot this is a high high functioning individual normally and they they just sort of cannot function they cannot complete simple things male or or groceries or things for for a short while it say it is almost a catatonia and they refer to is a dissociative state do you see that in depression and i mean wherein were speculating here as to whether not that valve a singular but whet the saying it has holds a lot of salients for me in thinking about this example yet yet there is a you see you see catatonia is an extreme outcome of depression and of am in sometimes get morning another illnesses dissociation is an extreme outcome or even some cases a less extreme outcome petiosty and intima and a and it is also a phenomenon that happens naturally in some people that are highly hypnotizable and soil you ask avid spell say that ta if some of the work that he is been working on us around post her singular and in the a capacity to dissociate but yet with or stimulation approach to to the elpiicy dormant er singular one of the sub scales that moved the most as the dissociative sub scale for for hypnotize abilities even normal individual you see that that change and in a in that kind of experience of dissociation i am highly hypnotizable e davits hypnotize me a number of times that i clip of that on or super aachantl i have always am will always it a starting it my early teens i start exploring hypos i am extremely hypnotizable and i self hypnosis or assisted hypnosis am i do not now that ever going stogie of states a it'll try and avoid am forcing you into running a clinical session right now but not to assassin anything that but this brings about something rely a interesting i think which is i am aware that some of the more popular emerging treatments for depression include things codeine which is a dissocyof an esthetic is not right and yet and my assumption is that as a disco of anesthetic that it leads to dissect of states nob people can sort third person themselves and be sup feel somewhat distance from their emotions es have also been hearing that there are emerging treatments sylicive in being one of them but some other treatments a m d ma et camera that w pars each of these and in detail that lead to the exact opposite state during the effect of the drug which is a highly engaged a emotionality and heart made and sense of self and can also lead to relief of dear action now whether or not this again reflects that depression as many conditions as suppose to just one or whether or not somehow tickling a er in some cases pushing really hard on the opposite ends of the the scale really matter i am absolutely fascinated and again also perplexed by this why would it be that it a drug that induces dessociive states and a drug take separately that induces hyper associative states would lead to relief of the same condition e nosegret question yes over a for redefine the the level of dissociation appears to be correlated with the the therapeutic effect it appears to be a necessary but not sufficient to produce an antitopress an effect in a folks that that do not have any any psychological change a from the cedeminer or do not experience need association team typically tend to have less a less potent antitopress an effects from redefine we did study a couple of years ago is really interesting s we we gave folks a not trecxsone which is an opiate a antagonist a me an capopiate receptor antagonists and we we we gave folk the same individuals a pill of that or pilloplosebo n they had no idea which hen they were getting was this logos nail recto fifty telegrams with pretty his dose open sweet we gave a typical enemy an therapeutic dose than we gave fifty telegrams of not treason a orplosibo and then in the same individuals we we gave two in two infusions one with each of those conditions and and if they had not antidoppress an effect we waited until they relapsed ten we gave him the other condition and then we look to see what a what effect of blocking the opioid receptor a what effect would you see on the antiopress an effect of blocking the pair receptor with the idea that if vermin works the way that a lot of researchers at the time thought that it in a completely worked and which is the glutamate system then you would have a no effect of nowtrecsen not treason just interacts the opiate system it does not do anything with any other systems cedemiane has a lot of effects over it has o clearopiate effects a in mice and various ways of looking at that a and enemy a receptor antagonism and glutamate of fat effects and fits just that the glutamate part is a is the part driving the antitopress an effect you should not have any difference in the antitopress an effect between the two conditions if however the antitopress an effect is primarily is the the opioid properties of cedemiane are necessary for the antitopress an effect than you should have a loss of antitopress an effecting the cede an plus nail recon condition that you observed in the redefine plus placebo condition an what we what we saw was that there was a dramatic blockade of the antitopress an effect when now treason was present in e in the people that had a had an antitopress and a affect with ceresin plus a placebo alone and and then some friends of mind that tot teams study with pain and they stimulated over the left or lateral prefrontal quartets and they gave colors ivenoloxen which work spastically the same way as now recon and they were able to block the anti paineffects of amass with a opiate blocker this idea that another con convergent pointright this idea that the opioid receptor may have a roll and mood regulation what's also interesting as if you look at people are getting a total operation very painful operation and a total need replacement and you you age sects everything match the individuals that are going to through that but you have a group of people it do not have depression in a group people it do have depression the presence of depression ripples the the or a opioid dose by day fore that is required that is required to to cover the pain but what may be happening is it is not just treating physical pain may be treating emotional pain as well right at least transiently seems to have a pro and entity press in effect chronically it seems t have a very protopress an effect can make people treatment resistant but it is it is a interesting phenomenon but yet the opioid system seems to be pretty pretty involve but what is interesting there with tether redefine trial is tit we did not see any effect on the dissociation and the dissociation was the same each time the psychological effect of what we call the trip or the the kind of dissociate of effect for people ore having a psychological phenomenon from redefine that was identical both times and it it kind of wait also challenge this idea that the psychological experience of the psychedelic effect may be all that is necessary to produce an effect in the pharmacology does not matter as long as you can achieve that state and we think we pretty clearly debunk that idea that the underlying pharmacology and the state you know seem to be important we do not know for sure if you can in a lot of people are working on this if you can take out you know essentially the psychological effect and still have a drug that works to to treat the the under the illness that you are trying to target and it a lot of there was a moutstudy out this week forever they had an else the analogue and they were able to see some some a animal level data a suggest that could be true but but until we fear that out humans its its kin of to be determined but it is it is curious right being able to kind of use experimental manipulations to tried a separate some of these phenomenon apart nearly understand what is what is doing what it is critical and its critical to the other conversation that we will surely get to which is the progression of psychedelics from felicity legal drugs to clinically validated and and presumably at some point either decriminalized were legal drugs which has not yet happened at least not in the us but just to make sure that people are getting this and how crucial this is what were really talking about here is the fact that somebody takes a multigramdos of siliceiban or somebody takes m drama or they take redefine and they experience relief from their chacma their depression their edition or any number of the other things that indeed those compounds to be shown to be useful for in certain contacts clinically supported et camera there is this gravitational pull to the idea that oh it was the hallucinations it was the dissociative state it was the feeling of connectedness and what were really saying is that while that certainly could be true it may be the case that a major source of the positive shift that occurs after the effect of the drug is some underlying biology shifts in the mule geoid receptor ala your experiments with neltrecsone or a change in the underlying modulation that had anywhere from nothing to something to do with the real shift and i know there is a group up it you see dais that published a paper in nature about a year ago also looking at these are is a chemistry lab essentially modifying psychedelics to remove the the hallucinogenic properties remold altering properties and actually sing some pretty impressive effects in shifts in mood after the drug wars off and i know this this gets people upset when they hear it a lot of pop this gets a lot of people upseterbecause people think out know it is the it is the intense experience that matters but in fact a that may not be the case at all it in fact it is powerful for people that sometimes i in it in my mind to you've somebody is the birth of a new child and it is such an incredible experience and then people feel much connection and that they sort of connect the the experience of thou the actual birth of the connection when infect the that is true it turns out but there are bunch of other things happening to that are simp that is simply the reflection of the fact the you are holding a child and the personal effects et camera anyway i i think it is vary important that these different variables be a figured out thatalong those lines i i want to make sure that before we dive a bit deeper into redefine and siliceiban m that we do touch on really important topic that has been in the press a lot lately which is excess rise select give sir down a rep taken limiters cause we cannot really have a discussion about depression thou talking about escessorise men i want a circle back to a redefine and siliceiban it seems that there are now data that essentially sate state that there is no direct link between seat ne in levels and depression although i my understanding is that the essessorize are powerfully effective for certain forms of obsession obsessive compulsive disorder and may also be effective for treatment of depression but it may again be through some effect unrelated to keratose in itself is that right and how shall we think about assessor's are the useful a the not useful am what is what is going on with accessorize inpour patients a and another other people's yet that they a be the the experiment that i described a better go round the now trectonand and cetane in is the first time ism aware of where we were able to essentially eliminate and an anterpressence effect by using a second drug is an kind of a blockade an in it lights a bigger issue right the issue that we have not had a good way of really understanding how these drugs work and it is the difference i think a lot of the the controversy there is that a it is been difficult i think for folks a to see that something can in one hand work and in the other hand we do not know how it works right a in a accessorized clearly work a many many m amedanalysies kind of proving that outright that that in a sub population of individuals they achieve great benefit from depression a u for depression a for obsessive compulsive disorder for generalized anxiety sort of panic in all these things you can see a an improvement in those symptoms a with what we call accessorize or selective serotonin retaken hitters the issue there is that these selective craton and retaken hitters in dust a blocking that the rep take of serotonin leaving the the seratoneand in this a in this coin between a between two neurons a for a while and allowing for more serotonin to kind be there the issue a is that they do not they do not work immediately right they do not work the same day you start taking them an that that suggests that probably it is not exactly the serotonin being in there that is directly driving it that it is much more likely that it may have some say pass this brain plasticity effects right we know that things brain drive nortrophic factor get up regulated with chronic am oralanteto present use in in that is that is kind of the ideas that a is that these things work but what is powerful on i think what the authors of this paper was extremely controversial patient paper were were a in part trying to say was that there is not a there is not a deficit of keratose and you are not born with ah what people call a chemical and balance since teciatry is known that this is not actually new information anybody you in ow it it is it is kind of a rehashing of a much of information we have known for a while now but in the lay press its kind of hit in a way that it did not seem to grab attention a before w previous publications but this idea that this chemical and balance ideas wrong ai really i really think that parts important because i think that you know for a will i think psychiatry what it'll call psychiatry one point o it this kind of idea of frond inpsychotheropeanits in its origins a it was a lot around the your family in those experiences and psychotherapy kind of going in correcting or helping you to figure out or in shown you being able to see or people here u that you can eventually come to the conclusion of certain cognition that are not helping you right and there is a huge there is use importance there but there is a history where things this gets o frenegenic mother and all that that was a concept at some point right and we have transition from that to to the you no for a long time the chemical and balance we shall call psychiatry two point out this idea that there is something chemically missing and nap and i i think that the trouble there for a patient whose not a physician whose not some one whose whose who steeped in these sorts of ideas whose more of and of a i can of a person a can have average america out there right is that it is telling it is sending a message of there is something missing with me whether it be my experiences i had no control of over when i was a child or a a chemical in my brain what i thinks really powerful with with teams a really powerful talesman a level even powerful the psychedelic story is it saying something different teamasss works and there is no ceratonean coming in or out o the train right and were it we are doing a rapid form of teams that works in one to five days there is no there is it is very unlikely that there is some long term kind of regulation of creatine an tits driving that or work actually kind of pushes back on the creatine and i hypothesis is being kind of the center of depression because it says look we are not giving anybody any serotonin we are simply turning these brain regions on in we are focused on the circuitry and that psychiatry three point fit is not just her modulation or modulations are really nice use case for psychiatry three point out as it a way to focally and directly perturb brain regions and in whatever modality are using but they're a lot of lot of groups that are actually doing your imaging before and after and they are able to see circuit level changes for something syliciban or chedemene long after the drug is gone right suggesting in those same brain regions converge the psubgenual default money or connection that we see as changing with our or or standing stamphord or modulation there technique at that same setabrain regions that the cerement and a sylicibon seem to act on act on these connections between brainnatworks that seem to shift and it refocus the story on something that is highly correctable and it is it is basically electrophysiology and it is basically can of re celebrating a circuit that it is recalebratable instead of i have something missing or have some phenom some set of experiences early in life that are a that are going forever or trap me in these these psychiatric diagnoses it con a challenges that idea and i think that is what powerful about psychiatry three point o ism the idea of focussing on the circuit because it gets us gets a see to thinking about psychiatry in psychiatricaleeses is something that are recoverable people can get better people we have seen with our teams techniques we seen it with h the some f the psychedelic work that we have done were people are actually in normal levels of mood for sustained periods of time or within five days within five or last days and in the case of of the psychedelics within a few days right we can get people but of these states they are totally well there is no drug in their system in that point in the case the psychedelics who as never a drug in their system in the case of of mamas and it and it just tells us that that it is it is it is fixable it that it is just the heart it is just you now's just such an y with me in the heart it is just these these other illnesses that like have broken leg we can go in and do something and we can get somebody better then i think what is what is empowering and what a lot of patients have told me as they say you have got into some people will relapse and need more stimulation ore needed were thepsychodelics whatever it is but bill tell me i have relapse in am depress the and but i never think about killing myself again because i know that if i go get stimulated again it it improves it gets better it it it will i will be able to achieve it and i cannot innit i do not fear that ism ironically broke and i do not fear that the chemical imbalance is still in balance that not fear that these things that i could not control of my childhood it are going at be there and drive this problem forever and i think that that is what is powerful about this the sense of control the sense of control the sense of they are not doing the stimulation themselves their not that ministering the drug in these trials themselves that probably never well these will probably e metical treatments but they are choosing to do it and in that since they are in control have a a good frena i will not out him for for reasons they'll become clear in moment who i was quite beast and lost a lot of weight and was really proud of himself and then he see could say he sort of relapsed in a senses not not not all the way but but far along but his tone around it was very different he knew he'd accomplished what his goal once before he was disappointed in himself but he knew exactly why he had relapsed tot was very clear he had essentially relapsed to the previous said of eating behaviors and lack of exercise behaviors and is now brought himself back again and it just resinates a with your story that one somebody understands they can do it because they would been there before this this idea again of of considering new rules that that e and and that brings me to this a question about psychedelics and and the frankly the altered thinking and perception that occurs in it is in hypos suicide been a clinical a sessions it seems that the disorder thinking even though it could a be random write a hearing hearing colors and and seeing sounds as always the you noconicleshae statement of the timothelery area also you right there that is a strip task of sorts it is a it is a cynistesia to combine on the perceptions but it is it is sort of true task is in that it is a new set of rules for the same stuff e right and u people do many people do report improvements in a aroma related symetomology and depression as i understand it for i read of the clinical trials after taking sylicivon because during those sessions something comes to mind spontaneously as a you an i were time mot earlier u they will report for instance a a new way of seeing the old problem the from the old problem could be the voice that they are no good they will never nothing lever work out or to be even more subtle than that that raises two questions one is about the basic functioning of the human brain which is why do you think the brain would ever hold on to rules that u i do not serve us well that is one question and then the come question is what is it about sylicivan an related molecules what in terms of their her chemistry in terms the ways they disrupt thinking and feeling at camera during the session that alow this a novel rule consideration phenomenon e the first question i think it side isn't it is leveler evolutionary neurobiology answer it i think that at the individual person level it does not make a whole lot of sense that when really stressed out some of us when it eat more right t the individual person looks that is not particularly that could for my health in the long term but if you think about it in som five hundred years ago a thousand years ago ism highly street out it is most likely that ism about to not have food at some point and i should eat bunch of food it is high fat high sugar high cared food to put on wait for the you next face were in this stress i may be in battle and i do not have food and i have enough fuel on board right and we we and up being a we end up being a result of of probably a lot of biology that is not that useful in the modern era and i think in the brain for foray but say pities writ a lot of a lot of veterans come back and they experience these taste symptoms they are not at all useful back home right that they hear some loud noise and all of a sudden there behind a car other behind a i heard a folia jumping run behind trashcan or whatever in the mill of san francisco when they hear a loud noise but if you put them back in the battle field delay doubted that is highly adaptive right and i think what what the what is interesting is that a we in the absence of using substances like relics and up having these very persistent memories that are attached to negatively valance to motion predominantly was you re sain earlier the jacket in in elmentaris we i various things that for me to writ you you you remember these things a and a and we we hold on to those things from it i think an evolutionary nor biology standpoint but what seems to for whatever reason con alleviate that are these a are these substances some new in do ma some thrave been around for thousands of years sylisibon and used a in incosacramental and as a sacrament in no in traditions a seem to have therapeutic effect that seems to be pretty long lasting for these phenomenon and it is is just curious great its curious that that in the absence of that these things will keep going on and on but in the presence of that exposure then all of a sudden you see a resolution of the problem and we have some work now retreating folks wit navy seals indaba still being being analyzed but the anecdotes that were getting river folks are coming back and there saying a finally the that is finally gone right this kind of these satapitiesti symptoms are finally gone and this s idea that for whatever reason going into what is probably a highly plastic state redoing about earlier up regulation of braider of neretrophic factor in the case of i begin bleed r i nor trophic factor this highly plastic state in a the ability to re con reexperience memories and then is you know we we we always reconsolidate a memory ah when we bring it back up we always reconsolt but reconsolidate in it in that state for whatever reason i may drive i drive at their peptic of fact i and a you know that that the the jury still out there is ism a i would say that ism ism kind of a ism an agnostic to what tool using kin orgy ism my business is to find treatments that help people and ism much more alike pragmatic about it if if this sort of thing which a has a lot of cultural baggage a but if this sort of thing ultimatelyans of being their peptic of designed trials that convince me in others that it is than we should absolute it and and if it does not then i then the clearly should not use it right and i think that is a big that is a big question the fields can have to work out we have a hard time blinding these trials because the placebo condition is not easy to to pull off i may the a a placebo for a silicivan journey is is hard to imagine we have got you we have been thinking about this and maybe that demean study that i was tying about earlier if we could give people now reckon an ceresin maybe that is a good i good sort of placebo condition rights we know that we can block any of the actual anti to pressed effects a academy they still have an experience o that is one way of doing a but thinking about ways to do that really con approving the sow and that is been a nothing that is been been concentrate to the way have been been thinking about this be i think there is the the work that is been done far the fir silicic an trial a the first india ma trial is publish in tour medicine recently a and what do those generally say i mean that that that that they are effective for a of people after one session to session e but what is what is thou or the general contour lest it let us ad start with silicivan an m a ma e india may appears to and in a one to a few india may sessions have a an antipetiuste effect that seems to be i outside of the kind of a standard assumed levels of peatiest improvement that you can observe an individuals a with this level of peatiest it what we call the effect size which is essentially a a a mere a coinscity effect size a measure that allowed free compare different treatments to each other for different conditions that are agnostic to what the actual illness is a the effect sizes there a approach effect sizes the e things the are pretty effective antacids for heartburn right and you see that with with a with india ma treatment does that mean that a for people that have aroma who do a and again ore ting about in a clinical setting they they take a one or woods is of of emdyim i think the standard masts is a honor and fifty tisane honk o telegrams again doing this with a physician at take control clinical trial lea guy a exactly they do it once or twice and broadly speaking what percentage of people who had drama report feeling significant relief from their tromp drama afterward it about two thirds of people had a had a a clinically significant a change their petiousty since impressive which is impressive it and how how long lasting was that cumin that these trials were ended pretty recently si it it appears the last for a while n the earlier trials for the followed people lout it seemed to last for kind of in the years range for some people and it is it is pretty it is pretty compelling a silicon a it that in contrast at redeem in which only when i averages last about a week and have for a single infusion it is a much shorter soft yo a repeated infusions a can mean every ten days or the to for we ever for some people were they and up getting a bunch of doses for a couple of weeks and than for some people that seems the last a while a you that is where i think i think the the suicide en story for depression and the a in the m d a ma story for petiustyeu seem more interesting to me for i syllicide in what is the a rut rough percenagism and this would be relief not from drama but from depression ye the exactly it is an open label studies it is closer to have to two thirds of people and up getting better to panting upon their level of treat men resistance and the in the a blinded trials it was more a third or of people experience to a relief in thin this is yes is a press release of of the date jun it has not ta to my knowledge it has not been published yet and you'd looking for to say in the full paper on that one but but it separated from from placebo and looks looks pretty pretty good as well it looks it is a the first of two trials it need to be done to get this thing a a proof for treatment resistant depression and a that stuff looks looks good in terms of m d am a for many years it was reported in the popular press an there was a paper publish in science that m d ma was nauru toxic that it would kill creatine in neurons this has what was always said then i saw another paper published in science that was not a retraction of the previous paper but rather was a second paper in the same group that essentially admitted that the first time around they had in in ejected these monkeys cause the with not m d ma but with math predate which is known to be neratotiser e was kind of a public it admittance of oops or big really big screw up oops a but never attraction and the never really a a publicly knowledge am correction in the in the popular press it seems that in the appropriate dosage range and with these one or two sessions my assumption and is as gain is an assumption ism tell me if ism wright or wrong here is that my a ma is not n erotocsic for are an urgent neurons that appropriate doses with appropriate sourcing et camera a whose an interesting study that ta i think i his name is happen a last name hampering it a not case helper not i form i think a i open ism bang on his first mim but but a case chaperon was a guest on this bod last a then is a former colleague of ours that stamped who unfortunately we lost to university pennsylvania and a mabisome day will will bring him back e outright this this individual a received som an age funding to actually night nationalist use for drug abuse funding to a to explore a individuals a of the merman faith in you ta who a who partaken only india ma a the way this works is that a india ma a happened kind of after a lot of the religious documents were were a developed in suit did ma is not on the prohibited druggist the and subs o loves can substanceless have some good friends who are eld yes a great great yalitai do i do as well a you know just a kind of set of facts and a these these folks a only use i a ma but they do not they are not you now the promos with some people using drugs to jolly substance users rites you cannot you cannot say it is the mama if they have also take another psychedelics an they've take an opiate n they've tain coca and you have this picture where you cannot really tease out that problem but but with this that it was just individuals that were part of the moron faith and they they were a conopurest in the since they only used i drama and he confirmed all that and a and it was brilliant study right because then he was able to go in and look at their cognitive profiles verses individuals a you know of the same geography the same faith all of that that happened to not take a india and found they were no nericognitive a differences he it dis i mean that it o was not damaging it was not damaging it it it is hard to know because to really do the study well you would have to tract these folks down before they ever took i a ma and do a report and compare to people that did not but this is about as good of a study as you can do a given the you knave given the situation to be able to check this out a additionally when i was back in charleston and working out conversion south caroling i one of my mentors a there doctor wager a was a knew psychologist at i aseeingwas also that the her psychologist for the early em a ma trials and he did all he nericognative batteries for individuals are post an similarly did not see any changes in neuricognative profile in a negative way and there is yours data from experimental patience receiving this ears data from people tor chronic users who only take him de am am and that that combination a a of data suggests that ta there is know there is certainly a no apparent risk in the canto one to two to three do strange am it is it is probably unlikely that it least as modest dose exposure over a lifetime does not appear to have a a profound cognitive a damaging effect interesting ye i know that am forcing is k and me were here ore time a clinical trials we purity is assured and you years ago when a called raves who are really popular maybe the still popular never been been one o know am if there happening or not that o a in the no i am but it was clear that testing for purity was importing because that sometimes the drugs it are made such that there are contaminants mathemphedamin which we know is highly her toxic i think that one reason why people think that m d am might be neratoxic is that the a reported am drop energy or for of feeling fatigue for a few days afterward i spoke to a physician colleague of ours who said that that a very likely has something to do with the surgeon polar in that arrive subsequent to the big dopamine surge that occurs in am no i ma and i mention that because i know a number of people talk about serotonin depletion after taking m i ma the has in mind that while that could be true it is likely that any time in somebody takes something or does something where there is a huge lift in opening that there is very likely a huge compensatory increase in prolactin that follows and prolactin has a kind of sedative effect humming effect on mood an libido et water that eventually also wears off there that make sense to you as a physician the make sense o in the difference between a m i man in sulcivon is that m dramas conman indamine of sort for its o has it has effects in doormen in de a in sulcivons in a pretty pretty neutral and maybe a little bit of dopamine effects but find of much more of a set anuria focus drug and ye i think you aregingto s kind of a different profile after and and that makes i have not heard that sort of the mic sense to me to since you mention suicide an suckle about the nurse chemistry of silicon as a seretonurgic agent my understanding is that operates on these a is it the five eh t serotonin a two s receptor two excuse me to a and and a receptors and that have seen a bunch of different reports and arms of what its ashy doing to the brain while people are under the effects of the drug and this is important furs to see meant out because there are the effects that happened while people are under the influence and then the more long lasting effects but some of the effects i have heard about our for instance and tell me again if these are right a wrong that there is increased conic a activation of lateral connection sort a broader areas of the brain being coactive than would normally occur may be that explain some of the senesieges seem sounds in adhering colors and the as the trivial example but rule breaking am within the mind am but then have also heard am that perhaps it is lack of gating of senseryin but normally if ism looking at something ism not thinking about the sensation in my right to unless it is a relevant but if ism thing about the sensation in my right tom generally not thinking about the talk around the corner we have these attentional spotlights but it somehow it creates am wore am it add spotlights e gates the the negates the holmic ritual the reticular thou the thalamic structure am what is the evidence that any of that is true and are the other phenomena is there involvement of dor salad or prefrontal quarters that we are aware of where ism really headed here for it in a few minutes is am you not is there a place for combining directed stimulation of the brain with psychedelic that the effects of serotonin could be am primarily within the structures that from your work to be element a depression what but to simplify at first but what is going on when one takes hillside and and am wised interesting in light of a depression defy a it a divide not in robin current berries work around your imaging psychedelics or could of the some of the first folks to do that work in a you do not to their great surprise the thought there was going to be increase in activity on psychedelics it they found as the opposite what the kin of an over all decrease in the level of activity in the brain am with psychedelics but they they have also looked it inactivity and there is the kind of small world large world inactivity that you think about and your small world meaning her's lot there is can have a much more conforms concortical function or you have some cortical function whatever it is and a what you see is a difference in that am in that level of engagement f of brain regions o the inactivity conglobl inactivity to your point k of increases and it is it is it is interesting i think to to con have a convergent theory on this it is still you ow table determine there is still lot of work i think at needs to be done but ta but it is certainly i suggestive that there is pretty profound changes in a in brain activity in brain inactivity after n what we found to be really interesting is the the antidoppress an effects of sylicibon have a particular am inactivity change that we also see with our or times approaches rate and it is this inactivity between the subgenus ant your singular and the default by network and when we do the effect give stamford nor modulation the be stimulation we see a down regulation the inactivity between them negatively valance mod statesmen case at oppressed individuals in the self representation of the brain and you see that same inactivity change occur post syiliciban setting of suggesting there is a convergent mechanism and it make sense right you have cannot and over connected negatively valanced system conflict system that is can you have come attached on to the self representation and people feel stock right and then when you when you do whatever you do that is effective it it nan unfair those two systems i want to ask you about this phenomenon heard about during suicide and journeys i heard about this from am doctor matter johns who is running lot of the clinical trials tat i john's hoping and has been a guest on this podcast he said that there is something seems to be important about the patient whose depressed or whose and is under the the influence of scyliciban were the patient whose trying to get a her smoking or an eating disorder who taking solicit an and is in the clinic that there is something important to this notion of letting go that people will feel as if there thoughts and their feelings and made even their body are not under their control and that the clinicians job under those circumstances is of course to make sure that their physically safe that they do not jump out of window or train i i she give an example of a patient who thought that i think it was a she could move into the painting in the wall and obviously that was not true in the real world although true in her mind they prevented her from doing that but that letting go that somehow ingathering from the autonomic arousal that is occurring is important ism which brings us back to this idea or me back to this idea of a case saw where u letting go of the hinge just you your heart rates going up let just go with it in trust your heart rates going down just go with it and trust you are thinking about a something very powerful and depressing related to your childhood you justsupose to go there without fear you are thinking about what is possible in terms of what could happen at and anyway the you get the et that the picture can we think of that as as just the willingness to do a million different variations on the the emotional stripe task not that you will entertain the full full array of rules within your head and consider them where is there is something more to it at and again were we are in the that the outer margins of what of understanding here but what are your thoughts on on this notion of letting go as such a key variable for relief from depression during the psychedelic journey yes up you we'll talk a little bit about some thing called exposure and response on therapethe the the typical con a gold standard the of freely and it'll help to can he help this little bit conceptually and what that really is it is a letting go there and a expos sure response prevention the idea is that you have to expose the individual to something that some some thing that triggers in obsession that they then want to do whatever the compulsion irate and it'll give you tit you to my first expos sure in response for bench inpatient when i was a resident a he was very concerned about a leaving the light s on his car and a and what we did is we went out and we turn the lights on in his car and locked his door as lighter on and he was superior that can kill us battery ah than we went and we spent an hour talking about things an we went back out to his car and his battery was fine and his lights were one and he cranked the car and we did it may be one other the and then all of a sudden that was gone right and that is the idea is that your essentially exposing and you want to do it it levels that are from an anxiety standpoint tolerable but exposing the person to something and then letting them see that that exposure ins up being fine read in ins rub not causing the thing that the that they'd a being worried about ah and in some sense being in the psychedelic state and we are all all we are all taught at a level to to retain some level of control people have more or less of that but we are all effectively retaining some level control we all wake up in the morning and put clothes on to go into society we all try to say you know most people try to say the right things they do not try to do things there outside of cultural reforms when their in conversation and or wore constantly at some level controlling the situation that wherein and it is you now it is not it makes a lot of sense that in that state part of the therapeutic effect that may be link to the normal circuitry is this idea of letting go and essentially letting the system the network configuration may be whatever it is a assume a state that you've essentially been fighting the whole time the same way that my see de patient was fighting this a need to click the off button on the lights of his car fifty times before he would go and do whatever he needed to do and in some level letting go there meaning letting us just turn the lights on and him not do anything or letting go meaning in the psychedelic state your just letting go of whatever it is you are holding on to negatively valanced think thoughts about yourself and t in the setting of having depression or re experiencing a drama a you a memory and allowing that to just happen and read seeing it again through a different li it you not feels the same in the sense that that is allowing for whatever going on these psychedelic states to do whatever they do fascinating am you said exposure response therapies the tuition is our response prevention prevention er be done outside of the o the psychedelic journey s done outside the psychedelic journey but that idea of letting go as is you know present in both of those psychother can a straight up totally sober non psychedelic non anything psychic vandalize that psycho therapy the we know works really well for of d and then in that psychotic statements or people of done studies with with still side in another some studies o them to you may trying to look it i you treating of d i with this same sort of idea of letting go right and and how do you how o you have and sexy patient con of lek i may be even letting go of not washing your hands any more can o accepting the idea they're knocking i get germs on their hands or whatever it is and it is kind of part of that parting parcel that same sort of thinking when i was in college i developed a compulsive superstition ism not afraid to admit this i ism somehow developed at a knock on wood superstition and i would i was actually kind of ashamed by it of it because it rationally made no sense ism i do not consider myself a superstitious person never was a superstitious kid yid step on the side walk cracks a cat it'd walk under matters i even try ti but walk under a latter in them know i do not suggest it m but somehow i pick this thing up and i use to speak it at times i told my girl friend at the time i had it in hopes that that would prevent me from doing it and it is it is tricky sometimes that actually comes back i think i she did not say knock on would any knock on wood i hope that does not actually happened it is and it is quite n quit crazy right but i a crazing the sense that it makes no sense rationally why the events would be linked and yet i think a lot of people out there yo have in internal superstitions maybe by talking about it now it el it will go away i joust see you clearly i just need to challenge it em it is a an when i mention i because i a might concern myself generally rational person a i ism it is interesting ow these motor patterns get get activated and and this notion of letting go because i do not actually know what consequence i fear and the fear as i was hearing example you gave the other fear of the car running battery running down as about say what if the battery actually did run out then the therapy would be under mine and yet that could also be interesting to because it is not that big of a deal you jump the card a sir but in my case i i been to think about what the ultimate an fear is yen i think feel lot of peoples there is it is interesting if you look it say the used scale or the depression scale or whatever we do not define normal as zero we define normal as sum number range above zero to in the case of the montgomery asper depression raiding scale one of the depression scales we use ten right that is the normal range and people can have some sadness and still be considered normal in the case the see scales about the same ten right where we say it is kind of starts to be ain't you mildly a normal or something and i always a you it always tell the medical students luck my friends that are serf instructors they are more a zero on the wing people professionals you another her the nonzero but you it still within the normal range and and especially the in the case you are talking about it does not sound it got in your way it does not say y u obviously highly successful tenured professor at stand fort and do all the great things that you do ah and it is it is very much kind of within the normal range and exit think totally am totally assume that a lot of people have have these sorts of things and his long i think something a psychiatric diagnosis when it severely temperas your ability to function and that is when we cannot cross that threshold but you know i think that i think that a lot of people and it is great that your bringing this of of its very anti stigmatizing that you bring it upright because i think a lot of people hold that stuff in and they do not want to talk about it because they are worried that somebody else may think something but ha the reality is a a psychiatrist a talked a lot of patients lot of people that are family members i folks what are just going through it a death than the family whatever it is and which you figure out is everybody's got a little something here and there everybody has the knock in some way if that makes sense and it is just and we were just all we are all just cold of more predisposed not to talk about it but i think it is important to talk about it because i think that when we start all talking about it than we realize that we are all con it in this to gather and a way and that were in then some folks that have have to knock a hundred times we call that of d n and they have all you germ there worry about germs all these other things we call that of d and then in that circumstance they need treatment right but but it is really on just blood sugar just blood pressure it is on a range you known it is not just these discreet diagnoses you have them a you do not it's good to know actually feels some relief just sun a i slightly i went say ashamed as er embarrassed by but i i i offer it as at tat it it is what it is is this that ah and certainly does not seem to hinder hinder mom my life much nock on wood is if a we could talk a bit about i begin an i do not know much about i begin although any time i hear that you know a i an lit again i again i think of an anaesthetic i and going to the dentist which is an unpleasant experience for me generally am what is what is i begin am does this then have anything to do with a the called tod am people to about smoking frog skin tod skin a what is it used for clinically is it legal in the you as in as a clinical tool a who is using it and for what purpose is if you could educate me and i begin i truly know nothing about it except i think i know how to spell it cretethat is fro began is a a is one of the alkaloids that you can extract from a a ut yoga tree outback that is a typically growing in the compete of the in the country of gabon africa gabon is one of the west african countries can middle a of africa an the when the west coast and a in gabon is a has a a a group of folks a a called the but a it is a religious con o sacra mental a group that a sacramentally uses a yoga outback is part of of that is is the sacrament a and they a they have been using yoga outback for a very long time a in it is it is been a part of the tradition there is a whole a of he whole set of of kind of ceremony around it a if you are interested in this there is a book called a breaking open the head by spaniel pinchbeck that goes goes through and talks about this a this whole process but essentially a the gabanese hae ben using this for a long time and a it it is it it is a kind of big typical psychedelic it is not it is not a psychedelic that we normally think about with silicivan and lusty where their visual perceptual changes right fou if you take suicide e silicon or lusty what you with you experiences you experience this kind of visual a perceptional differences in the external world right in on enough lust or siolicidan an individual can actually perceive something visually in the external world that is not there as we talked about earlier a i began does not do that i begin does something different it it is kind of if you redeem minority report with the moving i touches a the en or twenty years legit some the a dates i lit of it but a it was this it was this move were he would be able to go and see these and of are crimes and he had this big this big screen where he could look at scenes from from time and can i go through that scene and see it and what what a individuals thing i began will say is it open eyes they do not see anything but closed eyes they will go back through and re experience earlier life memories and they will be able to experience it from a place of empathy not only for themselves but from others and come to a detached empathy and being able to see this as almost a third party even though they were there but they are able to see it as a third parties claugdio pronto as sechiatris from argentina described this helot of books that that he wrote thing the eighties and nineties around this and i begins been around for a long time toward lots off medical my that brought it over from a from africa is a jolly substance use er used every drug that he hat hands on took i began and including a lot of other psychedelics by the way took i again in the never d another drug again supposedly because he had such a profound give again experience i began is in no way a recreational substance it is not a recreational substance if you want it to be a recreational substance because you are essentially having this what they call life review they also call it ten years of psychlitheropean a night these are the terminology that people talk about the inn does at last as it truly one night it is usually we can go depending upon if yet reposed tor anything go sometimes depending upon how fast you metabolize it sometimes twenty four sometimes thirty six hours sometimes it can be shorter but it is long time while a very long time its it is definitely the longest acting psychedelic substance i know of and a and people people you will take this landfill have this reevaluation of the a given memory and then it's wore time early reconsolidate that memory again and then it seems to have an effective of that consolidation process and about five for five years ago i was tapped by rob robot malice one of the a you a senior your a scientist we both know and the university says i the a you others unnamed owner that is very interested in o in funding a group a scientific can i open able study of a of these navy seals that have been going down to mexico and taking a i began and and also on five melodist which it'll talk about in a second ah to treat pities reclaimed of dramatic bran injury a depression you a that whole constellation of symptoms and as as it was described to me a by various people it had done this by their spouses and and what not a john well just say john john cultic screw a light into a light a fireball bit to a light fixture right that they just they were just debilitated they could not do in a simple tasks what we call activities of daily living and they were coming back and having these really dramatic improvements in a in you know all aspects of life and we have over the last couple of years been able to a to do this first inhuman can a full neurobiological clinical near acognativ a valuation f what i began is doing in this case and in special operations special forces individuals former navy seals for me at army rangers tat that and of true fox and look at the report changes that we a that their experience to be able to totally quantitative all of that and we have been able to capture all the clinical scales depression scales tastes scales that stander stuff near cognac battery haw is your executive function work specifically at as your verbal memory all of that and then her imaging and edgy this will be the first human study of ibogain for those in the reason while because i begins kind of the both seemingly the most potent and most a i an an mot seemingly to me at least most powerful a psychedelic but the the one that has the most risk to because it has a cardiac effect it seems to be that you can screen people out that have risk offer their electrocardiagraman and reduce the risk quite a bit and that is what we we all did but a but but that is what people have not really studied it as much mini it is not is ah in addition know right nobody goes to rave on isolate there is no recreation at all but of not fun it is people say that it is relieving but it is hard work right because yet you real your reexamining things and am you know and then then we we we see these folks after and it'll tell you we have it fully analyze the data but it'll tell you that from from what it folks your telinmets pretty dramatic you know people come back and their doing am they are doing a lot better there doing not better and a not nobody it'll knock on what butt's had any sort of a cardiac issue it all a in and in the cohort that we have studied and am and they look a lot better an they feel of better too an a and they describe these experiences of being able to go back through and a soldiers experience something called moral injury right were they maybe they accidentally blue something up and had a kid in it or something that there a grandstand i ran may be youknow child died on accident or maybe maybe a civilian diet or whatever it was right and then they suffer these moral injuries as part of the job an it is almost one of the kind vocational risks they come back and say that they have they've they have for given themselves which is which is huge right and i in part of that is being able to see himself and a different light in having empathy finally for themselves from being able to con have that experience of of forgiving and very cool the the study a you know what was happening was they were taking again and then taking something callfivin modem the people call the toad its the sonorant a a river toad i think it is at you you find these lexica indican arizona a in in the back of the the the toad a produces something old five imeodm t which is a a your flavor of d it that produces a particular psychedelic effect also use a as a sacrament is it at bimetal trip to me sit is it is a five a me bimetal trip to me and it is a kind o bimetal trip to me i with a kind of addition to it the the deal there is a that it lasts longer than traditional dot it in outs twenty minutes a five the or whatever kind of think and a and then these is were taken i began that they up take the five idiom t after we had to cold of divorce those two things people do the study and to s underpants gan was doing and they go back down a month later and they will do the e five into dot the completely separate sessions to two completely separate session and in one quick question by i began before a bit more union thodemt a is the i begin journey guided er the person just closes their eyes and they u start falling into the back catalogue of memories they have a a bunch of preparatory sessions and t they have about obsessions after that they kind of a they are able to kind of rehash things a during there is a sitter that sits there and bandits with them and in in helps them out but it is not it is pretty the phenomenon of the drug seems to drive a lot of this it amen a lot of it since a beingwhat we call support of psychother per is con being there and may be hold the persons hand maybe you're just staying am here maybe whatever it is but you are making sure they know your round but you are not really there is not really an interaction per say and then the whole congeal there is just to get to get folks to con to go back through and re examine these memories tan ultimately look look they re a re consolidate them in do it is very interesting i me in there is a there is this kind of tempt as you said earlier temothylery con a social cultural construct that ins up being overlaid over psychedelics and what i think is that if you rig yourself of all of those preconceived notions of what it is and isn't and the counter culture movement all that stuff that neither of us forever involve in the opus or ever partaken as is cold of straight scientist looking at this right if you can conto rig yourself of all those social cultural constructions and then re examine this these if we just discovered these to day we would say that these sorts of drugs or huge break through in psychiatry because they allow for us to do a lot of the sorts of things we have been thinking about with a with uscesorise with psychotherapy but c in combined right psychotherapy plus plus drugs in in a substance that kind of allows you to re examine these things and it is that is interesting at all there is a lot to do to try a figure out of that is true and and i can say that as it stands right now we do not know if it is that statement is true where it there is a lot more work that needs to happen for that statement to be proving be true but the hypothesis is if it is true then it is very likely that this will be seen as a break through because it allows you to do these sorts of things that you cannot do with normal waking consciousness but also why we have to really think about this and these drugs cannot be recreational drugs they really should not be recreational drugs right there really too powerful to be used in the context to recreation because they can put you into these states and in the this generation of psychedelic researchers are really clear about that you know i think the sixties folks were not clear about that and they they felt those the whole cultural thing that was going on there but i think this cohort of individuals really understands that in order really make this happen we have to understand that if you need a prescription for an assessor i which does not change your consciousness a whole lot and we were very worried about that and the doctor has to valuate you for that every week that the idea that some of these substances would would go outside of of very strict medical supervision is this kind of preposterous actually it is kind of it is kind of a doom and i think for for all medicine to say look we it we can t do this right we have got o do it such a way that protected that say that we make sure people know these things are not recreational and there really for the pure purposes of of really powerfully changing a cognition for a while n letting people have these what is seem to be you know relatively therapeutic states i thing it is great that your doing the study and along the lines of the sort of the early iterations of psychedelics and the counter culture of the sixties in seventies some of which took place one fly of the fuck's ness i think as actually based on am the men park we which isms real you know in our neighborhood of stamford am and things are quite a b different now i know of you and have spent some time with the operators in former operators at at an event and last veteran stay in fact on the so call veteran solutions group that is m pioneering a lot of these psychedelic treatments for former special operators and current special operators and what is interesting to me about that is in contrast to the counterculture movement o the suckscees in seventies that room was filled with people that are very much of a structure the military wight it is no longer am considered left wing right wing anti military pro military here this is just bout one group of people whose exploring psychedelics has a treatment for trogon testy and other other things and at of course you all have other coma new of society looking at this and in fact they were but it was really interesting because they were both a far left and far right politicians at that event one stage together talking about a in kind of a lighter turns heart medicine but also talking about neurobiology and talk it was just fascinating from from the perspective of somebody trying to learn about the stuff that psychedelic derbies no longer sit within the anti establishment realm its it is both it is it it is independent of all that am certainly when people in the military or adopting as a potential treatment again still under exploration but also under exploration that universities stamford and johns hoping and you see us happen f a universe he collage onion and on and on am along the lines of tree barks and goatskins am tell me about was a an as a plant a it is intriguing am and is it a cerprocertonurgic am drug sylisiban am an is it a useful for the same sorts of conditions that we talked about thus far and if you could a perhaps tell me a little bit also about the umbrazilian prisoner study e the wassail another psychodelicats used as a sacrament a in a in brazil an a in peru and ecuador and colombia a lot of the south america countries and a and what they do is they combine two plants together wit where one plant of the two plant combination would effectively do nothing but the two plant combination together is capable of producing a producing this very profound psychedelic effect and whats really kind of curious is the hard as i understand it tend to twenty thousand plant species an the mason in somehow somebody tried of all come behind these two plants together and certain proportionality in cooked this for five ten hours to the point where you cook out the dimathal trip to me in out of ne of the plants and cook out the reversible monoominoxidas an hitter out of the other plant it is such a way that the reversible monminoxidas an hitter prevents the the g i break down of the dymethal trip to me an and such a way that it is then allowed to cross the blood brain barrier and get into the brain and if you did not add the reversible monomnoxidas an higher plant derived into this combination then it would never cross the brain if you put people on a standard psychiatry proscribed monominoxdas an hitter was not reversible you you throw them into seratonenson drum its o this kind of lake sweet spot the somehow i was p practitioners have found being able to get demand the brain from an oral source with this combination of a monominoxidas and visitor is curious a and that that substance has been explored as an antitoprecent agent in some studies have looked at that it also seems to be very safe that a those a i saciatrisdown at a you seel a harbor whose don a lot of work with this where a where he is looked at children even that have been exposed just small doses of iawaska as as is a count of sacrament within amazonian a tribes and found no nor cognate effects no nor acognaive effects and adults and a an appears to be save it is part of it is count of part and brought into various religions including kind of merged with catholicity in south america kind of very interesting and in some sects of catholicity in brazil it is used as sacrament during religious a ceremonies and it became interesting to brazilin researchers is to whether or not they could effect recidivism rates for prisoners in brazilin prisons rite n they gave half o the prisoners a some sort of inert substance and half o the prisoners a a aawaska session and the the a recidivism made of the return to prison rate in the iawaska exposed individuals was statistically significantly lower than the recidivism rate in the in the control group suggesting that ta yen whatever is going on there seems to have an effect on whatever drives criminal behavior whatever criminal behavior that happened to be i do not have the the details on the exact nature of the crime a you do not knot i am also in no way saying that we shut be giving psychedelics to to to fox in prison and all that i think that that that that is a very edgy thing to do and probably not something that anybody should try but what it does it does kind of bring up this this curious question of of what is it about that that would drive people to a to change those behaviors and when why why of people make those behavioral decisions in in a lot of times if you look it prisons in the united states you set people say this what is the biggest mental health facility in the in the united states its prison yet there is a a lota unpack there for sure a homeless issue the prison issue a it does lead to something that i heard recently and which is related to all this which is a cannabis i do notion know we hear lot now days about a people say what safer than alcohol and we did an episode on call that at least by my read or the literature a indeed to the algal does seem to be a quite bad for our health been o be i think id it pretty clear that not drinking is better for your health than drinking at all and here ism not trying tell yo what to do but hat those are what the day to say and forget the studies on red wine you would have to drink much red wine to get enough for uts very chaos i even clear at her trial doesn'anything useful anyway et camera et camera none the last minibus is now available in a lot of very high potently form the people are raping cannabis am people are smoking cannabis i certainly am not saying that cannabis is bad for people necessarily although i think children i would i hope that their brain development would be be completed first you get age twenty five i know that sounds late am for a lot of people but am it the t c obviously taps in to some a indigenous systems of of of and canabinoid systems and is powerful and have seen this a this report that was in a lancet psychiatry this last year that said that early use of potent cannabis meaning age fourteen to twenty or can potentially lea to in exacerbation of psychosis later in life and i i tally put this out on social media and a sort of exploded u i did not expected too people saying well that is not causal and obvious its not casual am because people say will may be people with a psychotic tendencies are seeking out cannabis although that sort of a weak argument and in the sense that there is a a at least of four times am a four ax increase in these a psychotic episodes the people later in life but what a your thoughts about cannabis because i do want acknowledge that it does have medical benefits foreseen thins a pain hemotherapy am by no means trying to to knock on cannabis and its appropriate met medicinal use but what what the think about canaibus in terms of this finding that a kind exacerbate a psychosis in certain individuals yes i think there is us e couple things rates or cannabis is is multiple canikin its red c c b d c b and see vas and indices it that is the there is a lot there tun pay the there is a there is a lot of there is but there too there too man you have con chemicals you think about how things are er r a or sickly bread right and there is a lot of minibus it is really bread to be very high are potent c there is a lot an there is minibus we the t is bred completely out there stories am you now from from colorado i the a strain of of minibus that t c feathers no t s it all and it is all c b d and they a it is called charlottes web a and a bunch of a kid's parents one kid to and can have a string of parents after that moved to colorado and minibus was legal be c legalized because c b d is antiapoleptic c b d is also anti psychic there's been a number of studies if you give c b d t hi doses it is anti chaotic in skitsophrenic established kitsophrenic patients the issue is that we have bread b d out of merman selectively over time of got very good at figure how to do that right conversely t s is procycotic and proepoleptic i and when you talk about its canvas cause cyclosis or just anabas treat psychosis it appears to be more related to the proportions a s b d to t c than it does to the idea of anabas for me there is a there is a kind i a no stokes or anything that but there is a company called y do farmer suitable and i have not looked into them in a while but they a they they have a aloticlynical trials for some called drama cindram which is a seizure o disorder or kit ss whole to lenixgasto caldron which is a seizure disorder wiser seizing threehundred times a day both of these are like killers seizing much they they are basically in a seizure or in the poetical pase constantly and and they have failed everything they failed barbiturates they failed bromides which we we we do not use any more except into these cases because of the sideeffects and they'll give kid s b d and i think s bus pretty save drug comparative bromide right and this idea that that s b d in a kid is actually safe it is it is it is a canibidoid but it c b d s i and that to me is totally fine also giving c b d is a adjunct of treatment for for skits for any other been e positive trials and negative trials and about there seems to be no negative scideffects it seems to reduce some of the metabolic centrum issues and in dagos with y skits crania who are having sideeffects from the primary anticyclonic the the converse is there is clearly cases where people that a taken very hidroses of t c become psychotic they get put into the psychiatric unit nothing happens o to the the kind of get the t c out of their system and then they resolved their psychosis right and that that and a handful of people have had no seizure's related to hidroses of t c pinko in all sorts of thing and this idea that t c hidroses of t c can be procycotic is also not taking a shot at people that think that anabas over all is a good thing it just it it's is what it is and the conjure if you i think you fume back you say your true naturalist you think about natural medicines in the world you should think well probably marina was balanced t c c b d at some point than we just we humans must with it right and in that most likably that was probably o ka it is some level and then we pushed it one w are another and and what i mean by ones in a forty five year old it is o k kind of thing now what i think is going on with the the kids with it teen ages as you have got referral maturation right and then your exposing them to a whole lot of hi tease sea load and a while it is unclear effects if it is cause or effect it certainly in the picture and if i were apparent i would not want my sixteen year old smoking marijuana if i were apparent in my thirty year old otherwise healthy a totally fined whatever banker lawyer kid decided to try marijuana for the first time i wouldn't scold them about it right i think it is this kind of a different thing right i would never want my up to twenty five year old just your saying before referral maturation of never want my kid to be exposed at all but it looks except in susceptible individuals actor susceptible to drug in to psychosis it looks it is o it is a relatively safe thing past referral maturation again i cannot ism not in a comment of cause and effect but i but i would say that it does not if you are apparent it does not make much sense right it must you want it you never know what is ultimately can o hurt your kid ma now my wife's priggery ting out sterling my wife's pregnant now can one avoids everything right rightfully right this idea that we just we want to be careful when our children brains are developing and i think that is really what you were saying and i think actually important the bigger question you asked which is relative risks of drugs is an interesting one avid nut published in think it was in the lance that it'll have to look at up i think in the lancet an article about relative drug risks for the person and for society and this was he was on the the the okas brutish a drug a policy group where essentially what he showed was if you took if you look at social risk plus personal risk and you combined those two it drug is the most dangerous drug in the world an a guess its calls alcohol right behind heroine and cocaine and did it it do somewhere in the middles marijuana and right on the tail end on the other on the exact other end of this silicon its catena did usually does not i tells i i may have been on the list as private it was it was probably pretty close to silicon but somewhere in the middle was redeem and somewhere in the middle was was was a embed o being somewhere in the a little closer to siliciban that was in dead may but but if it is it is this combined personal can have world risk of these things and alcohol makes it because there is a huge amount of personal risk and the huge omen of social risk right drunk drivers kill exciton of kit you know people in the world by sexual assail that all that ye and then all the cancer and all that to and i it beats out cocaine it beats out heroine it beats out all these things and and yet ism and yet we do not we do not as a culture for whatever reason we do not as a culture see it is a drug and that is the part that really baffles me and i mean they serve it i mean this is no knock on stamford at all course i would do that this at every institution have been to they serve alcohol at they graduates don events us right but they sir alcohol that we would they do a happy hour have never been a drinker i can take it tor leave it id i realize that some people they really enjoy aldol a my former partner mean cheers we in that you ten per center people who have a glass one and just feel great and side one feel great i i just want to take an a after i i have beet of alcohol never does much for me i always feel poisoned i feel lucky in that sense but it is it is unbelievable that it is prevalent and it is it just it is baked into the medical even medical incitation that they will pop a bottle of champagne to celebrate the opening of a hobbit et trig the r you know it's ready crazy yet ow you are absolute right you know i think i think what is going to happen but this is me look in the crystal ball a little bit but i think what is going to happen is what happened with doctors and smoking f you look the fifties and sixties right there all these pictures of doctors smoking a cigarettes in with patients er a cites to encychlotherape and smoke a cigarette with the patient sitting on the coach you surgeon smoking a cigarette and between cases they are all these pictures that right and now f the sudden smoking totally band i think it is totally band from most of standard campus my suspicion is as your suggesting right this is everywhere and it is all we you quit us at some critical point some tipping point everybody's going a realize that just with smoking we have get a rid hospital systems in universities of alcohol and it is some point in fifty years it is my view that we will look it back these these cesarean your talking about and and be what we a we were foolish about this we i cannot believe that we we gave people alcohol on the wet when they graduated from whatever and i think we will have a different take on it but it is going to take it is contain a longer time i think i think people did a really good job tying smoking o one cancer and it is very very simplistic story smoking lung cancer now you as alcohol increases the risk of a lot of different cancers not clear which while and there is i of the kind of or the throat tongue cancer that is one as cancer you best cancer and it is bit is can have just it is a harder story to tell and i think that is why i in everybody and then there is this whole it is an my mam says is i drink my glass of wine because my doctor told me it was heart healthy an heretic others and i try to non but be doctor son a said it is heart health sit in up being this thing we are she is drink an all because she thinks that its it is good for heart in a you known it is it is hard have had those conversations that hurt's heart until that i think that to a yet some point were in it it is some some threshold moment it will be interesting if we really look at the data and we really look at what is safe and not safe from purely from this analysis it can have it cave points to the right direction through the interesting and also i say nothing poor judgment under the influence of call i man i i it would venture that if we are to remove call from university canvases what show watch the students are gin a lobby against me if i says if you were to remove algal from canvass mind just think about the the what i suspect would be the improvement in good decision making and that would occur or you not id have got stories from graduate school and put in it it it was very different a ten years ago there was a lot more call consumption yen that was never my thing but i know people make really bad decisions in any case a ears ha whole landscape there emerge i thing you got your finger right on the pulse of it i i want a touch on something slightly different than what we been talking about but definitely related to depression and this is again is one of these intriguing but perplexing things which is that sleep reprobation can improve symptoms of depression and yet ism in personally very familiar with the fact that if i do not sleep well for one night ere do not sleep at all in fact i do have an ability to function pretty well the next day it'll do this non sleep deep least practice that i babble to about on the superman laud pod cassarchfor me is tremendously restorative but i a good night sleep i think everybody understands now thanks to the great work of father walker and others that really gotten out into the world saying look the foundation of mental health physical health and high performance if that is your thing being a functional human being is to trying get enough quality deep sleep at least eighty percent of the nights of your life if you can that is that something to folk is on just good nutrition just exercise and social connection et camera sleep deprivation we know can imine particular i think rapid i movement components of sleep reprobation can improve the symptoms of depression and yet being sleep deprived can also really deregulate our control of the autonomic into my notice on night too or night three of poor sleep if on going through distrustful phase and that is happening all a sudden my heart rate is ironically elevated my thought patterns become really destructed i cannot than exercise you i can my decision making is thrown off my emotionality is more lay about the hinge as we referring to it earlier feels lasting control ah under my control and many i wonder sometimes if i enter that stay refer to earlier were the dor haven't refutal quarts is no longer leading the singular but the singular's now in charge that players are in charge of the coach e an not again situation i know you have done some work on sleep deprivation and lighten effects a please tell us about that and a please tell us about this triple therapy yet yes a friend of mined no great slum by one another o one of the professors standard a is very interested and sleep heated a much of much a training sleep before you into medical school and a and got very interest in this idea that is your saying if you sleep deprive somebody a one night in just kind of an isolated single night if the at the end of that sleep deprivation they will have an antidepress and effect but as soon as they fall asleep they lose it if it is a depressed individual you get them to be less depressed acutely soon as they falls sleep they wake up eight hours later than they come they come back into the same level depression and the idea is that you needed to do some sort of circadian reset and it parted what part of what depression is is that it is a deregulated circadian system and mentors of mind say if you just get the sleep better that is half the battle of dealing with depression to many people have in sonic around depression and have e whole host of types of insomnia fault having our time falling asleep waking up in the middle a night and waking up earlier all symptoms of depression and what this does is it sleep deprives the individual and then there is a certain calculation of shifting their phase and simultaneous sly exposing them bright light that is the triple the pase shift the sleep deprivation in eyebright light to tret it get their circadian rhythm essentially the the thermos rein trained and a know it in t in the trials that we have done an other trials a prior to ours and and and after you look those a pretty pretty profound anti depress an effect from this triple their this triple therapy that seem to be durable meaning durability is this term we use to say that not only can you get con point relief but that the relief ans up you know lasting what is important to know about this is you should not do the t how for sure this you would need to do this for the professional cause it is complicated it is not just one thing and it in sleep deprivation while it seems to be antidpress in its pro anxiety you take a highly anxious person that is not depression you sleep deprive them they get profoundly anxious and that is the other thing that that you have to really realizes that this is everything else to to day all things that you you have to do under medical supervision but but curious right and and i think that the questionthat always comes up as why as an this used more and i think the reason is that there is not really a mechanism for ultimately and in medicine as sad as it is you have have a code to do a thing there is to be a code associate with a treatment and it is hard to figure out how to make a code for this and i think that is part of it and if if there is a way and somebody is got a con to take that baton on that but if there is a way to make a code for this a you i think you could you could actually turn in into something was more widely widely utilize and you a pray dream up ways have had a had a in great a ay passive sense sing all that stuff to really make that work am but i think that would be that would be the the idea that be the trajectory i see si ye having a billable to insurance code is nice fundamental and a lot of listeners in this podcassite i think have a background in engineering science and we will put a link to that a manuscript that talks about the triple therapy because you were talking about one nights sleek deprivations and taught time to let a light exposure to the eyes and and then shifting in the circadian clock things central to the themes of this pot the podcast to come often am i think for the typical person can we say a that trying to get a regular dark cycle at sleep rhythm would be beneficial for over all mood regulation ye i think for for the typical perse and a really really kind of deregulating your sleep and in trying to get a good nights sleep in which you fall sleep stay asleep wake up in a set time every morning as going to be pretty crucial a in mild depression i think that one has a lot of control over that is we tying about early i think when you u hit some threshold in depression where things become con of simivolitional lots harder to kind of will yourself an to that a there are therapies a there there is a see tee for in sonic for instance for you cognac behavioral therapy to help with in sonic sometimes people ut ism not ism no sleep expert that in a pass us to grew to fully talk about this but but a but some of what goes on that people w cone a milder and sonic experiences blue light out of their computer and things that that they you used blue light blockers to to it tricks your your brain is better than me a tricksier brain to think that it is still light outside and people will they will have in sonic because their brain still thinks that it is light outside and then people well am that the kind of strict see b t for sleep a i therapists will say there only two things that you should do in your bed and if you are under a certain age and in what not it is really one thing that you should do in your bed which is to sleep and a an in be with your partner a right an those ore there is our kind of the two a the two things that you should do in a bedroom and that is really the only things that you should do n a bedroom if your having sleep problems you should not watch teen e in a bedroomshon eating bedroom ships euro hang you phone out of the bedroom keep the phone out of the bedroom now a we should get great sales on the pot cast we the it'll just mention repeople that want to regulate their sleep we have a a sleep tool kit that is available as a down loadable media that suberin la dot come just go to the machine a lot of the things in that tool kit a based on work from stamford sleep laboratories including family's users and others a lad ism not aimed at depression specifically a listen i none doctor willies a this has been an amazing a voyage through the circuitry of autonomic control this landscape of the prefrontal quartiles a i find incredibly fascinating and i i just been to start off by saying please do come back again om just more about that and your mamas work i before we rap however i do wane to give you the opportunity to talk about the saint study e is it saint or saints floral at saint a saint or what were we are calling at us in t now a saint has the intent was not ta to have to count of connect it to religion but a but we may a a accidentally done and we we abbreviated it to san t for the for the subsequent trials which was initially standard accelerated intelligent or modulation therapy or now re calling standoff nor modulation therapy but its a the idea there which is a cool ideas that mamas a is a device that deliverers a the delivers of treatment an the treatment is the protocol in the protocol is the stimulation perimeter set in a specific brain region for a specific condition and what is cool about normodulation the the it be transcribing magnetic stimulation or transcranial direct current stimulation deep brain stimulation what case happen talked about a on another podcast is this idea that in all those cases the device itself is a physical layer conduct a a stimulation protocol the therapeutic for given condition in a given brain region and in the case of depression which we know the most about for wit mamas we have been doing mamas studies for depression for yer since nineteen ninety five right in a clearance in two thousand a two thousand eight two thousand nine and in that a in that time frame we were able to go from really knowing very little at all about how to do something this to getting an a t clearance in in the way that it went down was that there were two groups studying a different component it and i the first group we studying mood neranatomy on functional imaging that was kind of the first generation of functional amazing back then pet scans a which er conmetabolic scans a and then spent scans and the idea there was looking at activity and metabolism in referral quarter and what they found in these come were crude scans is a general hypo activity hypometabolism the other reed upstairs at the national institute for neurological diseases and stroke in i an yes they were looking at using teams which had been around for ten years and rerepetitidly stimulating in mother quarter what they found was gosh we can get a read out in thumb a muscle a movement amplify that is really reproducible across people it like universally reproducible naif we do certain stimulation approaches they are biologically active to either increase excitability i e the thumb motion an a set intensity goes up the amount of amplify goes up or in history depotentiating it goes down with other biological stimulation approaches than a third outcome which is important that it is inert it does not do either you concave stimulation approaches tot do one increase activity decrease activity or you or a inert and what they found was oh we can excite certain brain regions and my men to r mar gorge had had this conahamoment where he said wow there is under activity and referral quarter in depression and we can increase activity using this thing that we know we can increase activity motor quarter we just need to put it in the left or collateral retinal quartet and then they combined the two and started stimulating once a day in this kind of very abbreviated fashion in lone behold some of those depression patients resolved their depression in back then and still to day you can go and as a psychiantropatient stay it the nationalistitudimal health and go through clinical trials to try to get treated and there repeating patients have bee there for months and they were able to be discharged he got a mood was better yet and i very crude approach for their using ruler measurements or a deal p s was and the stimulating with devices that you need to physically dunk the coil and an ice bath and with that is still were able to the consensus of this f mark and others or still be able to to create a a purely engineer stimulation approach whats which cool about that is that that they they could have found two things right they found this one stimulation protocol it does have some untie to press and effect its it is limited it does not treat everybody does have some untie topless and effect and this bigger concept that a demodulation device is conflict a parasitical company for you right that in the given individual a teams device or whatever normodulation device is able to generate to to uncrate a stimulation approach that is specific to a given condition and specific to an individual and the physical layer is just how you exert that similarly to how we make fharmasutical drugs and at pharmosutical company but the actual there itself is what you do where you do it and what we learned from another twenty thirty years of this is that you can modify the stimulation photo call in such a way we can create a whole new treatment and put it through the same tamest office or thank od i solve version of it we y do not have to donged nice basis and and take an actually really hands much more aggressive stimulation approaches and in two thousand in five of a group published a neuron a paper demonstrating that if you if you stimulate with the hipocampel rhythms through a tamescoil you can excite the brain with memory rhythms and it will last an hour you can change cortical excitability in the thumb twitch for an hour sending three minutes of excusatory or forty seconds the case of in hippotory stimulation that mimics thyppicampel rhythms much more efficient the original tames approaches and after that group try to do it in this kino six week schedule and after that and while they were doing that we decided gosh this prom i talked about the beginning of to show where you have these you know this problem we we do not have a treatment for people who are in these hi acuity psychiatric emergency states right this idea that we are an engineer a treatment where we can re organize the stimulation approach in time to be much more efficient by utilizing something called space learning theory and you you praying about the space learning theories the idea for the for t years is it is the simple psychological thing we have a seen it in hippocampus slice sort of physiology too where if ism cramming for a test what i do as i write out sixty note cards and i read each one for a minute until i get to the first note garden again and that is about an hour or later right and we just we just intuitively do this we all we allow know automatically do that and we we we into it that because we know that what does not work is writing out one note card and looking at it over and over again nobody ever does that right you we we have all been ingradschool medical school we have these big stacks and note cards that space learning theory it is this idea that you need to see it about every hour to an hour and a half and that optimizes learning if you take the same stimulation approach than i talk about the state of or stimulation approaching you take a hippocampus slice of a mouse and you stimulate you you enlarge som dendritic spines and you prime sum and then if you stimulate right after that you do not get any change is called in stimulation but if you wait about an hour or to an hour and a half you get more dindredecpines enlarged and more primed which by the way also is what enemy does t it does that it causes this interdict pine enlargement and what we f found was is that the old way of doing t amass this idea of just doing at once a day every day five days a week for six weeks did not utilize the space learning theory it is studying for a month or two just a little bit once to day like you remember some of that stuff but it is not as potent is that we where your kind of cramming right in what we realize is that if we could reorganize the stimulation and times that we took the whole six week course an we actually figured out away to do it in day an then what we also figured out is that people were undergoing t amass because if you just keep going after six weeks out to month three for five more more people got better we figured out it is not just one day where you five times the normal dowering of sevengand a half months worth than five days using space learning theory every hour every hour for ten hours for five days or five days sure he fifty our blockers ninety minutes of actual stimulation but spread out through the day in the same way of learning which is perfect for an impatient psychiatric initial five days is tangible yet it get stimulation nobody's ever dropped out by the schedule o the they their new folks wet want to do this want to do it they will do their nine minutes tho you get breakfast will do their nine minutes the go either therapist or whatever it is and what we found a with this reorganization and in time of the stimulation dose and then the third component is we do resting state functional inactivity scans on everybody and we have ways now in the last five ten years of picking out that she sonic subgenus feel p f s sub circuit that i was talking about earlier that singular deal p v s we can pick that out in every single one if you you won to come to lad we can we can find your deal of c subgenus its even more robots than we none and real to just were and the yet you out to we can we can move rout your hypnotizability of an we can we can find that spot in each person instead of finding the same spot on the skull we find the same spot on the brain and we can stimulate we do that every hour in the hour andwhat we found what were found is that folks will a will within one five days and in more cases than not and depending upon if your looking it is open label or in trials somewhere between sixty and ninety per cent of the time they will go into full on remission in the since the totally normal from a mood stamping at the end of this and it said with variable our durability that is the part we have to forgot now about dosing and ho to keep people well but for some people meet we have had four years of remission year of remission and it is it is really that cramming of the test that is really that idea that your laying in that information o the exact right spot in the in the signal is a simple signal but it is a profound one which is turn on stay on remembered a stay on that idea that your it your sending this memory signal into the brain and your doing it in such a way that your telling the system you con o taking out of the hypicampusis want your own hippicampas's hand is your sending the same signal the hippocampus normally signals out now you are sending that signal into the referral tarmac an kind of utilizing the brains own communication still to get it to get out of the state and what is very cool about this is that ta is that people when they when they con exit out of that theyndaam they'd up saying they do not have any any side effects from it and they feel acts o normal some people not everybody but there is a subject of people with with us arise we they will say a kind of feel not where i have the inside effects are i cannot i cannot i do not have the sexual interest that i used to have in that sort of thing not thing encesersorises the steer armor life saving unifier a subsection of people these things really work but with this what you see is that people do not talk about any that stuff and i think it is it is likely because you are tapping into that course circuitry and your reversing it and you're doing it with a with a magnet that because it is a very profound electromagnets the same field strength is an memorize scanner it is able to induce a current in the brain in this vocal targeted way without getting into the rest of the brain without getting into the rest of the body at all and just really con acting only on that circuitry that is involved incredible it is the same study steal on going in if people are interesting in potentially being am a patients or subjects in the study a can we provide them portal link absolutely as we have a now the the treatment a my summit students whenever to company called magnet medical o and they have been working on this they have got en auto a clearance now and dam and now folks can get it through trials over the next couple of years because it is on to take some time for that company to to kind of get up in running and and get a am get a get a device and get the whole thing set up a nationally but while that is all going on they are still about a thousand patients that need to be recruited to cross a bunch different trials all over the country we will take people from anywhere in the country we ell shave partners in new york and sand ego and another n n soon to be south caroling another places where we can actually can a you my lap can help to con o let people know where to go where that you a based off where the tin you ask and get them access to being able to be in a trial and what we have tried to do is make it that even if you get the fifty fifty chance you gan to get the real deal or young to get the the the non real deal but what we have figured out as a way to let every one have access a if they if they got the not real deal version the con sham version of the fate version for the first part of the trial they're other trials where they can have access to the real version essentially everybody eventually gets access to having the real version and that been a big thing for me as i i want ever nobody that comes through one of our trials to be able to have access and its important while i while you the companies doing what they are doing with the labs doing in nationally what loot you know other partner labs are doing we i can assure you when it get some interest chap you to have you d have i thank you and thin thank you much i for taking us on this incredible voyage through the were circuitry under lying certain aspects of depression the coverage of the different types of depression the various i they repute it compounds how they work we have ism talked about a lot of thingsayg you you've shared much knowledge and even as i say that i ism i very much when to have you back to talk utile many other things as well that we did not have time to cover but el so is really want to thank you for the work that you do i know we are colleagues but i you run an enormous laboratory enormous in my but forty a people as a is a big group a very big group plushier you are in the clinic you also have a a life of your own outside of work and to take the time to sit down with us and share all this knowledge that really is in service to mental health and and human feeling better and in fact a avoiding often suicidal depressions just incredible work and incredible generosity and just thank you much i thank you may n every i i you have similarly i want to thank you for for what you are doing i m i think i think that which you have a a lot of friends a fun it a nottmadical profession friends of mind a one of my bodies who a a real state age and we works with us i was a big big finer show and a you no told a couple people that's s coming on and i and they were superstar the we know we watch we watch every show and a superexcited to to to watch ism mind and the they sit something very important to me that you make this this complicated a were science and in con on a bit brain body science accessible and in a way that the few have a gift to do and i think at that important and in this show is doing much to to help with science literacy and yet appreciate you well thank you am ism gratified and honored i by your statement and ism i look forward to more thank you absolutely thank you thank you for joining me to day for my discussion with doctor dollar willies i hope you found our discussion about psychedelics and other compounds about transcranial magnetic stimulation and about the treatments for depression in general to be as

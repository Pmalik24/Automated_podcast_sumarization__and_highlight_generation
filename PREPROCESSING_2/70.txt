the benshpirosho sponserbaks pressvypien protector online pray today at expresvypianta cam flash men this weekend marked artists day in great brain and veterans day in the united states both are sombre days typically marked by honor and respect for symbols of the country and for the men and women who have sacrificed much for the country this weekend instead both onion and n w york city featured terrorist supporters marching on mass through the centers of the west proclaiming their sovereignty mark's philosopher show pull sorta once blustered that the west was guilty for its colonization the best path would be colonization in reverse quote it is our turn to tread the path step by step which leads down to native level but to become natives are altogether our soil must be occupied by a formally colonized people and we must starve of hunger this will not happened said sorta sorta was wrong he along with his minded and soft headed colleagues helped to discredit the west thoroughly that the west spend decades importing millions of people who despise it and onion this weekend saw radical museums threatening the open annihilation of news e a e tat la ta i death to all the news rang the middle of mall and due talking how cell of killer i the we e t forty wat they fit lies why do the the a make timing why de the go the the ta a cade an a loco mason ta that town do a

and they chanted ceiba cabrayhood which of courses reference to the chronic incident in which hammed slaughtered in entire to his village this weekend saw home grown or imported radicals wearing the head gear of terrorist group compass these are literally protestors with compass head bands on them with is a crime in brain and it saw these procomas protestors attempting to mob the current secretary of state for housing michael got as see shying crowd of procomas protestors where following a member of the government the police are trying to spirit this member of government away at least one hundred and fifty people were arrested but there were three hundred thousand marching in solidarity with an actual terrorist group there is one banner in particular that stood out it reads your either on the whites or the right side of history where is has white this manner it shows four flags these really flag the america flag puca flag and the french flag where it says right it chose a bunch of arab flags itches much of african flags again white or right this in a nutshell is the philosophy of those who march with comose and against the west the west is powerful the west has exploited the west is white therefore the west is powerful because the west is white and exploitative the right thing to do is to side with front canon's wretched of the earth the flags here by the way are apparently the flags of congo sudan the palstinians and the eager flag none of those places are particularly free or well governed and there are much the unifies them other than they are not white and yet the wrong side of histories apparently israel the ask up and france that is same philosophy extends to this side of the water here is a flier that is been making the rounds at the university of chico as you can see if you can watch this the anti schematism on this flier is directly linked with anti whiteness this flier says ending white privilege stars with ending jewfish privilege the idea is that the news are ultimately white people the are unduly successful and therefore they must be stopped the poster shows a pyramid and it chose the one per cent is it is the one per cent straight white men or is the one per cent jewfish says this flier handed out of the university of chico this notion is fully coincident with anti americanism america after all is largely great because of the promise that any one of any background can get ahead jewfish america are one of the great success stories in america history by that standard give the fact that they arrived mostly in the early twentieth century in the united states dirt poor and quickly became highly educated in economically successful the current antisemitic movement is linked directly to hatred for this country and its meritocratic promise that is why prochomos protestors spent this weekend in the united states ripping down america flags this was in new york city we can see a man climbing up the flagpole and east forty third street and tearing i down america flags leaving palstinian flags up their tearing down those america flags got to make sure that those t do not stay up and people cheering wildly where the police no one knows rest a terrace by the way across the world those who have not cheer are uniting against the west they blame the west for their lack of success while living off the west largess that is why over pampered over celebrated dulled complete more on great twinburg spent burweed en lincoln climate change with support for compass as those lamaterrists word tremendously about solar panels rather than burning jewfish babies alive the mothy listening the teopletollernothi listening you wit fan this f months is in en firemen a comment on be trying to take away the microphone because if she is ranting non cynically about gaze and the so being stop by bunch of women a serin cathead and he gets tragedy away did she can continue to jabber about the possess strip this obnoxious idiot child who is no longer a child wo can make fun of her now she has been fitted she has been treasured by the west for years to be a completely destructive moronic force the west has a choice it can be colonized in macros fashion or it can refuse that colonization in the use that battle is taking place largely over the verbiage of swell a brakeman she as the former home secretarial get to that moment she as been stalwartly calling for an end to the police and the governments coddling of procomas rallies over the weekend she the to quote our brave police officers deserve the thanks a every decent citizen for their professionalism the face of violence and aggression from protesters and counter protestors in onion yesterday that multiple officers were injured doing their duty is an outrage she continued the sick in lavatory and in some cases clearly criminal chance placards and paraphernalia openly on displayed the march marka new lot antisemitism and other forms of races an together with the vaporizing of terrors m on such scale is deeply troubling this cannot go on week bi week the streets of onion are being polluted by hate violence in antisemitism members f the public are being mobbed and intimidated jewfish people in particular feel threaten further action is necessary now brakeman is not white she is india extraction but that of course does not matter she does not imbibe from the well of pseudo victimhood and thus she is an enemy to be destroyed and because brakeman made the unfortunate mistake of telling the truth she has now been summarily fired from her job noticing the predations of those who love comas is a dismissible offense in the use in the words of need base a former had of counter terrors and policing in the use quote you have a chance of in flaming both sides when you make such decisive remarks yes it was the remarks that were decisive not the hundreds of thousands of people calling for the destruction of israel and newest from the heart of onion and both sides that might be inform those very very dangerous news in landed who might be inflamed must not defend brakeman's alter brought back to power former prime minister avid cameroon is foreign secretary in amazing change of events she has a foreign policy squish who stood against brave and had resign from office when he lost camera is shown himself perfectly willing to speak words of appeasement to muscle radicals into then ten he labeled gas quote prison camp welling turkey which his a is comic tatatorship and suggested that israel had to open up gases borers well comas was in charge criticizing israel for stopping a shipment of weapons from turkey to the gasestrip after all fate for naturists an all that in the united states that battle is taking place of the universities where enemies of the country are ushered in and offered scholarships at or top institutions of higher learning the latest exertion comes courtesy of mite where radical students violated the universities rules by occupying public places they were not allowed to occupy news were then told by the university not to enter through main areas do to safety concerns now these procomastudens are foreigners you the university could have easily suspended them they did not in violation of their own rules why not well it would violate their scruples about the necessity of importing people into the united states who hate the united states the university president openly state to quote because we later herd serious concerns about collateral consequences for the students such as e a issues we have decided as an instruction that the students remained after the dead line we will be suspended from non academic campus activities the students remain en roll it am i tee and we will be able to attend academic classes and laps see it turns out that if these people were suspended and they hate the united states than theoretically they would be eligible for deportation and we would want terror supporters deported that might open a laughed a mi tee to in agent america or something the mite student come out supporters they celebrated as you wouldexpect giant rally yesterday if ad use an in international shame an theirturing that they have one they did not end of suspended because the university decided the united states must have foreigners who hate the country here must it has to happen these people know that the weakness of the west means living off the fat of the land while seeking to undermine the very society that humors their garbage the reality is that the west has created wildly disproportionate prosperity and freedom over the course of its history compared with other civilizations the does not excuse the west sins it does me that tearing down the west in favor of supposed alternatives is disgusting and repulsive if the west is an aging lion those who seek to tear it down are scavengers relying on that lion for their livelihood and the r well being but seething with envy and hatred either of the western line will roar again where the scavengers will tear it to pieces that is the choice we face in just one second we will get to the latest from the middle east and great lies there being told by our media of course first obviously we are facing serious economic turmoil and international economic turmoil domestic economic

come freshmen use coven to save fifteen per cent off oka the great lie that is now being told by enormous numbers of members of the media is the lie that the violations of human rights that have happened in the gossip strip are somehow the result of his rely policy as oppose to the results of commons terrorism they are a a wide variety of narratives that are now being trotted out by soft headed morons in the west in order to try and protect commons or to pretend the moral equivalency that allows them to go back to see and pretend tat the problems that exist in the streets of onion do not nactuallates of see the thing is if you can pretend a moral equivalence ten israel and its enemies then that allows you to go back to your isolationists view of foreign policy in which things that happen very far away are not happening at home but you will notice the lot those things are happening at home intends to wake you up to foreign policy when you got three hundred thousand people chancing for compass on the streets of onion or when they have tens of thousands of them in the united states or when you have america campuses honeycomb with people who love comas attends to open your eyes to the consequence is of morally relative the stick policy when it comes to foreign policy and better to go back to sly and that are bunch of members the media ore desperately attempting to do this routine the be s more than any one else because the problem is really really big in onion much bigger than it is in the united states the united states as a problem of s lomocraticals living here but as a per centare of the general population is lomograticals are not a huge percentage of the america population n the fact is that the number of muscles in the united states is approximately three and a all million obviously to all those people are radicals severe talking bout o very small percentage however when you talking about muscles in the qua you're talking about seven per cent of the country in inland and whales not fifteen per cent of onion when you hung my muscles and a huge percentage of those by polingtata are not only anti israel they are wildly antistatic and obviously by the numbers very much pro protecting commons an that you can do a look that in the face ordain deny that it is problem at all and the easiest thing to do is to fires swell a braver men and pretend that is not a problem at all now in order to establish that its not a problem what you have to do defter pretend the israel tho tell rob in the millimes the b b case between the nonstop the b b c is basically just an artist outlet on behalf of proterrorism forces in the middle's that is what they are that is what they become the pathetic perfect example yesterday the b b c did not interview with along baby who is the israel government spokesman and this interview is perfection sane because alien lay points out and when civilians are dying in goa its because commas is hiding behind trillions that israel is targeting military targets and compasses deliberately attempting to massively increase the cavilling casualty numbers in orders they can go to the more an to the b b c an claim that israel ought to pursue a cease fire this b b c anchor response to that clam by saying it is convenient for israel somehow that is convenient for israel to make the argument the becoming military targets now again let me shut mind everybody israel has complete military superiority in this era is rows complete air superiority commassosn'nt have than got and assectines israel could if it wanted to turn the entire place to rubble could turn the entire place to glass it could kill millions of people instead israel is purposely targonin not only that willowy evidence in just a second an they're attempting to take care of palistonians millions in away the compass actively is attempting to stop but here is the b b c lime is is what they do it is a convenient responses in it that every time there is not is ready strike on some sort of facility in sit gas you just tells the harasses a pricing thar an that is why your firing bat we understand is to o no ally i was saying that its facility the you had incenacially recognize body the u and says that it is facility in posit was a tame by your forces event and this morning reporting a significant number of deaths the points as that is on conga action o an a actinal time an attain in lo and p man an somewhere that a safe to go if you're telling them to evacuate from the north of gaze i have to push back because the insinuation in your question is that israel takes meet taking poncho tat civilian facilities that no won am saying ism to saying it at for response yo make to my suggestion that you are treating people when they are trying to find some we safe to go is yon car my ha mass is operating that is citinmeland facility us then homes a spend the lost sixteen years intending itself under the civilian areas in goa building its headquarters under the hospital exploiting ambulances putting its own no our troops of just discovered rocket lunches and weapon silos inside schools inside coatrooms next to children bedroom a the musdefis not tacking those targets even the there are as we have seen this morning babies in the hospital we have seen that innocent of anions are in the can facilities and we are doing everything we can going above and beyond our obligations under international lo to get civilians out of tom's way look at the media lot looking to b by see the look the b c what alien baby there is saying is it one hundred percentage clearly one hundred present true when he says that the you and facilities have been us for a very long time by come ass a staging grounds for their terrors om and a storage points for their weaponry then the best as who is not it convenience then the troll attacking those yuan facilities as severe ins tat they are not civilian targets then military targets the liberally placed among civilians which makes the military targets and these that what is not that convenient since you do will not obviously us an we do not want kills of tensing but do not you really because you will news you news in your killing of the civilians we can't see what so doing you did to nasty news you an it is just disgusting it is evil and the sort of moral equivalency comes in softer form as well was ism friendly with per organ and some appears is coverage on this conflict has bee good and some some other parts of his cover to ben purely babies e tends to fall into this moral equivalents nonsense there was a picture their merge from all shit a hospital of small babies why having trouble the reason that having trouble is because babies should not be at all shift a hospital israel has offered to get the babies out of allshif a hospital it'll shit a hospital is i front for terrorism it has the held quarters of the military under it has for ten years has been report by the your times the washing to most amnesty international hay they keep the they put vulnerable children literally on top of their military headquarters in order to protect them and here's organs we s out this is heart breaking dozens of new born babies detach from their incubators at it'll shift a gaze hospital do to power oxygen running out israel must do more to get them to safety and medical trip and asap israel has offered whatever it can do to get those babies out in fact yesterday here was israel openly offering is their military spokesmen person offering openly to fa facilitate the exit of those children commas to not want the kids to leave commas wants the dead babies to imply that it is israel that has the responsibility for the babies the comose is almost literally strapping their own bodies is insane here is israel military spokes person explaining this yesterday we speaking directly and regularly i the hospital stud the toff of the she to hospital is request tit that to morrow we will help the babies in the pediatric deployment to get to a a to hospital we will provide the distance reedit en the something that the world us not forget and we will not let the world forget it commas has been holding hospices to hundred and thirty nine men women children elderly and babies do not forget babies for thirty six was this is a crime against humanity and we will not let the world forget it it of course that is true but then in stop the media from trying to crate this false moral covens why because that way they canpertoen they can appear sweet as the reverse colonization from places that hate america and hate the wast happen that is the gold we to more this in just one second because it is truly it is truly maddening the tape is out there but the media

about the human rights like that is being propagated by virtually every one in media and half of western governments it is in fact a li there is much tape that is fully available of come ass violating human rights and of israel attempting to honestly overcome a composes attempt to violating rites is totally crazy for example when israel has ben complaining that when they ship did in coma steals all of it it is beaus come steals all f it for example yesterday a bunch of aid was shipped into the gosistrip and comes immediately started unloading the and in stealing it you can see people in this particular video attempting to get to the doodad they want the food their hungry and you can see in this video giant crowd people attempting at the truck and comas is beating them off the truck you seed in the background far back in he background you see comas literally smacking people and trying to get them out of theirs that they can steal all of the aid this is what they do in there there is no secret about this come so's been openly doing this for literally years they took every dollar that came in an they built it into terror tunnels rockets and meanwhile there is befall this fuss about i'llshiva hospital he's again come of deliberately planted there military headquarters beneath a hospital that halal a place for feeling babies yesterday israel presented fuel wall sheila specifically to the hospital ministers at shiva in facture is video of israelies carcarry is the middle of a war hvou'vere herd of anything us eve never remotely heard of anything this i give soldiers literally an minimal war knowing is to military target dropped off canisters of fuel four hospital authorities in orders that they could use it to maintain power supply for people who need it in the hospital they drop off these these tanks on see there is aerial footage here they are their dropping them off you see all of it and then am so's prevented the gas from getting to the hospital come as stopped it here's a senior goes in health official and he says there's a problem at shift because israel than of us fuel and comes is preventing it and then there ismorso israel postural isn't i peers but i wont the holiest walking about what exactly are they suppose to do air drop the fuel at s they magic powers i do not a when israel military was granted the magical ability to do anything that is it the impossible israel can magically snap is fingers and every terrorstvis an every civilian is preserve israel can magically snap its fingers and the fuel goes intalshifa but does not get into the hands of compass there is a senior gotten help official acknowledging the compass is stealing the fuel and or preventing it from getting to the hospital in the first place dis a call between coordination reason officer and it senior official and the health system in gaze n me the gods know f ictus as there is a problem only at chifanow a bear with me ass what is the sorry bill reach the rector general of the commas health ministry does not want this amount of fuel or trying to convince him he does not want that fuel in there the ewyorc times by the way confirms this story the commons is blocking fuel from entering allshifa we the can show picture is that peer's organ can tweeted out and people the media can say israel must to more to protect civilians this is the entire game is the entire game and this combines with a secondary narrative the secondary narrative is this idea that somehow israel is violating the waws of war that is an absurdity there is no country on earth that has pursue the kinds of measures that israel is currently pursuing in order to preserve the civilian population of that was governed by an enemy certainly the united states has not done that theunitestates did not do is an arc that thunitestates did not do the snafganiston no country has have or this far as i am aware as much as me mean and military analysts say that that is what crazy and yet there is a new york times opinion article to day by a person named doctor water ad horn a professor of defense tunnies at the royal military college of canada in kingston on trio and he says that this war that israel is waging ans commas violates just war they now you said yourself house whatever possible how is it possible that if a a government of of an enemy attacks your population hills twelve hundred people abducts another to in or forty and then u go in to root them out how does that vile just wortheory we let this professor this verywise professor explained he says the standard elements in assessing whether adjust a war is just are just cause right intent legitimate authority that benefit or likelihood of success last record proportionality of means and know combatant distinction ideal state should met all of the criteria but the case for a just work can still be made even if the few of the bench marks are we israel easily has just cause and constitutes a legitimate authority be its case is far weaker re guarding the other five criteria in addition the fact that commands violated these principles does not absolve israel from n obligations live up to higher moral santatheradas and israel israel has to live up to morelstandars that literally nor the country on earth would pursue because this moron professor from canadasesso he says to determine just how unjust or was israel current actions are let us examine each criteria be reason the approaching my scholarship on the first measure just cause israel seemed have plenty of that right intends the second criteria means that fore should be used to help establish peace in the long term rather than in pursue of a short term or politically self serving gain or in an act o vengeance he says those some might argue israel is fighting to establish peace in gaze from a position of strength and dominants israel actions can easily be question why what because benjamin inti yah he is two right wing what the by by way soul's point out here yet yearly peed who is a central left opponents on ton gas deny wants they are all behind nintinyahoness nut there is no disunity in israel is not left right issue at all in israel israel has never been more unified from left all the was to right be according this professor an canada probably there is a in ulterior motive what the he of the ulterior motive be israel is eager to hands off gaze to comes that they literally ignored every single sign the compasses preparing this military attack for twenty years because they did not want to be in there and this dust is out there saying things well and when it comes to one comes to wright intent they might not have right intent they really might want to build beach houses in gaze hah sure sure he says theisraely government does satisfy the criteria of having legitimate authority cause it was democratically elected the criteria of net benefit weighing the gain against the harm would include the potential gain of removing comas from power or at least neutralizing its capacity to attack israel in the short term the war might also provide new opportunities for the parson an authority or some other transitional ad ministration to govern gaze and eventually free and fairelections israel might also be able to rescue hostages held by mamas however the enormous loss of had simian lives will most likely create inter generational right your the has not been inter generational rage ever since nineteen forty eight everybody's been perfectly happy until now until israel has going in camp comas nailed it further there is great risk of a wide or war with fire already being exchange over israel wars lemon and serial ya that the best thing for israel to would be nothing apparently he says the downside of israel war outweighs any benefits hah and the he says the criteria of last resort is key to all just war con iterations fore should only be used when all other means have failed or be clearly in effective israel he's no other way to neutralized omasa rescue the hostages but it has force warns rest negotiations out of hand and is not considering a peace process for gaze oh according to this professor israel should negotiate with commas this is this insane by the way under the kiscritera there has literally never been a just war rage by a western power ever in history ever literally ever worldwares who is not justified because after all the united states was it really necessary for us to attack japan after they attack us term negotiated with them was really necessary for the united states to involve itself in literally any war any by this crib of course the answer is know which means that is a it is a lie and this kind knows its a limit's promoting it anyway by the way we now have a piece from the washington post that has serious evident whelkomas was attempting to do and the answerers there were tempting to start a vast conflagration orcinol extend all the way to judo day an tomarya the west bank and start a three front war against israel at the same time by the way in the middle of this piece bearing this s washington posties is in admission that commons not only rape people but actually had a commander of rape they appointed a person who sin charge of delegating people for rape they issued orders to their terces that said in arabia trains liberated people it said on their orders orders to women to take off their pans they could rape them and that that s in the washington postaricle or all the denials who are suggesting that no rape took place a me it literally says in the middle of this of this article quote some of the most brutal attacks occurred in very were militant cut of in the belly of a pregnant women drag fer photos on tote ground in other town survivors told the parents being murdered in front of their children and children murder in front of their parents other survivors described winning witnessing sexual assaults including rape apparently and then they admitted that there were lots of non comose painting in to join the rate not only that it turns out that there were gowan workers who had supplied them wit the information quote to obtain detailed intelligence come ass to ply cheep surveillancestrones to generate maps of these rally towns and military insulation within a few miles of the one billion dolarbariar sister israel built to wall off goa the group elicited additional information from grand day laborers who are permitted to enter israel for work israel literally let in and paid the people who then spied on it to create this war and then you have more on suggesting that the war is not just somehow it is just it is absolutely incredible it is abs in credible by the way that last part is kind of important that gowan civilians were involved in the planning of attack and infant in the carrying out of the attack why not because it justifies in anyway the targeting of civilians e tartan military targets and civilians are there you then have to assess the cost of benefits of each military strike point out a this point israel had hit as of last fridge twelve thousand military targets in the gzistrip they dropped over twenty five thousand bombs in the gozaistrip and they would killed by the grand half authority vestments a are totally wrong ism sure they would killed bout ten thousand people et that is not the way that a carpet bombing campaign with look in terms of casualty numbers that is not a carpet that that is the targeted military campaign my but put that aside what is that really say what it says is whatever comes back is not going to be easier its not going to be quick this notion that israel can simply hand off the goscistript to the self governments of people who literally participated in the attack or who supported the attack er who cheered the attack is totally crazy again it is part of the west'sself deception ism pasta inter it this grandmother recently apirnau pause inti and here is what she had to say beat man says quote with those who not have martyrs in their family have no home land those who have no prisoner in their family have no honor we have to fight the jehad for palestine our land by allay the blood of our martyrs i have seventeen grand children and sixty five grand children by allay i will sacrifice them all for the sake of palestine and the all oximes i will sacrifice them wholeheartedly and happily i told my children my grandchildren you are the price for our home can i give you to our home land shawl literally get

daily security obviously this is why get what you are watching from iddleastern policy has ramifications for america has ramifications for triton has ramifications for the west because the entire m o of the west for literally decades has been you sleep you go to sleep on the actual belief systems of billions of people across the planet was to give yourself this wonderful you utopian dream of a world where everybody things you and therefore you can just import everybody to your shores can welcome i at my the in welcome into the centers of onion ye can fire anybody who says watisican these people not only do not think us they wish to destroy our civilization their ramifications for not understanding the way the world works and yet much foreign policy is predicated on all this is not real polity her there is an aspect of real polity where even america allies get forced into positions that they do not want to be in because it is in quit quit amerces interests it tat is not whats happening here what is currently happening here is that israel is seeking to annihilate in actual terror group and then replace that with a secure situation for itself and meanwhile you of the west saying none know what you really need o dos you need to hand over control of that situation two a bunch people who will then repeat this afterward for example jaksalvan who is the actual and say adviser he says there the cannot be any re occupation of vassal get what is alternative seriously i i want no the alternative is the alter of to handed over to the palsinan authority you have multiple

samurai in the palcinan arias sudan solaria for literally fifteen years of this point is is machmudabas in the p are deeply afraid that if an election were halcomasedwin turning this territory over to

that borer area to unific the can promptly loud casually to come in and are inhere border with two hundred thalsan rockets the can or w a has not only facilitated they have advanced the cause of

colonial outpost left over from the brutish mandate and she is happened go to five star hotels she is happy to live in palaces while her people live on forty one hundred bucks a year and meanwhile she sits there and she complains which not longtaken any pain you refugees why because s the afraid she will be overthrown that is why everybody knows this there is no one who is willing to do this which means the only alternative realistically speaking is for in is daily military presence to guaranty is daily security colon an israel order cats bitten ya who said this the therapy and take loners no the will be no reoccupation bulk fine you we're wait crawlers here's li near every one everyone left all years got some solutionsles hear them i the israel will fora the government brit will have doyouroll oh security responsibility because we have seen what happens when we do not have what what is you what our take on that i mean is also later said they do not seek the govern fossa but that sounds in this really occupation of fossa his is is that is that where this is going that is not our understanding of the israel governments position and i think trimester and ya who has clarified his comments is you as you just eluded to the america position on this a straightforward secretary blanket lated out this past week no reoccupation of fossa no reduction in the territory of going no forcible this placemen of palistinians and goa should never be allowed to be used to a base for terrace to tax against israel or anyone else lasso obviously it is on have to be it is on at have to be is really security control and all this happy talk about it not being is ridiculous ones face nelson an one make aim as though the comose supporters or winning everywhere there not men the fact is there are lots and lots people across the west who support israel in is in its attempt to take comes off the off the gamepord that they are tons people yesterday and very encouraging so there are a hundred thousand people who marched in parts you will notice ism ism seeing ism a very different demographic profile for the people who are marching against comosfor people are marching procomass that does not have to do with race that have to do with country of origin and ideology attached there too in any case here is what some of that march looks alike in france the up by the way the far left grouped in participate every other group in front every other political body joined this march not the far left the far left said we will not a hundred thousand people re joining in this march against antisemitism now by the way if you would actually to fight antisemitism that means you nun to let israel fight the new notes war comose you have to points out that it is not just commossisesso his below a turns out that that fighting antisemitism is more than just a fou petty words but we should at least we should least provide the the optimistic news that there a people across the world to support israel in their battle against commas that is good meanwhile it is see it turns out that some rich people our star and get the news about how terrible the university system is which is presumably we one thousand six hundred jewfish hazard atom our threatening to withdraw their donations over concerns about antisemitism according to signed members of the hazard college dushalumni association we are letter to the presedetento the college and we ever thought that at hazard we would have to argue the point that terrorism against civilians demands immediate and unequivocal condemnation we never thought we would have to argue for recognition of our own humanity when glad to see the people are waking up ism glad to see that ta there is some people on the left of the jewfish community wive finally realized that it turns out the far left and their introsectional coalition they are not your friends at all at all o cane n just one second we'll get to breaking news in

dot calm for full offer details on can meanwhile the twenty twenty four race on the republicanize is beginning two can holiday to him scout enter from south caroling who had failure to launch right from the outside this campaign barynice guy no reason you is running for present he has now bowed out here the was yesterday announcing it on fox news but i go back to i w they will not be have the presidential i candidate i suspending my campaign i think the voters i who to the most remarkable people on the quieter have then really clear that the telling me not now tell i do not make the sang tray no be do you the the sang go now it some win respect the voters an i wit a hold on a cut working we are re what for too to he he is out he don't have lot in the polling he was about seven per cent an iota which is interesting because that supported can go somewhere nationally speaking he was in sixth place behind christy christy him dropping out is not a big note is doit means some of his donors when i can put the money behind i any more because he ad originally suck up a lot of cash the mean there only five people wore left in the race this point trump who way out in the lead onto mantis in solid second nickel hale who is drawing up behind to mantis the bag romasuammy who sticking around for the plotters and the believes in the giggles and chriscristy who is out there as some sort of revenge tactic that no one really understands because he is one of the angrier people in america posit one of the questions here is which way him scouts support actually goes again timscott is true south caroling you have to imagine that him being out is can o help nickel valley in south caroling particularly hiding out an i not clear which way scout support is going to go if you added it to to mantis than to mantis now in the mid twenties if he split between to cantus an hale than ta mantises twenty twenty one per cent hayloft it may be seventeen per cent in i can to the the smart money suggest that most of scout support is going to go to hailed because he was very much minded with her on a lot of various issues and also because again he is true south caroling he is seen a sort of the nice my in the campaign which is more the preserve of nickel hailed than it is of on to mantis we have not really seen a lot of new polling out of i since the governor via can reads announced hersupport for onto mantis where that's can move the the needle at all in that stay basically the only way that this race he can gets interesting is if to mantis wind's wave to mantis lose i trumps over if drumlin's i i means rollover anyway but if trump win's i he is going to run the table if he loses i then there is the possibility that you could see to mantis strength and in new samphire and whale's strengthened in new samphire here is the theoretical possibility youredical possibility jo santuswin's i heluan's new samphire and then he move down to south caroling and now that scout is out who is eating up a lot of h boat and valley's the former governor is there a lot of that support then swivels over to hale and it turns into sort of a three person race from there on ow now by the polling data that does not seem the most plausible at this point if outlook a napoleon i the real clear optic's polling average has trump up at forty seven per cent to mantis valley scout combined were it thirty nine per cent s they wasn't actually up at true flu but it is caukustate if he like a new samphire trump has a wide lead over the rest the field he is at forty seven per cent whale's at fifteen the suntan eleven crispy is at nine if wrist ye were to drop out that might make the race a little but more interesting over there there is no polling fire as ism aware true south caroling any time in the recent past we do not actually know how that would look in the primaries but if yells had a consolidate at least for there to be a chance that somebody could take on trump and a the field is consolidating you do not good for him scout for stepping out when this was no longer a campaign worth running ism waiting for chis crispy and naval romasuammy to realize the sand because again there is no reason for them being the race meanwhile a donate trump is making the rounds his campaign to the point has basically featured him going to sporting evens and you of see fights and getting cheers and some boos inland then himoranting bettcourt cases and honestly if that is hat the campaign is all right i'meu no kat as long as the focus remains on jobidon in him being a very bad president i think that that trump has a very solid shot and winning the presidency right now the big problem is that again that should you ere the focuses his the the amount i think that people should understand the amount of hatred that trump draws he is entirely jump concomitant with the amount of love that he draws listen lot people love trump foreshore also in enormous number of people hate trump this was made perfectly apparent the other night he showed up at yet see fight he was flanked by a tucker carbon to tucker sound up with him spurring all sorts of rumors about the possibility that tucker was going run as his be i think that is very unlikely i won think that is a job the tucker even won but it spurt a lot of those sorts of rumors especially cause trump had been asked born hes maybe that true trumps is maybe to lot of things in any case they both showed up here is what o look liken they walked in is ran neutron as well maybe crop ill will run from emunionn never now at that cold be possible loves the crowd loves it this is it is trumps sort crowd lot lot o match in the room lot lot of motif dudes in the room the this is this is where trump is very popular well he was very popular except for one human it turns out that bill burr thecomedian who has a new move you he was also at the fusee fight and he was there with his wife his wife is sort of a black lives matter activist and due and here is what it look when she flipped him off on the big screen tanking here behind him she she flips a double bird at trump i as i as he moves into his row now this spurred all sorts of conversations on line that there couple points to major one is that again there not lot people who really hate down trump it is not just the they are a love people love done trump there are they're also lot peoplwho really hate down trump is a very very polarizing figure this is why by poling did a generic republican beats the pans off jobidon and done trump is running ridgy even with jobidon in most of the pulling if you look at the real are politics betting averages right now trump is up slightly on bison in the betting averages if you look at the real crepolitics general election match up average it shows that trump is up very very slightly on jobidon within martin of air of forty five point six percent o forty four point five per cent an other words pretending is a foreworn conclusion that trumps can be bison that is not true now trump could be bid for shore but is at a foregone conclusion not clear if we get a year of donna trump ranting about his courtcases and the media swivel as the undoubtedly will to cover trump as to avoid covering biding that's con be a problem the more trumpets in the headlines the worse it is for him the more morbidness in the headlines the better it is four donned drums up again point number one is that when you see this lady flipping off toneltrum lot of us on theridlice what up what a horses asked lie really he say you have sea fight seriously really and ism thererea lot people who are meanwhile are cheering her second point here is that man bill bear i got a say personal point on bibber bill bur one i favor comedians really funny if yet watched any of his specials they're hilarious one the best working comedians out there i went to a showed killer did down here in florid last week he don wat the haddock a at at the haddock casino seven thousand seems and bill bear i think that he realizes that a lot of his crowd are people who are center center right and i think he is in comfortable it that an he is deeply in comfortable it that i think partially it is because again he is married to somebody who is very much on the left and he decided that he was going to come to florid and extremely red state and not only insult the audience is munch of hick races but he was then going to make just a series of jokes about how a america is dominated by white supremacy and man i he died on stage am he's a angry at the audience he he was e was up there he done the same routine i assume in he lands like the right before something and every joke he told just fell absolutely flat and he was relegated can of telling old dirty stories this is what happens when you are captured by your idea logical crew is a real prom for lock comedians lot o comedians particularly ones who have some sort of for of center sent tor right crowd him gaffagans another example this at a certain point they realize aft thererea lot of people who might not vile they do and they get really uni comfortable with it and they start to actively virtue signal athbothose are not my people don't those people can play that game but it turns out laws feeling be very turned off they're lot of people who trump and voted for trump and probably vole for trump again if he is ignominy who saw killer's wife flip off the camera and there gin a hill here bilker's latest routines which are all about the inherent evil of the united states men that is literally whathewas talking about whether night and are going to turn off that is a career risk for people and i know that for people who live in alley and want to be they want their friend group to respect them the thing it is necessary to do this it really really is not it really is not and entertainers are making very large skill error when they do this sort of stuff o can to anywhit true trows up that is a big cheese again this what trump is great at he is created drying us a spotlight he is great it at being a celebrity it is the thing he is best a when it comes to campaigning he is very intractable easily intractable the login up intractable wit down trump will be hung about job an to tar the breast a bet and then out in the background pops a thought and the thought sabot lie we miss names or the thought is about christy christy in take squire squire in just tires chasing after the squirrel the dog from up em here he was campaigning the other night and he just decides that he is going to go off on chis crispy for in why is there a point to this chis christy is he is gathering he is gathering would in this campaign here he has no voters close said that who said that and by the way there somebody else says something we said this man said he should not say i won it e he said chis christy is a that pig you you in that say that sir you can please please take that that please take that that no no no non said chis christen of that big you cannot do that a it o calif really i gean then just tad just tat the the item who's bast m me being of tor chis christy sometimes trumps insult commit sick the time the insult comedy dog sometimes that chick is great iouremember a few weeks ago he is going after how bison wake he look take ye lots in ethics and it is true line now you everydime as he bike alcaic trump is right it does look he is walking on toothpick it is weird but christy being a fat paging eh then trump decide he is going to talk about being a proud election desire which again if we run on this if a publicans round this in twenty twenty tour s can to go precisely the same way it is twenty twenty one twenty twenty one twenty twenty two and twenty twenty three is no can a amazing again dos not the imagery the you want if you are if you are the president form present i sates running again is you double screened with michaelin dull the my pillow guy next to you got a next to you who is are lost a lot of his fortune pursuing your specious claims about election election stealing a here is dona trump i tens minions of people within nation o proud and strong elect you bomb o very proud election denser o case om is that coming one around also on veterans day he treated out we pledged you t we will root out the commeuust marks is famous and radical left drugs that live everyman within the con fines of our country that li and stealing sheet on elections they will do anything whether legally or illegally to destroy america and to dis troy the america dream an now ism perfectly fine with him conn a rooting out commands marks is fashion and radical left drugs the promise when he uses the language live vermin again i thin we should aport an enormous number of people whose support terrorism i think there a lot of people or lengths country ore not citizens who should go back to their countries of origin the language of vermin is not particularly smart political language but again ye i is reckon put trumpet an you real a things on hurt trump it any really is just at another distraction again these stories should be here that yobidin is very bad at the presidency and then on top of that is o i will ay there was one on fair hit on trump mediated on trump yesterday and that was that trump was speaking and he mixed up who the president was e another trying to n out credit a narrative where dona trumps is see now is jobidin by to that that login can hunt you doesn't have crime an a is a the proper at the having an other countries who ambitions of people wo lot in but they were interviewing i two weeks ago unless said an what would you advise president of gamma the whole world seems to be exploding and imploding and he sits very simple he should immediately resign and they should re place him with president to who a the world s h a ha h h h i gay sow am because you said o mama rather than widen ism sorry that that is not red the meanuant nuts over this he is again you're now trying to undo the thing the thing is the running in eight year old guy who clearly is not functional trump mixing up agama and widen have done that before on the show because frankly they have the exact same staff and balm's last democratic president before this that is really silly it trot trying to suggested this is because trump is losing it or something is purely ridiculous already got the rest of the show is continuing right now here not gone o one to miss it we will be getting into a breaking story in which secret service agents actually had to open fire after some people tried to break into in unmake secret service vehicle these we agents protecting i i be bid in the

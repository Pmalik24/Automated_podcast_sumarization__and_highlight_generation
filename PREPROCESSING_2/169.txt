to an abortion by by chico it is this america life a for glass stays so nine months after the end of rosy waved to days o episode as inspired by the excellent reporting of caroling kitchener who cover's abortion war the washing impose if you have ever seen her story is caroling retorting just gets inside people's lives in this way that feels very unusual intimate and very real and you see how not black and white people's feelings and situations can be she's be with us for the house stay with us an first trimester we her to to show in those first few months read after the court's decision and how this played out for can tailor who both has found out they were pregnant and both one an abortions fourteen states the band most abortion since roe was overturned i for some but that is it they will not get abortions but others of course a can taller the stop going to try to get one i for them the state bands are a hurtle the things down as he try to figure out how the any abortion movement is a we that there's this new window of time we are maybe they could reach these people wand persuade them to change her minds since the fall of road has been a big pushed to do just that to increase state funding for crisis pregnancy centers we tried to get millions of dollars from taxpayers these are cgointics whose whole mission is to convince people did not get abortions meanwhile long line any abortion folks are trying to connect with people who are looking for in formation about abortions an any abortion actors reached both ka and tailor boring the first try meters n nintresponded very differently caroling kitchener watch us unfold for each of them in two separate states week by week ut just a quick note that we changed some names intodaysio for people who requested that for privacy though cannot teller are their roamed it here is caroling cat was in oho tailor was in portion boll states had just spanned abortion after six weeks of pregnancy that leaves ha super short window to get an abortion from the beginning hate tried to approach her pregnancy the way she approaches other things in her life she is methodical organized kat is twenty five years old white don't turn pat setting business she kept track of her periods on a nap and when she mess one she took a pregnancy last it is potent she started calling cleaned to try to get an appointment for an abortion hate was not completely sure she wanted one ever since that walk with her why friends to the dairy queen she is started going back an for u wondering if maybe she should keep the pregnancy after all she made a pro confess she really was not show her boy friend kept telling her that he would support her in outer one that was not exactly helpful she press him trying to figure out what he actually thought is that was l o ka i making up my mind a and i have an abortion how do you feel about that that is fine o ka will i change my and to know the y to keeping how do you feel that that is fine and i was do what the he to in give you something more it was just gat a on almost somebody to tell me what to do because i felt out of control of the situation u that i just needed somebody almost help me make the decision finally say found a woman enter on line that offered free alter sounds and abortion consultations they hadn't appointment right away i remember my first thought was won this is super purple as purple a pretty much every the walls the decor i just remember it was very common in quiet i remember them offering me general it visit a gal take tingerailun superdaushes the women enter was actually a crisis pregnancy center those are places were staff or specially train to talk people out of having abortions but say did not know any of that she was there to get an answer to a question out she get an abortion an oho at all what she still under six weeks the crisis pregnancy enter gave her an alter sent i was o cable how far along am i and they were too early to even tell it is too early to say anything a trained alter sound tax should have been able to give her some sene of how far along she was starting around five weeks what just right where cat thought she was obviously ism not a doctor ism not good argue argue with somebody but i was see looking at i theirs nothing you can tell me absolutely nothing and i was just is there anything any type of estimate and she was i cannot say it will just half to reschatul another ultra sound about a week from now the only thing that kept going through my head was ism going to be past six weeks her is something have heard from abortion providers crisis pregnancy enters will sometimes to lay telling people how far long they are or though misinformed people about how far long they are in til abortion as no longer an option the doctors element they have heard this from patients who come in to see then after going to a pregnancy center say had wanted some one to help her to side what to do with this pregnancy an she walked into a place that was pacifically set up to do just that meanwhile tailor could not get an abortion in georgia because she was too far long she had to fly to florid for her appointment but the soon as one she could get was weeks away tailor as twenty seven years old lack she studied film in college ended up working an office job at a financial service's company she just got in her first apartment also she is o a but nutty the great it use her when she hear something that teaks her interest her first move is usually to scout around for the relevant supper the weeks when she learned that her abortion procedure would use a suction tool tailor wanted to no for three i shall went home an like it u cause i think a lot of times the only images we have or of people worry lie when show you pieces of goody fess a i do not look up anything that but i was able to see an anime diversion of would it looks when the when the actual surgical tool is in the body in pools the feet is out a tube would be inserted inside her useless a pump and then the suction it made me wonder if the had was alive or not anything is going to hurt him if they use it to i just thought that the would be a more advance way ut to do it that would not be that gruesome it made me wonder if is to barbaric or to arctic or to violent tailor had pretty uncomplicated feelings about abortion up until now to the except seen of her thought about it she was figured that if she did get pregnant unexpectedly she would go to the plan parent had client down the road from her apartment and that would be that but now she was not sure what to do she called her aunt she said i do not know f from comfortable doing this she was just listening you cannot afford a ki that she saying of the day it is not matter if you think the procedures barber they do it every day they do this is a very common procedure is not anything you need be alarmed about you'll be just fine her aunt reminded her that she did not have a lot of savings her new job was not a don deal she still had to pass a big am to keep it and she did not know how to drive tailor says it was kind of insulting she called her boy friend they were long distance he had just moved to florid and the collect she would pecked for the abortion was near where he love now on the phone she told him she was having doubts he assured her that was totally normal and he had his own theory to explain her feelings would he was saying was that he felt because he was far away maybe the baby was away from me to feel more connected to him then i was just what the i just immediately was you are not that important to me i thing ism pretty sure am telling control of her i feel if i was having second thoughts it would won hand yo per cent be because of me an no on ow a baby is not something that she used to feel closer to know the person i go just such a heard thing to even suggest me wanting to emotionally connect with him through the baby the nest when i went out for other people's opinions tailor found herself in the exact same spot as ka an oho asking other people what she should do say tailor would soon find herself face to face wit the anti abortion movement people who were ready and eager to influence her decision when ka leper her appointment at the pregnancy sent er in oho she still did not know it wasn't a regular abortion friendly medical cleaned the stuff handed her a gift bag an haw to nail file many many pamphlets spearmint come to help with nasal and prenatal fitments but she did think was a little bit heard she told them that she was planning to get an abortion it was the way that they described them that made me things that they wore completely listening to me because they were all this is for the house of your pregnancy moving forward and well the pregnancy is not looking forward i having somebody give me these options and almost push the option i wanted to the side it was not even really a choice t that really just i to me and i was full this is what i want in you are not even listening to me lake i would expect this from a man or something butt have other women just regard what i was saying was one of the most irritating things to me crises pregnancy sent herself carefully thought through all these moves to push people away from abortion but for a it actually seem it was back firing it was making her more sore that she wanted an abortion when she left she looked up abortion pills on line and found eight access an organization based in euros that we is pills to all fifty states even states where abortions man they opera in this kind of legal gray area that made pa nervous but she put in the order anyway she still wanted to know how far along she was she went back for another scan of the price's pregnancy center people who work at pride's pregnancy enters the see their work is saving lies that is what there there for i talk to several sappers at enters who told me they find immense fulfillment in convincing even just one person to keep their pregnancy a part of that is making the best case they can for not having an abortion say got on the alters on table for a second time ti asked if she wanted pictures no thank you she said they played her something they called a heartbeat tactically doctor say this is not a heartbeat say did not want a hear it i haven't changed my mind hearing that was just another sound for me and the culture son tack who knew that i did not want to keep this pregnancy asked me if i want to take pictures ah home with me and i immediately was just now i do not want that and she was just what are you sure s yet pretty sure i was already angry in having her e question me i was just you guys really just art getting this again are you sure you do not want pictures and was i guess ism very sure i i and on and in abortion still i got i pills from eight access ah i bought those ism just waiting for those to get to my house she immediately just kind of had this change of demeanor to being completely defense and not in what way when you say defensive her first thing was oh you should be careful because you never know what kind of great pillar in to get to be clear there is no such thing as different great abortion pills and eight access has been around for years and as a widely trusted source but cries is pregnancy enter told say how far along she was six weeks and three days that went a couple of thanks first say could have tried to get an abortion an a clinic an oho right after her last appointment had she known it also meant that the week before a train stenographer should have been able to give her some sense of how far along she was wit cases permission i reached out to the woman's enter it is called hello woman's enter they would not give me an interview but they said in a statement that they do not talk about individual patients because of confident sioalityy they did say they are aware of the time line pressure that comes with a six week abortion man and they added that they are committed to quote full disclosure of the patient's options but as far as say was concerned her options were dwindling say wanted to take the abortion pills by the time she was ten week's pregnant because that is what the aft a advises she was probably right around six weeks and the pills could take up to a month to be delivered she was running out of time meanwhile and georgia what tailor seated she fixated on one particular question she could not find a satisfying answer no matter how many people she talked to or how much repeat she did on line would be abortion her the baby an the only people will ever say abortion actually physically her babies are people will polite she found an untie abortion for a on line and wrote a public message o ka hi o can i am porch welly having taken thoughts about my appointment next week advice question or question work she writes that she is now eleven weeks present have just got used to being pregnant and have the fly to another state to give in abortion that would happened a lot of people comments in on that post i mean just flooding a lot of them were telling me i could give my baby way for adoption any option is better to them than to murder told uncle your baby ain't i abortion obviates on line use all sorts of different strategies to sway people away from abortion to do everything they can two and share that pregnancies are carried to term i shat is lady as me if i would do an open adoption oh o to give it to her right ire's no way i would doit probably a little over two hundred comment people offering me money people would just super involved in making sure i did not go to my appointment how did it feel to read those things there is always a tome o coercion in my opinion but it was nice to read them because you just want here of the people's opinions u just hearing that it was nice to here the other side of verse just just the answers the abortion but i had no one else that was i shall excited for me because i will say that in a moment i really reedit somebody to can neck with me about how is feeling them what i first started talking to cay and tailor it looked to me they could be sway by people who desperately wanted to sway them carry was trying out different decisions optioning them for her wireman and tailor was seeking out guided from people she that ne them now but that i started thinking they actually were actable deciding what voices they wanted to let in who exactly they wanted to be influenced by in the meddle of one of the most polarized debates in america can tailor were trying to suss out what was right for them i would read those comments all day i would read those comments at night i would read them at work i would read them when i left work in some of them did not mean anything but most of em actually mean a lot to me a but just being able to speak to some one freely and not feel they pushing you to a certain place i mean they were pushing me but they were also give me what i for which is a valley reason to not have an abortion ultimately tailor did go to flora she got on a plain to another state for an abortion her boy friend picked her up from the air port of eleven p m in the next morning it was probe six am but my appointment was at eight and he was just leaving away no problem no whatever but i was up i kind of welcome up i will be we talk and they kept talking about their parents how they were raise what they would want to do the same if they became parents a what they would want to do different my her boy friends said he worried his kid would struggle in school the same way he had they wandered how much to tat was genetic the kept talking and talking yet cope looking at the clog because it is a it is six thirty unless we there are clothes one right now ere going to be right own time or it is seven we it did get seventh fifteen seven thirty i just cold of worked out in that way were we just blew through the time an just ignored it tailor never want to the appointment cays tells arrived when she was eight weeks along when kat took them she was in pain more than she been expecting which was carry because with all the new laws katydid not feel safe calling a doctor she don't want to get in trouble i was in a lot of ain i was cramping i was bleeding i went into this little bath room and and i remember being hot because i had the light on the bout the room the door was closes this heat was just building up from the light and the only thing i could think of to help the pain was a warm shower even though i was hot and i turn the shower on and i kind of contemplate getting in for a few minutes tats i was all my god what if it does not help and ism just roasting myself alive and i it it up just getting in an was immense relief it was done for c but not for tailor carline kitchener as you're putting the sure together the legal landscape changed a few times in many states including oho were k lives i was abortion mare was challenged in cord every others temperaanjunction which means that abortion is still legal there for u to twenty two weeks be a option pills the once a kook they soon be harder to come bine thinks to decision just this week by fedora judge in texts at decision if it stands can me a portion pills harder to get another states to coming out what ibex's next with tailor and how vidioarcade can make almost anything feel better it is in a minute mchicago bobagradio went our program continues is magic in life m glass to day show nine months later is been nine months since supreme court overturned rosy wide a pogramtitt is about people who discovered that they were pregnant and did not want to be it when that ruling came down amid abortions large a legal in their states we are following what is happened to those people in the first trimester and now in the next part of our show in the second trimester backfire to fell the vast number of abortions did happen in the first trimester but now because it can take long to figure out what to do a for abortion pills to come in the mow doctor say this seeing an increasing number of people seeking abortions in the second trimester there is a hot line the miss carriage and abortion hot line which was started to help patient who are taking abortion pills at home tit is beginning a lot more calls from people who are taking pills later in their pregnancy than the ten weeks the f a has proved now to be queer the piss are still safe after ten weeks but the count be complications the whole experience can be more intense people call look just just say just this sound its going o cay because ism afraid that if i been to get medical care it'll get a rested that is going to price who help start the hot line a talk with us and with a medical story telling pot cast called the nocturnes about which she is been seeing she says she used to answer questions for people in first trimester abortions about how much bleeding is normal had e the off the pills work but now she says at least once a day shall get a call this very different it is taken them long to get their pills that by the time they use them there fourteen weeks sixteen weeks twenty weeks and we get calls about the feet is just came now and i do not know what to do about the tissue that is stuck how do i how i do this there is the cord or there think the placentas stuck in my service or yet ow sometimes they do not even applet if they do not have the vocabulary the explain what is happening but there just i can tell there is more tissue and i do not know how to get it out and what that i do ha the point the as to walk them through a second trim as her abortion over the phone this is part of what the second try mister looks now for complicated more frightening and the people we talk to felt very hon spoke it nobly a dozen people who looking for abortions the weeks after to fell in many of them could not decide who trust who would asked for help and there is one other thing people talked about when they talked about what they were afraid of i do not know how we cold my log kat had to travel out of state for her abortion the only appointment she could get t was the same weekend as her college or recantation at there is no way regret yet is i cult know hobbit from my la a why what it aregetulat moms there is no figure we heard about more than moms people did not won i have to talk to their mams about the abortions it was hard the mom call we the time it risked how they were but they needed the mom to drive them across state lines bring e was she heard over twelve hours in the car of it would rat don't be e e be your lie to i a hoping i wish i did not have to de sing to no at all but i needed a you gar we needed to help for to we get rashly i o figure at what to say about why she needed to weave town you wide she would extremely help about we gain a far a big i think e again one day the i hade had to work sturdy but i had ta car l i could not tell i on thesis jest ago in texts telling her that i was raglans and was not sure if i was going to keep it would have probably om that i stated her there is one a post row second try mister pregnancy that especially drew caroling in caroling kitchener the report of the wathionipos that were ding to day show with this pertiguar pregnancy was in okohoma a teenage girl name lily who could not get in abortion without pulling in her parent in this case her dad i gat his caroling i met lily a few days after she got her posit to pregnancy test she was seventeen years old and well into her second trimester i liked lily right away she was silly and made me feel old but in a superendearing kind of way lily told me shed down this boy for a while and they had an on again off again thanks and off more year i not i whinny he is very funny and he is very he is very sweet and very carrying he is little stupid but that is o get and yet we have we have just started hang out again i think cause we had been going to lunch stuff because o my school we had on fifteen minute lunches than then he was a would you do it and always o dear cot and then it all coat just re started lily had no idea she was pregnant to the entire first trimester she had just graduated from high school still writing high off from she was making her own money working at a samdwin shop stang out late with francs somewhere down the line she thought she might go to coronary school or she had an idea for a business that combined her two favorite things tattoos and food she would call it pies and pants lily's the youngest of five the older siblings have all moved out already we is just her an her dad in the house together what you picture when you picture a single divorce tad he does not know how to decorate we a shop nightly for meals he will not go hoping for a a lot of things to keep the fridge of the pantry shot well just go as we need or will go by food i fasted places or go to restaurants and i just think it various here is how lily found out she was pregnant she was at work and she called her dad with really bad stop grants they ended up in the y are where they took lily's vitals took some yearn an the doctor came in the room with this weird look on his face he asked lily if she was coquet talking with her dad in the room lily was yet of course talk about what he told her you are pregnant and ay looked at my ad and i remember him getting all shocked and looking at me it was he just looked he looked he was deafly panicking but trying not to show me because he knew i was panicking cause i was visibly panicking how were you win whale you now i was re crying i was crying medially that that is i literally instantly started just sobbing i turned out she was about nineteen weeks along the doctor handed her the tests results and told her that she could put them in her baby buck he kept talking but lily was just staring at her at studying his face i just remember being scared i felt shaky and i just i condo wanted to know if he was mad at me or really just what he was thinking about honestly he said nothing but at one point he did reach out to hold her hand they left the room walked to the car in silence as they were driving home lily said he asked her right off the bat d ye knows it is and i was i yet and he was well who sit and cause i do not tell him cause he knows the guy and was get an did you ah yet that he was o my got i should have your brothers kill him don idea she rolled her eyes and then the conversation was very much over they drove home she went to her bedroom he went to his the next day lily sat in her room while her dad went to work and it really started to hit her she was pregnant and abortion was now a legal in oklahoma there was nod out in lily's mind she wanted in abortion had she found out earlier in her pregnancy before oklehom a band abortion lily could have driven thirty minutes to a clinic to baton but now she had to find a different way first she tried clinics and cassis but the clinic she called told her that she was too far along for them to see her then she tried new mexico they did not have appointments for three to four weeks i talk to lily a whole bunch right around this time she was terrified one clinic told her she was far along they would have to induce labor to end the pregnancy lily told me she could not imagine pushing a baby out of her ninety five pound body do you think you sounded scared on those calls probably a it was very nervous and i it was not fun to say on telephone repeatedly she kept calling and calling eventually she found one clinic in new mexico were thin a point at the following week she knew she would not be able to get there on her own she knew she was gone an eat or dad lily dad his former air force now he works in i tee he lots music lily likes to describe as dad rock as see bout joy he was five kids three boys in two girls he grew up in a conservative family believing it was wrong to have in abortion lily did not know what he would think about her wanting in abortion i was just nervous to tell him honestly i was nervous to see his reaction hat were you wearied about i just didn't want him to be disappointed i guess a few days later her dad finally asked her shady you din i do she told him ism not con i have a kid he said how hard that's going to brain out right lily knew then her dad walked out he said he needed a little time to possess that information lily decided in her head that what her dad was not saying was that he wanted her to keep the baby dit was it was it was fund of hard cause i can handle my o being out of me him being disjointing me as a whole different story was he actually disappointed did he actually not want her to get the abortion what was he thinking when the doctor told them she was pregnant when the drove home that night wily had not asked him i did the the first thing was who is this kid right because there's there is a butt kicking come you mean who it on person who impregnated her yes yes and when she is told me it count of infuriated me a lit more why well because the guy had already he was to he already got another you fifteen sit year old girl pregnant and ha a baby with her is yes then the next thing in my mind is i ism calling the three brothers and this is getting handled that that was the immediate you have ruined your lice your seventeen years old you can have a baby now a how how you going to take care of this bayou do not even have a jot no i think she was working it at that point you work in a jersey mikes making in on wage i have just gotten out of finally paying off her medical bills for your broken leg which was our also the result of a horrible decision on your part what were you thinking when lily told her dad just that she wanted an abortion she imagined he was angry her as that but he told me he wasn't he was really just surprised i did not think knowing grace that it was going to be an action for her grace is his nickname for lily he is always called her that i do not know why just that was my first instinct was she is in have his baby i soft know why i thought ti cause she i mean when she talks about it it is there was no room for that it is interesting that knowing her as well as you do that is that is conga were your mind wen this dismay sound terrible but it probably was a result of how nurturing she is she does not to step on spiders he wont of saying i just never thought ti that that would be an action for her but just quickly moved pass shock and inaction mut he assumed that this was something that he needed to make happen for his daughter the day lily told him she wanted an abortion cotton went to work and research he looked up clinic he had no idea that lily baby now his anxious and somewhat irresponsible tea nature she was wat out of him generally hear from her much that day and i get home fully she is laying on her bed she is got her little note book out she is got some kind of banks to rap going on on the trick in on the plea i and she is called forty displaces she is called the rosy wage fund she is called everything and and she is basely got a planing place and ism oh how you thought you were going to be the wet making the concuss i did i absolutely did it amazed me because that is not a a trait she had displayed before and her calmness staring it that is what really stood out is she she did not she din panic she would all did a old me she is oke i well good called this gaga cost what did you want her to do what decision did you want her to make that is a great question i think if you had to say what was your topchoice i would have said yest keep i it want her to keep the baby why do you think your topchoice was for her to keep it ah that is that is it that is probably a very that probably very psychologically deep and it probably has to us grace getting to the point where she is get a leave u and feeling all my children er out is he has her own kid michaels after in the world doing his saying christian brad or out in the grace's all i have left right that i know needs me right her daily shuvibal to some degree depends on me and have gone almost longer in my life with that and without that i i do not know how to be the me before the kid's right have always had for the last twenty seven years always had somebody that needed me i know if grace has his baby i got another at least eighteen to twenty years of being needed and that may be purely selfish but i hope that my concerned for her it way my selfishness in that situation button was not sure he could trust his own impulses or his own feelings that is why he did not talk to lily to her it seemed disapproval but just was really just trying to give her space not chair too much of his own complicated thoughts he knew lily would have a hard time ignoring anything he said when lily asked him to drive her to new mexico for the abortion just said yes she got in the funds shed made the appointment she had a plan lily was twenty weeks pregnant when she and her dad loaded up the car to dries her mexico together they stocked out on her favorite red trips backs wrinkles and putting cups it was their first her trip together to tits of them and just told me with everything lily had been through he wanted to make sure they did something fun along the way which was funny because lily told me this about heading out on that trip with her at i wanted him to have at least some sort of fun while he was out here i thought was really sweet that he was trying to made me feel better and i ran obviously it is not fun for me but i know it is not fun to have to see your kid ism what end him to have some good memory when it was time for the procedure it took two days because she was far along the doctor had to insert dilation sticks to soften and open her service then lily an her do went to the hotel and they went back to the cleaned in the morning and the doctor use suction to empty the useless for about twenty minutes until the feeds was entirely out lily said the nurselocer up and told her you are done you are no longer fragment she immediately notice that her stomach did not fearful any more she said it felt flat again afterward lily told just she wanted to go to the arcade in the mall she wanted to try the deny a machine but mostly she wanted to go because she thought her dado it but i was in credibly cautious and an a bunch of pane but ways ti wit because ball out she was she was sick in the car in the parky lot we pull up in in them all but she was determined that she wanted to go arcade all right well we will go was very partly really limo wouldn't thou the but your actively fuck o bring out i was just i was kind of proud in all right ye we logia y little vomiting o topless from plancsan games and after she threw

will be some moment probably soon when will all just get use to the idea that people travel hundreds of miles and cross state lines to get abortions that all just seem normal if it does not a ready it will see normal that people have second time utter abortions at home that some people will panic and not know what to do with the fetal tissue for feel too scared to seek medical attention at some point in the future without fear will not be remarkable and we will also get used to this notion that for many people if you get pregnant in a state were abortion is band and you do not want a baby you may still wind up with one we are rapidly moving into that future where all this is normal which means right now may be the last time we can truly feel how much has changed for the people who

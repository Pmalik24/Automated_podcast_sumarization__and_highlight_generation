welcome to the youeremagus sciencesciencepactoi m indrucuberman and of a professor of neurobiology and opthomology at stamford school of medicine to day we are going to discuss the gut and the brain and we are going to discuss how your gut influences your brain and your brain influences your gut as many of you probably know there is a phenomenon called your gut feeling which tends to be something that you seem to know without really knowing how it that is one version of the gut feeling the other is that you send something in your actual gut in your body and that that somehow drives you to think or feel or act in a particular way maybe to move toward something or to move away from something now today we are not going to focus much on the psychology of gut feelings but on the biology of gut feelings and how the gut and brain interact because indeed your gut is communicating to your brain both directly by way of neuron's nerve cells and indirectly by changing the chemistry of your body which permeates up to your brain and impacts various aspects of brain function but it works in the other direction to your brain is influencing your entire gut and when i say entire gut i do not just mean your stomach i mean your entire digestive tract your brain is impacting things how quickly your food is digesting the chemistry of your gut if you have not be stressed or not street whether or not you are under a particular social challenge or whether not your particularly happy will in fact adjust the chemistry of your gut and the chemistry of your gut in turn will change the way that your brain works it'll put all that together for you in the context of what we call the gut microfilm the gut microfilm are the trillions of little bacteria that live all the way along your digestive tract and that strongly impact the way that your entire body works at the level of metabolism in mine system and brain function and of course we will discuss tools things that you can do in order to maintain or improve your gut health because as you will also soon see gut health is immensely important for all aspects of our well being at the level of our brain at the level of our body and there are simple actionable things that we can all do in order to optimize our gut health in ways that optimize our over all nervous system functioning we will be sure to review those to day this episode also serves as a bit of a primer for our guest episode that is coming up next week with doctor just in soninberg from stamphord university doctor soninberg is a world expert in the gut microfilm and we will dive really deep into the gut microfilm in all its complexity will make it all very simple for you we will also talk about factional tools in that episode this episode is a stand alone episode you will get a lot of information and tools but if you have the opportunity see this episode first i think it will serve as a nice prim r for the conversation with doctor sonunberg before you begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate for my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire effort to bring zero nostoc consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens at lentic greens is an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the ease n i started taking athletic greens in the reason i still take athletigreens once or twice o day is that t helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which our vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called got microfilm and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essential with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens i get the vitamins i need the minerals i need and the phobics to support my microfilm if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock come slash supermen and claim a special offer they give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin d three k too there are ton of at an ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if for getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still decision in vitemend three and k too is also important because it regulates things cardiovascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic greenstone come slash supermen to claim the special offer of the five are travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar eve talk many times before on this podcast about the key roll of hydration end electrolytes for nerve sell function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues an organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium and potassium present in the preparation all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the preparations of electrolytes if you to try element you can go to drink element that is element dot come slash supermen andyoull get a free element sample pack with your purchase there all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to element element dot come slash supermen o k let us talk about the gut and the brain and how your gut in your brain communicate in both directions because as i mention before your gut is communicating all the time with your brain and your brain is communicating all the time with your gut and the two are in this on going dance with one another that ordinarily is below your conscious detection although you are probably familiar with the experience of every ones in a while getting a stomach echo or of eating something that does not agree with you or conversely eating something that you find particularly delicious and that sensation or that experience rather being a whole body experience your mind is excited about what your eating or just eight your gut is excited about what your eating or just eight and it seems to be a kind of unified perception of both brain and body to day were gong to talk about how that comes about in the negative sense when you meet some one you really dislike or w you have a stomach ache and in the positive sense when you interact with somebody the you really really can you to spend more time with them for instance or when you eat something that you really really and you to spend more time with that food to speak now the gut an the brain represent what we call a biological circuit meaning they include different stations station a communicates with station be which communicates with station see and on and as i mention earlier it is by directional ta two way street between gut and brain i want to make the important point at the outset that when i say the word gut when i refer to the gut i am not just referring to the stomach most of us think that the gut it quits to the stomach because we think of having a gut or not having a gut or having a gut feeling of some sort but in the context of gut brain signaling and the related microfilm the gut includes the entire digestive tract that is right from start to finish the entire digestive tract much that to day we are going to talk about for instance the presence of neuron's nerve cells that reside in your gut that communicate to specific locations in the brain and cause the release of specific narc chemicals such as the nor chemical dopamine or serotonin that can motivate you to seek more of a particular food or type of interaction or behavior or to avoid particular foods interactions in behaviors and some of those neurons many of those neurons in fact reside in your intestines not in your stomach that can be in the small intestine or the large intestine in fact you actually have taste receptors and neurons located all along your digestive tract you have neurons that are located all along your digestive tract and they are communicating to your brain to impact what you think what you feel and what you do you case o for the gut brain access we need to deal with the brain part and then we need to deal with the gut part let us just quickly talk about the brain part because there the word brain is also a bit of a misnomer in that when we say the gut brain access it does include the brain but includes a lot of other things as well as many of you probably know by now if you are listeners of this podcast an if you do not that is in your nervous system includes your brain and your spinal cord and those together constitute what is called the central nervous system your nerd retinas which are the lining the back of your is and are the light sensing portion of your eyes are also part of your central nervous system actually your eyes are part of your brain there the only parts of your brain that are outside the cranial vault your retinas your brain proper and your spinal cord make up the central nervous system the other parts of your nervous system constitute what is called the peripheral nervous system which are the components of your nervous system that reside outside the retinas brain and spinal sort now this is very important because to day we are going to talk a lot about how the gut communicates with the brain and it does that by way of parietal nervous system components meaning nerve cells that reside in the gut and elsewhere in the body that communicate to the brain and cross into the central nervous system to influence what you think in what you feel that is the nervous system part of what we call the gut brain acts brain again just being a shorthand for including all the elements i just described gut as you now know includes all the elements of the digestive tract let us talk about the architecture or the structure of the gut of your digestive system now not surprisingly your digestive system a your gut begins at your mouth and ends at your ones and all along its length there are series of sphincters that cut off certain chambers of the digestive tract from the other chambers now also along this tube that we call the digestive tract there is great variation in the degree of acidity or p h as it sometimes called that variation and acidity turns out to give rise to different little micro environments in which particular microbioda mycobacteria can thrive or fail to thrive and the way i you to think about the digestive tract this gut component of the gut brain ais is that it is not just one component it is not just your stomach with a particular acidity and a bunch of microorganisms that work particularly well to make you feel good and if make your digestive pathways work well it is a series of chambers little micro environments in which particular microbiota thrive and other microbioda do not and certain behaviors that you undertake and certain experiences that you have will adjust those micro environments in ways that make particular microbioda certain bacteria more likely to thrive and others less likely describe well talk about how that was set up for you early in life actually from the moment that you came into the world that microfilm was being established it was actually strongly impacted depending on whether not you are born by c section or by vaginal birth a end it was strongly impacted by who handled you when you came into the world literally the hands that were on you how much skin contact you had whether not you ware a prime baby or not whether it you had pets at home whether not you are allowed to play in the dirt whether not you are allowed to eat snails or whether r not you were kept in a very intercept environment all of those experiences shaped these little micro environments and shaped what constitutes best or worse for those micro environments you have this long tube that we call the digestive tract and it is very very long in fact if we were to splay it outwards to take all the curves and turns out of the intestine we would find that it is very long it is approximately nine meters long now the structure of that digestive tract turns out to be very important in terms of gut brain signalling once again it is a tube and the hollow of that tube is call the lumen el u m e and tut the walls of the tube are not necessarily smooth at least not for significant portions of the digestive tract for much of the digestive tract they are bumps and grooves that looked very much the folds in the brain but these bumps and grooves are made up of other tissues theatre made up to what is call them you coal lining there is a lot of mucus there and if we were to look really closely what we would find is that there little hairy cellular processes that we call microvilli that are able to push things along the digestive tract the microbioda reside everywhere along the lumen of the digestive tract starting at the mouth and all the way to the other end and they reside within those microvilli and they reside within the lumen and if we were to look really closely at the bumpsand grooves along the digestive tract what we would find is that there little niches little arias in which particular things can grow and reside best now i might some kind o gross but it actually is a good thing especially of what is growing and residing there or microbacterio organisms that are good for your gut and that signal good things to your brain and we will talk about what that signalling looks and how that is done and accomplishing just few moments but i want you to get a clear mental picture of your gut something that we do not often see and often when we think about the gut again we just think about the hollow of the stomach food going in there and getting digested but it is far more complex and actually far more interesting than that now i have been referring to the gut micro boom and to the microbioda and these bacteria let me defend those terms e obit more specifically just to avoid any confusion the microbiodar the actual bacteria the microsome is used to refer to the bacteria but also all the genes that those bacteria make because it turns out that they make some important genes that actually impact all of us you have loads and loads of these little microbioda these bacteria in fact right now you are carry no with you about two to three kilograms that is more than six pounds of these microbic to these bacteria and if we were to look at them under a microscope a would see is these are relatively simple little organisms some remain stationary they might plop down into the mucosa lining or they might hang out on a particular microfilm or they might be in one of those little niches and others can move about but they basically fill the entire lupine they surround and kind of coat the surface of the microvilli and they are tucked up into any of those little niches that are available to them to tuck into if you were to take the head of a pin and look at it under the microscope you could fit many many hundreds if not thousands or more of these little mycobacteria and the reason i say many many thousands or more ism giving up a could of broad range there is that they do vary inside and again they various to whether not they can move or they do not move now they are constantly turning over in your got meaning there being born to speak and their dying off and some will stay there for a very long periods of time within your gut and others will get excreted about sixty per cent of your stool as unpleasant as that might be to think about is made up of live and dead mycobacteria you are constantly making and excreting these mycobacteria and which mycobacteria you make and how many stay inside your gut and how many leave meaning how many are excreted depends a lot on the chemistry of your gut and depends very strongly on the foods that you eat and the foods that you do not eat now just because what we eat strongly influences a microfilm meaning or mycobacteria does not mean that there are not other influences on what constitutes are microfilm a microbiomas also made up by mycobacteria that access are digestive tract through our mouth through breathing through kissing and through skin contact in fact one of the major determinants of our microfilm is who we interact with and the environment that we happen to be in and that actually includes whether not we interact with animals in a little bet it'll talk about some data as to whether not you grow up in a home that had animals whether not you grow up in to home whether not there was a lot of social contact me skin contact or whether not you grow up in a more animal sparse contact sparse environment and how that shapes your microfilm but the simple point is that what you eat influences your microfilm but also what you do what you think an what you feel and many of the little mycobacteria they get into your digestive tract do by way of social interactions in fact if you ask a nurbiologist what the roll of the microfilm is they will tell you almost certainly that it is there to impact brain function but if you have friends that are microbiologists such as i do they will tell you well what maybe the brain and nervous system are there to support the microbyom it is the other way around you have all these like microorganisms that are taking residence in our body they do not really know what their doing as far as we know we do not know that they have a consciousness or they do not we cannot rule that out but it seems pretty unlikely none the less they are taking advantage of the different environments all along your digestive tract they are taking advantage of the sorts of social interactions for instance the people you talk to in that breathe on you the people you shake hands with the people tat you kiss or do not kiss the people that you happen to be romantically involved with or not your dog your cat your lizard your rat whatever pet you happen to own is impacting your microbic there is absolve no question about that fully now you have some sense of the architecture of the digestive pathway and you have some sense of the trillions of little mycobacteria that are living all along the different components of that digestive pathway but what we have not talked about yet and what it'd to talk about now is what those little microbiota are actually doing in your digestive tract in addition it is living there for their own intents in purposes they are contributing for instance to your digestion many of the genes that those microbiota make are genes that are involved in fermentation and genes that e involved in digestion of particular types of new grants and in a little bit we will talk about how what you eat can actually change the enzymes that those microfilm components make enzymes largely being things that a responsible for digestion they catalyze other sorts of cellar events but in the context of the digestive pathway we talking about enzymes that help digestive food those microbiota are indeed helping you in many ways and if you lack certain microbiota that can help you digest it stands to reason that you would have challenges digesting certain types of foods the other amazing thing that these microbiota do is they change the way that your brain functions by way of metabolizing or facilitating the metabolism of particular negro transmitters one of the ways that having certain microbiota present in your gut and improve your mood or degrade your mood for instance is by way of certain microbiota being converted into or facilitating the conversion of chemicals such as gala gala is in what we call an inhibitory nor transmitter it is involved in suppressing the action of other neurons and that might son a bathing but all types of sedatives for instance alcohol and a lot of neurons that naturally make gala can help quiet certain circuits in the brain for instance circuits responsible for anxiety in people who have epilepsy the gala uric neurons as they are called can often be disrupted in their signalling meaning they're not cranking out as much gala and therefore the excusatory neurons which typically release other molecules glutamate can engage in what is called run away excitation and that can give is rise to seizures the simple message here is that the microbiota by way of making petrochemicals can influence the way that your brain functions you want to support those microbiota and we will give you tools to support those micro biota but the take away at this point is that those microbiota are making things locally to help digest food other microbiota are helping to make certain nor transmitters gala and will also talk about dopamine and serotonin and the very specific microbiota that reside in your gut have a profound influence on many many biological functions especially a mine system function brain function and digestion that should give you a fairly complete picture of your gut microfilm now i to talk about how your microfilm and your brain communicate or more accurately how your microsome and the rest of your nervous system communicate neurons which simply means nerve cells are the sells that do most of the heavy lifting in your nervous system there are of course other cell types that are important gleam ells for instance very very important cell types you have endothelia cells which are responsible for blood flow perry sites and other types of cells but the neurons are really doing most of the heavy lifting for most of the things we think about in terms of nervous system function you have neurons in your gut and that should not surprise you neurons reside in your brain your sponicord your eyes in fact all over your body and you have got them on your heart and in your heart and you have got them in your lungs and you have got them in your spleen and they connect to all the different organs and tissues in of your body that is not surprising that you have neurons in your gut what is surprising however is the presence of particular types of neurons that reside near or in the mucosa lining just next to that lumen of the gut and that are paying attention and all explain what i mean by paying attention to the components of the gut both the neutrinos and the microbiota and thereby can send signals up to the brain by way of a long wire that we call an axon and can communicate what the chemistry and what the nutritional quality and what the other aspects of the environment are at the gut at a given location up to the brain in ways that can influence the brain to for instance seek out more of a particular food lemme give you what a sort of action based picture of this but say most people you enjoy sweet foods i do not particularly enjoy sweet foods but there are few that i on of a succor for a really good dark chocolate or really good ice cream or gave this thing for donate that seems to just not quit although i do not tentindulg it very often i do them if i eat that particular food obviously digestion starts in the mouth their enzymes there gets chewed up the food goes down into the gut these neurons are activated meaning that clauses the neurons to be electrically active when particular component certain neutriante in those foods are present and for the cell types or i should say the neuron types that mater here the neutrinos that really trigger their activation are sugar fatyacids and a men acids now these particular neurons have the name entire endercrin cells but more recently they have been defined as euro pod cells uropod cells were discovered by giegobohorcuss lab at duke university this is a phenomenal set of discoveries made mostly in the last ten years these uropod cells as i mention are activated by sugar fatiacids or a men acids but have a particularly strong activation to sugars they do seem to be part of the sweet sensing system and even though focusing on this particular example they represent a really nice example of how a particular set of nerve sells in our gut is collecting information about what is there at a particular location in the gut and sending that information up to our brain now they do that by way of a nerve pathway called the vaguest nerve the vaguest nerve is part of the puerperal nervous system and the guest nerve is a logic complex to describe if you are just listening to this if you're watching this it'll try and use my hands as a diagram but really the best thing to do if you want really want to learn neronatomy is to just imagine it in your mind as best you can and if you contract down a picture of it terrific but hereabout works neurons have a cell body that we call a soma that is where all the idea are contained that is where a lot of the operating machinery of the of the cells are contained and allow the instructions for that cell of what to be and how to operate are contain the cell bodies of these neurons ore the relevant neurons are actually up near the neck see can thing of them is kind of a a clump of grapes to cell bodies tend to be round or relish and then they send a process that we call and acts on in one direction out to the gut and they will send another process up into the brain and that low clustered near the neck that is relevant here is called the roofs ganglia and o d o s e the notes gangling is cluster of neurons on either side of the neck it has a process that goes out to the gut in a process that goes up into the brain and again these are just one component of the call vaguest nerve the vaguest nerve has many many branches noxious to the gut they are also branches to the liver branches to the longs branches to the hart branches the larynx and even to the spleen and another areas of the body that are important but right now were just concentrating on the neurons that are in the gut that signal up to the brain and what the bohorca's lab has shown is that these uropod cells are part of this network their sensing several different nutrients but in particular when they sent sugar they send signals and the form of electrical firing up to the brain in ways that trigger activation of other brain stations that cause you to seek out more of that particular food this brings us to some classic experiments that at least to me are incredible and these are highly reproducible findings showing for instance that even if you by pass taste by infusing sweet liquid or putting sweet foods into the gut and people can never taste them with their mouth people will seek out more of that particular food and if you give them the option to have a sweet food infused into their gut or a bitter food infused into their gut or a sweet verses sour or a more sweet verses less sweet food people have a selective preference for sweet foods even if they cannot taste them ow this is important understand in the contacts of gut brain signaling because we always think that we sweet foods because of the way they taste and indeed that still true but much of what we consider the great taste of a sweet food also has to do with ta gut sensation that is below our conscious detection how do we know that well the bohorcas lab has performed experiments using modern methods and their classic experiments showing that animals in humans will actively seek out more of a particular sweet food even if it by passes this taste system and the reverses also true there have been experiments done in animals and inhuman that have allowed animals are humans to select and eat sweet foods and indeed guts what they do if they're given the option and yet to somehow eliminate the activation of these neurons within the gut that consents sweet foods now there are couple different ways that those experiments have been gun in classic experiments the date back to the eighties this was done by what is called subdivephromatic we notary the this means cutting off the branch of the vagus that enervates the gut below the diaphragm that the other organs con still function because the vagus is very important but recently cutting off the sweet sensing in the gut still giving people the opportunity to taste sweet foods of their mouth and they do not actively seek out quite as much of the sweet food when they do not have this gut sensing mechanism that we now know to be dependent on these uropod sells more recent experiments involve selective silencing of these uropod cells and there ben a lot of different derivations of the sort of thing but tho take away from it is that our experience of and our desire for particular foods has everything to do withhold those foods taste it also has to do as you probably know with their texture and the sensation of those foods in loudmouth and even indeed how they go down our throat sometimes can be very pleasing or very unpleasant and it also has to do with this subconscious processing of taste that occurs in the gut itself and again when i say gut dioecious mean in the stomach there are actually neuron's uropod cells further down your digestive tract which are signalling to your brain about the presence of sweet foods as well as food such as a monoacid rich foods or foods that are rich in particular types of fatiacids signaling up to your brain and causing you to seek out more of those foods or to consume more of those foods now you are probably taking what is the signal how does it actually make me want more of those foods without me realizing it what does that by adjusting the release of particular nuromodulators for those of you that are not familiar with nurmodulators these are similar to burro transmitters but they tend to act more broadly they tend act impact many more neurons all at once and they go by names dopamine ceratonaan a seat cosine apineferan and forth sometimes people refer to those as nor transmitters technically they are nuromodulators it'll refer to them almost always is nuromodulators the uropod cells signal by way of a particular branch of the vagus through the nodose ganglion that we talked about before and through a number of different stations in the brain stem eventually cause the release of the nurmodulator dopamine dopamine is often associated with the sense of pleasure and reward but it is more appropriately thought of as a nuromodulator that impacts motivation craving and pursuit it tends to put us into modes of action not necks scarily running and moving through space although it can do that to but in the contacts of feeding it tends to make us look around more the more reach for things more and seek out more of whatever it is that is giving us that sensation of delight or satisfaction and again that sense of delight and satisfaction you might experience only consciously as the way that something tastes on your mouth but it actually is caused again by both the sensations in your mouth but also by the activation of these uropod self this is an incredible system of gut brain signalling and it is but one system of gutbrain signaling it turns out its the system that we know the most about at this point in time there are other components of upbraid signaling that will talk about in a moment for instance the ceretonan system but in terms of examples of gutbrain signaling for which we know a lot of the individual elements and how they work i think this uropod neuron sensing of sweet foods fattyacids and amenoacids in the gut in communicating that up to the brain by way of the vaguest and causing us to seek out more of the foods that deliver those neutrino is an incredible pathway that really delineates the beauty and the power of this cup brain axis let me talk about time scales from talking about a particular type of neuron that is signaling up to the brain using electrical signals to cause us to want to seek out a particular category of foods that is happening relatively fast compared to the hormone pathways of the gut which also involve neurons your gut is also communicating to your brain by way of heron's nerve cells but some of those nerve sells also release hormones and those hormones go by names c we k glucagon peptide wan pwywy et camera a good example of a hormone pathway or what sometimes call the hormone peptide pathway that is similar to the pathway have talked about before but a little bit slower is the gremlin pathway gremlin g h re e l i n increases with fasting the longer it is been since you have eaten or if you are just eating very little food compared to your colonic needs gremlin levels are going to go up in your blood stream and they go up because of processes that include processes within the gut and include the nervous system it is a slow pathway driving you to seek out food generally as far as we know the gremlin system is not partial to seeking out of sweet foods or fatty foods or on gremlin increases the longer it is beensince you have eating sufficient calories and it stimulates a feeling of you wanting to seek out food will how does it do that it does that again by impacting neural circuits within the brain neral circuits that include what we call the brain stem autonomic center it tends to make you feel alert and quite a we say high levels of autonomic arousal if you have next eaten in a while you might think that you just get really exhausted i because we all here that food is energy and colonic energy is what we need to burn but you sh have a lot of energy stored in your body that you would be able to use if you really needed energy but typically we have an eaten in a while we stare to get agitated and we get agitated by way of release of the demodulator epinephrin which causes us to look around more move around more and seek out food that all occurs in brain stem autonomic cents and in the hypothalamus we did not entire episode on feeding behavior and metabolism as well and you can find those episodes that superman labor come do not want to going to a lot of detail but hypothermic and brainstemscenters but there is a particular area of the brain called the nucleus of the solitary tract the ends t is its called that is very strongly impacted by the circulating hormones and tends to drive us toward feeling behavior the important point here is that we have a fast system that is paying attention to the neutrino in our gut or the absence of neutrino and are gut and stimulating us to seek out food or to stop eating certain food and we have a slower hormone related system that a originates in the gut and impacts the brain but all of those converge on neural circuits for feeding the neral circuits for feeding include things the argument increases the hypothermal they include of bunch of other agrochemicals but the point is that you have got a fast route and a slow route to drive you to eat more or eat lass i to seek out food and consume it or to stop eating an to essentially start the satiety mechanisms as they are called and those are operating in parallel it is not one happens first than stops an the other the always operating in parallel and i bring this up because there's a bigger theme here which we see over and over again in biology which is the concept of parallel pathways you have always got multiple accelerators in multiple breaks on he system it is very very rare to have just one accelerator in one break on the system and this will become important later when we talk about tools for optimizing your gotmicrobaiom for healthy eating and for healthy digestion and for healthy brain function i one to take a moment and talk about glucagon peptide one which is also called g o p one g o p one is made by anurans in the gut end by anurans in the brain is a fairly recent discovery but it is an important one g o p one tends to inhibit feeding and tends to reduce appetite there are number of drugs released on the market now one for instance goes by the name semaglutide which is essentially and go p one agonist it causes the release of corgi p one it is being used to treat type two diabetes which is insolent resistant diabetes as is different then type one diabetes where people do not actually make insolent it is also being used as a drug to reduce obesity and it seems pretty effective at least in certain populations there are certain foods and substance is that increase go p one one talked about a few of these on the podcast one that ism a particular fan for entirely other reasons is carbamate t can stimulate the release of go p one in south america its often used as an appetites suppressant probably in large part because of its effects on go p one release but probably also because it does contain caffeine which is a bit of a stimulant which also can be involved in lipolysis which is the utilization of fat stores for energy and forth a brief mention about carbamate there are some reports out there that carbamate can increase certain types of of cancers the data that have seen on this is that it tends to relate to whether not those are smoked versions of the carbamate the the amount of consumption and the debate is still out i invite you to look at those papers you can a search for those on line none the less carbamate is one force of go pe one stimulation semaglutide is another source it also can be stimulated by various foods nuts avocados eggs and forth certain high fiber complex grains will also stimulate o p one i raise this as not necessarily i rout that you want to take in order to reduce food intake i do not even know that that is your goal but that g o p one is another one of these gut to brain signalling mechanisms that ad just appetite that is dependent on diet depends on what you eat or drink and that the go p one pathway does seem particularly sensitive to the constituents of diet there is at least one quality study i was able to find showing that the erogenic diet for instance which almost always involves ingestion of very low levels of carbohydrate can increase go p one although as i mention before there are other foods that fall outside the the range of what we consider keep genie that can also stimulate go p one and as i mention their prescription drugs somiglutide there other ones as well now the stimulate go p one how does go p one reduce appetite it does that in part by changing the activity of anurans in the hypothalamus this cluster of anurans just above the roof of our mouth that themselves make go p one and that cause the activation of motor circuits for reaching chewing all the things that we associate with feeding behavior i use go p one as an example of a pathway that you might choose to tap into by ingestion of your romance or by ingestion of the foods i mentioned or it is something that interest you keetogenic diet but i also mention it simply because it is another beautiful example of how a hormone pathway can impact the activity of brain circuits that are directly involved in a particular behavior yet another example of how gut is communicating to brain in order to change what we think we want or to change what our actual behaviors are the next time you find yourself reaching for food or you find yourself wanting of particular sweet thing or fatty thing or something that contains a lot of a monoacid a proven rich food keep in mind that that is not just about the taste of the food and it is not even necessarily about the nutrients that you need or do not need it could be but it is also about this subconscious signaling that is coming from your body all the time waves of hormones waves of nerve cell signals electrical signals that are changing the way that your brain works and this raises for me a memory of the episode that i did with doctor robot supolski who a world expert a colligomine at stamford who o is expert on things hormones and behavior but we got into the topic of free will which is a bit of a barbed wire topic a as many if t gets into the realm of philosophy et camera and we were kind of batting back and forth the idea i was saying well i think there is free will and cant there certainly be free will or on or certainly the the idea that we can avoid certain choices and robot was saying no in fact he said a he does not believe that we have any free will he thinks that events in our brain are determined by biological events that are below our conscious detection and that occur seconds to milliseconds before we make decisions are assessments and therefore we just cant control what we do what we think in what we feel and at the time i of did not by it i thought i do not know i i just i guess i really wanted to believe in free will and to some extent i still do but as we talk about how these neurons and our gut and these hormones and our got are influencing our brain and the decisions that we are making at the level of circuits the hypothalamus and the nucleus of the solitary tract these are fairies the brain way below our frontal quarter and our conscious perception think these are examples that really fall in the favor of what doctrisupulscu was arguing which is that events that are happening within our body are actually changing the way our brain work we might think that we want the cup cake we might think that we a do not need to eat something or duty to eat something and that t is entirely on the basis of prior knowledge and decision making that were making with our head but in fact it is very clear to me based on the work from the book slab classic work over the years dating back to the eighties and indeed back to the fifties that will talk about n a moment that our body is shaping the decisions that our brain is making and we are not aware of it at all now the good news is that whether or not you believe in free will or not the simple knowledge that this whole process is happening can perhaps be a benefit to you you can perhaps leverage it to get some insight and understanding and perhaps even a wedge into your own behavior you mig thing ah i think i want that particular food or i think i want to avoid that particular food but actually that is not a decision that ism making on a purely rational basis has a lot to do with what my gut is telling my brain we have largely been talking about chemical communication between the gut and the brain chemical because even though the sauropod cells are communicating with the brain by way of electrical activity what we call action potentials and in neural language we call those spikes spikes of action potentials spikes of act shin potentials meaning those neural signals cause the release of chemicals in the brain dopamyg it is chemical transmission similarly hormones even though they act more slowly hormones nauru peptide why c c k gremlin they are signaling chemically they're moving through the body there going in their affecting the chemical output of different cells and they are changing the chemistry of those cells and the chemistry of the cells of those cells talk to that gives us one particular category of signaling from gut to brain which is chemical signaling but of course there are other forms of signals and those fall under the category of mechanical signalling you are probably familiar with this if you have ever eaten a very large meal or consumed a lot of fluid you experience that as distension of the gut and that does not just have to be distension of the stomach but distension of your intestines is we ell that distension is registered by neurons that resided in your gut the signals go up to your brain and communicate with areas of the brain that are responsible for suppressing further consumption of food and or fluid and under certain circumstances can also be associated with the activation f curl circuits that cause vomiting or the desire vomit if ever you have eaten too much or you have eaten something that does not agree with you that information is communicated by way of mechanic censers that sends the mechanics of your gut possibly also the chemistry of your got but mostly the mechanics of your gut signal up to the brain an active ate brain centers that are involved in stopping the eating behavior and activation of an area of the brainstorm that is affectionately for referred to as the vomit center among nuronatamis this is a area that for appropriately is called the memo receptor trigger zone the c ts or area postrema and neurons in this area actually will trigger the vomiting reflex the way that the got in the brain communicate is both chemical and mechanical and it can be both forsake of increasing certain types of behavior today we are talking mainly about feeding behavior up until now anyway but also ceasing to eat closing your mouth moving away from food turning away from food all behaviors that were familiar with any time we feel kind of sick on the basis of activation of this merchant censor for gastric distress we have got chemical signaling and mechanical signaling and i also want emphasize that we have direct and indirect signaling from the gut to the brain direct signaling is the conisignaling of the sort have been talking about mainly up until now which is neurons in the gut communicating with neurons in the brainstorm that communicate with neurons in the hypothalamus and of course those are also going to interact with neurons of the prefrontal quarter which is the are of brain involved in decision making the i think it was the shrimp that made me sick minis just want any more of that or ism never going back to tat restaurant again because after i ate thereabout an hour later i start feeling really not well i felt in a kind of feverish but my gut did not feel what my digestion was really off all of that kind of information is handled in the prefrontal quarter at a conscious level but the immediate decision to stop eating or to eat more of something to move toward something or away from it that is made by neral circuits that reside at the we would say the subconscious lay level but what we really mean as below the level of the no quarter below the quarter means essentially below our level of conscious awareness we talked about two types of information within the gut that are communicated to the brain chemical information meaning information about the neutrino that happen to be there and mechanical information distension of the got or lack of distension and forth and we talked about how these nuropodsells can signal the release of dopamine an circuits within the brain to cause you to seek out more of something now in a very logically consistent way dopa mean is also involved in the whole business of vomiting you might think at us a make any sense i thought dopamine was always a good thing it is involved in moderation and reward et camera but turns out that area postrema this vomit center and the brainstorm is choke block full of dopamine receptors and if dopamine levels go too high it can actually trigger vomiting and this we see in the contact of various drugs that are used to treat things parkinsins parkinsins is a a deficiency in dopamine or a lack of dopaminurons typically the causes arresting tremor difficulty in movement cause dopamine all associated with the lot of the curl circuits for movement many drugs that are used to treat parkinsins adopt increase levels of dopamine much or at least activate dopamine receptors to such a great degree in certain areas of the brain that they can cause activation of things the trigger to vomit now this should also make sense in the natural contest of if you gorge yourself with food gorge yourself with food gorge yourself with food the the neurons in your gut that respond to that are simply detecting the presents of nutrients but they do not really make decisions themselves they do not know to stop eating your brain knows to stop eating or to eject that food and it is a wonderful thing that those neurons are communicating with areas of the brain not just that stimulate consuming more food but that are communicating with areas of the brain for instance area postrema that when dopamine levels get too high cause us to either stop eating that food or in the case of vomiting to eject that food i raise this not to give you a kind of a disgusting counter example to what we call a positive behaviors the things that we to do more of but simply to give you a sense of just how strongly even these reflects that we think of as feeling sick and vomiting or the desire to seek out more food are really being controlled by a kind of pushball system by parallel pathways that are arriving from our gut and the same narrow chemicals in this case dopamine are being used to create too opposite type behaviors one behavior to consume more one behavior to get rid of everything you have already consume our brain is actually sensitive to the amount of signalling coming from our gut not just the path by which that signal arrives our brain is very carefully paying attention to whether are not the levels of dopamine that are being trigger are within a normal range for typical eating behavior or whether not we gorged ourselves to the point where enough already now of course mechanical signals will also play into arapostrema and into the vomiting reflects if we have a very distended gut we feel lousy it just tactual can hurt very badly and we will have the desire o vomit or we will just simply vomit mechanical and chemical signals are always arriving in parallel they never work in unison and now we have chemical signals mechanical signals and o now w it'd to talk about direct and indirect signals because almost everything i have talked about up until now or direct signals a hurry pathway that converges in the brain to create a particular feeling thought or behavior but they are also indirect pathways and that s what takes us back to the gut microfilm and to these little microbioda and to just give you the take away message that the front here and then it'll give you a little more detail as to how it comes about you have near transmitters in your brain and in your spinal cord and in your eyes an nor popherol nervous system they cause the activation or the suppression of nerve activity meaning they either electrically activate other nerve cells whore they cause other nerve cells to be less electrically active and they do that by way of her transmitters but as it turns out the gut microbiota are capable of influencing metabolic events and in some cases are capable of synthesizing nor transmitters themselves what that means is that these little bugs these little microbiota that are cargo in your got the six pounds of cargo they actually can make narrow chemicals that can pass into the blood stream and into your brain and actually impact the other cells of your body and brain indirectly without involving these very intricate nerve pathways that we been talking about in other words the foods you eat the environments of your gut microfilm can actually create the chemical substrates that allow your brain to feel one way or the other to feel great or to feel lousy to seek out more of a particular type of behavior or to avoid that behavior and that would constitute indirect signaling i been talking a lot about the structure and function of the gut to brain pathway focussing mainly on feeding behaviors and in some cases avoiding feeding or even ejecting food from the digestive tract i to drill a little bit deeper into this indirect signaling pathway from the gut to the brain because it bridges us nicely from neuronal signals in the gut to the brain hormonal signals from the gut to the brain to what also includes the microfilm which is what we started talking about at the beginning of the episode they mention a couple of minutes ago certain gut microbiota can actually synthesize certain narrow transmitters that can go impact the brain and we actually have some knowledge about which microbiota can synthesized particular her transmitters for instance the neuromotulator dopamine can be synthesized by or from bacillus and strata now these are just names of microbiodi do not expect that any of you would necessarily recognize them these are not the sorts of things you necessarily would run out and buy to get more dopamine but the point is that particular gut microdot can create dopamine in our gut that can get into our blood stream and can generally changed are base line levels of dopamine within the brain and other areas of the body i mention baseline levels of dopamine because as i talked about on an episode all about dopamine but anus repeat the was is here now we have baseline levels of transmitters a neuromogulators the act give sort of the level of the tide the overall level and then we can have peaks of dopamine that are created by behaviors or by ingestion of particular foods or drugs et camera basilican seated tend to increase are baseline levels of doom if it turns out that we are creating the right gut microfilm environment that these particular gutmicrobiota can thrive in will then our baseline levels of dopamine will be elevated and in general that leads to enhancement of mood similarly there are other gut microbioda for instance candida streptococcus serious a enterocacus these always have these con of strange and a not attractive names at least to me as a neuromiologist none the less those particular microbioda support the production of or can even be metabolized into serotonin which is a nourmodulator a located with mood with social interactions with a huge number of different types of events an behaviors again these gut microbiota when present and allowed to thrive in our gut will increase are overall levels of ceratonan and riding on top of that level of eratonan will be the teratogen that specifically released in response to certain behaviors really one to drive home this point of baselines an peaks the baseline level ceratonan might set our overall mood whether not we wake up feeling pretty good or really lousy if our creatine levels happen to be very very low whether r not we tend to be in a kind of a calm space or whether not we tend to be somewhat irritable but then of course individual events as we go about our day may be a complement that we get or may be somebody says something irritating to us whatever it may be will also influence levels of teratogen but those ceratonan events are going to be related to events at particular neural circuits in the brain an this is an important topic because i think that a lot of people here quite accurately oh ninety to ninety five per cent of our ceratonan is manufactured in the gut and indeed that is true its manufactured from the sorts of microcode that i just described and there are many many experiments now mostly in animal models but as also some inhuman that show that if the gutmicrobiom is deficient in some way to these particular bacteria that ceratonan levels drop and people's mood suffers may be in their subsystem functions may be even exacerbates certain psychiatric illnesses however a lot of people take that to mean that the serotonin of the brain all comes from the gut or mostly comes from the gut that is not the case it still the case that you have neurons in the brain that are responsible for releasing the ceratonan directly in response to certain things social touch or to through other types of positive social experiences we have got got microbiota that can literally be turned into dopamine an raise our baseline levels of dopamine we have got got microbiota that can literally raise our baseline levels of ceratonan and indeed there are other got microbiota lactobasylas or bifodecti biff dobacteriums cases me hard complex names to pronounce bifidobacterium that can give rise to increases in gabby levels this inhibitory narrow transmitter the contact is a little bit of a mild see alive can reduce irritability et camera but that is just the baseline the kind of tide of those neurmodulators again i want emphasize that we still have natural circuits within the brain and body that are specifically releasing in a very potent way dopamine ceratonan and gala the two things act in concert even though the gut and the brain are acting both in parallel and directly influencing one another it is a powerful synergistic effect and there are now hundreds of studies maybe even thousands by this point mostly performed an animal models typically mice but also some studies in humans that show that creating the correct environment for these got microbiota to thrive really does enhance mood and well being and that when our got microfilm is not healthy that it really can deplete are mood and sense of well being now there are two major phases to creating a healthy got microfilm one you con control and the other one is less under your control i get into this in a lot of detail in the episode with doctor sononberg which is coming out immediately after this one the following money that is but for now i wanted just capture a few of the main points about the early establishment of the got microfilm it turns out that the environment that we are exposed to the things that come into contact with our skin and digestive tract and any other mucosa lining even the urethra the nasal passages any opening to the outside world that brings in certain souse me certain microbiota in the first three years of life is going to have a profound impact on the overall menu of microbiota that we will be able to carry within our body and it really does seem that getting exposure to and building a diverse microfilm in those first three years is critical there is a lot of speculation and some data as to cesarian delivered babies having less diverse microfilms compare to vaginally delivered babies there been attempts although not conclusive attempts to link that to the the presence of opium spectrum disorders which at least by some statistics seem to be of higher probability in cesarian deliveries although there are other studies that refute that i wont to make that clear however it is clear that babies do not get much if any exposure to microbioda inside of the womb may be a little bit but not much but that is during the birth process and in the days in weeks immediately after they arrive in the world that their got microfilm is established that those got microbial take residence within the gut it will depend on whether not they're reset er bothered ill depend on whether or not they were exposed to a household pet or not whether no they ware held by multiple caregivers or just by one whether not they were a premie baby and were contained in a o a particularly restrictive environment in order to encourage their further development before they can be brought home or not i do not want to give the picture that if you were isolated or you are delivered by sea section that your somehow doomed have a poor microfilm hat simply not the case however it is the case that the more diversity of microbioda that one can create early in life is really helpful for long term out comes in terms of brain to got signalling got to brain signaling and forsake of i the union system there are some decent studies showing that if children are exposed to a lot of antibiotic treatment early in life that can be very detrimental to establishment of a healthy got microfilm and fortunately that re establishing a healthy got microfilm can help rescue some of those deposits doctors now days are much more cautious about the prescription of antibiotic drugs to children in their early years not just up to three years but extending out to five and seven and ten years and even an adults their very very careful about that or they ought to be one reason is the existence or say the proliferation of antibiotic resistant bacteria that are becoming more common in hospitals and elsewhere and that can cause serious problems but in addition to that because of this understanding that the got microfilm is influencing an actually creating nor transmitters that can impact mood and mental health impact immune health and on as i mention early are there are hundreds if not thousands of studies emphasizing the key role of the microfilm on brain health psychiatric health et camera i want just highlight a few of those studies and in particular some recent studies that come from labs that have been working on the sort of thing for a very long time one of the more exciting studies comes from the work of mark costomatioles lab which is at bailer college of medicine morrows lab has been working on mouse models of autism spectrum disorder for a long time and looking at social behavior using a mouse model for a long time and they have been able to identify particular types of microbioda that when they take residence in the gut can help offset some of the symptoms of autism at least the symptoms of autism that exist in these mouse models miso again this is not human work this is work being done a mouse models for the simple reason that you can do these c into manipulations where basically they took mice that were in germfree environments or non germ are environments or they expose mice to particular microbiota and not other microbiota and they discovered that a particular microbiota called l rudely its l period re e u t e r we treatment with el rudely corrects the social deficits present in these opium models and it does by way of activating our old friend the vagus nerve but not simply because the vaguest nerve triggers the release of dopamine but it turns out that this particular gut microdot el rudely can correct the social deficits in this opium spectrum disorder model it does that by way of a vagal nerve pathway that stimulates both dopamine release and oxytose and release and they stablish this really mechanistically by showing for instance if you get rid of the oxidase and receptor you do not see this rescue now those are cause models we have to take those of with the appropriate grain of salt but the really exciting and they come to us in parallel with other studies that are being done taking the microfilms of people who have one condition or lack of condition and putting it into people who have one condition or another condition them explain what i mean by that the early discovery of the gotmicrobiom and its potential to impact health was not in the context of the got to brain pathway but rather was in the conics of coitus the states back to studies in the fifties whereby people with very severe intractable coitus for which no other treatment was going to work received female transplants yes that is exactly as it sounds taking the stool of healthy people who do not have coitus transplanting those stools into the lower digestive tract of people who do have coitus and they saw significant improvement if not rescue of the coitus that was one of the first indications that something within stool of all things could actually rescue another individual from disease which sounds kind of wild and crazy and made even sound discussing to some of you but as i mention at the beginning the episode almost sixty per cent of stool is live or dead bacteria microbiota and it really opened up this entire field of exploring how different microbiota much might have therapeutic effects and indeed that has been shown to be the case also in female transplants for certain psychiatric illnesses these are still on going studies they vary quality ah its these are hard studies to do for all sorts of reasons getting the appropriate patient populations getting agreement et camera a making sure that everything's handle properly but what this involves is legal transplants from individuals that lack of particular psychiatric condition or metabolic condition into people who have a particular metabolic condition and there has been tremendous success in some cases one of the more a powerful and sailing to examples is for ability their some people for which even if they ingest very low numbers of calories even if they go on a liquid proline diet simply cannot lose weight fisher somewhat rare disorders but these are people that would either do i get gastric by pass surgery some people are now getting these equal transplants from people that have a healthy a healthy weight and they take the the the stool from them they put into lower digestive tract and they can see substantial improvement in weight lost in people that were otherwise unable to do that in some cases actually they can start eating relatively normal levels of food and still lose weight pretty remarkable and that tells us there something in these microbioda that is really powerful now how those effects are generated is not clear one idea is that it is impacting the metabolic component of the metabolism almost certainly that is going to be the case another ideas that it is impacting nor transmitters which change behavior and food choices within the brain although as i mention some of these people are already eating very little food to begin with that is a little bit a harder of an a argument to create there are also some somewhat famous examples now of howfecal transplants can lead to negative outcomes but those negative outcomes further under score the power of the microfilm in impacting bodily health one key example of this for instance is transfer of fecal matter into another person in order to treat something coitus and it effectively does that but if the done of the of the stool of the equal matter happen to be ones or have some other metabolic centrum it is been observed that the recipient can also developed that metabolic centrum simply by way of receiving that donors particular microbioda these microbiota can create positive outcomes where they can create negative outcomes most of us of course are not interested in or pursuing focal transplants most people are interested in just creating a healthy got microfilm environment for sake of immune system and brain function and we will talk about how to do that in just a few minutes but i just one a further under score the power of the microbiota in shaping brain chemistry and in shaping things mood or other aspects of mental health that typically we don't associate with our gut there are several studies publish in recent years one that all dust highlight now first author it is eonian win envy u we en the title of the paper is association of loneliness and wisdom with gut microbial diversity and composition and exploratory study the interesting study looked at a hundred and eighty for community dwelling of hat adults excuse me ranging from twenty eight to ninety seven years old they explored whether not having enhanced microbial diversity somehow related to these variables that they refer to its loneliness and wisdom they used a number of different a test to evaluate those those are a common tests in the psychology literature not much the biology literature but none the less there a ways of measuring things loneliness and wisdom om wisdom in this case being the the opposite of loneliness a at least in the contacts of this study and what they found was the more microbial diversity the more diverse one's microfilm was the lower incidents of loneliness and they did this by taking equal samples profiling them for are in as mentally doing gene sequencing of the stool of these individuals getting readings of how lonely or not lonely they felt and correlating those and that is just but one study i pointed out because it is a particularly recent and thatculaus particularly a well done there is another study that it'll just refer you to this was a study publish in twenty twenty and scientific reports the title of the study is a emotional well being and got microfilm profiles by interotype what i particularly about the study is that they were able to correlate the presence of certain microbioda with feelings of subjective well being and lack of or presence of depressive symptoms they did high through put gene sequencing of the microbus of individuals that meant measuring the microbioto figuring out which microbioto were present how diverse their microfilm was in general got microfilm diversity is a good thing and then to correlate that with what is called the p a and a s score p a an a stands for positive affect negative affect schedule this is a test that my lab is used extensively that other labs use to a valuate mood and well being and they defined what were what were called three interotypes three different categories of people that a very different diets that tended to fall into categories of having more or fewer emotional symptoms that were negative or more a fewer emotional signed symptoms that were positive and whether not they tend to be more depressed anxious or have more stress related behaviors et camera and what they were able to derived from the study was some strong indications about what types of things we should ingest in our diet maybe even certain thingsthat we should avoid but certainly the types of things that we should invest that can infants mood and well being and contend to shift people away from more depressive anxiety and stress related symptoms before we get into what the particular food items were that lend themselves to a healthy microfilm ad one rays a bigger in perhaps more important issue which is what is a healthy microfilm think if you asked any number of world experts and i certainly assist of doctor sonumberg what is a healthy microfilm they are all going to tell you it is a microbus that has a lot of diversity that includes a lot of different types of bacteria that make sense i because it logically would include the a bacteria that produce gala and dopomeneand ceratonan and that support the immune system into a number of different things but is it simply the case that adding microbic a diversity is always a good thing well that does not seem to be the case robotics and prebiodicts both of which can in hansel microbitole diversity can improve mood digestion in run system and on that is been established but it is mainly been establish in the context of post antibiotic treatment or people that are recovering from illness or people that have been a very stress or i have been dealing with all sorts of challenges mental or physical and they are an attempt to replenish the got microfilm however it is also clear that excessive microbiota brought about by excessive in take of robotics can lead to things braining there is actually some good studies that point to the fact that certain metabolites of the microfilm certain chemicals produced in the got and and in the body can actually lead to braining states this is thought to come about through the lactate pathways of the gut that can then impact the brain if you want to look more into this issue of whether or not robotics taken in excess perhaps can lead to braining an incursion look at a particular paper this a paper published in clinical translational pasta and trilogy and the title of paper is brain fogginess gas and bloating a link between so robotics and metabolic acidosis wit publish in twenty eighteen we can provide a link to the study and there are several other studies in the references that point to the fact that in some cases excessive in take of robotics and excessive proliferation of got microbiota can actually be problematic i mention this not to confuse you but because it is confusing out there we all would think that just increasing microbial diversity is always a good thing but there are a thresholds beyond which excessive microbial diversity might be problematic i think everyone agrees that having to few mi crucial species living in us is not a good idea now none of that answers the questions that i think every one really wants answers to which are what should we do what should we not do to improve our got microfilm i man clearly we cannot time travel back to when we were zeroth three years old and get a dog if we have a dog a get breastfed if we were not breastfed a be delivered a rationally as supposed by sea section if we did have that opportunity we just cant time travel and do that all of us however should be seeking to improve the conditions of our got microfilm because of the critical ways in which it impacts the rest of our brain bodily health what shall we do what should not we do clearly we know that stress can negatively impact the got microfilm however some forms of strata can quote quote negatively impact the microbes include fasting long periods of facts which makes sense because a lot o microbiota need food in order to thrive in fact many if not all of them do at some point there are other questions such as should we eat particular foods and how often should we eat those foods we all been told that fire is i credibly important because of the presence of periotic fiber which can essentially feed the microfilm but is fire really necessary and how necessary is it to encourage a healthy microfilm clearly there are number of people following relatively low fiber diet such as keetogenic diets and those can have in some cases anti inflammatory effects and can some times also improve certain microdot species can all be rather confusing and for that matter i asked our resident expert doctor just sonaberg at stamford all of these questions and he answers them very systematically in the episode that comes out after this one but i do not want to withhold anything from you it'll just give a very topcontour version of those answers and then you will get more in depth answers during that episode i asked about fasting and the reason i asked about fasting is that years ago i was at a meeting as part of the pupils the biomedical scholar's meeting and one of the other biomedical scholars the expert in got microfilm and i said hey are robotics good for the microfilm and if which one should i take and his answer was very interesting he said in certain cases they can be specially if your travelling or your street but it turns out that the particular bacteria that they put in most robotics do not actually replenish the microbiota that you need most and i thought oh well why do not they make ones that replenish the microbiota that you need most and his answer was well they do not replenish those but they replenish other ones that than in turn encourage the development of the microbiota that you do want once you start eating the appropriate foods they change the environment which makes the environment better which indirectly supports that proliferation of quotunquote good microbiota o case that was a somewhat convoluted answer but i did appreciate his answer then i asked him about fasting i said well lot of people are getting interested intermix fasting now people are spending a signing portion of each twenty for hour cycle avoiding food for sake of time rester defeating what is that due to the got microfilm does it make a healthier does it make it unhealthier well my colleague from feel and doctor soninberg both confirmed that during periods of fasting especially prolong periods of fasting we actually start to digest away much of our digestive tract now the whole thing doesn't struck as is peer but there is thinking of the mucosa lining or at least destruction the mucosa lining a lot of the microbiota species can start to die off and it was surprising to me but none the less interesting that fasting may actually cause a disruption to certain healthy elements of the got microfilm but again there is a caviar the caviar is that when people eat after a period of fast there may be a compensatory proliferation meaning and increase in healthy got microbiota you start to get the picture that fasting is neither good nor bad you start to get the picture that particular diets meaning certain restriction diets or micronutrient rich dies may not be good or bad for the microfilm and yet there are some answers that arrive to us from doctor soninberg but from other experts in the field that there are certain foods and certain things that we can ingest which definitely enhance the microfilm and make it healthier than it would be were we to not ingest those foods next i to talk about and what i think is a really pioneering and important study in this area this is a study that was carried out by the soninberg lab collaboration with chis gardeners lab also at stamford where they compared two general types of diets inhuman diets that were fire rich which has been propose time and time again to enhance micro biota diversity and to enhance got brain signalling even and to enhance the inion system perhaps and diets that were enriched in called low sugar for rented foods before i dive into that study and what the conclusions were because they are very interesting and very actionable for all of us i do want to touch on robotics because i want to avoid confusion it is not the case that ingestion of robotics will always lead to braining what to make that clear it is the case that ingestion of robotics even if those robotics do not directly contain the microbiota species that one is trying to proliferate can be useful for improving microbial diversity in general it seems that maintaining a healthy got microfilm involves ingesting certain types of foods we will talk about those in a moment but perhaps also augmenting the microbic system through prebiotics or robotics at a fairly low level on a consistent basis these are not hide robotics except under conditions of disbiosis where for instance if somebody has done around of antibiotics and they need to replenish their got microfilm there are foods end there are perform and powder form robotics and robotics that can be very useful or in cases where people have been very stressed or are undergoing excessive travel or have shifted their diet radically maybe that is due to travel maybe that is due to illness may be that is due distress but when there are a number of different converging events that are stressing or depending microbial diversity that when at least i believe it can be useful to support they got microfilm through the ingestion of quality robotics or prebiotics it would be under conditions where people are stressed ore their system is generally stress for environmental or illness related reasons that it might be useful to lean towards higher doses of prebiotics are robotics than one might normally use but that under normal conditions that one would focus on quality nutrients through diet and for is on ingestion of robotics at a fairly low to moderate level and or robotics at a fairly low to moderate level that just seems the logical approach based on the experts that have spoken to but certainly if your doctor proscribes or suggest that you take high levels of robotics for any reason you should fully pay attention your physician and you should obviously pay attention your physician in any case you should never add a remove anything from your nutritional plan or supplementation plan without conduct consulting a physician what shall we do in order to maximize the health of our got brain axis as it is called how should we support the diversity of the good microbiota that help us create all these narrow transmitters that we want improve our immune system function and on and forth well some of that is going to be through the basics when i say the basics i mean the foundational things that really set us up for over all healths this is going to be getting deep sleep of sufficient duration eighty plus per cent of the time i mean if you you get a hundred per cent the time that be grape but very few people accomplish that it is going to be proper hydration it is going to be proper social inter actions is can be proper nutrition will talk more about nutrition in a moment it is gong to be limiting excessive prolonged stresses or stress and indeed we have done episodes about just about all of those things but certainly about stress we have an episode of the human lab podcast that you can fine at human labor calm all about mastering stress how to avoid long periods of intent stress what to do to offset those given that stress can disrupt the microfilm whether not your fasting or not those tools ought to be useful now in what i consider to be a landmark study exploring the relationship between the up microfilm food in take and over all health is this paper from just in soninberg slab and chriscardeners lab both of which are at stamford and the paper entitle gutmicrobioto targeted diets modulate human immune status was published in the journal cell which is among the three top journals perhaps in the world nature science and sell really being the apex journals or over all science and especially for big medical sciences now this is very interesting study it was done humans there were two major groups one group of humans was instructed to increase the amount of fiber in their diet and in fact eight a high fiber diet the other group was instructed to eat a high fermented food diet now both groups started off not having eaten a lot of fiber or a lot of fermented foods and were told to increase the amount of either fiber or fermented foods that they were investing over a four week ramp up period and that was to avoid any major gastric distress it turns out that if you are not already accustomed o eating a lot of fire increasing your mount of fiber dramatically can custom gastric distress but if you ease into it over time as will see a there is a me nisi behind this was was unveiled in the study but if see into it over time then the system can tolerate it likewise his fermented foods can the readily tolerated if there is a ramp up phase of investing may be one serving a day than may be two servings in camping up in this case as highs six servings per day however after this ramp up period the group sign to the high fire condition maintained high fire in take for six weeks and the high fermented food group maintained high fermented food in take for six weeks after which they went off either the hifibr or the hipermento flu diet and there was a four week follow up period during which they gradually return to baseline throughout the study there got microfilm was a valuated for the diversity of got microbiota and there were also a number of measures of immune system function in particular measures of the called in flamatome the immune system has a lot of different molecules involved i did whole episode about the in system if your interested in learning what some of those molecules are verycidakinds and signalling molecules that reflect either high inflammation states are reduced inflammation states in the brain and body your welcome to check that episode its also at superman labor come regardless in this study they explore the sorts of immune markers that were expressed in either of the two groups and compared those the basic take away of this paper was that contrary to what they predicted the high fiber diet did not lead to increase microbiota diversity at least not in all cases and that was somewhat surprising now the idea is that periotic fiber and a lot of the material in fruits in vegetables in grains and forth are supposed to support microbial diversity and the proliferation of existing microbiota and that is not what they observed although i want to be very clear pointing out that the results did not indicate that fiber is not useful for health over all but it does point the fact that increasing fibrin take did not increase microbial diversity which in general as i mention before is associated with improvements in microbiota function health and overall well being now the high fermented food diet condition was very interesting it resulted in increased microfilm diversity and decrease in inflammatory signals in activity there was a tumor basically by investing fermented foods at in fair abundance rite in for to six servings are more per days is a lot of fermented a food intake will talk about what some of those foods were but the outcome was very positive am there's a clear increase in microbic diversity and decreased in inflammatory signals things interlunar six on a number of other interlucans and sidakinds that are associated with increased inflammation in the brain and body were reduced big significantly now let us talk a little bit about this notion of number of servings et camera one somewhat minor point of the study but i think is useful in terms of an act taking an actionable stance with this is that the number of servings of fermented foods was not as strong of predictor of improvements in the inflammation meaning reduced inflammation and improvements in micro biota diversity as was the duration of time that the individuals were in jesting fermented foods in other words the longer that one is consistently investing fermented foods on a daily basis the better the outcomes in terms of the got microfilm and for reducing inflammation i think that is an important point and i make that point especially because for a lot of people even if you do this ramp up says six servings per day of fermented foods i con seem quite a lot what are these fermented foods right i think many of us are on familiar with certain cheeses and being fermented and beer being fermented and combuchas fermented in this study they focus specifically on low sugar fermented foods this would be plain yogurt a in some cases kitchen or sour kraut an important consideration however is that it needs to contain what are called live active cultures which means their actually have to be a microbioda that are alive inside the sober craft one way whether not that is happening is if you purchase sour kraut or pickles or kitchen from a jar or a container that is on the nourish refrigerated shelf of the unrefrigerated section of your grocery store it is not going to contain live active cultures of microbioda and likewise if you consume eager that has a lot of sugar or other components added to it it is not going to have the same passive effect on the microfilm least that is the prediction given some of the relationship between the sorts of microbial that live in sugar verses plain top yogurts they gave people the option of consuming any number of different low sugar fermented foods that again that count be sourcraut kimchi things heifer dato a in japan they consume dato which is of fermented food a beer was not one of the fermented of foods that hat was include in the tormented footless and when we say six servings per day that is indeed six six out servings or six for to six out servings it was not six servings or what is listed on the package that again that turns out to be a fair amount of fermented foods how should you gauge whether not you regretting enough for this well if you decide to a take on this photo call of investing more fermented foods which at least by my read of the study and some of the follow up work that is being done a terrific idea if you want to improve your got microfilm for all the great reasons that one would want to brain body health reduced inflammation and on and on well then you evilly want it focus on fermented foods that you enjoy consuming for you if that key fer r for you that plain yogerder for you that sour cat which pas we might a personal favorite then you want to make sure that it is going to be something that you you are going to enjoy in getting quite a lot of and that you are going to be obey with ingesting probably throughout the day now people follow different meal schedules of course but this does require not just eating all the fermented foods just before bedtime or one meal a suppose you could do that but in general its going to work basin arms of limiting gastric distress by spreading it out throughout the day i also wont to mention brine brine is the liquid that surrounds sour craft o its that very salty fluid and that contains a lot of active live cultures and they did a include a were they allowed people to include brine in this in the study and in discussions with doctor sanunberg which will going to in more detail on the episode o and that comes out next week we talk a lot about the particular value that brine might hold in terms of bringing about micro a biota diversity because of the richness of live cultures that it contains i do won o focus for a moment on the high fire condition because there were some interesting observations about the people that were placed into that condition first of all increasing the amount of fiber definitely increase the number of enzymes that can be used to digest fire this is in keeping with this idea of this ramp up pase where accumulation of more fiber in take can over time lead to less gastric distress but also to more utilization of fire which overall should be a good thing while they did not observe and increase in mine system function or an increase of microbiota diversity there was an increase in these fire digesting enzyme they also observed what they called personalized in man responses there were some sub groups within the high fire group that had interesting changes in terms of their reactions to a i should say their in flamatome meaning the inflammatory markers they expressed as well as their microbiota diversity there ware sensual three groups one group ache showed an increase in inflammatory markers that was quite surprising and a probably a not a wonderful for the message that fires always good for us but that was a small cohort within the fiber intake group another group and still a other group both showed reductions in baseline microbiota diversity although to varying degrees i soft want to paint the picture that fire is bad but fire certainly did not have the plosive effects on microbiota diversity that the high fermented food diet did my read of the study and i think the stands that many others have taken as a consequence of these data is that we should be increasing a fermented food and take that that simply a good thing to do in order to support a gout microfilm and to reduce in inflammatory signals in our brain and body and there are number different ways to do that i mention some of the particular foods however any time your talking about in jesting fermented foods especially the high quality ones that come from the refrigerated section of the grocery store or that end that have low sugar content et camera we do have to be considerate of cost because certain things combucchas for instance can be quite costly a i should also mention some cambucchas actually contain aldol some to do not a or contain very little amounts of alcohol one way to avoid the high cost of fermented foods while still being able to accumulate a lot of fermented food intake is to simply make those fermented foods yourself this is something that a we started exploring and a experimenting with in our home one simple way to do this is to just make your own sour crowd it involves very few ingredients abashedly involves cabbage water and salt but there is a specific process that you need to follow in order to create these large volumes of sour craft at home using that low cost method the best resource that i know of in order to follow a great recipe to make homage sour craft would be the recipe for home made sour craft that is contained in timferras's book the four hour shaft there is an excellent protocol there involves chopping up the cabbage putting into a bowl mashing it up a with your hands which can be for a putting water in there some salt covering it and then keeping it in a particular environment and then routinely scraping off some of the a material from the surface you have to do that in order to make sure that you are not getting a micro a microbes an things growing in it that are bad for you you defy want to pay careful attention to the protocol but that is a very very lowest way of generating lots and lots of fermented food you do not to broke trying to improve your microbayume the otherthing that you can do if your really a obsessed with combuccha or something that to avoid the high cost of combucchas there always that you can get the score which basically allows you to make your own camuccha at home have never tried this but when i was a post there was an undergraduate in the lab i think a well i will not out him but he is now gone on to medical school a and a i think he is passes residence is and is a practicing doctor but none the less he was always making combuccha at home he told me it was exceedingly easy but then again he had a number of other skills and attributes that a maybe think that he could do pretty much anything with ease whereas a i tend to struggle with even basic cooking maybe if you are feeling a let more adventurous you could a explore making your own combuccha but there are a number of different protocols and recipes out there for making your own low sugar fermented foods you need not run out and buy fresh sour crowd all the time i shouldalso mention for those of you that are interested in a getting your fermented a in take from pickles jarred pickles a rarely if ever contain ferment a mostly there just soaked in an vinegar water and with some spices but there are some that contain ferment yes show have to look for that on the container and porno maybe some one out there knows how to make not and knows how to make kimchi well in things of that sort a it certainly is the case based on the data from the study that in jesting more servings of fermented food pray ought to be beneficial for our got microfilm and since this is a ne episode not just about got microfilm but got brain health i should mention that one form of signalling between the gopmicrobyum and the brain which we did not discuss and it'll just touch on briefly is that when the in flamatome or the the genes and markers of inflammation are kept in a healthy range there is an active signalling of that immune system status to the brain there is an intermediate cell type that communicates immune status to the brain and that teletype is the microgleal cell a type of fleas the name suggests when there is a lot of inflammation in the body these microglea actually get activated and can start a eating away at various components of the brain and nervous system and i do not mean massive eating away than i can digests the whole brain but these microglea are sort of the resident macrophages of the brain macrophages are in the periphery and they gobble up debris in things o that sort the microglea on a regular basis are eating up debris that accumulates across waking cycles and in response to micro damage of the brain on that occurs on a daily basis they have a lot of important basic every day what we call housekeeping functions but when the is a lot of inflammation in the body when there is a massive immune response the microglea can be hyperactivated and that is thought to lead to any number of different a cognitive defects ore challenges thinking or a maven some forms of nerdegeneration over time although that last point is more of a hypothesis than than a well stamped down fact at this point there still lot of investigation to be done in humans the animal data however are very very strong that when the immune system is activated or chronically activated or hyper activated that neural tissue meaning brain tissue another central nervous system tissue can suffer there's a lot of reasons to want to not just improve microfilm diversity but to also improve immune system function and to limit the number of inflammatory markers that are present in the body because of the way those inflammatory markers can signal deleterious events in the brain and while eating fermented foods and making your own fermented foods and buying hycualty fermented foods might seem an inconvenience i would say that from the perspective of cost benefit or effort benefit is actually on a quite a good situation where if you can just ramp up the number of fermented foods that or servings to ferment o foods e reading pray over a period of a few weeks that your tolerating that well that ought to have a very plosive effect on your microfilm diversity and indeed on got brain function and it'll be the last to suggest that people completely forego on fiber i think there is some debate out there as to how much fiber we need and whether not certain forms of fiber a better than others ism not gin to get into that debate its barbed wire enough without injecting my own a views into that debate but i think there is ample evidence to support the fact that for most people investing a paramount of fiber is going to be a good idea i would just say that mayor that your also ingesting a fair amount of fermented foods and along the lines of fiber in in an accompanying article published in cell which was sort of a what we call a news an views piece about the son in began gardener paper they make a quite good point which is that the increase in fiber and take that led to the increase in carbohydrate active enzymes the see a regimes as there called these are enzymes that help digest fiber duo indicating and enhanced capacity for the microfilm to degrade complex carbohydrates present in fibrous foods in other words eating more fiber and fibrous foods allowed for an increase in these enzymes that allow you to eat still more fibrous foods or to better digest fibrous foods that are coming in through other sources there is at least one utility for in creasing fiber even though its separate from the gut microbial diversity and reducing inflammation and i be remiss if i did not touch on some of the data and controversy about artificial sweeteners and the gut microfilm i want to be very clear that what am about to tell you has only been established in animal models in amounts model at least to my knowledge what the studies have shown a and there were several but one published in the journal nature a few years back as the one that got the most amount of attention is that animals that consume large amounts of artificial sweetness in particular things macron or scrolls show destruction in their gut microfilm ism not aware of any studies in humans that show the equivalent effect and ism not aware of any studies in humans that show the equivalent effect for things plant base lo carry sweeteners things stein mong fruit in things to that sort and at least by my exploration i could not find any data specifically related to the sweetener ascertain right now its somewhat controversial and actually this as kind of a third real topic out there when one group will come out saying that artificial sweeteners are bad because they destruct the gutmicrobiom the response generally from a number of people as well that is only been shown in animal models and indeed that is true right now i do not think that there is a strong case one way or the other i think that people should basically ask themselves whether not they artificial sweeteners or not whether not they are willing to risk it or not an obviously that is an individual choice i also not to point out a recent study from diegobohorces lab which actually shows however that neurons in the gut those uropod sells are actually capable of distinguishing between real sugars and artificial sweetness this is a really interesting body of work it was published that just n just recently i should say february twenty twenty two the title of the paper is the preference for sugar over sweetener depends on a gut sense or sell and to make a long story short what they showed was there is a category of nursed sells that recognized sugar in the gut and signal that information about the presence of sugar in the gut to the brain i the pathways we talked about before the notes gangly a the vaguest opening et camera et camera interestingly the very same category of neurons can respond to artificial sweeteners and signal that information to the brain but the pattern of signalling and indeed the signature pattern that is conveyed to the brain and received by the brain is actually quite a bit different when these same neurons are responding to artificial sweeteners verses actual sugar this is very interesting because what it means is first of all that neurons have incredible specificity in terms of what they are signalling from the gut to the brain and it also means that there may be a particular signal that the brain receives that says ism receiving some intake of food or drink that taste sweet but does not actually offer much nutrients in the direction of sweetness meaning that it does not have calories to spite being sweet now again this is all subconscious processing and with the previous studies we were just discussing about artificial sweeteners generally in the gutmicrobiom generally it is unclear how this relates to humans at this point in time but given the similarity of cellar processes and molecular processes at the level of gut brain in mice i think it stands to reason that these uropod cells very likely are capable of signaling sweet presence of real sweet nerves is artificial sweeter in humans as well although that still remains to be determined empirically i to just briefly recap what have covered to day i started of by talking about the structure and function of the gut brain access i described the basic structure and function of the digestive pathway and how that digestive pathway harbors microbial species meaning many many little bacteria that can signal all sorts of things to the rest of the brain and body and indeed we talked about the various ways that they do that we talked about direct pathways literally nerve networks that extend from the gut up to the brain and from the brain back to the gut and we talked about indirect pathways how some of the gout microbiota can actually synthesize nor transmitters that get out into the blood stream can impact the body can impact the immune system and can get into the brain and act as her transmitters in the brain just as would her transmitters that originate from within the brain also talked about what constitutes a healthy verses unhealthy microfilm and it is very clear that having a diverse microfilm is healthier than having a non diverse microfilm but as i pointed out there still lot of questions as to exactly what microdot species you want to enhance and which ones you want to suppress in the gut in order to achieve the best gut brain acts as function we talked about how things fasting might impact the microfilm and how some of that might be a little it counter intuitive based on some of the other plosive effects of fasting or ifwoere not just discussing fasting some other types of somewhat restrictive diets either restrictive in time or restrictive in terms of macronutrian intake how those may or may not improve the health of the up microfilm and the basic take away was that because we do not know exactly how specific diets impact the gupmicrobium and we do not know how fasting either promotes or degrades the microfilm we really cannot say whether not they are improving or degrading the microfilm at this time however it is clear that stress in particular chronic stress can destruct the gumicrobium it is also clear of course the antibiotics can disturb the gut microfilm and that brings us to the topic of prebiotis and probioics and i emphasize the fact that for most people investing high quality non process foods that include some periotic fiber but also that include some robotics will probably be healthy but not excessive levels of robotics high levels of supplemented robotics of the sort that would come in a robotic pill or even prescription robotics would probably lend themselves best to when people were under severe chronic stress or had just come off a serious round or an on going or repeated rounds of antibiotics that does not mean that ingesting robotics in any former any kind is not good it just means that the very hides robotics again typically found in prescription form or or capsid piliform probably your best reserve two cases where of course your doctor prescribes them you should always follow your doctor's advice but in cases where perhaps you are jetlag your traveling excessively of for any reason or working excessively you are not getting enough sleep or your diet is radically changed from normal and we talked about how increasing the amount of fiber in your diet might be useful for increasing fiber digesting enzymes and the assimilation of fibrous foods but that it is really the ingestion of fermented foods and in fact getting anywhere from four or even up to six servings a day of fermented foods can be immensely beneficial for reducing inflammatory markers in theboti and for improving microbioed a diversity all along the gut and thereby improving signaling and outcomes along the gut brain axis we went all the way from structure to function to the four kinds of signalling mechanical chemical indirect direct robotics fiber and fermented foods and i tossed in a little bit at the end there also about ways that you can make your own fermented foods at home in order to try an offset some of the costs also its deacon fun to do and some of those actually taste quite good i have actually found that o the fermented a souercrot they were making at home a actually rivals the saurcrot the you can by to of the refrigerated section of the grocery store and i am by no means a skilled cook or chef or and easily have no coronary skill whatsoever if i can do it you can do it i hope you found this information useful and perhaps also actionable one of my motivations for doing this episode was again as a primer for the episode with doctor just sonunberg where we go really deep into the up microfilm less into the up brain axis but really deep into the up microfilm what it is what it does what it does not do and some of the emerging findings from his lab that are yet to be published and i also was excited to do this episode because i think many of us have heard about the gutmycrobiom we hereabout these bacteria that live in our got we hereabout the gut brain axis or that ninety per cent or more of the ceremonial that we make is made in our got we her about the got is a second brain and forth but i think for many people they do not really have a clear picture of what they got mycrobiom is and the pathways and mechanisms my which it can signal to the brain into the other parts of the body i hope that to day's information at least improved the clarity around that topic and leaves you with the more vivid picture of this incredible system that is our gut brain axis if your enjoying and or learning from this podcast please subscribe t our tube channel that is a terrific

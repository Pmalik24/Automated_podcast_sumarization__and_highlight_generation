sash sponterbaks pressvepien thousands my listers have already secured this networkdata join them atexpressvy piandicom flashes according to the legacy media disaster is about two befall america donate trump is now the overwhelming favorite to win the republican presidential nomination the latest to join register and be s news pole shows trump at fifty one per cent in i up eight per cent since october he is gaining momentum on do mantis is in second place at nineteen per cent like hailed at sixteen per cent according to analyst strive cornaki is really good on the sort of tuff there is an enthusiasm gap in favor of trump seventy per cent of trump supporters say their minds are already made up in favor of trump his currently at seventy two percent favorability with wall calk's golfers and here is the thing in the general election trump is also up and he is not up by a small margin his up significantly donate trump if the election we hell to day would become president of the united states again according to a wallstreternal pole over the weekend trump leads bison forty seven per cent to forty three percent in the national poles if third parting into pending candidates enter that make that lead actually jumps two six points thirty seven per cent to thirty one per cent what's more according to the latest we amen pole trump leads jobidon bi ten points in michigan his by five in georgia according t the latest miniapolist post pole trump is down only three points to bison in mince soda in other words trump would likely win in a landslide worth election held to day had win georgia misconsin human pennsylvania human michigan there are two reasons for this first jobidon is terribly terribly in popular that them mallstreternal pole shows just twenty three per cent of voters say that bison's policies have help them personally compared with fifty three per cent who say that jobidons policies have hunted them personally that's a terrible staffer him those exact same data who half of voters say trumps policies when he was per cent helped them personally firs is only thirty seven per cent who say they hurt them personally bidet's job performance is at thirty seven per cent approval and sixty one per cent disapproval only three in ten voters couldn't quit bionomics literally the only issues where jobidon leads trump are on a portion and they are he only leads forty four per cent to thirty three per cent not a huge lead and tone in politics thirty seven per cent to thirty one per cent which means everyone hates both of their tone that condition as unlikely to alleviate for jobidon before the election it is according to the wall street journal quote less affordable than any time in recent history to buy a home the man is not changing any time soon how bad is it according to the wallstre turn quote be four of the feds started racing race a person with a monthly housing budget of two thousand dollars could a bout a home valued at more than four hundred thousand dollars to day that same bier would need to find a home valued at two hundred ninety five thousand dollars or less in a time of rising prices by the way average new home payments are up to three thousand three hundred twenty two dollars true one thousand seven hundred forty six dollars at the end of twenty twenty that is e ninety per cent increase in average new home payments since jobidon took office what is more been so posted off landing this thing where we bring down in elation the economy continues to sail along it does not look particularly likely to happen despite the happy talk from the media nonmember jobgrowth was week which was expected it is what the fed was actually looking for when they raised those interestrats in order to tampon in elation but here is the thing that jobgrowth was only even in week territory because of three sectors help are leisure in hospitality because we are going into the vacation days and government employment in fact those three sectors plus private education i payment air responsible for eighty one per cent of all jobs created in twenty twenty three that means that just those three sectors plus print education in loment that is all the job's cried in twenty twenty three when people say they are feeling it is week economy they are right business starts are week grow output which is a measure of the entire economy not merely these spending side that we seen gross domestic product and which can be jobs by government spending grow output has ben flat line in the first to quarters of the year business spending drops nine per cent there is a reason that warren buffet is pulling his winnings off the table brother halthaway sold twenty eight points have in billion dollars in stock in the first three quarters of this year buffet has a very simple strategy sell when he thinks the prices are too high he thinks stock prices right now are inflated and too high because they are now brain's team he's trying to whistle their way past the graveyard on his candidacy the literal graveyard he might die according to senators gunsmith at the white house holiday party where bison has a very easy job we you have to do it just say a couple of nice things bat how you have a contentious relationship wit the pass but the first men that really matters another of say some nice things about christian or something instead according to gunsmith quote bison straight into a couple of hazy monologues which ended only here his wife interrupted him to reminds him it was a party his speech was not terrible or even noteworthy said sbensmith but every one in the room realized been had a simple rhetorical job and had not quite pulled it off an that is a really easy job at a holiday party i been to white house holiday parties lemmtell you it is not a hard job but jobidon literally could not get through a holiday speech of the white house without doctor jill grabbing one f those old vaudeville canes in yanking him off the stage that holiday speech is super easy unenthusiastic democrats are now being force to defend this ailing octogenarian here is for example minis to government him walls it'll take your bind an a hundred over in hes gas waterage thereof because he is delivering well that might be o say for him to say except that everyone knows that jobidon is very unlikely to serve a full second warm not giving the state of degradation in which he currently is standing which leaves in the background down down don comely arris yes that horror music o you hear that is the undertakers music

expressive piazza come slash ben ill can back to coal prison dug gambol every single your that put out a conical message that makes no sent last year they put out of video about ho sonic was about love and light clearly demonstrating that the she knew nothing about the holiday or it is origins the actual story of conical is about religious news throwing hellanis gree cellaniss out of the temple and re consecrating the nation to he biblical gods very fundamentalists holiday but last night they really topped themselves they confirm they know nothing about conical with this insane post dugamhof put this up on twitter quote the story of sonic and the story of the just people has always been one of hope and resilient in the conical story the jewfish people were forced into hiding no one thought they would survive or that the few drops of oil they had would last but they survived in the oil kept burning during those eight days in hiding they recited their prayers and continued their traditions that is why sonic means dedication it was during those dark nights that the makes dedicated themselves to maintaining hope and faith in the oil each other and their nudism in these dark times i think of that story that is not even remotely the story of conical and mat's not even half said to the story of connicaisnot in the same even diagram that comely her's loves is the story of conical they haveyou n tout the oil story that is the rededication of the temple they find a canister of oil they have to re light the sonic minor atstetiou that the minor actually only has in the in the temple has four branches they relive the mora it last for eight days as opposed to lasting for one day but that's bout the rededication of the temple it was not dislike in hiding an a cave somewhere with a w what what in that what in the in the what these are the people who back up yobidan coma derris is his back of she is even less popular than he is that is reason number one why your bid is losing's don drums cause he is terrible and his back up his terrible but here is the thing the election is in h old to day and this brings us to the second reason that trump is leading jobidon in the poles right now he is not in the news that is also the reason that trump is up in iota head an shoulders above the rest of the candidate because he is not in the news he is beating bison ironically he is actually using bison's own twenty twenty strategy against jobidon it is donate trump was in the basement he is not running around campaigning he is literally either in court or back at farrago on truth social and that means have owns focuston bison and that means he is a head in the poles and that in turn takes the electability argument away from both eonian to sin nickel hailed which was their number one argument was that trump could not win nominate us instead because trump is not in the news everyone has been able to look away from trumps crazy which has always been his ackilliseol ironically one of the best things ever to happen to donate trump politically was his social media ban bees it made him nearly invisible on line the fact that trump actually put his own money in truth social an he does it on a lose that money which is the reason he has not gone back to act evenly been unhand on ex well that means than we are not treated to a small memo wild fire every time he tweets to he's on truth social ere he has seven people watching him as oppose to on twitter or he has seventy million people watching him mostly for donate trump truth social now acts the sort of venting t mechanism and everyone pretty much ignore it and by the way that is the best thing for donate trump over all here is the question will things stay this way maybe they will not because trump does not love being at the center of attention there is literally known who loves being the center of attention more than donate trump donate trump is conga west verses tailor swift at the crammers of a let you finish losing the selection but first but here is the doing there is literally nothing he can do to change anyone's opinion of donate trump everyone has an opinion of donate trump and there he note they think about dona trump what exactly could happen if he gets convicted did anyone's opinion about him change but here is the other thing elections are about enthusiasm this what democrats are counting on trump quid theoretically rein violate enthusiasm against him if he busts through walls a big orange coolly man o oh trump is already giving hints that he might want to do this during his recent interview with unhandy for example shown asked him if he would be a dictator it was a set up is a soft ball question because the entire last has been saying he is going to be a tyrannical dictator and shown was asking him are you going to do that and instead of just giving me obvious after which would ben ridiculous ridiculous they a let can a temp to say yes ism not dictator as president ready not a nomadic a not a dictate raedictator jobidon very easy answer instead donate trump because he is a performer and a compendium he played to the crowd another he trolled the media by saying he would not be a dictator except on dawn and what he mean is that mama and bison he would use a pen and a phone and he said that he would be a dictinerante one by closing the border for example using the pen in the phone it was a job but it also gave his enemies oxygen which is why yesterday trump had to actually explain that it was a joke he put out a truth social saying quote far news writer peter mama baker of the failing car times warship ins strip ions we tan from the good o tramples whose claim to fame is that he will never write anything good about the great job president trumped in quotes just wrote in a major from page story that i want to be stator but does not mention it was suddenly joking manner and completed with but onlyver a ben then a close the butter and go logo an much differ en attitude been o trump is right about all that but trump also has he nasty habit of just pouring gasoline on fires trumps enemies do have one playbook he will be a dictator i trump doesn't have to plans o that he might but that is their playbook is what all the brilliant minds in the democratic party and the media have come up with trumpeter small mustache funny hair orange man mousseline here was father loud yesterday on mason best doing this retire you'll true winds all the my states because he be lost nationally by four or five points in twenty twenty and barely lost the key states and that is what i think that biding campaign of needs to understand the course of this at some point the biting campaign at to let go o the idea of running this a reperendumon jo by a running it is a referendum on bionomics and turn this race to hearts of the choice tot presented before america it is democracy versus dictatorship an s your freedoms versus your o your loss of freedoms in the course of this including economic freedom in this o case that is the magic they have come up with his atonal trump is going to take away all of your freedoms to now this pringnot can work because who is president already but this in a be their playbook here as that why you professor ruth begat who is a scholar on fascism comparing true to bonito mousolini and and penuche bat we know crow i know from my studies a precuratarines an at its successful meters always have to have a powerful witness a and noisy bi the people in the toss to indite which trigratin his

joining galloot come slash chipper o gene again the narrative four democrats is going to be donate trump cannot be presidio because if he is he will be a fascist it money is jumping on that band wagon he has taken zero break from pestering on behalf of his own legacy by the way it money's leggashy now mounts to failed in thence he twelve against bracobama paved the way for trump tried to servant trumps administration was rejected and then joined with democrats on he measures in order to shore up he is failing legacy now part of his legacy is going to be apparently going on meet the pass and jabbering about how trump is a that too the republic or some such we have actually seen him do what he said he is going to do when he said that he believe the section with the electuary was going to be ragged before people actually went to the post he went on to question the results tried to overturn the result of the twenty twenty election why do not you take him exactly at his word ai i i think we agree that we have looked at his behavior and his behavior suggests the sis a person who will impose his will if he can o the judicial system on the let us say to branch about the entire nation m when he call people to come to washin yo see on canary six that washout a random date that was the at when peaceful trance fer of power was to occur he call that on purpose i he is no question he has authoritarian rulings an and interests and note notions which he will try and oppose i'lgete again that trump fashion argument is not particularly likely to work but there is one argument that theoretically coward nikehaly is articulating that argument that argument is the trump is unelectable because people perceive him as a chaos agent not that his unelectable because he is a terror of he is a fashioner or something that but because he is just too chaotic we a wan him here is nikihaly articulating that argument chis christy that he is on fit i wanted as put that directly to yo wan e yes her no to thin dona true to day and twenty twenty three is ti to president i it is not about i ta think hes to be present it shard he be president i do not think he so be president he know i thought he is the right present a the right time i greed with the lot of is pay the croblnas he we our country i tin is the right our world is on fire and you cannot ti ti tons prat can to the republican cops an dona trump been ta cars to not about in a it is us canon think hes the right person to be present it well that argument the trump is a was agent and only works under two conditions one is very likely to be filled the feeling the trump is in fact chaotic certainly tht'swhat the democrats in the biding done are doing this why their indicting trump over and over and over again on every crime from j walking to class documents miss handling to murder there is a reason that jack smith that canary six prosecutor wants his case accelerated yesterday the supreme court agreed to here smith's request to here quickly on drums own claims of immunity against federal trial over jaguar six trumpet saying because he was president during the entire period nonmember to canary of twenty twenty one because of all of that he is a mine against some sort of conviction or y even a trial that was rule against by anabobomapointod judge is been appeal to the d c circuit an now smith is going direct to the supreme court because he wants in answer according to the walker journal smith wants the court to take up the case before that lower appeals court even considers it allowing the justice is to squarely weigh in on when if at all drums trial shown move forward the special councils move came ten days after the trial judge presiding over trumps case the lined has bid to toss the criminal election interference charges rejecting arguments that he is immune from prosecution smith is asking the justice is to cut out the lower appeals court and rule directly on the matter his team quote to further the imperative public interest in a timely trial the government seeks a full and final resolution of the defender's claims that he his absolutely immune from federal prosecution for crimes committed well in office or is constitutionally protected from federal prosecution where he was impeach bet not convicted before the criminal proceedings began before the marked forth twenty twenty four trial day that is going to smith's team and the sprimcourt is likely to do that smiths team wants trump on trial an the on i on trial right now there hoping against tope that trump is going to eat all the headlines the jobidons bad performance becomes a secondary concern because trump is chaotic but even that eventuality and again it is very likely that trump will be on trial after losing this immunity appeal during there actual election cycle and by the way it is very likely he will be convicted some time in the midst of the section cycle it is also likely that that will not make bison's case the trump is a chaosaged in order for that to work bygone has to a your solid and non chaotic and that is not happening which brings us back to the poles in every election its have said over and over and over again every elections a rerun him on one of the two candidates the re run him right now is on bison barrings caticlismac collapse by trump or magical recovery by bison the underlying fundamentals of this race are likely to remain stable all the way up to election day which means that pulling advantage for trump is not a mere chimera it might just be twenty twenty for reality and that is why the media and democrats are panicking they really really should be a my in just a second we are going to get to the latest insanity from hazard university were cloudy in gay is going to survive being a horrible president plagiarism apparently being soft on antisera that she count survive a that pbecatiofs black lady an me let us be real about this will get to that momentarily first from maintaining control of your assets to easing the burden on your loved ones in a state plan can insure that your family stayed prepared and protected if you are looking for way

its rightful family to finalizing documents with a notary writing will can be expensive tedious trust and will makes it affordable and easy there is a reason they haven over already of excellent with thousands of five start f views on trust pilots secure your asses protector loved ones with trust and will get ten percent off plustreyshipping of your estate plan documents by visiting trust and will dot come slash upper that is ten percent off plusfreeshipping at trust and will dot come slash chipper o gas meanwhile over at hazard clouding gay looks as though she is about to survive a challenge to her leadership apparently the hazard word has now announced that the unanimously stand in support of clouding this despite the fact that over the past forty eight hours there been heavy accusations that she actually engaged in plagues and notches in her p h see dissertation but also all over the damned place according to the washington freebeacon hazard university present clouding game plagues numerous academics over the corse of her academic career at times airlifting entire paragraphs and claim them as are own work according to reviews by several scholars in four papers publish between ninety ninety three and twenty seventeen including her doctoral dissertation gay a political scientist paraphrase are quoted nearly twenty authors including two of her cliques and hazard universities to apartment of government without proper attribution according to the washing ton freebeakan analysis other examples of possible plagiarism all from gazes dissertation re publicized on sundae by the manhattan institutes christy for ruff and carlstack's cries brunet the freebeacon work with nearly a dozen scholars to analyze twenty nine potential cases of plagerisn most of them said that gay had violated a quart principle of academic integrity as well as halyard's own anti platuris an policies which state that it is not enough to change a few words here and there rather scholars are expected to cite the sources of their work including one paraphrasing and use quotation marks o according to erectly from others tut at least ten instances gay lifted full sentences or even entire paragraphs with trust a word or to tweaked this is devfinently plagiarism said lead just an a social psychologist at fuckers university who review ten side by side comparisons provided by the washington frebeakon including paragraphs from gazes dissertation teashop gave her a prize for that disdissertation for one word exceptional merit this is the longer passages are the most egregious but again none of that would have broken except for the fact that clouding gay went in fronton congress and made clear that she does not caravan antisemitism that at all depends on quote the context now again hazard university has one of most restrictive speech cots in america they will they will come after for fat phobia at hazard university but if you say from the river to the c palestine shall be free while waving around a commons flag everybody will apparently look the other way all of this despite the fact that the national association of scholars yesterday called on hazard to remove clouding gay as president of theuniversity they noted gaze shoddy professor professional work record of naturism and promotion of races policies that was has of yesterday and gain when it comes to cloudy gaze own upset over antisemitism its just absent it is not there one of the things that was amazing about watching the university presidents testifying from congress is even if they had said something listen we cannot do anything about speech that we do not but we really do not the speech it is ugly and it is wrong is tell has a right to exist as jewfish state and we hate all of this but we trot ward trying to draw balance if they would even said that that wouldhav been one thing ut they did not and here is the thing they say that kind of tub all the time for example in aril of twenty twenty one cloudyian gat signed to letter to the hazard community accusing america of racism and a crying the shooting death of madam to lead a who flash gun at the police what we is a community must stand against racism we must commit ourselves the unfinished work of building a just society one in which everyone is rights and safety u protected and everyone is dignity is honored in a system in which police ha vast discretion to stop people on suspicion o miner offense is many people in this country of color live with an ever present sense of vullnor it get what when when she is talking apparently about america racism then that is one thing now there is very passionate about that when comes to accusations ofvantisemitism on her own campus then it is all by the wayside now hazard tried to rely on academic freedom as the basis for why she should basically get off the hook shot free there is a petition the emerged on sundae from various members of the profisoriat urging the university to quote resist political pressure that are at odds of halyard's commitments to academic freedom bel let us be real about this thy not care about academic freedom at hazard there is two registered republicans on the entire staff at hazard university and n i went to hazard law ism just telling you there are no re public into staff in the lowball when i was there i think the number of registered republican to staff at hazard lawscool which had well over hundred professors twas three i could name them if the fact is that hazard is not a place of academic freedom ant never has bee a place of academic freedom in any serious measure but they ere lying on all that in order to protect t antisemite now naturally the hazard board stands in support of clad at they have to they have to she is a black lady and she is selected for this positions specifically based in herd i verse bonafieties meaning that she is a black lady and let us be real about this the reason that she was allowed to get away with this sort of shoddy work for years on end is because she had these shield of interosectionality if you are if you are an interjectional person meaning a racially diverse person who ranks high in the victim hood coalition then young get away with just about anything on a college campus that is the way this works if clouding gay we are a white lady and she been it with these charges of plagiarism as a student shroud have ben out she is been hit with these charges of plagiarism bet alone what she is doing as the actual pressing but now apparently they are going to defend the quality of her work that is way this works hazard university's board has now put out a stay and quote there members of the hazard community as members of the hazard corporation we today reaffirm our support for president gazes continued leadership of hover university our extensive deliberations affirm our confidence that president gate is the right leader to help our community heel and to a dress the very serious social issues wearefacing what were their extensive deliberations thy met last night those re their extensive deliberations many people have suffered tremendous damage and pain base of compass's brutal terrorist attack then the university's initial statement should have been an immediate direct and on equivocal condemnation calls fregenicide are despicable and country to fundamental human values president gay has apologized for how she handles for congressional testimony and has committed to redoubling universities fight against antisemitism that amazing they just rejected everything that she is done since october seventh and the they but the apology but she but why because the edifice of d i must upheld as we discussed at length yesterday the entire reason for being alive major america university liberal arts programs use to defend the idea that america is fundamentally unjust that the america meritocracy is fundamentally unjust this is why you need diversity equity and inclusion it is why you give people extra points on their application based on their race that is why you do those things is because the basic idea is that if you succeed in america society unless you are a member of an interjectionally oppressed group if you succeed it is because the system itself is broken and exploitative and we have to read jigger the system by providing benefits like say the presidency of hazard university to people who are not qualified for t apposition with regard to president gaze academic writings the university become aware in late october validations regarding three articles as a at president's gay request the fellows promptly initiated an independent re view by distinguished political science and conducted review of for published work on remember ninth the fellows review the results which reveal the few instances of inadequate citation while the analysis found no violation of hazard standards for research is conduct president games proactively requesting four corrections in two articles to insert citations and quotation marks that we are omitted from the original publications in this tumultuous and difficult time we unanimously stand support president gag at hazard we champion open discourse at academic freedom sure sure you do and we are united in our strong belief that calls for violence against our students and disruptions of the classroom experience will not be tolerated halyard's mission is advancing knowledge research and discovery they all help dress deep social issues and promote constructive discourse in that the key ward help address deep social issues the a had to keeper in place because america is bad america meritocracy is bad and because those things are bad she is unqualified and she is probably a patriot does not matter we are going to keep her in place to rectify those grave injustices of the passed that is the reason the harvarstickment that it'll be onisithum ism fine with them sticking with her the reason ism find them sticking with her is because i think the when these universities fired their president at to filly a then one my gill when at at university pansylania i thing it to filly thing now the ideas can o be they go back to the downers they say each look what we did we got rid they keep the entire system in place all the foundational d i principles that lead to antisemitism inevitably best again d e i is a conspiracy theory and it crosses streams withantisemitism again if the entire d e i theory is predicated on an oppressor oppressed narrative in which people who are successful are the oppressors and people who are unsuccessful are the oppressed news cannot fit into that narrative because they are both oppressed it generically speaking in terms of the number of t ms for example that they are targeted by antismat a cate crime in the united states way higher than any other group they are target for harass generally much higher than other groups in the united states they are targeted on campuses but they're also disproportionately successful and this means they do not fit ins that matrix they keep breaking the matrix and you keep breaking the metrics it turns out the people are gin have to shove you back in the box they cannot get rid of the antisemitism with out also getting rid of d e we and getting where to these presidents is a fillip it is a way for them to say walkway five the problem please bring back your hundred millionoledonation no one should be fool tom actually kind of please that hazard it just saying the apart out lot fine keep her there and halyard's one's and all of my fellow hazard along if you are unhappy with the way that president gay has handless perhaps you should look to the fact that the entire university is reflective of a system of values that made clouding gay the president that is the reason she is the president they are backing her be cause they supports her ideology and she is the president because she supports their ideology it is all of a piece and if they would fired her it would a changed nothing is again d i is honeycombed all the way through these administrations the number of d i autocrats on any giving compass is huge you may outweigh the actual number of faculty on many compasses billions of dollars every year or spent on d nonsense that is the actual ideology being promulgated at these universities and it is poisonous n it bleeds up ins things the white house or the white house now demand that equity be a part of every piece of policy that they make or the white house now has to deal with interns yelling at them over not supporting common enough understand whereas of this comes from it comes ionamat cohesive ideology about in internal revolution that has to happen in the united states it is why clouding gay is protected she cannot they cannot allow her to fall if they allow her to fall it is a rejection of the entire ideology upon which they predicate the university system if they used the black lady for not sufficiently fighting antisemitism that defeats the entire hierarchy f victimhood is that hierarch o victimhood boss to suggest that disproportionately in successful groups in the united states are disproportionately victims and disproportionately successful groups are disproportionately oppressors you cannot do it there is no way an get rata list gill because leismigles a whittled it cannot get her to clouding gay there is no way to do it without again defeating the entire purpose of your ideology in that interjectional coalition it is shockingly strong and bizarre constituted yesterday the a the brooklet bridge was shut down once again this time by queers for palestine and here is some footage of this men hayride argali one now listen that chap there for second actually mean something and this is the same ideology promulgated on america college compasses an why it k k k idea you are all the same for stall dos rime but putting aside the lack of lyrical interpretation that says it all understand that the people who hate israel on college campuses that the left that hates israel they hate america for the exact same reasons there is not a single rash anal they use for they hatred of israel that does not apply in greater detailed to america when they say for example that israel is a colonialist pressure when they say that it is a foreign imposition on native soil what you think they think about america white i again was colonized it was a european colonial mission what a they thing that mat when they say that the if is brutal

e craned that they're seeking all they would have to do is solidify the border and they will not do it it is absolutely insane right now in the situation you crane is in fact prettydire hoiden is hosting lodgers lens at the whorehouse again to day discussions on u crane eight dillremain stalled in congress according to siamang the visit which hothouse an on sundae is olenskys stor visit to washington since the war in e crane began he last visited in september zolensky's visit comes at a critical moment in congressional negotiations for emergency aid to u crane all of this is coming amid the fact that crane their offensive his easily stalled out according to n your times america and cranial military leaders are searching for a new strategy that they can begin executing early next year to revive that keeps fortunes and flagging support for the country's war against russia according to us in cranial officials the push for fresh approach comes after you cranes months long counter offensive failed in itsgol of retaking territory lost to the invading russia army and after weeks of coffin tension counters between top america officials and their eucranian counterparts preside en vlodimers leaky youcrane arrived in washington money for those meetings with pressman bison and congress now again t republicans are hesitant to send good money after bad at this point or good money after good depending on the situation right now one of the problems that is facing the west is that a bunch of stockpots have ow been depended according to the waster journal the brutish military has only around one hundred and fifty to ploybletanks perhaps a dozen serviceable long range artillery pieces bear was the cover last year the brutish military con ordered sourcing multiple rocket launchers from museums to upgrade and do not ate to you crane that is how bad the short coming and all of this is based on the odd western fixation with the idea that the cold war was one purely through moral suasion i suppose o a giant military builds up that the west participated in for fifty years and after the cold war was over basically all the western countries cut their military's eating pretty dramatically in the united states every democrat cut the military dramatically eve republican try to rebuild the military every democrat then came back in and cut the military again were seen this over and over and over again and then it turns out that when you need it the cupboard is kind of bare you crane war is just exposing that it is not is though you crane is the reason that the cupboard is bear you crane is just the reason the the cupboard is bare big at before the cupboard was clothed now the cupboard is open looking around there is nine of fork over there france has through the ninety heavy artillery pieces equivalent what russia loses roughly every month on new crane battlefield denmark has no heavy artillery some marines were air defense systems germanous army has nigh am for two days of battle in the negate since the end of the cold war week and european armies were towery by government across the west because men en gaged america with it is vast military muscle underpinning of the dato and defense policy in rope yous accounted for nearly seventy present of natives defend spending last year but as america moves more isolationist everyone is realizing that do they completely defenistry de army themselves they defend themselves anchovy can professor of worstudies to university of warrosist rope has systematically to militaries himself because they than to spend the money meanwhile the united states is of course ponying up the bulk of support to you crane everybody should realize tat the world is very dangerous place they should start building up those stockpots pretty much immediately anchovy blinking for his part he is playing unit understand what what game the democrats replaying here they want the aide for you crane they can get the aide for you crane all they have to do its sign on to some strength and word provisions and they will not do it instead they seem to be involved in this idea that they let you crane wither on the vine and maybe make them subject to another push from russia into cranial territory long as it means blaming the re publicans for it which is really kind of insane first vault's bad political calculate to biding thinks that losing the war in you crane is going to not renown to him that twill re down to the republicans good luck with that arguments that is not going to work the america are going to a tribe forgot policy failures to the president especially a president ho is already engaged in the single worst act of for policy to a lection of my lifetime the botched pull out from from afghanistan sorn came they think tor plan here is twenty blinking yesterday saying tat he is word you cranage will run out a with help up you crane how concerned are you about that with winter coming on a very concern a we need to see this supplemental budget request go through as quickly as possible a you crane has done an extraordinary job in defending against the russia aggression of the past hers taken back pay he fifty per cent it wit is territory it is engaged in a ferocious a battle right now along the eastern and southern fronts a we are running out of a resources already in the bank to continue to as system and we need them i would point out as well that about ninth per cent of this curitiousnysness that we provided crane actually is invested right here in the united states mean give used to question then why do not you see on to the word provisions unless your playing some sort of stupid game here which democrats are here is chuckhole er sent majority the tear playing these to begin yesterday the ones is on republicans to show they are willing to moderate let me say that again if republicans keep insisting on donor trumps border policies then they will be it fall when a deal for you crane israel and humanitarian ate to gods of all full of par republicans would be giving gladimmere queen the best gift he could ask for democrats are serious about reaching reasonable by partisan compromise to pass this package thequestion is if republicans in unwilling to do the same well ism in the real question is will not you compromise on the border even democrats on the born wily got compromise on the border according to seep yes news a remote decor region long the son then border has becoming makeshifts international arrivals area for toucans of migrant from africa aria and satin a america hoping to work and reunite with family members in the united states over the past few days large groups of migrant men women some families it children have spent the night in a makeshift stage ground an this rugged section of us medical border waiting for overtax border officials to process then many expect to be released into the us after being vetted by boy by local border patrol agents lack the resources in man power to screen every one in a timely manner migrants are setting up fires at night an the early morning hours to keep warm amid dropping temperatures many brought blankets to sleep next to the border wall without toilets they relieve them selves near the cacti that adorn the picturesque landscape of his national monument located two hours away from the closest u less city the way to be process with long in recent days the medical families and merchants travel regularly to the station grounds sell drinks and food hoping to convinced deeper newcomers o buy their credos smells and cups of coffee from the other side of the border wall and yet the the bydemnistration does nothing they are saying that if anything is done on the border that they will basically sink its senator names languor a vocalhomites that guides you are not kin to get your new cranefunninguless you do something about the word o the borders chaotic and he is obviously correct we have got to be able to have a change in policy on the run now they cushion polish really a political cushion over than is anything else if o to to just about any one in the country outside of kachina the see they would say the border is chaotic rid now wave the highest number of crossings how any september ever last september the highest october ever the highest nonmember ever and we had the highest single day just this last week it his literally sparling out of control he is right of course and everonows the democrats notice republicans notice everyone knows this but apparently the by administration you rather weave the border open and let you ran fall to russia rather than just giving republicans what they want on the border it is unbelievable it is such political malpractice mean forget about the policy stupidity of it which is unbelievably stupid on both counts it is political malpractice to believe that republicans are going be the ones who suffer at the ballad box if the border remains open and new crane falls to russia of course batons can be one who suffers this i insane it is ridiculous and stupid just one second we are going to get to is real and the latest over their first everything is not cocker it is a bran new so that we put out on you to with bet cooper this pass pecan well i mean if you have seen this video you'll have seen that staff jeffrey

because public opinion is very prohistrael the media seem to believe that the best move for jordan on israel politically speaking would be decide with compass i do not even see how that applies it is ridiculous to me is the idea that he is suddenly going to uptick in michigan bi ten points if suddenly he sides of compass it is not going to happen he is down ten points in michigan why because he is deeply unpopular you no it actually is kin of popular in the united states as i turns out israel according to a bran new wall street journal poll it finds that fifty five per cent of those pull say they believe israel is taking the military action needed to defend itself and prevents another attack by commas only twenty five per cents of respondents say israel military action is just proportionate and going too far forty two per cent o voters say they sympathize more with his rail is compared with just twelve per cent we said the same of palistinians jobidens marks for his response to the war remain at thirty seven per cent we because his approval ratings at thirty seven per cent you could literally say do you prove of jobidon's policy on toilet paper everyone just con to gull thirty seven per cent yes that that it is is simple as that when youth thirty seven per cent approval rating it is very difficult to exceed that rating on any particular issue very very difficult to do that but the media been attempting to push this idea that if jobidon suddenly flipped on the israelvers's compass war suddenly his numbers would up tick actually it is the opposite if security is restored in the idle east and it is not a headline by the time we hid election season that is on a redound to bison's benefit he is going to look somebody mellowed israel to destroy commas and reestablish deterring in the region that is can be the actual outcome but if you allowed israel to be victimized again by compasses because ball up in the north which by the ay is gin be the next step israel cannot let it is got thirty thousand citizens israel in the north of its country are not living in their homes right now israel cannot allow those people to go back to their homes until husbelize pushed off the border there is now a large skew push by israel in by the way france other members the internatural community to push is ballet in active terrorist group out of southern lebanon out thirty miles up toward root me ebony's government some members ebony's government which is dominated by hisbalac even they are saying a may behave bless pull back or the idea f might be marching through bayroute in the next couple of sons but again one o the things that is amazing is the is the break down the partisan break down here do you sympathize more with these rally or palestinians democrats seventeen per cents is daily twenty four per cent palestinian that's an amazing statistic how you sympathize more withe group of people who have elected come ass and palsinian authority an we by polling get support october seventh by leaps and bounds over the democratic country that has human rites involves with it that that iran amazing thing forty eight percent o both sides equality is waving out to one to answer the question republicans the answer is sixty nine per cent israel two per cent palestinians seventeen per cent both equally for independent thirty five per cent say israel eleven per cent say the palistinians even mong young people a plurality thirty one per cent say the support israel over twenty three per cent for the palistinians undecided voters for the most likely to say that yours is doing too much for these daily government in to little for palistinians begin the this notion that somehow jordan is going to win additional votes if he suddenly flips insides if compass is at ridiculous i think began knows that he weirdly enough maybe it is because don is out of it but hes actually is not two online when he blows his teem to be twelve onus very bad for him he is actually not been two unlike on this particular issues yesterday at the holiday party i he suggested openly that he was finish which there a lot i turns out i know that dynast is cold for new for a lot o people who hate news turns out that a lot of people or ironist for not tough namely any one who believes that israel has a right to exist as a jewfish state is a pianist thou include jobidon a or in i a e e e the do don cob glia e you e par my ta on o par the country when not thirty giesgi sad do not had to be e begin on sin on yon he is correct about all of that now whit is amazing is again the amount propaganda of being put forth by the legacy media about this conflict is truly astonishing and an people are buying ins it for example the jordanian for minister presented ism on alsophidi yesterday he give a speech in which he suggested that israel was creating hatred around the region your right guides until until israel lignin to got there is no hatred which is we an october sevens the most juseroslaughterd since the colugos other than that nailed t also i got a say being lectured the west being lectured about treatment of israel by the garnanians is astonishing especially with regard to treatment of the palestinians just retrace jordanian history jordan is creation of the brutish mandate they have no relationship with the people they govern the kingdom of jordan not only that not only are they also a colonial a colonial outpost of israel is the gordanian kingdom had sovereignty over the entirety of idea and maria the west bank and east jerusalem from nineteen forty eight nineteen sixty seven and they never once considered the possibility of crating a separate palace inion state heard that why because they knew that if they did that it might topple their own dynasty they also have refused multiple times overtures from israel to hand over control of some of these areas to the jordanian government why because they understand that the palcinian population in these areas is incredibly radicalized and hates them as much as it hates the mucus by meanwhile you got the gordanian government sitting aside lecturing everybody is just the hypocrisy the madeleast is truly an amazing thing hero is that's greet tat among topic the good on is is is begin the good begin tunorations will come an therefor it certain its on peeled is much's e taste into e gets o thegn this is a war that is coo to be one this a war thatcannot be want it is going to be one by israel and by thewy again this see y they are creating hatred let me show you some tape of a compass leader in gaze ay here is the common leader an gassy explaining his agenda i will translate m there are news everywhere we must attack every new on the far of the planet we must slaughter and kill them god willing enough of being angry we are but up already ready to exiveglowd i knew the people of the west bank how long will you keep silence a trying to initiate there in their we want to see give they cost five shekel how much is a news throatworth five shekels or even less god willing o you all of our people are ready to glow up wee build a new factory for explosive belt the offers which is ready for the moment we enter prison by the way is why israel stripping them down say the fence aria our sisters are ready the offonswitch all our sisters are ready to carry an explosive belt we will open up a gateway or two in every camp along the border and we will continue to arassesrael in till we reach you this is why lifting the sieges better for you israel otherwise you will be killed by all you'll be killed with our explosive belts we have build en factories four explosive belts operating factories we will hand them out to every one and send them on their way no water expostbolts no negotiations note recognizing israel we will never recognize israel man it is it is i wonder what the context is for the university president there must be some contact that makes the acceptable after all the media again continued to do the work of commas this is their favorite thing to do their latest attempt is they have in a piece in the new york time in the washington post rather by a person in a ten abusaif the author of six novels and the minister of culture for the palcinian authority in the west bank he has a piece to day tatlcood my gas house felt a castle now it is rubble the house were grew up where i was born was destroyed a little over week ago no one was inside the time these really istle sit flattening it into a perfect pa l of rubble in losing my family home have lost a little part of me well maybe the reason that nobody was in the home is cause israel warned every one to get out before they hit it and maybe the reason israel hit it and was standing five minutes go is because israel the worst tear tact since the holiest but that is entire pieces about the the sadness of the family home being lost now at no point does any one note that this ate abusive character who again is the minister of culture for the palsignan authority which is hilarious but the assignor authority has a minister of culture because at the when you think of a a governmental entity that promotes culture do you think of the palestinian authority ism fuck a point out in twenty fourteen save said quote israel surpassed hitter's massacres y calling israel anti sadist and factious for it is military response to rocketing from gossip we are letting israel off lightly that is we said in twenty fourteen comparing israel to the basis in went not to day in twenty fourteen these are the moderates being quoted by the washington post ye you wonder we america sympathize with israel maybe it is because those are the people

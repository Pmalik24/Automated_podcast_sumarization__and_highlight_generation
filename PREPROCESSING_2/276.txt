incredible story of kidnapping and intrigue and being torn apart and thrown back together and years of dreaming about escape from the kidnapper will at the same time convincing the kidnapper that what they really want to do was stay with him nancy dyke has the story the woman who was kidnap was a famous south care an actress named chazan he i read a book about it by writer and film produced her

seventieth she was put on a boat and a boat went to campo harbor and north care and she actually has a photo which as in the book of her very first meeting with kimjongel he was there waiting for her off the not wire the photographer and they ad lithographer take a photo an and then sender to her as till one a remember this exactly remember that time and he is men time had your kidnapton brought to me and s the terrible picture and his beaming and smile and she's got her face covers for years her family and her country did not know where she was this happened in nineteen seventy eight cha was in her fifties and her first sickening guess as to why she had been taken was at him joyed had brought her to north care to be a mistress for his father the great leader cam ill sung who was ruling the country at the time but no it seemed that kimjonyel himself was just a very big fan of chaise movies he put her up in a fancy villa surrounded by walls and bared wire and arm cards she called it in her memoir less vagus meets vlatabostac him jowl brought her out to display at parties that was has life for five years until one particular night and one special party the had been there for a while and she was standing in a somewhere in a enter of the room and she was used to these parties by this point exactly they e routine a she would started for feeling repulsed by then but people got drunk and groped women and than they went on forever and somebody had already told her that you notice is going be such a great evening for you and she nodded along because she was used to sort of my purely about everything the had no idea that kimjonel that night was planning to show off for the first time another person he had acquired the man who had direct end or produced almost all of chaise movies her ex husband chinwag rock shin and cha e did not know that the other was also in the country chin had been brought there the same way chat was but he tried to escape twice he was thrown in a prison camp for a couple of years the best way to thescrime chin seven spellers a sort of good comparison o senses while he made films that were very good very commercial very popular and also produced other people's films had his own studio and he was the most powerful popular fell nicer and south care arguably in all of south stasis from most o to sixties an into the seventies and chin today's drive that as you million prison camp carrel's for ten days an fella de fattened them up treacherous storm to had he arrives at the party when it is already you no in full flow and he walks inside and as soon as he enters there is applause an what an insane thing and exaysago you are in a prison camphor walk and you're the life of the party he wens applauding exact in in the pictures you w his face to look a mediated you can tell he s gone through something terrible to see down fit now cha does not see chin come in she just hears people start applauding and chat is sort of even on faced by this you anytime cam does anything people get up an applaud to she don't know why people were plotting chili gentile somebody you ka says why do notion look happy looks here and she turns around and it spent five years chins got the marks of having band torture in a prison camp she does not recognize him right away and and from that point on him jungle was pulling them together an and i sort of shell shocked hugged one another and and whit and moved around you know blocking in in a movisin back him hung ill a what night stand here sit here and here you stand next to me smile to the cameras you now they were sorts of the the guests of honor famous people do not get depict their fans him john ill was ta superman who was also unfortunately the son of the all powerful leader of a totalitarian state shin and chat had made their best movies together him loved their movies and he wanted them to be a couple just they were in their hay day he arranged it parent trapstyle he told them at the party the guess what he had a newly remodeled villa for them that they would be living in from now on together making a joke i think he said something an the newly way organ bought to be alone now an what a were and had them taken to a car and by all accounts seemed extremely pleased and expected them to be equally and and it is it is the the moment right after that when the went back to the villa close about this door turn the falsetto on to took an order to li write privately they turn the fosses on to they can whisper and exit of a private contact and they just asked one another what had happened wan a the way she described to is for the lovely moment which she asks him a happened to you and he said a lot it'll tell you some other time an and he ask how a happened to you and she says a lot it'll tell you some other time and you a chin and have gingerly and asked her you looked very smile and happy and i just have you been brainwashed and and she made a joke about how the director can you recognize acting any more any sort of both of them were finally able to be cabin with some one and and they spent the next several hours going through everything chin and chat made a long turn plan in a short turn plan long turn they were going to escape but they would wait till they could do it right they would not be caught their short turn plan involved a small taperquarter which they were able to get because one of the weird privileges of their captivity was that they were allowed to shop at a department store that sold things that were out of reach for most people on the country taperquarters him johngill had long and short turn plans of his own for them he told them that soon he would summon them to talk about his vision for their future then seven months went by and during those months chin and cha spent hours nearly every week and kid's huge film arrive he wanted chin and chat to see it and be impressed and they were i did not just love their movies he loved all movies it was against the law for ordinary north careens to watch foreign films but him had set up a massif bootlegging operation running in countries all over the world he could build up his private collection with every movie ever made or as close as he could get the arrive was three stories high and heavily guarded at least two screening rooms all for him only and now for chin and chat him was bowled over by every detail the to way the building itself was set up to run and and you know it admiration over how him had set up his own arrival and how well everything was kept seeking out over the a conditioning sat things and how he was preserving the steroid and how everything was catalogue than the staff and how large it was how as it categorized was it by year or by gonna or by director and went by country first and i think hey went by year as they got the in and and there is that lovely watch where the south mean films in a kind of normal air conditioning room and and the north great films an a must lavish store an screening rim n all bill ding the films were dubbed into careen after being painstaking i transcribe sometimes by america there was an america defector he was one of several actually who would been there since nineteen sixty five and one of his jobs was transcribing america films but just by listening because he was not allowed to watch them yet and he would not know that they were films because they gave him any other america factors the audio for some reason they chopped up the filmsantracts into the fervent bits in the long orders that hey would not no i get they en doing exactly enjoy them but he had this experience of of in a transcribing him an sunny realizing why this is ma point in an chasten dozens and dozens of hours watching one move after another in the screening rooms that the film arrive and in their villa which was also outfitted to show movies they do that for months until finally they got word him is ready to meet with you they went and they brought the tape reporter and the second they walked in and chat had the tapequarter and her a perse an try flirted on and i think unexpectedly kimdrungel just talked at them mostly for two hours n a him ring spoke very very fast and his mind out of went all over the place and he had a very intimidate thing wat the slash body guard who kept walking in to to refill drank and empty ash trace chin and cha wanted to record him for two reasons first they knew they might not be able to escape maybe they would be killed and their children and friends would just never know what hid happened to them or according if they could smuggle it out would at least be proof of where they would been the second reason to record him was that they knew that him would insist they say publicly that they had come to north care on their own voluntarily chin and chat were hoping that in their private conversation him might admit to having had them kidnapped and brought to him and he almost almost did by making a joke in the first couple of minutes of their conversation him talked about how he brought cha over first in order to entice chin to north care i say joke because him laughs as he says it and then all three of them lac it is tyrant management one o one the laughed you laugh the rest of what him said in that conversation well he said a lot of things but the main thing was north care and movies are bad and i am sick of it they were making the same film over and over again and that they were too long and to boring and history lessons and and to to the dramatic and and says there is too much crying at in tell anybody but in much crying kimono yet told shin and chat that he knew he was the only person in the country who could get away with saying what he was saying and he told them not to repeat any of it he said when it comes to movies we are in kindergarten and other countries south career are in college he said if we do not catch up in the next ten years our movies are going to be the worst of the worst movies in the world the problem he said just between us is the people in north care had it too easy they had things handed to them e have to hostile shin and chased there is a point an ta this wet he tells them that e no an i think in e says i parties the bay says not there is no incentive and socialism tginubet ay hid an as might might screen writers i at they will right something they will get their anions a the other is make a film tot at their passions i the capsid no matter what they that ate turn out that the work exactly follow orders i any this very conscious that in i needs some one he he bushes himself more than that who is use to having to do more than that the earnest keep him john yet never mentioned another possible reason why north creeps movies were wooden and unambitious fear he him john will had written the book the only book in north care about the right way to make movies and think about movies it is called on the art of the sinnama it is still in print every one involved in nor crews film industry in the nineteen eighties had to have been aware of the potential consequences of doing something as unpatriotic or insulting as trying to realize their own independent artistic vision without kid's explicit blessing and his fathers it was better to be crappy than sorry the conversation continued chin and chat murmured that north area's citizens were fortunate to have a comrade leader who understood film well him on will agreed with his permission the three of them got into croaking specific films a north free an one called the starve care and while they were at it a soli at film called mother hat had a dying scene they all agreed had been atrocious they were three move lovers talking about what they loved and him on all's big plan for shin and cha was that he wanted them to make north careen movies good that they could compete with films coming out of the west and when awards and be shown in theaters all over the world he wanted chat to act to the movies and chin to direct them chin could have his own film company just he used to have chin wanted to call the company shin film a very bold request in the circumstances he can nothing in north we had been called anything other than e knot the work is paradise trays at a part he this at a supremely this or no kimilsong university i was at big kill but us also in very telling of shin that even in this several situation his first instinct is o kicocokabut can not give the company my name inn in film nor some one is always using somewhat and often people are using each other and we do not find out till the end who gets away with what chin and chat knew that their only chance of escape would be to convince him john ale to let them film and work in the west him john ill knew that if he wanted good movies he had to give shin and cha enough freedom to create them all three of them wanted to make great movies but same bed different dreams him angel won end the films for his own purposes and need of the films they get away from him and it almost his ambition of making film with the world of respect completely overtook any sense of logic the first fission and chat am she had sequences that they shot and east in rope standing in for the vague and you now tho showed him doing el the film am he said this is fantastic it is a european film it is the best thing we've ever made glad him t start showing it and i never cross his mind that they had done exactly what he would forbidden his own film makers to do for ever for reason they been forbidden to show the world outside north care they showed people things that they had not been able to see you n almost in a lifetime for some people in north care about nineteen eighty three nine into for and a seconds that film sir playing in minimal in north care you know the north green audiences did not take in necessarily the hirproduction values am all they could talk about was that first ten fifteen minutes shot on the streets of plague where you know they wait the buildings look amazing people walking into business as they'll dress differently withal cars wet that is what we had an impact because up until then they had been told you are to luckiest people in the world you know the workers paradise is the only place in the world of people have peace and freedom am and and suddenly they saw that that was not true how do that the were people thought i was lucky enough to an meets and speak to people who would escape from north care who were i know caring ages that the time at they were able to waste films am and as another at german researcher and in japan cold the hands changer who ton quite to love told to the fact was about the same thing and as one of the things that is fascinating is that shin and chase films had a huge impacts straight away you the ouldoven people an relates thirties who would never seen anything of the outside world they had not been filter but he was not just the people suddenly were able to see footage of the outside world but you noshing and cha made am a filmdom love love my love which was literally the first love story and north care an culture post nineteen forty five there was not about love of the leader a love of the party was liters the firs some people able to go tote senior and see something those about two people falling in love and knot was the first time i poteen ages had pictures on their wall of of a meathead of anybody other than the leaders shin directed seven films for kimjaniel and then in march nineteen eighty six he and cha went to a hotel in sienna for some film business manage to grab a separate taxi from their north green minders sped to the a embassy and ran in they were briefed by the s a a and later by south care an intelligence and they were interviewed by the fashion post and other media outlets and stories about north care are always hard to fact check for parts of shin and chase story they recollections their interpretations are all there is but the movies exist the costing of him exists him denial had told shin and cha in the recording that when people asked them why they were in north care they should say freedom for true artistic freedom for chin there were some bitter truth to that because south care at the time shin an cha were kidnap had been a military dictatorship with very heavy handed censors shin studio had been shut down by the south careen government in nineteen seventy five his career was in ruin s in north care shin got to make films again he wrote unabashedly in his autobiography how much he had loved making movies there shin always spoke of north care as the place where he con of a that the place he associated film freedom with and create freedom worth because he can ask for anything and gat a you know he asked and one upside he he we asked for and a model train to blow up for a scene an he was given a real train packed with explosives on rails to blowup if he wanted to and if he asked for a whin machine he sent helicopters and if you not a fakes know had better flown to a mountain you is no expense fare you not cimdringi felts the larger than life film producer they hereabout and he did not have the downsides that if for producer usually has because if how products yes tray no every now and we do not have enough money we dill have enough time sin in jay had remarried in worth care it kimjenials suggestion and it edit of being a real marriage they were together till shin died in two demand six these seem to have been each others big love in life besides movies although shin love movies more than chased maybe a lotmore and there shared memoir of their time and an north career it goes from his voice to her voice back and forth and count of the second they star making films her voice kind of disappears entirely and it is all his from then on and etna it is about escaping but in equal measure at about making the films almost of the the is writing a memoir of his time and hollowed or something has eighty eight years old living in south care when pal was were searching his book he interviewed her for it and he asked her about shin and the movies they made in north care and and you known i modern spoke tore he could sense the impatience that she had had been able to get out of there three years earlier an no mate any of the films she had been very happy to do and him not mom and him not much even great love cannot protect to you from the other person wanting what they want

ora jessamine goes home to new mexico but she just cannot let this go she still dealing with the fall out fighting with hurts and a few other places over bills and she decides to do a bunch of things that most of us would not do first newsman sends a letter to errands admass saying basically i know it you did and here is what it is done to me she includes an envois for twelve hundred dollars the total cost of her round trip flight to californium combined with an hourly write for her time and then months later jessamine finds herself back in san francisco for work and she picks up errand's trail again she has a list of old addresses grand of get maybe twenty of them she got from a private investigator and she starts going from place to place visiting errand's old apartments at one point newsman pulls up to this gorgeous building overlooking the abridge at the time newsman was seven months fragment and she thinks well maybe i can use this to my advantage i went to the front ask the

not live there any more sun jessamine took a few pictures inside the building and then moved on to the other addresses all of them were deadens n mean i there any part of you that kind of feeling a creep i knew it was crate i knew thug it was not healthy i did know that but i could not let it go as just something that some one did to me that i had no control over newsman hates feeling she is lost control and whenever it happens ever since she was a teenager she is dealt with the same sort of way when she was around eleven her dad o band in the family her malm and her three longer siblings then they lost their house and for a while they all lived in a van with her cat and dog her dad he did some pretty extra things my a tried have me kidnapped but he tried to kid that few er sent some one t he tried to have some one coming i didn't me at my school and then again later in apart and and my family we ended up going for o some time up to canada that he could not find us later jessamine's malm got really sick and suddenly she found herself taking care of her entire family at some point as a way to deal with all the choose she started taking pictures things an ambulance driving her mam away screening matches between her sisters trash strewn all over their trailer home she methodically document when she was going through and it gave her a sense of control she continued to use her camera that way is in a dust at one point eight years ago she had a brief scare that reminded her of her dad a random incident r she wondered if he was following her again from that night on i had not i my had i wanted to find him but i did not want to find him and talk to him what is something that you wanted just i wanted to see him i wanted to first just find him i just want to now if i could find him i did i did bunch of searching and back on chanson gouglestuff and he was about the and half hours north of where i lived desman was living in garland at the time and her dad was just north of her living in a condo on the medicine o coast she started making covert trips up there she never knew how explain this to her friends she kept at simple and told them oh ism going to spend the weekend with my dad which technically was true just that she did a wearing a blondwig and from a distance why ta tellphotolandars really far away i was out in the woods i could get a mile or if i needed to om what did you see he was on the deck he was out for walk he would go to the him taking out the trash he never saw you no no when you are stocking your dad of your following your dad subserving him observing him what did that feel felt really good to see him and him not now i was there because we am because i had some knowledge about who he was and what he was doing it was a one way mirror om i could see and and he could not see me and it felt i had some kind of power i do not know much about the identity that business but ism guessing that the ideal target does not on a camera that can photograph you from a mile away two years after jestaman got that phone call from the police she was still trying to track er and down and in february two the s and thirteen her private investigator let her know that he found errand she was back in jail and about to be released jester went with him to a jail and down town san francisco she brought a telephoto lens in e video camera then two of them sat around in is ass you v for hours waiting her meet i had a contact told the moron might come out the back fully one by one people were coming out and the entire time ism just photographing i just lens pointed at the door and terrified that she is not in e come out has not to come out were not con finder and we see her greenheart walked right past her car she he a couple bags hanging off her shoulder and she was dressed just siren thought ut she was going to a night club time locks her shiny pants and wedge boots immediately i thought only gosh we we do kind of look similar she was a similar bill to me which is sort of tall is i sevenfivy but no fuller figure wider hips and i could see that she had a roundish face i do and she has this bright orange hair and i just thought of my days and my teenage ears dying my hair that exact orange this superbright orange and i just felt this uncanny connection to her i really did and then from there on for the next several hours with just a drew o o than two other pies working with them and super car they all trail therapy whose first stop was a convenient for we she went into my cigarettes an the lighter she hung outside for a few minutes noting then on a public bus array got off right in front of a good millstone walked in right away piece says jump out and going there go after and is oh she take her i a like i thin thinking oh of he is a note o do not talk to her just just go in get your photographs get a good look at her just go cococotand i jumping out freaking out on ma body just leaving me here with her what i and then i see of a angel in there the other p ye i oke ism looking at them for kind of use and they are not remotely giving me any kind of use and then i just go for it and i go up to her and i do not say anything to her i just stand across right across the rack of clothes and the good will from her as she is going through pulling clothes all looked changing her mind very expressive oh now i would never wear that like a kind of cure in my mind what she might be thinking from her expression and i mat an angle where i feel she cannot really tell what ism doing made ism just checking my e nail or something ism just looking at my phone and i take some photos of her but how nervous are you being you are literally now you are face to face ism shaking ism very nervous definitely and i think there is a part of me that is still thinking i could just talk to her rate now errand he errant i could just say that i i could her myself sang grin heart am i know you pow we do not recognize m i knowing do not know me am but am lure old musclemen level a and you used my idea to do a number of things but i just the the power for me was in seen her without her knowing that i was seen her then she disappears into the into the dressing room and that is when the mother pan comes over to me and says she stealing clone own an one to i just needed to get out of the i was overwhelmed i was feeling really is feel really sad for her and i did not want to feel sad for her i wanted to feel angry at her it was hard to maintained the anger because she was looking at errand and remembering things she would done when she was young and her family was broke i had shop lifted nice cheese or i literally stole the cocoa things that i thought and associated with class middle total upper middle class and i think that is what really was giving me the sympathy for grand heart was i could identify in away with the desire to be some one else i could see how a path in my life could have led to my beat in that moment i i really could but it was i guessed a little disappointing i could guess it was a little oh i kind o wanted it to be she was a criminal and did sonetheg fad to me and it just was not that non of that satisfaction of i got her it was just sure of this weird its transition and anger was starting to be sort of replaced with empathy what jussamen did new does not sound empathetic at all when he first hereabout it but for hussar then it was the logical end of her search she went through the hundreds of images she taken and she put together a gallery exhibit it had survellant shots of grand the court summons place reports bills and pictures of places where her idea had been used she done this once before with the surveillance motive she took of her at in fact her wallet was stolen while she was setting up that exhibit which is what sent her down the habit hole of trying to find grand in the first place she called the new show dear grand heart an one of the ideas on display with a sealed letter and a plumy glass box she asked the people at the gallery to give it to ran if she ever showed up there it was not a dramatic letter just a way of telling grand that she would been looking for wan to talk jessamine did not see putting bran's name an photos out in public as for venge but not every one sought that way you are victim of inanity that whit o

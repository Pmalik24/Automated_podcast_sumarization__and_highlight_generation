her there many i revere if you heard our show last week that i had just learned hours before we proud cast at episode that i needed to go into quarantine because guy who i had chicken hands with five days before that developed sometimes and then tested positive for coroniirus it is now twelve days since i shook hands with that guys and have not developed symptoms see see god find say that it can harem up to fourteen days i am nearly in the clear reminded at everybody that people who do not have symptoms can to be carrying the virus and give it others anyway the world has changed a much right one of the striking things about this coronipirus is how differently it effects different people some people who get it have no symptoms or the get mild symptoms or they experience something a bad fly that is particularly young and healthy people though young healthy adults are not mum the c d see a put out a report this week may be saw this saying twenty per cent ha hospitalizes cove nineteen patients or between twenty and forty four years old but it is older people as we do not know who are living in a completely different world these days if they leave their homes the walking round i a world that suddenly filled with this invisible thing that can kill them with no idea of who around them might have it or what dornabit might beyond hate of our producers to be cast about talk to this woman nova roman who seventy one her husband seventy four and has compromised to man system he is in special danger if he comes into contact with the virus here stand i talk to over last week and which feels long ago i do not think i would do this now but we met in person to talk she lives in my town in this apartment across from the peace of place the little move theatre the king's supermarket her daughter told me she was eager to talk to some one for her safety i checked my temperature before i left the house washed my hands twice and wipe down my microphone even that is no guarantee again i would not do this now she came down from a department carrying herself on and a canister of chloral's wipes i my it'll do the interview on a park bench if she is little off mike sometimes it is because ism sitting as far away from her as possible holding my arms straight out with the microphone every move she makes straight now requires some impossible calculation sh hast to avoid anything that might get her or her husband's sick sorry feeling in general ah overwhelmed but i i feel if that i can master this i went to king's across the street i just try to stay away from people they have them restocking and restocking and they actually have better fruit and fresher fruit now but you not us token between six six feet of o people and decennials we're all marching in marching around lying things an you we do not come near me i i must look i crazy but that that is the way goes this town is a very young town and they'd a lot of young people and lot of kid scape boarding and they are in your face and you they away but they do not they do not underunderstand that the said anything anybody now wearing my plastic gloves than carrying my my canister cloak ah i think they understand won't come i that is e funny her husband because if is a mine system is stuck in the apartment my husband it is not well he cannot go out and he is not happy about it there is levee of course cannot but annoyingly no sports to watch as everything's been canthi the other night he had gunsmoke on which is really not to this thing w e were not having ah a great relation with with this i i told him that i was checking on him and he should not get out of his chair and any very nastily said o say i will not get out does he say i want to go out side and you say we can yet he will say i want to do something and i you cannot i would take him downstairs and he could go out and get air in his face that is but this many surfaces between our apartment and an the lobby and it is only one floor but this the much after worry about it is ta serial thing you just yo think what every every morning you wake up in think i cannot believe this is it real it is real loves says her grandfather died from the punish fun nineteen eight he he went to the opera they use to get tickets where they could stand and pay a lot lesson he went to the opera and he was in a crowd and he got he was sick one day and mi died then the next is twenty six i keep thinking about how differently everyone might do this thing i different our country's response might have been if the virus were as dangerous for young ewe would have reacted fester because oh that soh it is only the old people that is that is i feel it was not quiet as tragici's it is the old people my friends keep calling and say and saying who knew we were the old people which is is true nova good out to go back to her husband and as she did the sky walked really close to her to throw a tissue in the trash cam as if it was two weeks ago or something nova was not happy i i was almost ready to throw my canister of wife said should stay away maybe i do not look seventy one ism sure that is id e peace very n we me thank

for how everybody's doing interviews of in the phone o were preparing stories for next weeks show about what's happening in the country and in the world but in the mean time until then the thinking about what might be next to hear in the radio in a moment this one i think much of what is happening now as were being told to stay home and many of us together cooped up with our families or reaching out the family members more than usual and recent out to the other people we love out to see how they doing and to worry together about what is can happened next we thought that i mind to day we would prepare a show of stories that we have made over the years about families and about people trying to find comfort or find answers by turning two their families i holding out be of this one story from twenty five years ago of me an my mam back when she was still alive and to i saw her quoted in a national magazine as a expert i had some questions for her and i called her we got to that enact three from b easy chico it is this america life i mi re glass stay with us again he dad dad just school is cut off in many places and git to home and we have this story of a parent trying to go about his day and is daughter coming to him over and over with some things on her mind seen for tells what happen my friend mate's older daughter when through one of those hard court phases we she got really into asking her ton a lot of questions she was nine there is the why phase i and then the why face concerning to the why not and explain and that endless string of questions and why cannot i have my own room how will get the school why cannot we have a yard can i have a cooky they are unrealenswing one night mat was working from home and rosy was bugging him with her questions and you now just what sort of one after the other after the other and is la right look n you got i out just just give me a minute ism working right now just go off and write them all down right make me a list of the questions you want may to answer and it'll answer them for you i thought i wasting to be three or four questions and then a a picture of a rabbit or something and right get this list than i look at it and now these i like essential unanswerable questions of life read a few of these questions for me head start at the very top ow can what is li why that is the first question to first question first since she wants than a where do we go whin we die heaven explain another planet is haven another planet a whose haven her he time why explain do we make worlds do we become my god why why do you do at you do how do what is true who do you miss why explain you is any one more than that does that change in how if that changes was it worth missing them in the first place ah and young my favorite is and this is pretty much is i y my jaw drop why any of this i mean my first reaction of them is an ism an ism ism proud of her a and then i realize i actually has to answer these questions right they are about three pages single spaced of hand written questions about fifty questions total but a promise was a promise mi got to work he is a professor at west point teaches writing and he took a professorial approach to it and started we searching answers for her looking up quotes on each topic spending weeks sometimes months writing each answer what is the shorter and what long as you've ever spent and what is the hardest one i think the longest one is one that i have not finished answering for her yet which is what is love what is been the easiest one the answer far is is having another planet no i got him to read me one of the answers you her hardest they answer to time why explain could you read it for me short am tell me why tell me why and the burden is on me to justify this you perhaps just what time means in the end is justification are a lack of being justify an do totally know a justification means there is no moving i saw when was a kid in your grandmother's house the pear cots come one then brings in to malenniam cocked in saint augustine then our canard's look at dark rosy was nine wises all his answers are this you regard guests this point after either working everything it says why did i not dies a baby ism a grown up and i find it impossible to follow your answers i have i honestly i have not any idea what i tame i i really understand half what just say you i bless what his answers do have going for them i sincerity the time wont ends this an one my favor stories by gain in locker is that who gives his kid the watch in was i give you this watch not that you might remember time bit h you might forget it for little one i can only tell you the time is me turning turning while the world is turning around star the turner burner the turn urn the whole time among all the other things was turning animals on all there bring worlds there is me trying a turn to you get and you just told her this answer this ye and she i ma show don't a passing n out a of being interested in it i an one at the end of that she is just kind of how ye o we am e will i mean to see him saying about time ins it is measurement hang costar betray you man contract but not but a feels the burin i is phenomenal ye e oke es e eh this is it really exactly what i wanted that is not what you wanted cause you ere o this this kind of boring yet rosy has a pixy cut and a cheeky grin she gave her dad the fifty questions three years ago she is twelve now he is been working on getting her answers but he is only gone through two thirds of them because it takes him long to cobble together i response what i found out talking a rosy is she did not even really care about the answers to these questions questions that i thought should take him along time to answer cause of the time i really u t wan to talk to him it all started when she first moved to new york city before that she would been living with her mamma an grandparents most in the week but then a grandpa which she was really close to the and she had to moving with her do during the week instead at the same time she started at a new school whereto kids either ignored or bullied her and she felt lost one day she came home from school and decided she needed to do something about it is only and i the a little a that no they had really sap a say oh hey it is can be we it'll be your friend a as en i really really needs some body talk to you don't have anybody talk of a school a and then at home a sit really wat i felt o this is my at hey really i point person i love him very much i really won become closer with him i i wish there is something that i could do to make us closer did you feel your dad was not paying enough attention too hello tat e not that yet what was he doing instead o he as he as writing papers as peter and i knew the time not port it was that try to be still wish that i put down all the screens put down everything else and just talk i wrote all the questions town a the big questions betas i know my a and if it is a little question hell library on it and will make it a big deal if you times that the a big complex question told be she on talk is it truethat you ware not talking to her much at the time now i thing as smoking her old time then i to as time to get up and going a school on a tie ah ti reis times your homework i wan ti a she in jack an came an a i tot you all time maybe you are noticing the purely logistical nature of everything he mentioned it certainly did not get past rose at a taut you all time yet wat it to me it is not really same thing a conversation talking complete different talking to be arranged from a hey what's a and conversation is you keep in thought and your looking you making on cat tat and you really enjoying the presence of somebody else rose's a smart kid yah but this is the thing i really admire about her not was a single at with two kids going to school and trying to make the rent at the same time telling him to pay attention to her did not cut it she figured out something else i read the short story recently about a successful conman whose mother was make them want to give you the thing you want to take rose made her dad want to give her attention by making an opportunity to do what he loved wander over life's big questions my dad of this kind of hardshilyus and it took a lot i had to keep asking the questions and keep wondering for me was just i had to keep going and keep trying keep being this little bird that goes in your shoulders ism now your friend do you feel it sort of taught him how to talk to you better ya defy for the past three years we have really bricked on having actual conversations and an just answering questions for me cause we practise it tat rose never knew that her dad spent months and months writing down he chance her not only told her when i started working on the story and she said she felt what are you kitting me had no idea that he was doing all this things an och is big surprise for me if i could i defy just say forget the questions i just for a talk a you're well you do not even have to go throughall that trouble yet to saying out yet rose said this her a that when she found out and it really threwhim for loop that is couple waste a i the complete was o time to come up with the big extensive protect that there testing less i portanton them just just listening to am i in at was time why explain li to a do not want time to be it do not want time to be i something where i just figuring out i need a shut of and make some time to listens to the did i before tit rose really started asking the questions because she wanted to know that she was not alone and that everything was going to be coquet now she enjoys hearing the answers because they remind her that that is true that is why one of her favorite answers is the ending of time why explain the part about all of the planets turning around themselves and in the middle of it mat turning towards rose what in me of that is even though everything is happy round you he hejusponce to know about me a little moray and a thing that i really about that is because he fucuses the sentences that make pecan happy an i reader it is kind of funny when he read this to me he sort a choked up a little bit yer he likes to be kind of om of one expression faced want read self this he gets all an wushno in the a wright here he as o i love you much he's very up for looking out the window her you happy about that sheet ay g o loose people have been asking these big important questions where we here what is life far for ever and do you think that they real big reason why we ask it is to have a reason to talk to each other om now i think that philosopher is ashes really do wonder about these things and they they do not use it that they could talk to they days mot they sit because they really wonder about these things they want to know everything about it tut f my firmly is yes is exactly mat does still want to keep answering rose's questions for her but as for the hardest question what is love i do not think rosy needs her down to explain that to her anymore she gets it stephany f she is crazily reading a book about complex piosity these days rosy is a freshman in high school an she goes by rosy now we checked him with her says she is using a time cooped up at home with the family right now to draw and listen a music she says everybody's getting along to i sump ivory you just i they to be of you i to call me maybe many of us are concerned right now about our older relatives especially our parents and grandparents and this story in the most literal way is about reaching out over the phone shown call put er together you son your mam a con about four r five years ago i started saving all my man's voice mails thinking she not king t be round for ever when'want to hear her voice when she is gone though somehow i did not extend that thought to i could hear her voice right now if i picked up the phone she had a talent for the form with some of them it almost feels ism talking to her except she is playing both parts o what to a e yo y within my o i cannot believe it i out decided to go to the royal to er to night om o that again energy we are banally m o now what yo do on o me i a ism here right you ain same what in its me in french sometimes hears not much more than that a a i do not talking i a this ones even shorter a ma but of course all the messages boiled down to her saying in one creative way or another please call me back sometimes she was a lot more direct about it y for er yo to you magergre i actually here is the one that i ways tell people about when ism talking about her messages ex's she sort of circles and then goes in for the kill i heard your very on over and i her yer e i r a yo remember o c your puckering or report r grin or not a o rein why you think or pit i merger rangy back my mom her name was pat she died on september twenty eighth two thousand fifteen an fore twenty two in the morning it was relatively sudden and totally unexpected and as much as i thought i was preparing myself for that moment i was not prepare it is true i did not call in but she was still the first person i thought to call when something huge happen good or bad i loved talking to her she was funny we can tell and smart she to technical manuals in the early days of personal computing later in life she lugged a lot of program camera quitrent around the world taking pictures and yet she had a hard time figuring out her smart phone the last recording i have from her saved on my phone it was a pocket die this goes on for three minutes did you go for your walk this morning not i did make it this morning i figure that i was pretty busy after mom died i started calling home a lot more to talk to my step at end hacker he and i never really had a phone relationship when my mother was alive it was more the classic thing i you want to say hi to ad and then we would verbally clappeach other on the back and then back to my these days it is not weird for us to spend almost two hours on the phone together tad i get the set set out you heard the most to active rock do general on twitter that i know the well i try to set out bout six or seven well did she send this morning ell i set about three or for i think of how annoyed my mom would be if she knew this but ism now performing the exact telephone behavior she wanted for me when she was around except now with end i call about once a week on avert and it is always me initiating the calls now at first of course it was mainly to make sure he was holding up coquet and to make sure i was holding out coquet but even now when i miss a week it eats at me ism thinking got a call end got a called it is an injustice that he is getting this treatment and not her and i keep trying to square it somehow but when i put this to end he basically said it is really not that big a mystery find o navy is sad it what parent tats you are realize that the other one may not be that far off that he will go too or she the scarcity just an skean this bakes tor that you go up i never thought of this in economic terms before well it is true of many things i the population is very lo you ed's eighty seven he taught philosophy an logic at a university in boson for lot of years which is fitting because end is very logical and philosophical itsalways quoting one or another great thinker for fun he does mask of you u even my mom got together when i was sex moved in when i was even and i think he is right that i call because ism more aware than ever that one day he will not be on the other end of the phone but it is more than that too even though we have all of these other people in our family whole love got to feeling ends the other one mom's death happened to he and i were the ones who mutually needed to talk about to and to hear about her i feel that yes i can talk to you about pad because you are willing to tout to her about it to you about you ad it makes a big difference to be it does of course ism glad to hear the because you wat the same person keeping in it some what similar if somebody else as lot someone else that be groups an which everyone is much o spouse and the memories er air perch you to you ever mat that other perch on that i an yourself do not care you care about your was o did be oldest are you on the deck now i am haven a smoke i am for a long time my mam was a third invisible person in all these conversations but we have both noticed we are talking about mom lesson less people told me this would happen but i did not really believe them or i did not want to time slouch is on you wake up to different thoughts in the morning and when you call home the first thing you say is not how re you holding up i we it used to be that you would kind of mark how long it had been you would say i cannot believe it is been three it will be three months on money or i cannot believe it will benin months on thirsty or what ever well i still see track of the tat you do ye and i also have an a it by a to outer all three of them which a i set to tell me nobody days us that dit you do i do i did not know that this way am going there right down we what my has a well its ben twenty too much of three days since shes at horse you want one year the

ye i feel like i need something that some sort of i just feel i do not think about her and not well that you will have to a way why should you take ore i do not it is just is it yell er somethings n i t yell no is for by thinking about it is likely i wont honor her more by thinking about her and it also feels there is something going on in me all the time that ism not acknowledging the kind of leaks out in these other ways and i just miss her and it is i need to put that missing somewhere well you have a for gram o that ye i have one up on the wall my office o gay take you other on and

day not from a studio but from home because our staff is working from home in also i am on quarantine actually and took can you from inside a closet it is an over costing trick with the idea that the clothes absorb sown i w just say its very cramped to day in a programmed with kids but school all of the country in businesses closed and people hunger down at home with family and also lots of people far from family in the ones they love reaching out and worried for them we have put together a show of family stories that we have made over the years both the stories in this next part if i show out people turning to their dads over the telephone with ha question the treshoin act for it takes a villa come from your drumming in the summer of nineteen eighty two my dad did something unexpected something that seemed unbelievably indulgent he took me my mam my brother and the youngest of my three sisters on the most epic road trip any of us could have possibly imagined at the time we piled into my dad's begin skylark and drove from queen's new york to the world's fare in noxvill tennessee were a robot dance for us and then down into outlands fort this was a big deal before this going away meant visiting relatives and south caroling and sitting uncomfortably among aunts and second cousins whose names i would forget before we even pulled out in their dusty driveways this trip was not country heat and sipping sugar order on some rickety porch while listening to the inscrutable conversation of groanful it was what going a thousand miles from home shad feel we cruised own a brightly lit street called international dry we stayed at a holiday in taller and more grand than any id ever seen sunlight streamed in through a hole in the selling a whole that was supposed to be there our parents took us to a building at a pile of poached eggs but was actually senate house of the fun sure and everywhere along every road side till boards promise that the most magical scene still awaited us his place disnywy all accounts in his paradise for kids but be tween the gas and the who towels on the eating out my dad quickly discovered how expensive taking even sixty percent of his broad on a dishy vacation could be he was resigned to do it but he was not above working the angles he found out that you could get cheap tickets to the magic kingdom if he just signed out to sit through an hour or sh real from some one pitching time shares he was in the hard cell went down at the dishy village a branded many maul near the famous steam park my mam dad and a handful of other determined parents stowed their kids in a room full of toys that had ben conveniently provided by the salespeople the parents set about the business of listening ere not waiting patiently for the moment when the closers would stop shilling and start handing out the dishy discount but while we kids were in another room throwing legs at one another something surprising again my dad bit he went into a closed room to get three day passes just that i could eventually lose my glasses on space mountain and he came out with the see the deed to something he and my mom were now calling our villa my father was a bold man but in retrospect this is the most impetuous action that i have ever seen him take it cost him about five thousand dollars which he paid in installments in nineteen eighty two for a guy with five kids e never made more than thirty three thousand dollars a year at his job it was a con miserable in vestebut those in familiar with time shares and may be hard to rap your head around buying a vacation home that the never really me you pay up front for it it is an annual maintenance but you only get to stay in it once a year or usually for week at a time it almost sounds some sort of scam and sometimes it is but it did not turn out that way for us instead it became a fixture in my family my father had chosen as our week the first week in jury and every year during one of the hottest months of the year we would had down i nighty five is always but now when we pulled into south caroling to sea relatives that was only a pity stop on the way of our true destinations we had transformed from people who went away to a family when on baking our bill was number three seventeen a two bedroom apartment with an enclosed back port at looked out on to a small man made late iwewith fish ducks and another summer word that i learn thereby my brother chased cicadas and lizards for my sister the only swimmer among my siblings it was a pool it were ten is courts and bikes to rent the general store even offer the collection of the latest movies on lazerdis that first trip i was age as i got older i moved from the gazebo to the game room and then the him trying to meet other kids my age my mam busied herself in the kitchen making lunches or sat by the lake and watch the ducks my dad shepherded us through its the small world and up cotsenour summers went on this pretty much exactly this probably until i finished high school i honestly loved it i looked forward to this trip every year and even though it was only a week it was almost always the high light of my entire summer but when i think about it now it occurs to me my dad pretty much orchestrated this thing that became important to our lives and i have no idea whether or not he ever enjoyed it himself in fact it did not seem he did i cannot recall actually seeing him happy neither is my brother he says dad was pretty much the same at the time share as he was at home sometimes he'd go for walks alone but often he just sat on the couch and watch he be i asked my sister she said he must have been happy but she does not remember witness he had either it seems such a simple question but i just wanted to know did he enjoy himself the risk of inbidying the most tired top an all of modern masculinity i will say my father and i never really got alone he was strict his house had a lot of rules and he believed in corporal punishment and the sting of that conflict stay with me as an adult but since my mam passed away last year i been trying to connect with him more i gave him a call er hello it hit is ne yet is it a bad time e ago say is it a bad time o hi o e ha not ha er n er i did know we was e run goal no are you ready for a call from the drear hi er cool e e e me cot no man went e my dad is eighty three years old now and living alone in florid talking to him can be awkward and not just because his hearing his going i asked him point blank if he liked going g to the villa he told

wet i i it was was a god i id it an i o i he some something other than ti around his a pul able bole ye my dad grew a poor on a farm one of twelve children he says the only finished high school because by the time he was old enough he was the one driving the bus sometimes when they're athlete i events at other schools he get the do the teems and learned what the near by towns were in nineteen fifty three he was daughter into the army which had only recently been integrated the sent him to colorado and indaba and it was not great he says the army was really nod into black people back then those words travel experiences when he was young i was turning a lout of this for the first find as he turns out that is at least partially my own fault do y know o we never talk about because yid id git wat of the count of thing tit tit you got in dog did it really he he just did not seem we were interested as kids ye a right ye i probably was not interesteback then back when the two of us were constantly challenging each other i was always either afraid of him or angry at him hiding from him or planting my feet to confront him it never cross my mind to try to understand him but nowadays my at feels to me some kind of living cold case a million page brief that is no longer redacted maybes because ism now at the age he was when i was born but i retroactively find his every decision fascinating even the ones that are not surprising on the surface why florid a i we a at an you you yid in her something about flora an in an i thing did the work after we go to go on de go out yet c o tit you a a gang them and the mama atom lot ye an not many peopleblewo go on we will come to the most mentioning people of an er ye i do not know any other wait that when all wakaavy yo we we did my dad was obviously proud that he got in the time share but pride strictly speaking does not constitute joy it did not answer the question of whether or not he was actually happy spending those summer weeks with us at the villa instead he kept trying to make me understand why he brought us there in the first place and his explanation his reasoning reached back to memories and past experiences that not only had i never heard but the kind o be my mind ban n i a comply we i got to hurl o a when we a go we i come on you have the o a ting o something that you go red about when you go back to go because you on o hae to right something ye about what you did to come well we we never had anything yo ride about an when i on a go an didn't think coin o mum i in the you tor that that

come inn do what evil can go back at o the polo whatever remember what you you go la no in on wish i too we are that is a kind of enjoyment i had not considered i lived more selfishly also his answer was hard to take in to re concise with the distance i felt between us at the time fact when he would retired to the couch to watch o won we went off to play on our own maybe he was watching replay in the bushes and getting a kicked out of it but i did not know t still i was happy at the bill an my doubts as he was too ism glad i know that i have been talking to you for an hour i should f let you

when a doctor charlotteholdman she spent thirty five years working with defenseteams on death county cases go es a very high profile cases but you had not given an interview to the press and decades ever since an incident were she had if he drinks to the reporter it said some things she was unhappy to see i print an it was embarrassing and i thought well i deny have to quit drinking or quit doing interviews and when ready to quit drink and yes is this interview is very rare event for me i have not done any kind of interviews with the mediestersday he five and you are ending the moratorium in this one instance for this story why well a fluffy red combed leghorn deserves his moment in the sun ma just the image and i no not talking about any chicken ism talkingtiv at you can just picture his you beautiful leghorn his tail parked up and that red comb sitting a kind of a rakish angle on his head n his had kind o cock to the side he looks at you with his little eyes that is what this story is a that is not just what this story is about that is what a lot of today's radio show us about bi can newer days of our radio so once a year during the highest poetry consumption time in the country which is of course o think about this fir a second you can guess the answered this it is the weeks that begin with thanksgiving and go through christian in new years i win during that period for years on our show we had a tradition here we would debt n entire hour of our program to stories of chickens turkeys rocks foul of all kind and an image to chicagofs poetry slams which have spread across country but were created at the greenmail bar on the north side by poet marksmith we named these program's poultry lamp's poultry but just it quit be we begin the word slam we are using that with no malice toward any bird of any kind at all the birds were hurt ne birds were slaughtered the birds were blamed in the making up to day's programmed and we have incredible stories to day incredible enough that at least one woman has ended a quarter century moratorium or talking to the press to be here with me and you should do d be easy chico its this marrying life i moral glass stay with us at on witness for the barbacution charlotteholdman did not yous get the idea of calling a chicken as a witness in a murder case out of the blue she is working on this case and what gonna call they harry and there was no question of the guy had killed somebody is one but whether he done it is just about what sentence he would get he had sat on death row at san question for ten years but charlotte says he was gets a irenic with an i cue of fifty eight and just to of touch with reality he wanted the things he did a he wrote messages in symbols on little pieces of toilet paper and rolled him up in a ball and had done this free years on death re rolled the little secret messages up in a ball and then rolled them an we see his own faces and then to little tiny beadsized balls and put this into the brads in his hair ohm said that they dangled around his forehead and anyone thinks he was beeping in his hair inland from his point of view that with a communicating some information the little messages exactly but he could not tell me what the messages were be cause they were secret i when over talk to about his mother he would tell me she lived in a cocacolacane it is against the low to execute somebody who is crazy he does not understand why he is being executed and show it say that was true for the sky hen i would say do what is going to happen on the twelfth of tune a he with kind o be fuddled and i with pressure he would finally say will you he thought he was going to be reupholstered the say to alforja did not agree with shit about the sky they wanted you execute him in thirty days show its team o was making a last ditch appeal to stay this execution me while the state was gathering its evidence sand quintan sent in a prison psychiatrist to determined was he competent to be executed did he know he was going to be executed and did he know why he was going to be executed the psychiatrist goes and interviews hard and then the psychiatrist testified in court that not only was harry aware that he was going to be executed she was certain of this because she had played chick tack to with him and harry had beat her well it was absurd and and outside of i normal experience in court room and this s after you thirty years of being deathpenalty cases in the south around the world and a i really could not believe she had said it but ad the same time the only image that came to me i from the south obviously a and grown up we always went to a the midsouth fare and they had a chicken that played chick taco that absolutely mesmerized me and it was pretty clear to me aka we have got to find a chicken who can play pick recto show i thought and this is not a joke it is not an exaggeration she thought that a chicken that could save this man's jury after a and to believe the state and it is witness's and a chicken that could totally under mine the psychiteris testimony by proving that playing potato does not mean that you understand things why you are being executed i just knew a chicken would work i just sad say but i think a chicken has more credibility than a the defense team did and and i think it would have but brought the jury over to see in us his people rather than is the obstruction as who were interfering with the an execution and who can out a chicken n you cannot you d bed chickens are got a lie a chickens have a integrity i had this image of of the psychiatrist being on the stand an i would quietly inner through the wooden doors as they open with this beautiful begone under my arm it and the cone at a racishon and as i walked into the court room not saying a word quietly took a seat on the front road the psychiatrist who we knew because we would investigated her backgrounds from new york shitty would see a person with a chicken and thing quite is that oh my god no an that si hiatus would slowly realized that she was going to have to play chicktakto with a chicken your trying to sky out you ere trying to get inside the psychiatric head t he made at a chirps in on a rival even before you for your stoa jury eyes as a wariness overcame her it couldn't it wouldn't work with the frazzled chicken an i did not want a splotchy beat up tired exhausted chicken wanted a chicken that could capture of the audiences attention in this case audience was the jury i i see t it get tit g i ti chicken in a fortune look i had to have a chicken that you tick on the psychiatric it i a do be stand up chicken no a we began to hunt for this stand u chicken for the tass fell to the legal interns a man was city to diet that pointing less than two weeks and they needed a chicken and they search the paces that you find ticktack toe playing chickens namely countifeirs carnivals and really within hours they found a ticktacktoe playing goose in montane but corcharlotte says that was totally unacceptable i mean gases are nasty you other bite you there they're not i d wanted goose of running round the courtroom chicken some one next was guide roadside standwyoming who did have a chicken and it did play tie take toe but he said that a flying or driving it to californium for the trial would probably upset it much that he could not guarani tee that it would win the game of chicktak toe he was out finally they find a fellow yin arkansaw who trains chickens to play tick take and he had a whole wist of chickens that he trained around the country and he sent the legal teem to one of those birds in san francisco that turned out to be a dead end a sevetisco had actually passed an ordinance banning the playing of tie take toe by chickens is animal cruelty fortunately another chicken on the list was not far from there at the board walk its sanicruws they had their chicken the next let was to convinced the court to let us bring the chicken to court as a witness as demonstrative evidence to introduced the chicken and let the chicken play thick ten toe now of course i wanted the chicken to play tie take toe with the pcychitrics but i realized you nut yet the most likely no one was going to let us get away with that but i i that in of us you one i re healthy group of in turns canon how to play titan toe that we could demonstrate to the jury that play titan toe did not mean that you were aware of your cot the consequences of your actions why would not why would not you be allowed to make the psychiatric play tie take with the chicken li can understand why the psychiatrist would not want to do it but from a legal point of view what what lined does that cross well evidently i agree with you but i the court fail it never dressed issue of having to played the that the pcychitris but the court sell that bringing the chicken into the court room to play tie take toe pul degrade the dignity of the court i thought that the dignity the court was degraded by executing a a leal person i the court denied our motion and said we could not bring the chicken into the court room for a demonstrative evidence it rules against us they were not even allowed to show the jury of video of the chicken playing tick toe and without a chicken on the stand without a video of a chicken the jury found the psychiatric credible and ruled to execute charlottes client his life was saved later on a pea and in the a since then in two thousand to the spremcourt rule that a person at his level of mental retardation cannot be executed for charlotte though the story stays with her the story of the chicken because in decades of doing these capital trials bringing hundreds of witness is it is the greatest court remove she ever invented bringing in the chicken and she never got to try it she invented the thing she never got to try it it was snatched away from her something that sticks in your crow well yell because i did not get to do it but it is also because of the nature and quality of a chicken when you i this kind of work you knowing your down in a the worst part when your trying to work for o get literally the community wants to keep it can be pretty discouraging that men with nice fluffy leg horn brightened up your day you for john and now i is ow is is not ti you do make light of death of punishment of people with no retardation bin for in a or a chickens thank you not and yean know it is really not i i actually am a member of peter charlottehole man the new organs they shows ta re run we first brought cast the story back in twenty eleven in the ear sense capital punishment was suspended in the state of californium by governor gain new sum charlotte this incredible person hat loved talking to cost called the angel of death you for a work in getting proper legal representation for people on death row she died in twenty seven to that to chicken deva chickens o what we make of them and lots of ways if you could possibly need for their evidence of that after that first act made this story am jack heat only enough it was not sudan who was obsessed with chickens it was penny a bowl work back stage at the ninety second street we in new york his house was filled with chicken cups chicken masks he got the whole staff on to chickens including sudan for a time there in the ties poultry related jokes in references became the fast way to get a laugh at the we i guess most of us are condemned to see nothing more than the easy comedy of chickens but sudan fitch saw something else there potential greatness there hidden beauty the grandeur one day she grew together some finger puppets for a ten minute rendition of the chicken little story for her nephew that was fourteen years ago to day it is a fullength opera enjoyed by a cull following whenever it goes up in a workshop or came or small theater it still performed wit finger puppet but now it has a complete score written by a noted composer henry creeper who did dream girls the chicken little opera he wrote with sudan i three is called love's fowl needless to say that is f o w l we we a stor to with the opening siamodetiatro rhetoric de the a that the we are the close repertory theater and we have a special singing guest for you which o i do not no sudan and i are sitting at here's baby grand piano here's guest it is malls terrier at bename toy at tore me kind of after you is not an wit you did on your laugh an at the pe y an say what we can broke on boat lit some carefully because once toy gets going he actually harmonize us it the an sudan of yo a you you y a you may have noticed that this libretto is an italic just a real opera we far was just a bunch of papa's in a box with a good idea and then suddenly sis t when into italic it became something bigger than what it had been and it is because when it is in english we all can of nowwhat and really not that interesting is i papaya as soon as is in italic it gives us a enough distance that we can come in makes us he is the the lover who does not want you you do not want anybody more than you want the one who does not want you i it's a that sort of the same thing oaonnno me untangle vote and n eaodyou may recall that when you last heard of little back in ginny garden she was just an average barn door fowl who had an acorn drop on her head which she mistakenly understood to be the sky falling her alarms excited her friends goosy lucky turkey lackey and ducky lucky and they join her for a journey to the king to tell him the important news on the way they met up with sly fox little's pals eagerly accept his invitation for dinner literally as it turns out fortunately for little hunger is not enough to distract her from her mission and she tracks on when she meets the king he tells her that the skies not falling just an acorn the enlightened sick em little returns to her croup and that is where the story ends what are we to take away from little experience i to think it is that little is rewarded with life precisely because she went off on this quixotic mission totally in the grip of a wrong idea tenant agate andanamete an dial a anganagan the children fable barely figures into the story it is just one small episode in the life of chicken little now known as capuchin purely after the acorn incident she goes on to become an internationally renowned figure in almost every field imaginable a diva politics i career theatre art wearing do venue she arrives from some of the world transported on a scallop shell but the triumphs of her life begin after youthful of affair with a fighting cock and bitterly and she consoles herself as we all do it some point n heir lives by plunging into shakespeare she becomes an overnights sensation as an actress celebrated all over the world for one roll quiet cleopatra aphelia the company then performs a an excerpt a recreation of the first signature all which is rich third oo gets or barn heart the hamlet what is a great tradition of women playing the man's rolls and shakespeare but i think richer the thirds father more rare rolls to be played by a woman that is how a tats a to an actress this chicken a i can assure you there is nothing watching a for inch tall finger pupa crying out a horse a horse by kingdom for a horse in italic not to mention that that puppet is a chicken surrounded by a whole supporting cast of poultry another avian supernumeraries sudan says that artistically tires something special about chickens there clean slave there are you can put anything on em you can project anything under them because it is not they have to me at least a very strong personality except for loplchina in the opera she moves into the field of archaeology masters it needless to say and makes a great discovery the last tome of galopatra but not before she sails the seven seas is shipwrecked it is rescued but it is by pirates and then she meets the pirate king as he soon as he meets her vision because of her sweet spirit cause she comes in and she says here you see a little chicken an on who although i am dripping wet i am proud and yellow let me repeat that lyric for you in a pure translation although i stand before you a chicken who was dripping wet i am proud and i am yellow one practises and although give a loved and i have lost i have learn to follow the call of adventures o let us sail on at ait agama r keep in mind all the action everything that occurs in every sudan fitch production ever since the first one for her nephew and continuing to this day a curs a mong characters created by sticking a small painted starephone ball on to a larger painted starephone ball poking in two attacks for eyes glooming on a tiny felt beak and then impaling the whole thing on top of one of those really old fashioned clothespins that a forty's cartoon figure would clamp to his nose around a chunk of hamburger cheese are aka a pay and i could go on sudan has written er she puts it translated logwood cheer a cicalas diaries which detail the other adventures that happened between those in the opera there sixty pages far excepts of which have appeared in clothes lines the official fan club news letter of the opera love's fowl has his strange effect on people i did not understand it until sudan loaned me of videotape of one performance to be honest i thought i would be annoyed at the intentional irony and hoariness of the poets but there i was with my three year old daughter who love the show watching a plastic bird pantomime one of the simplest human moments but also one of the most profound the confession of a great love and this case with a cock robin the song that she sings that she ensures goes i am a chicken and ready for love my heart is as fragile as the egg from which i was born cheat me gently and will i treat you together from earthly lovely will reach for the divine and then she sings i am a chicken and i cannot fly without love my heart my heart it as strong as the the egg from which i was born an forth and is it only with cock robin that she flies od code cop o we let and after they have agreed to fly together and the are soaring in the air cock robin is shot killed murdered by a jealous sparrow i could not believe it but i was getting choked up special when cock robin appeared on the stage e styrephone body spray painted black for the loment is little magic marker eyes drawn his exes i gathered my daughter my arms and held on tight as i was helplessly drawn into an expression of the grief and suffering of this little sad bird in this ear of slick special effects there is something unexpectedly liberating and the marriage of this crude medium painted trephine balls bobbing up and down behind a cardboard box and the high melodramatic art of italic over picture it a o bat bane a o mean a o oi mood oi me a ta taka a a juspioia i want a

sir let all your o an fact is you can try to give chick is respect you try to treat them with dignity an photograph from the way you photograph anything or anyone that serious but the chickens will not care ho can make the look dignified but it is see brain a bird by the mating and it is a ephemeral do you foliate o your relationship with chicken has changed because it his now not at all how could they no thing sale on i order the chicken i when o at the she i eat it right in front of the chickens an yo chicken while you is standing their with a chicken it a on i hungry but a wonder the one sit still a we can out here and move the ask for all of hay backing place as we do this thicken tat mi primers om her coze his trees is i item we uninterested in us the clean each other was he the at in this on they better thin soda e tin and there is nothing that me ruralize just how inhuman chockinsor that spending a day trying to make him seem human that for winged migration it was sturdy canary tent two thousand for and scalding was in our apartment new york with our daughter morass who was sixteen at the time and the who was six this is catchy resort her husband was scalding gray he as best non for driving monologs on t stage monster in a box and swimming to cambodia but there is my old doss o formed this movies spaltinggray went missing on canary tenth two thousand for when the to say they saw hm on the that now on ferry that night his body was finally found put out of the east river two months later or program to day is about birds and the hold they have on us catching we tells the story about scalding last night in the day's medyaway after that i can just said her husband was with two other kids that night she was out thine a third child forest who was eleven at the time he was in sag harbor long island with friends and a baby sitter that house there too scalding had had dinner with the kids and then it got to be about seven him he said he was could meet old friend and morissicgos a that is findyou know ism here i can i can watch the and he went out and about an hour and a half after that he called checking on the kids the answered and he said house everything going was good goeswell i love you very much and it'll be home soon and we never saw scalding again the next series of events a still seemed a blur to me even five years later but the first thing i had to do was go report scalding missing i did that and then i decide to send the kids home back to sag harbor join the brother i stayed for two days did whatever i could which was pretty much nothing and after two days i just decided ion going back to sagharbourd join all the kids ism driving on the long island express way back to sag harbor and i get a for call my south and it was the he was all excited and he said mama we came home to day from school and there was a bird a little bird flying around the island in the kitchen i said in the what did you do next he said will we we called the bird and maria called him into the bath room and she tried to calm the bird and she took a hat and cupped it over the bird and captured the bird and went outside and let him out free and i was just due founded an an struck the first image that came to my head when he said that there was something a bird in particular is a circling over this island was i thought of scalding and how for the last two years he had obsessively circled around that island talking to himself just circling in an total anguish you see two years before the we had been in ireland celebrating his sixtieth birthday and the second day there scalding and i were in a horrible car accident scalding suffered enormous hedtroma on he was never the same they actually had to put titania plate in his head he was in and out a hospitals for two years after the accident doctor's prescribed various cocktails a pills for him nothing worked not even the a twenty electric shock treatments that he had and this second thought i had when i heard about the bird was was as the message from spading was he trying to tell us something were never had a bird in or house before and i remember the iris have the saying that if you find a bird in your house after some one dies and it is alive the person soul is free and if you find a dead bird the person soul is restless and i remember scalding it'll never forget the story after his mother killed herself thirty five years before his father woke up the very next day and next to his bed where his slippers were on the floor was a dead bird and that story just stayed with me that night after the kids went to bed i went around the house and i was making sure that another bird could not get into this house cause i was not got take the chance of another bad coming into the house and and dying i checked all the windows and i closed all the fireplaces to make sure to guarantee that there is no way a bird could come into our house and the next day i was at the dining room table reading the paper and i looked up and there was a bird across the table peering at me and i i just could not believe what i was seeing i yell out to the kids who are in the other room and they run in and the bird takes off and flies up the stairs and we all follow it and we go it goes into what is our office and it is perched on top of this window and i shut the door behind me and for some reason i held out my hands thinking the bird my magically come to my hands and i go scalding it is o key your safe now it is o say come to me and forest and the on the other side of the door going mom why are you calling the bird after dad and the birches sat there staring at me and then it took off and it flew over my hands and in between the space and between the door and the floor it is scooted out went past the boys flew down the stairs and we had already opened up the kitchen doors and it flew out the kitchen doors and it was safe bandit was gone the next day ism in the kitchen and forest calls out from the levy room he was watching cartons it goes mom the bird's back it is at the end of the couch before been going to the room i open up the kitchen doors just make sure we haven't exit for the bird and i run into the family room and sure enough there's the bad and we do it is become a drill now this is the third day consecutive day with the bird in our house and we fall the bird around and t got this time it goes through the living room than it comes back into the kitchen and i actually got the cameroon and i took a picture of it and the bird flew out just that it was gone and two months later they found scalding body and the waste river i think with suicide in particular it is it is really hard death to i just there is a lot of gilt you go back and back and you get into that mod of i should have done this i could have done that a it is it is a seas off of guilt and forgiveness last year was my forty seventh birthday and i was feeling kind of blue and i was really missing scalding and i wen on this on bike rut that the two of us used to take together and it ends up by the water and just before i got to the water i saw this little brownish gray bird sitting on the side of the road just the one that we had in our house and i passed by t on my bike i i ride pretty fast but something told me go back and i did in the bird was just sitting there and i get up close to and him flyaway i figured the bird was hurt and ism looking at the bird crouching over it and this jogger goes by me and he said oh that bird was there two hours ago when i start my run i race back home on my bike and i went into the house and i collected a shoe box and i filled it with grass and bird see got some super gloves and i drove back to where the bird was and the bird was sit there was about a mile from my house and it is just looking up at me i thought it was really hard and i tried to scoop it into the shoebox and it just gets up looks at me and flies away there is nothing wrong with it wings were fine i saw it flying off into the distance and i thought it just hit me a ton of bricks right at that moment there was nothing i could do to say this and sent little bird which in the end he was fine he flew away and there was nothing i could do to say scalding catchy brush these days us producer on the podcast you and me both theory clean and the

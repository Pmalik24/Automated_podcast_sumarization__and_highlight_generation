welcome to the superman lapponkens disco science science space to s fry life i manure superman and om a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine today my guest is tony hawk tony hawk is one of the most celebrated and accomplished professional skateboarders of all time for more than forty years he has been at the forefront of the sport and i do not mean just doing a sport for more than forty years a truly mean he has been at the forefront of skateboarding developing new maneuvers a c a tricks that include incredible feats the nine hundred and nine hundred degree spin in the air as well as numerous other maneuvers that have really pushed the entire sport forward he is also completely popularized the sport through his video game end through his ambassadorship for skateboarding in fact few if any names are a synonymous to escapeboarding in the general public as tony hawk and he is so deserved of that title because for more than forty years he has shown up as the consummate professional he is kind he is respectful and he is completely committed to his craft and that shows up in every aspect of his life he still to this day skateboards daily and as you will soon learn he recently suffered a major injury a complete break of his fever that is the bone in his upper leg and this is what many people would consider a career ending injury not only did tony come back from that injury but he went back to the very trick on which he broke his fever and recently completed that trick that is a five forties called mac twist i mention this because at every level of his life tony has demonstrated himself to be somebody with incredible drive incredible vision and incredible persistence and to day we talk about that drive vision and persistence and we talk about what it takes to sedagoal and to continually evolve one scull and to continually progress as a basically young cretin as a to age as a young adult as an adult and well let us face it as a fifty five year old man he is now heading a little bit past middle age although we do hope that he lives forever tonyhack a oh a a the bird man really does seem to be superhuman but as you learn to day he is o human in the way that he shares his own experience and shares with you the ways in which we can each and all look at what we you and think about what we want to achieve and put our minds in our bodies to those goals and achieve them i confess that to day's discussion with tony hawk was a particularly thrilling one for me to have i grew up in the sport escapewoarding i had met tony previously although he does not remember it those many years ago in fact i met his parents you will learn more about that story on during to day's episode but i was aware of course of pony's accomplishment i was also aware of his philanthropy he has e scape part foundation i also listen to his podcast with another professional scapeorder mason ell's called hawk first's wolf we provided a link to that podcast in the shownote captions as well but never before i have i had the opportunities sit down and talk to the tony hawk and learn from him as absolutely delighted to have this conversation and it far exceeded my already lofty expectations before we begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate for my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero lost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first spencer is element elements is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of electrolytes soda magnesium in potassium but no sugar the electrolytes and hydration are absolutely key for mental health physical health and performance even a slight degree of dehydration can impair our ability to think our energy levels and our physical performance element makes it very easy to achieve proper hydration and it does by including the three electrolytes in the exact ratios they need to be present i drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up i usually mix it with about sixteen to thirty two ounces of water if ism exercising it'll drink one while ism exercising an i tend to drink one after exercising as well many people are scared off by the idea of ingesting sodium because obviously we do not want to consume sodium in excess however for people to have normal blood pressure and especially for people that are consuming very clean diets that is consuming not many process foods or highly process foods oftentimes we are not getting enough sodium magnesium in potassium and we can suffer as a consequence and with element simply by mixing water taste delicious it is very easy to get that proper hydration if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element t day cam slash supermen to claim a free element sample pack with

have tracked your career for a very long time grow up in escapeword thing i i know had your poster on my wall i think your name is synonymous escape wording as i think a question that probably get asked from time to time but was just clarify the data from the outset tony hawk is your real name right yes anchovy frank hawk but i never went by anchovy my i ma my parents call me tony since i could remember it it is a fitting name i given the sport and what you do and we will get into the kilobit later when we talk about family and parenting and parents am but ill elude to the story now that a when i was fourteen years old your parents took me in i slept in your bed in your collie while not with you in it but surrounded by your a near infinite number of trophies and and a it must have been right after i moved out sis would be ways fourteen years old they tough to tell as story now very briefly i was fourteen years old was it a contest at linden's ta boys club everyone left me in another can name billy madman a we are still there your dad said were were you going am it was clear that i did not know where i was going my life was i was wayward youth at that time and they took me in for a a night maybe even two nights your mam a nancy and your dad frank we are gracious brought me in in your home took me to dinner am i do not relax lev me that tract that let out it does not my dad and an my mob together would be doing that yes incredible people a and we'll get back to that story later because you and i actually met a the next day in falbrock at your rant but a fans a hadst an eighty eight eighty nine that is right i mean to say onto say eighty nine look and it must have been one of the either essay or castle contest young that your dad was very active in but we will get back to that but ai have m any questions that relate to scapewarding to you and really as a narrow scientist to the whole concept of a life of continual progression because wet the re not people listening to this and watching this or scape orders or not and i imagine that most of them or not it is absolutely clear that you have been in this came a very long time and that you've somehow manage to continued to progress over and over to come back from very severe injuries and somehow keep getting better and better the first question i have is about the younger version of you i did you have any sort of self concept i want to be a triathlete or i want to be escapeorder or i want have a video game named after mix exactly a but if you can think back to maybe even preescapewording do you remember what your self concept was this notion of ism i a self and ism either similar a different to yer is a someway when i was young i was put in a lot of advance classes and not that that felt like could badge of honor i felt more i was just classified as a hurry but then i thought o capable that is my strength it'll lean into that and and i thought that maybe i would be a teacher cause i about bit i get all these concepts and i think i could relate them to kids or to to my peers i because i helped lot of my classmates through some some classes i that is all i really had i did not know and then when i would place forts i would i would be o we was not i was not terrible but i was not the i p the p and i was just kind of plain baseball plan i baseball i and then when i found skateboarding i mean it was it was pretty obvious that i was what i want to do it was once once i got on a scaleboard and realized that i could maneuver it and do things that were unique and not there moving the needle or any one carried but they were unique in the sent lie didn't i never seem on do this and this feels also and i just one to this and i did not think that this is my career i was ten such skeletons this was my less this is my hobby this my think and i do not want to play these passports anymore did you stop playing all the others yes i i quit i quit little big in the middle of the season when my dad had been appointed president of that chapter of little league because he was the coach he was always very involved in all this kids i have three siblings he was always very support of whatever they were doing and then when i was playing baseball he became a coach cause he had time and he was doing that e as he was being almost retired and then he was such a prominent figure in the little big they said of your president now and then some one else was coach and then i was scaring and i was over it did you immediately start escape boarding in the parks on transition as in or shorter were you pushing round in the driveway i mastoids it was i was transportation and scaring was kind of a fat i started in seventy eight roughly may be seventy seventeen and it was kind of a fad kids is had skateboards and they would they would all cruise run you do not it was a seventy everyone had o bite right and you knew wherever all the kidsberg has the bikes on the front one and then at some point that kind of turned into scaring everyone had scapegoat they were all said he no a case penny or big box stored skateboards no one had really good one not lira but then at some point we were just looking at his magazines of people skating and everyone setting in pools cause that was the dog woman zealous there i was case were flying i wandered where do we do that and the e scape ark gout up in sit ego ah non mar caper i scape ways o cnweaways escape ark was the first one in aura i call i take that back spring valley was the first cape part i tried to go there and i was nine and you had to be ten and i remember stating in the personal looking over the fence an my dad did not realize what they cause my doubt would easily lied for me but he did not realize there was an age element was hold as he nine sorry cannot come and then they closed not long after when i never got scapespring belly cause i i think of you as synonymous would dell mar state wrench short we that was that came later because always escape part was open that this was when i first one was seventy eight i a friend of mine was going you said i one to go to the scapepark i had to go get is such a host i had to go get the authorization form i had to get notarized by the bank for my parents to go there and then i went and it was that was my piano when i first saw people flying around in person i was this is what ism doing for as long as i could possibly do it cause it looked it looked magic it really did look there were flying on magic carpets and and it spoke to me in the sense of being a dare devil but also doing it individually not relying on my team not i getting getting hostel by a coach it was just oh i could be part of the scene but do my own way and then i i scared always is as much as i could as whenever he rides there and then my parents move to north county sit niece when i was in high school mostly because they were just chasing kind of real estate deals and i an and i got lucky that do mar state ranch was right there every other park closed the dommarscape ranch remained open mean there was a bit of luck to all that and new is based on geography your dad's involvement is interesting because i got in escape boarding because my dad was not around that much at that time a lotto scatting escape worm because it does not require parent involvement was it unusual to have parental envovoment at that stage ye i mean i remember frank and by the way i remember frank and nancy your parents withwich with such fondness not just cause thy took me in but i remember thinking the they were at times the only point of stability in a landscape of like to hundred people where as the be potential chaosipin o time and your dad had this way of moving about he was not afraid i recall that he was not afraid to say what he thought hag do not do that imposed some regulation yet contest and at the same time it seemly also understood that this was a sport unlike other sports your knock in a regulate kit is me at the time or a you can trunk control people what was it to have your dad involved and the reason i ask is that your apparent will talk more about parenting but also it seems that he went from saying of u a little league other sports which is more typical to oka this kind of unusual sport scapegoating but your mere interest in it was enough to get him excited or motive enough to take you around to these places that is pretty special and that is pretty was i mean in in that respect it was great to have his support and and to rely on him for that the fact that he was always grounded he was in charge of a lot of the events the thou that sucked because because he just marked me ah as one being favorite ah and spoiled ah and and most o my friends their parents did not want them skating even though they were stoke that my dad ha was was doing this kind of thing and giving that kind of support they still were your dabs here this is our thing this is our scene this is our get away from our parents i i did not really have a choice in the matter i did i did at some point tell him my my concerns and my frustrations with it but he d smelly wont o hear it n he was he was very much steadfast while m been coming this far you can we can keep our distance at these events but people are relying on me to organize them and i decide to suck it up for while did it push you harder i you enough you could prove yourself with arm wording they index have to worry about yanks a favoritism is ultimately i you cannot fake you cannot fake escape right right i mean there is no deep fake version anon escape ere no you either can do it or you cannot do it and it is shown in real time and i suppose back then i recall you were requite a bit skinny your skinny aroma o i had i had all kinds of things going against me ut that is ye i mean i do not think people l realize us unless they met you in person but now it is their few taller escape orders out there to the sports grown much but you are pretty tall you six six three but i was not when i was drawn when i was that age i was very small and kind of concerning small because by the time i got to be sixteen i was still i look i was thirteen i use to get pulled over i literally i had a car that i bought with my earnings at a hontacivic nineteen seventy seven m c c and i would get pulled over and then the cops would be i how older you sixteen will you look you were thirteen back there and then i shot up around age seventeen that is interesting and we can get back to this when we talk about your almost remarkable levels of ability to recover from physical injuries because well you share a little bit a by allobjical theory here which his at the other popular study longevity and perhaps the fastest rate of aging that we ever undergo is puberty rig if you think about it gan before puberty kid afterbrusly different human being psychologically often physically as well some people have a longer ark of puberty than others and that does seem to correlate with a longer life and it is don of interesting my o some gets it puberty and they go through all the markers of puberty in one summer i the kids it is very very long and it sounds we don't to talk about when you hip puberty and the other markers but it sounds you're grow per occurred late oh that is a terrific marker of a long life by the way because what it reflects is the onset of a big burst of growth harmony out of the pituitary and e brain and if you continue to grow for a long permit of time that indicates you do not give heel little bit of the slope of h line some excepts oh yes i this this may have important and fortunate consequences it seventeen you shot up in my correct in remembering a maybe you said it may be somebody else did that you were forgive me but skinny when you were a kid that you actually for elbow pads is yet y that is a true that is a satori fer sure and and i took inspiration from others that that i identified with namely stove caballero because he was already an established pro when i started to come up in the ranks are getting get noticed at all and he was wearing allow pads on his knees in this full page picture of him in windcheater gunabackatar and i was that i want to do that and he is small and i feel that is my goal and and why yes stay if he can do that i can do it's is more oh this i identify with that and and that gives me hope and as i recall stove also as a pretty severe scoliosis r i why thong august what he has ye one point he was turned it turned pretty pretty maya to the writer left i do not recall what me still incredible scape water loves yet me he is a nor calmly o whatever he had is from birth but but it was more that that his size and i did not even know he was can't not many but i sick four years old win me i just as o there is small guise doing that i i can do it maybe but when i got tall when i went through during suddenly i had always tricks and then suddenly i had the strength and the the heights that gave me confidence and all was said it was a i can go way higher now and ism comfortable with these tricks the intricate board maneuvers an stuff that was a huge advantage to me the the smaller stuff felt different after that which was harder but being had to blast eighty in the airbus was a for feet near was a huge advance yet is not that wild when the nervous system knows how to do something and then your body changes and you can do the same thing but with much more voice even the bolls looked smaller when i would stand on toping like way this is not that big wild hell the reason i ask about this i think you non people listening generally seemed to assume that if you become a stand for professor become professional scape order or you fusional socraplayer that that you were just fated to become that right in is clear that it is the confluence of many different factors but one of the consistent factors for sure is a sense he just really love doing it right i mean i cannot imagine getting you knows proficient or excellent at anything without loving doing it right and still at this time when you were to say ism fourteen fifteen did you have any concept of whenever promote a ism going of none of that well there was there was none of that to be had we did not have these great aspirations because no one had really done that before there were you could have some success yes you could have maybe a signature model but even the top sails of skateboarding then was not a career the prize money was a hundred and fifty dollars for t first place a hundred for second fifty for third couple tanks gasp some food yes was put i this way i turned pro an own fourteen by the time i was fifteen and a half and i had a earnest permit and i could drive a a shooter i had six hundred dollars my bank account and i used that to buy mahatma express a motet for a year and a half that was my earnings was six hundred dollars clearly money was not the a the dopamine hit it was the it was the actual escape sure end it that is what i mean though there was not there was no goal of that because it just did not exist i d i did not care i getting i i had my own vehicle at age fifteen i was living large i can get t the casework on my own that was amazing to be fourteen and be a professional at anything must be a a trip to speak but what ism wondering about because i came up when your early cohort with palpralta for those a don't no call bones brigade rite guess it was wat model wat six seven guys over some of there i more pro fry than others bat about six seven a for guises in the various videos i mean eyes were famous right you posters am on gins walls who scapewoarded there was a second or maybe was a third surge of popularity in skateboarding because it would for surgeon general popularity then disappear and come back as it has over cases keeps coming in going om to some extent did you have a conscious a wariness of just how how much a tend ton was being placed on ye photos of view videos of you and ism just wondering about the younger version of you whether not you realize what was happening and the reason i ask is because you have always seemed to me somebody who through interviews throughvidios through our interactions and for those have known you much longer than i have i just very grounded i not caught up in it mum we have never seen headlines about you find of listen a blowing all your money ere you navy reckon cars and you no destroying your life it's sure you have made mistakes any of us but but you seem to avoided a lot of the pitfalls of cutting cot famous people and selebiries are tat you were a famous person from a very young age o i i well i think it was that i did not never i never that was never a goal and then when i had a sense of it i was very uncomfortable i mean i was happy i was happy to be successful i was happy that people recognized me that hi was amazing just because i was good escape working i never imagined something that i and but i was always very i mean some people thought that i was sort of i almost pompous or arrogant because i was not interacting because i was just i was walled off as i i now what to do don't coshlayse tat this is look last words i would ever use to describe you i think it was as more that that that people would see me it'd go to ramp i did notknow anybody and i just coruscating and it'd do all my stuff in there oh he does even talk o any one i no i knows i i do not know i do not what to do i do not not how to act now a outright fourteen years old i ti broke me out of that cause i remember one time there was a kid that was a staring at me to hold my scape word he had my seems your model and hes a come half what i very sure he wants he wants the inter act with you just go why fivelem or anything and and i learned to her to break out of my comforts own by doing that enough but my first go around a me t i was that was set of my first i a have of fame might say e bones forgat years and we were young that we thought this is for ever and we were defiantly careless with our our money with our actions and am and at some point my dad saw that he did nothing it as going to be long term cause now one had had a long turned career writ he he a encourage me to to invest to get property to to by house that was he that was my saving grace cause i devil was spending n a has and things a ya car kind of a little bit beyond my means i was not really considering all my money was was ten ninety nine in come was not we were not paying taxes on anything and the end of the year of you like owe you a this much wait what talking about am for instance my you onto go to why ye o we invite every one we are all gong to why i got little run a place o we an it was on me cause i had the means you mention stay we should proxy clarify for people am ponies referring to the great stay parallax the was he was the one who put me on the bones brigade when i was still considered sort of a circus act e me know my my skating was not really established the stuff that i was doing was largely made fun of because people thought that what i was doing was just more a free show can you explain more it mi and let me just say that my recollect first recollection of you that i still out that image in my mind would am is the finger flippers right for folk get ain't familiar escape board hanging up people righter on transition or in the street hand rail stares he not people pride familiar with all those things but am skipberals will riot up toward the top of the pool of the ramp and they'll do something on the called lip of the coping that is to it it the the edge of it or they will go above it it in the air but i recall seeing you do the fingertip a it'd never seen any one flip aboard in the air i than people yo very also for i move it this can be complicate for people just listening but just to flip it upside down and the catch it in an fingertip a yet that was i remember that was jaw draw writing was if that was considered circus ere a or circus a then i do not know i do not know what it was being compared to because at the time we we partly watch that it was in slow motion as i recall n we praywatched it three thousand time that summer there is a big group of us at all sour holy during that summer i would say wonted just before that in that window is when people were were more am giving me flak for what i was doing because i was mostly doing bored variation stuff but i still did not have the height the high thin terms of the height in terms in terms of getting in the air ye i was doing all the stuff kind of right at coping level and people were not taking it into consideration or giving it much merit because it was just o he is doing a little board twist or board turn and then when i started to get some height around the time you saw and started doing those tricks visibly way up high that is when the the the shift happened in terms a more acceptance but i was still labelled as a as a trick skater robotskater and then you had christian of so who was all stile he air is higher than any one any time he did a trick it was going to be flashy and amaze and riot our personal rocks or personality and in that are you i mean it was very divided was no one liked us both not ting it was strange to be of that age and of doing something that had never really been established and then something unfitted against another skater we are just trying to make our way through teen years and and scape boarding and and i got it was it was hard men it was like i got i got bully eyes i was successful o yes i was you but but i would get i would get i thrash your magazine would talk shit about my performance when i would win i remember that because i was from northern californium and thrash for magazine as scaleboard magazine from northern californium as she wrote for them for a while when i was a postdoc to make some extra money ah under a different name folks but you can try and find those articles they are out there u and then in southern californium it was scape order man trains world mostly trains world scapewoarding yeas men as the trains world trains will shape outing and thrash magazine were there that the rivals rid yum i recall some of those things that were said u it just as amazing to me but it brings about a really important lessen which has that kid that gets made fun of if they are determined and they love what they are doing that is going to be the kid that wills everyone away later and i know this for sure because it'll never forget there you remember the back to the city contests that were rattled in san francisco i went to those that we in the drain fountains in front of city hall i remember getting there one day and there was the sky with how fro hair pushing around he was doing what recalled daffier he had two scape words hem as kidding weaving around and i remember thinking ye sanfraciscoas got it it is issues now but back than it was rough also your different reasons i remember thinking disguise canto get beat up i hung out with the embark arrow crew disguise gan t get beat down the i was markings alias the one of the greatest perhaps the greatest street scape boarder if you cannot rely defend these things greatest and what not n escapewoarding but you now remember thinking disguise just he is a cook and then i realized who it was and then i realize he was just any other kid there at some level and then a lot of the kids that got teased early on they stuck with it five years later ism seeing them in the magazines and i think about this with podcasting too there been some poetasters that have reached out early on and had questions he new look at their stuff and you once initial impression can be i wonder lank what are they doing here and then you just see them two years later three years later and there doing amazingly well pandour this gyre galls here for good they are going they are probably me top of the game an if your e never count anybody out when you would go to sleep at night in that you are a were you laying on the pillowing i homacad people hate me their stuff in the magazines i got ta push harder this is hard did you talk your at about it i mean again it is a lot to bear r even as an adult i can only imagine what it is to bear as a fifteen year old kid i did normally have us for ho know or any resource to to voice those concerns i just knew i want to keep getting better that was it and if anything if i was worried about those voices for i was worried about the whatever take people had on me i knew i was going to go back to the scape park and learned more tricks and it is some point i had much of that as a foundation that it was sort of undeniable that were he can do all the stuff and he is not does not just do it at his home part and i think that is probably when the tide turned for me is when when i started to do well at other events namely plan pipe line which was for the most part the most frightening pool that we could write the thing was big but i also recall the e hips as they are called the transitions away they a shop we it was supertight lot of er giant coping super rough if you fell and plan you are getting shoot up it is pulling your need pounds down i did not know that was from the photos i would not know that oh i was it was treacherous et really was it was in and i wanted to do well at the event and i would drive up there every week and mike my friend a greakesmith was a freestyle but he lived near plan and o i would go try fridge after school straights up on say ta night skate sturdy all day skate sundae a early and then drive on clue senega and i just made of my missions an to figure that thing out because that was the proving ground for me u am id if i could say that i gosgetty as many of have been taking a one daily since two thousand twelve some delighted that they're sponsoring the pod cast a one is a vitamin mineral robotic drink that is designed to me all of your foundational nutrition needs of course i try to get enough servings of vitamins and minerals through whole food sources that include vegetables and fruits every day but oftentimes i simply cannot get enough servings but with a one ism sure to get enough fitments and minerals and the robotics that i need and it also contains adaptigence to help buffer stress simply put i always feel better when i take a one i have more focus and energy and i sleep better and it also happens to taste right for all these reasons whenever ism asked if you could take just one supplement what would it be i answer a one if you would to try a one go to drink a one do calm slash supermen to claim a special offer from now until august twelve twenty twenty three a one is giving away ten free travel packs plus a year supply o vitamin d three k to again if you go to drink a one calm slash supermen you can claim the special offer of ten free travel packs plus a year supply of vitemend three k to it is clear you had enormous drive let the struck a look it about the process of trying tricks the anxiety associated with it did you did you and do you have a for systematic process was it a even a learn the basics first did you say that do you say ism okay in a learnt had to stuff at coping level then ism a do little air than we o go bigger mu do this were did you just sort of am try what you wanted to try and ye obviously weren't haphazard about it the out it seems your pretty systematic about explore in what is possible and then pushing forward little by little but that may be could talk little bit about how you have conception i sit cake to morrow when i try this it comes in different forms but for the most part i think about how i could combine existing tricks and would this trick work going into this trick and could your body position shift or would it all work in unison and when i approach a new trick ism say ism saying more in the last twenty years my thought process is i have all the pieces to this have done every bit of it have done that have done the first part of the trick in another form have done the second part or the grinding of it or whatever usually in some other basic way and then the landing is while the landing is from whatever that is and if you can throw all those things together and make the timing work it is going to work and i never i never went at something with some harlot hazard approach or throwing caution of the wind hopeless see what happens it is always very much i know i have all these things and i just have to put him together and i mean now things are technical that my same approach that ism doing hundreds of times one of hem just works and it is not because i did not it is not because i committed to that one it is because of some tiny fractional adjustment that happened that i did not even know happen and it just work and and that kind of is the curse of what tricks are now cause there a play of moves that have done over last ten years even that i only u dance cause it was too fuck and hard to get to and i did not learn from that one make and that that is that is hard to accept cause in the past i was learning tricks to have them in my arsenal that i count just throw him down at a competition or a demo have got them o my pocket these days that trick for instance i did a a de three sixty shove it five odifaky i has to let us break that ti have real three we to shove it but who seem to take this on it'll let you take this on i contrive for my knowledge and first acted bear it will will will you sixty shove it is pushing the board with your feet and letting it spin a full three sixty rotation under your feet and a landing back on it it is it is a trick that people do on using on background have learned have learned to do it up on the very walls i can do three sixty shove its kind of in the air but ism doing that ism doing it through sty shove it and ism landing on my truck right the axle between the we all hung at one all and a what we call five old position which is basely a wheel on the truck everything is precise i got do through sixty shove it exactly a certain spot on the wall have got ta catch it that it might truck lands when my foot hits it i cannot push it into the truck cause that that screws up my balance it has to land on the truck i have to land with my weight perfectly set back enough that i can come in backwards because ism doing this trick and and ism ism gun come in fake right three sixty shove five o to coming an forward is as a whole different beast that that i can probably do that just in a few tries but the idea that i have to land on this thing balance on it a teeter totter and then reverse my energy and come in baby backward it is a hard it is hard to to get in to the right position any time i try it there is a one intend chance ism evening to get into the position i need and that is the one i have to commit to every time i do it it intense and it takes much much commitment and and much a mind i do not even know how to explain it the the that you have shut everything else out except this one moment and this one fractional piece that you have to make work and it have done at once i i would love to do it again but i know what is going o sign to take the same on effort i did not learn from that one that i made some trick that makes it open every time it is all tactical another many things can go wrong that all as except that i kagu at once in think about the thresysy shot it five fake yah was that something that you thought of the night before you decide that day do you ever use visualization if you ever had ism learning come to you in a dream or find that you try try try something when to sleep that night next day made it anything that yes sometimes it'll wake u mill night and it'll write down something cause i others this trick oh i think i could do that ye it'll get me i do you dream about scape wording from time to time ye well ye that as shifted a bit after i got hurt but ye i used to dream that i cannot scape ism trying and tit it feels the ramps made a carpet i cannot get the speed i cannot get the timing and then as i went through this dramatic injury my dreams shifted you while i cannot scape i can do all my tricks again oh interesting ye a little a piece of science around they cannot ah cannot scape piece or when people feel their bolted down in a dream or they cannot run away ye there is this one face of sleep called rapid i movement sleep where the brain is very active the dreams associate with it tend to be very vivid and at the same time we are completely paralyzed and the ideas that no one really knows why but that it is the case that were paralyzed to prevent us from acting out our dreams it is also and interesting her a chemical phenomenon cops dreamy is rapid give movement dreams they tend to be very intense but the body cannot release a crinoline it is almost its own form of drama therapy's your experiencing this intense thing in your mind but your body great ye and often times people i have argued that that is why you feel you want to moving you cannot because actually can some people have woken up while still a bit paralyzed in red if yo ever had that happened we went o but i but u actually couple my kids of have struggle with that couple times yer ram interference is all it is not dangerous and usually people consult themselves out but it is kind of terrifying such interesting to well get to a discussion about the the recent injury and thankfully recovery from the injury i not miraculous because that makes it seem as if its surprising frankly ism not surprise that you have recovered but it is i spectacular a the way you have but you are saying that in your dreams before the injury you would think about scape whoningwut you felt there was a kind of lo wen i was doing it in my dream there was always some rowlock that i just cut i why cannot i get my speed why cannot i why cannot i snap or do this trick ism it is more in the moments where itstwilight moments where ism kind of awake and ism thinking about tricks that everything else false away and i can actually focus on what kind of new moves to come up with i i an example of that was i recently i went to the excuses in japan few weeks o i and i was thinking i was going to go mores you show my support and because they had a very event there is not a lot of vertevents any more if there is a very event it is kind of li could you build hat i will come cause i want to show my support that is that the kind of where my heart is and they had a best trick event and i thought man maybe i could get in the best trick of the anything new though and ism still recovering from my leg and then at some point i was falling asleep when i thought oh i could do that trick an come in when it i know i could do that with with my current state and not getting that much speed to explain what i was doing is is i half cab body raise baxiblunt of we can walk through this half a o a as come up backwards coming ever call right to half you o out t i approach the top of the round i body trail that means i jump around and then i jump run on my board and then i make sure that it lands with my two trucks out and my tail on the coping which is very precarious and have done that and come in fake that is the blunt piece that is the blunt have done that where i ere and then you have to you have to use your be to lift up board come in fake right have done that have done that twice and i thought well whet if there is something i could do that and then i realize that if i just keep coming around and i come in backs idea direction that keeps my body spinning and not might i sly be easier it was not but i figure it up i think i saw a clip of this on ins did it ye i did it i did it excuse and i was it was my last proton i was it was an me it did not move the needle i got seven place but for me it was a huge moment it felt amazing i bet oh ye for sure i me an't if i ways i me nit was by weeks preparation and n trying to figure this thing out i made it twice before the event om on my own along on my ram but i that is just an example of of i was i was literally falling asleep in the olsinoms i have got by roll taxi blunt i love it that liminal state between wakefulness in sleep is such a beautiful state that if one is open to ideas showing up there ye they almost always to i ti tried to search in it the next morning do you ever find that when you are taking walks or in the shower or not thinking about scape word o ye that is usually in in the sort of mundane moments that that i get inspiration do you have practices for pure relaxation aside from socialization know i i was never i think that something have been lacking i i never was good at warming up stretching post warm up am the or or or relaxing meditation nothing i just i i skate and it is on am and as have got an older i realized that is not the best technique but it is work far it has work a for you it is go holy a little bit warm up if you i have ware of a sort of o c d warm up run that i use to gauge how ism feeling but i kind have to get through that a surgeon when a surgeon's about to do a surgery they do not warm up they just check off the various boxes of y test her that is there make sure that they are comfortable in their environment and then they they do the the life saving work ya my it'd say my warm run is is kind of basic tricks but they give me a sense of how how stiff or how i would i need to adjust for for the rest of the day i guess it is not o s d but but i dedn'tly feel i got a got through that routine what feels the best i i know that making a new trick feels incredible special if you ben at a long time dining it in that you can do it again and again it is it is own form of reward year but what is the maybe list of two or three things that just feels good wheel that for sure learning you tricks not even that that it is something that i created but just doing something the have never done before when i first learned various backs id various no one had done backside barrels before they soft in done front side a and a serials were you you reach down grab your board jump in the air and then turn it when aid under your feet it is it is a shit but you are guiding with your hand i learn that half way up the pool the the main pool in a way adowasis with no one around and the feeling i got when i rode away was something that i never experience and it is as literally the buzz that have been chasing ever since because it was i created somethingverials below coping was that was the but how was it it really was and and if you saw bit you one it like that thing what can i say it was it was the first time that i thought i thought of it i i went through all the motions of it i did the work and i figured it out and no one no one cared but at some point i was able to do it six feet in the air and do a full three sixty barrel and that was the building block but but that feeling was no other it'd say that and then just even to to strip everything else away the most basic trick a backside all is is it and no handed trial that used to be what was called backside no handed trial it feels good because even to this day people people say i spporstay on your feet and i cannot even tell you how the board says on my feet i just know i know how to maneuver it and i know how to keep the pressure on it and the friction going and backside always is i think it is a marvel of physics and a clean backstop to me as feels good as anything that is a beautiful thing to behold i confess have never done a legitimate back sat all an very on a mantra sure but not on very i cannot relate to the feeling but i love love love the fact that you brought us back to that early serial below coping feeling and that that marks the absence of what feel good when you do something else righting throve a it is a is an early i is is y is a chemical stamp it is a thahemical finger print of progress right ell ism also delighted to hear that it still feels that good to do these thin cause i do not think any one can have the kind of life long progression that you have had and it still going a without a not just love of the thing but love of the feeling that it brings when no one's around cause you did scaring our ramp by yourself often are you on your ramp with know one's filming for in serum no nothing for avidin nothing for a video game none of that maybe there is maybe other giver round gals around will talk about galls to cause one of the big shifts in escapeboarding since i started is that there's some amazing female scale right now ah there is a young lady in fact that is been escape went your ramp forgive me i cannot remember her name is it real threes reason nelson goodie item goodness gracious no she is ya good good good a we will get back to that but i think that people starting any kind of sport or academic career or business or anything i think people assume that you go from seer to a hundred somehow and that there are these people that are just selected by genetics or by lock or by some combination of things to just i get it and be better than everybody else but it is clear that you've spent a lot of time alone driving some place the scape the next day or alone at the ramp you we do you ever reflect on that kind of drive and what what what that is all about or is it just intrinsic to who you are and nay i do not i do not think about it i just know i have to do it it is i man it i would not get into with my injury but i but but to go back to what your saying is you saying that people think that oh you were chosen for this or genetics whatever you last things talk aft i all ongesgate ye when i first started scaring there was no way you would think that i was natural or that i had any future in it i was all gangly azole plays i was eating said left him right it just it it was not i was not good i was not i was not a natural have seen people old that are naturals and have seen that how they do not have that drive they do not have the discipline and it is not wasted but i they just do not they do not you doglike then do not take advantage of what they have naturally and and for whatever reason i do not do not fault any one for it but have seen both sides of it and have also seen other skaters who are just driven and who are not really good conofslobby and become the best and adrenals the when we put him on our team he was just me super gangling is boards bouncing around but he is trying every single trick and every time he send me a video it is some new technique that he is figured out and he did not really a by untrained i he did not have the skillet for and then he became the boss an i mean i think it is just you have to you have to give that as much weight as natural him if not more it'd say more y i would certainly say more for science and you other people are in the lab late at night in early in the morning in drilling way not you not always the smartest certainly not the a demist but smart enough to show up when other people are leaving and continue and i think there has to be a little bit of friction internally i many i most be ma they be externally also but just some frictions son ism going to show you ye ye e my best example of that and i have not talked about this yet cause i did a privately but i i broke my leg doing to man test something that have done thousands of times by forty five forty you it is it is a one and a half spin in the backside direction but that particular grab that you do makes it a me twist because it makes you kind a flip upside down is kind about one and a half some fault i it is not my tricks might magic's trick i learned it not long after he created it in nineteen eighty four been doing ever since ism time out forty years mess right have gotten her once or twice but not bat anyway i fucked around and found out did one with no speed last year thinking i could do it i was still twenty and got tangled up and and broke my fearer i had a stumer long recovery i had a false start i had a non union fracture which means my bone never connected back t itself and kept pushing itself further away am and that is all i in the past i i got a second surgery in nonmember and all along in the back of my head is i got to get back to five forties i have to and i cannot explain why i have to i hate that it means that much to me but it it is in here you know me it is not it is not a sense of pride it is not i have to prove this to any one i just have to do it and last week i did it scary and i crept for it i i mean i even down to my diet and i i stopped drinking altogether and i was every time i go to the ramp ism just trying five forty to get the spin to get to get the landing zone with no intention to make yet just that i had to get there and then i had to have this heart to heart with my wife that she doesn't want to see me get her shoes do not see me risking myself this age any more she doesn't want to live through another dramatic injury with me and i had to tell her i have to do this she was gracious and accepting and that is all i could ask for it was not she was ya you got to go do it was oke and you are and she was there she was my only spectator it confess have seen o video of this and my first response was ah a yes ain my second response was that was really high this is no just above coping five politic this is an even this is a head high five fort ism not gong to make the same mistake i did last time where i try o low thinking i just get away with it any more or the going high was more of a safety measure which is ironic the the the bigger the ramps for me the safer it is because i have a better landings i have more time in the air to the just and even though it look spectacular and usixteeing the is no i need that i cannot scape some eighfootpool have no landings ism too tall ism too i moved too slowly now to do that kind of stop that is why you do not see me in the park events like that your gong to see me on this fourteen folder ram because that is my happy place and that is where ism safe ah but also having my wife there i just knew i was not to get heard from her cause i would i in such trouble the the emotional support and pressure is a is a real thing and in the best ways a not to focus on the bad aspects of the injury because there are the plenty the ad that i recall you and i communicated not long after the it is a butts call it what it was the first break and i remember you said to me over tax you said how long before ism scape warding again and i said am scape warding as in pushing or skinhording as in am what you do on very and you said a what i do on very and i said what seems you are doing a lot of things you were doing deliberate cold deliberate he pressure you would number of things and you are not hap hazard about your career in your body and your health and will get into that limit later come of the things you've enjoyed as beneficial for you but am you said ism calling it at two months and i i said o we ah i believe it and then i recall that you was it the scar or some the reward event where you came out about a week later you came out there walked out you broken fever and you were not using any support to walk i you clearly ditched whatever support you might have been using of which i think is awesome by the way u and then you soon i would think idiot of you dropping in i think tit he is of you doing kick turns below coping i seen bet else of you at coping and young we have a friend in comment in thiscscapeward and generally photographer my play back and i remember tasting miles pony's back already this is this is superhuman rates of healing and i think it is superhuman rates of healing then you mention that you damaged broke broke the fever again do you allow more rest the second time what was driving yes i well back it us sparsely but first go round i just did not listen to any of the professional advice because i thought while have done have come this far and have always been able to push through broken pals broken elbow ah surgeries and have always been the time lines always very shorten for me because i just get back out there and i and i get the healing started but i also am comfortable with what people think of extremely risky but in this instance i want to get back out the right away and not long after the academy wards i i was actually walking with the cane at that time and i ditched the cane just to walk out on stage to present the arms that was my big my big coming out moment but it was kind of forest and as soon as i walked out the say got my can and i was howling in the back stage but i was i was skating cut of a mean ramp and and i was already struggling because i could not put my weight on my front foot because my bone still had not connected to itself there's a gap in the bone but there is a there is a nail but they called nail big piece of metal that is holding them in place but i did not realize how careful i need to be with that because it was precarious and i decided ism going to drop in on the mineral i think ism ready and and it was not the drop in on the mantrap it was me getting to the top of the minyramp and stepping off my bonito is always that korandov but but i just stepped off my board i would do any other day but i did not think i led with my front foot and i felt the bone move in that moment i i really i felt it i felt it either twist or get out a place and i was in total denial for months cause i just set all just it just hurts now i id i got a minor set back and then i finally eight months into my recovery seven months into my recovery i was always in pain my skating was not progressing i could not get speed and by all measures i should be back at least it'd be back to a level that i feel good about and i went got extract and they said your bone never connected you haven't on union fracture and and and and every time i skated my bones this every time i skated i was pushing it further away and my bone was this on the last ax ray and and that was the hard truth for this livid luck just latterly displace thing about a pipe that is broken in the middle an just once offset to the other and and as i keep skating and i i could force my skit i can o learn this hack where i can put seventy five per cent on my way on my back foot and twenty five percent my front foot and do what i wanted to do but it was not where i thought it'd be and it just hurt all the time i meant really was that was my trigger because i id have a pretty high tolerance t pain and it was always like i i would dread going to the airport knowing i had to walk to a gate i knew something s wrong there i went to a specialist that deals in non union fractures and he had a very pragmatic factual approach and was i ought i would do this ism take my nail out and take the other hardware out and put it together and you cannot move for two months did you obey that or did really ye what is shelling i was not in is that again did you and do you prized things sleep u nutrition just generally and did you emphasize those things while you were recovering from the entry ye i i i was very disciplined in my diet in my schedule an my sleep surprisingly i i was very busy because i do speaking engagements and suddenly my speaking engagements were getting books left him right me to he point where i i did two or three rope last summer of speaking engagement that was suede that was a sober lining against to my my idle time and i leaned into it i made myself available and and i it no it is good money and it was i fun to to interact and but all through all through that of course the in the back of the head as i went when can i scape mi can i scape and then when i finally started scaring it was night and day with my leg i felt i could lean forward suddenly i was learning tricks every every session relearning tricks i just i just lucky that i got to live in this time of modern medicine was that two months the longest you have ever gone without scapewarding her ye y without getting at all not even just push in or in i good for you for obeying doctors orders and also finally and also good for you for deciding that your rate of recoveries going to be whatever it is for you because i feel ism hearing both things on the one hand you listen to the medical professionals on the other hand ism not hearing oh i look at the average rate coverage from this kind of fracture this an that it is is it is as if you decided two things at once that there are experts who have something to offer me here it'll follow their advice and yet ism the expert at myself here ism putting myself in your first person a pony's the expert an tony and ism gong to make sure that i come back a under present year better yet not better but ism and i and i have come to terms with that because i know that ism not going to be pushing myself the way that i did before i got heard any more there are some tricks now that are way more difficult just because whatever is something changed in my body and for instance i cannot grab slob lie i cannot i i cannot do it consistently i you see mi go to rap could do that any time over sixty foot gaps whatever i could i desorb i knew where my board was i knew that was get to hold on my feet and half the time i try to grab that way now i do not reach it or i grab my foot instead and i i do not know i cannot make the adjustment to fix it and give just sort of come to terms with up that is nothing go to gravity more and that is who a yet i had a good in yet r yourcance pretty pretty and a vast there is a lot of other things to reach to aside from the five forty which by the way congratulations not only as it i forty but a done at least head high have seen it with my own eyes and ism and under really great circumstances your wife there just the two of you and after and the trick that broke the fever in the first place i congratulations on that i to take a quickbreak and acknowledge

for now the ye i i i want to get my hand plants back the way us to do him i have yet yet theme likes its one hand in hands tom uh i can do them now but i have seen you to them recently ya it a but i use these to be my signature was the tacking over and flapped all the way back and and i cannot get a hold of my word to pull it all the way back i use to if i can get that it'll feel i that is it that is that is that was the last mile softly ism not here to i dignoson en treat these a specific a scape what trick isms but between your what you said about the slaw ear and what you saying about was this outta seems their same thereabout about getting your your your my from hand around and and round my sailing it back back id a behind you maybe this is the way that the fevers lining up with your pelvis and maybe some offer him something or other i the the i do i i am actually working with a best core he is a he is the doctor of physical therapy and he has helped me immensely through my recovery and when ism frustrated with this motion or that is the same grab actually has in the twist he worked on me before it and was just contorting my body and my leg into these positions that i do not really even get to when ism scaring just to prepare me for that and he did but that is what it look it is interesting that were a talk he mot scape wording and we are also talking about physical therapists when time i nutrition is ti cut not sleep growing on me i none of that none o the never imagined never an and ism chuckling was you no growing up scape wording early on for me a not quite earless you but pretty early twelve and got out of it n back and yes i can still do a thing or two here and there but that is not the point the point is at the nutrition consisted largely of fast food or whatever was around cigarettes and beer were sort of the the energy drinks and a i and am supplements of of the times this is fortunately changed but there there is mentally no health promoting tools or aspects et at all but that was back then but then over time it seems it is evolve now i see am i saw a couple post from stove willies he is in the him sum i think i saw nanny way early on working with pall chat and doing some balance work back work cause he had broken his neck siring and things the sort there seems to a been a big shift over the last fifteen twenty years were scape orders are taking good care of their bodies other ashes thinking about the razilients of their bodies and also generally taking better care a lot of am of not to drink an do drugs and all those sorts of things i mean how does it strike you to see the way that scape hoardings evolved towards the option to be much healthier entreat it a serious sport where you are serious let the word that even fifteen years ago twenty years ago if you call tasgidboarder and athlete some people might him be offended oh a people escape boarding absolutely ye we will to answer question in the early days that was part of the the seen in the culture j cause the t it was the antithesis to organized team sports and mainstream culture and it was just yet is what we do forge cares we drank and we scared and everyone is it was wild west right but as i never fell into that deeply because i saw how it affected people's performances and the scaring itself was paramount to me that is what i want to focus on that is what i want to be good at and i saw people partying and partying their skills away i had at least that forethought and then as scanning got more established popular more of a career option then people started taking more seriously especially competitors i mean but there is such a wide swath of of what scape warding is and it is a big tent to say that it is more organized yes it is organize over here they are still all these skaters over here partying hopping fences do not care about contest do not want monsters o gas one thousand those kissed am hills an sarasato it u but that that at a a a bags is the diversity of it all and that that is we are all part of this scene i i was a competitor that was that was my path to success and i appreciate that people take it more seriously now and that they do have trainer they have resources mean they have sponsors that will pay for this kin of stuff here was no such thing commie at our biggest cape contest we were all staying at stay parts parent's house the night before and he would take us out to get spigetty because he thought caryatid dates was going to give us energy the next day that always the extent of training in nineteen eighty three i but nowadays it were treated i a need athletes because they are if you really look it people there o the top of their feel people not you used ton i to mean the doit s a machine he is he is one of the most precise skaters that we have ever seen or precise athletes the side of not oncoming each you n yes ism i i m ism aging myself but what ism saying is this is this it takes hard core dedication precision athleticism and devotion and now they have the resources to back that up and to keep it going longer i mean die would i be able to do this now especially after getting hurt without the help of a doctor of physical training probably not i do it on some level but i would not get to where i am now and my i think it is also you know i i never i never wanted to cove it skateboarding as this thing that no one else catlike a gate keeper to it no one else can touch it i always thought there was something o scape boarding that was magical and that was good for mental health and that was that was required such required such passion and i did not i never understood why it did not get bigger through those those lean years as always i kids this speaks to kiddie it is it is their devil and it is active and it is exciting and you can do it as a group but you can do it your own way and i do not know all those things it took a long time for everyone else to figure it out the does not finite it out i mean nowadays skaters of the coolies in school as and the olympics li there was always discussion would it be was an exhibition sporting theolympics at one to point no no no o i thought it was it formate it had a run it potentially being an exhibitioner were there was talk about it got om butts it never did an and not the i mean it some point especially in the late nineties pretty thousands skiing was getting appreciated and and kind of reached that threshold of a is it mainstream well it is in it is all mac dona's commercials i guess that is pretty mainstream and we already had come of age and it was we do not ending lyrics we are already more popular than a lot of lymph sports right why do we need their validation and then at some point it became the the power dynamic shifted it was oh they need are cool factor we do not need their validation and d it was lie yoke you guess on it sure go ahead but hold the events hold the call fires well participated but we do not need this who've been an amazing ambassador for the sport that is driven much of that wider acceptance and progression and invitation into different domains one of the a thinks that i deflyuont talk about is the vidiogame i because i think that the video game changed a lot of things for the general public in terms of their perception escape wording i mean what it aloud of course is this is obvious but it allowed kids it were not going to a bang up their shins or walk in with a broken was i you all skinned up to to do incredible tricks but in silicon on a screen right and to a pretend that they are that the prostate order a ton yo wat what vidiogames are about and yet when you can see something just you can imagine it in a dream or while you are falling asleep and you can see something and and hearing air quit to do something in of video game it also is going to inspire a number of kits o outside and grab a real scape word and try that or try something that clearly the video game was a catalyst for what i concerned now the the wide acceptance of scape wearing as a sport in all its various forms a count use talk for a bit about the genesis of the video game were you individio games prior gather the do game am were you intotechnology generally and in what e sort of motive a the interest in the video game because it certainly has changed the face of actual scape boarding and the perception of scape boarding a what have been into vino games since the gecko may i was a kid you plan pom hackman miss command cuber you name at and then getting the home systems in television subcranial common or sixty four am sang saga ya but but i am and i always loved technology when i when i finally started making money in the kiddies my first count of big purchase in terms of that in in terms of electronics was a commodore mega which was considered one of the highest end a home computers alongside mac but but more graphic orient an an more game on am and i was always in to that idea that you could do this kind of stuff at home locust in arcades and then i got a i got a call from a piece programmer the wanted to pitch escape game and had a crude engine of am scatter that cruise round going bowls myself i got and yet was love keyboard control lives clunky but a something and the last thing that we had as scaring was seven twenty in the arcade or stator die for home systems for comonersis for that was the last thing that had happened for scape wording a invidious games and i went with him i was excited to i got to we got to go to nintando and pitch a we went to midway we went to all these different a consul and softer manufacturers and were just told that this is a bad idea scape when he is not popular how video games are barely a thing why would anyone want to buy a video game about scaleboard some one said those exact words to me at midway and he got frustrated he needed to find a job and i was i was just cone a free floating thought o an gas well ism ism knocking to do this but i feel you have established yourself at least in the video game world a industry that your interested in doing something so maybe some one does something to call you anoas i ye right sure sure enough a year later at did vision called me said hay we heard you want to do a midi game i said well yes i would love to work on ta video game ism not a programmer or anything we have something working on i would to show to you and i went up track o vision a they were working on a scape game but it was based on an engine of a game that was already release called a pocalips starring brace wills the first version of my game was brace wills on a scaleboard with the guns dropped to his back in it desert was land doing kickslips and it was also it was i was truly i picked it up and i got past that visual and then i started playing it and and it was intuitive it the motion felt right the engine was right and i was this this is the base line of something special i did not think it was going to be some big hit i just thought this is this is going to be appreciated by skateboarders and that was my got the entire a development process which was about a year and a half after i signed on we threw that year and a half we were going back and forth with they would they would fear me builds on seeders i had a modified plantation and i would play at make notes and i thought manskaters going to dig this and that was it and skating was even that popular it was coming to it it was starting to get some traction what your wasissgan ninety eight was games were staring to come to the fold people were taking note of whats when no had become at that point and then i thought the skin to be cold skaters in a it and then not long before the release they called me and they said hey we went o we went off for you to buy out of future royalties for this game cause i think you knot this i think you've men a it most what dies tat mean that g will give you half million dollars and then you do not get royalties going forward but you get that money a front and at that time my life to fearsome was a half million dollars seriously sounded half a billion dollars no one never talked about numbers that big to me also ninety eight was a little bit of a of a quiet time for vertscape boarding to sure ye was all to general went but ye r very luckily overstating still was a thing because of inlineskating because inlinskating was huge right late nineties and they were all very and we had skaters got to sort of ride those coat tails cause it was i gat there our her rams for everyone roller beating i forgot about that than that dad it and i have honestly i was the special guest at a couple of inline role blade shows where was this as team roller play alive and special guest do not holt the scape order and i was i i droving in but it paid the bills chancier o to to for from what you were saying vertsgating was it was a thing at least establish in the escapes which was something and enough for us to make a living i when day offer me this money i actually was in a pretty good place ism in terms of my i do not know my options n mi my trajectory and i felt and i had just bought a new home and i thought ism man take a chance and to see what happens and i the was the best financial dies n i have it took the equity ye i just let a ride but was not want to see what happens with us and as soon as the game was released it was getting stelleryiews and then i remember the very next week after was release never stopped saying cave were works on number two what you want to what o you mean we were doing sequel with what blossom the we went of doing ten maze crazy making ism thinking about your decision to not take the cash and desert how it would go ism thinking about i your decision to buy car at sixteen and yet as a cons clans get pulled over cause you looked younger i ism thinking about the time when through the graciousness of your parents you took me in cause i had no money to get back up to northern californium and they couldn't get a hold on my malm i they took me to your home but then they took me to where you were living the next day which was in falbrook you do not remember this but i do i man i know you heard the story before forgive me because most people the saying haven't but remember getting driven up to falbroock you it the ramps in your back yard i walked in got introduced to you you ere very gracious said hello what is up ism said feel free to push round on the rams outside it was the in it was a spine rout you you ism two ramps back back folks spine a sorry join cloture i i think ray under hill was there ye he lived prefer while and as i recall you had i pretty vast music collection and will talk about music i but it also seemed t your thirst couple cars in the driveway and what not but it is clear to me based on a number of things and that interaction and what i observed there that either you had some one in your ear either your dad or mum or both or maybe it had been stay or maybe was somebody else who was advising you to make very good financial decisions not spend all your money or continue to spend all your money am to investing things you know or maybe it was just instilled in you at a young age who knows ism asking because i think many people burned there early success what represents a lot of wealth for them early on they burn that where they start making just bad decisions you explain before why you tended to avoid drugs an alcohol certainly am any severe relationship to drugsralcall that would keep you from progressing and scapewarding but the ability to make really good decisions as a young famous the is more rarer than it is common even when people have coaches ism curious where did that a shrewdness and that prudence come from and was frank your dad and maybe nancy also youknow advising all all hate am think smart be smart because clearly made som some very smart decisions he was definitely a guide in a he he was the first one who said you should prove by real state i was seventeen i did not even know that was possible but he cosigned and made a possible am but then after that i had to buying that ham that you went to and it was four acre property and we built these ramps on it and that was amazing and definitely helps propel my skating to a different level than i ever imagined but at some point that was just a drain and it was a drained financially and i was living beyond my means and my income kept dropping cause we talked about not l no after that was ninety one ninety two the slowest days of a skating and have got this giant mortgage and have got this property in these ramps that i cannot afford to upkeep i can barely afford my water bill at one point and what you saw might a seems stable but behind the scenes it was it was starting donerauel bird house hadn't been started bird house was started ninety two and when i started bird house i took the equity from that house to start it cause i i did not i burned through my savings from trying to keep this place going o i took a second mortgage out on that house right i took my equity out started bird house sold the house for what i had taken out and then o moved to my original place that i had whole i was an i school and just pulled back on expenses i think that was the that was when i really became shrewd because i had to i had i had first child i had a income that was very uncertain very fluctuating and i was just eating tolkabell and top mama and congenially sandwiches and and not spending anything and and taking every job the most random damn request or we want you to be a consultant on this commercial because i to l ism twenty four ism too old to be the guy escaping cause it has to be youth right but o i be we want to see what is possible come up the day before and show us the ropes and i would be the stunt skater that is filling in to to show them the angles and stuff and then they would go higher chat homes is the you kid and then i would stand around is gan paid i do not care i think i rememberless commercial is a serial commercial onto the civil commercial was a cristmillar frossiflakes and i was tony a tiger to i e way call of in wide dog as you chest ah ya id throughout the a bird house which is your company but without telling me what is escape or company remember a willy cantos was region i remember a supervise kid you seem at the confess i rememberything will tomahawk has his own company for escape words a as wean her we had a team willy willy was a bistro am jerry cline legendary street pioneer a steed barre who kind of a we called e t v a street and very we had a ocean howl who was our number one amateur we had after refolds mapbeech we had a team was it was for was it fun to move from rider to also rider but t manger owner was it a fun it is it was just necessary i cannot say it was fun i mean ye i was it was fun cause we distilled just kind of reckless and driving me six of us in a van driving to skate shops across the country an begging him for three hundred box that we could get last and for hotel rum and get on our way i do not know it just it i but for me just fell necessity to keep to two that was what i had to do to make a brand of and i was willing to do it and but it was exhausting yaks i had to be the i had to be the the couch and the our manager and the scatter i was put myself out there on the the the worst conditions and just rolling my ankle left and right and d it was all street and this was not my things it was hard but i i li loved a it have i my mind ism thinking you had to be tonyawk the scape order frank hawk the organizer yarn stay pasta the ye cause stay had been a escape over i still think of i as escape warder ye of time film maker escape were just i still thing o spike one's escape order be a maker film maker seems i got to integrate all of those and i mention that because i am curious i think a lot of people are probably curious the are you the tired person sit back in a chair at night and think oxalic how many do this arming are you contemplative or it really you just identify what needs to be done this here and over the next three years and you will set your milestones cone short in i goes going ow a back that back then oh know everything was just in the moment we got to get here we got to get to dais by to morrow as soon as i de as over get the van were gone we got to get to a talcum no it was myself got it was it was very much but but i i i respected i think i learn to respect punctuality because i grab with playing it scatter as the were not and did not care and show u lad an was good i do not know these guys and then when i was in charge was we are going t beyond time cause we have to respect other people's time and we a ere going to be here three o'clock were e t be at tree o'clock and that is not easy with the scape crew mi play back who has you knows it to girl to the he were in lawpadcas i talk about that wee got some other got came over from d c to as filters and editors for us and there punctual and they are on it and i nowise you showed up early to day right right on time or early early by five minutes and that is a distinguishing factor i think in any occupation but special n escape warden where there is this kind of looseness sure and if you do show up on time really means a lot the professionalism that was in stilling you it is it is clear the different places where thou showing you mentioned the shrewdness about the business incisions ism curious about another aspect of that which is maybe a little more critic which is you now whether not it was the seedy collection that i saw were you are mention of the car u your interest in video games it seems that one thing that you have done that a lot of i said i knew respect him by the way it was mostly guide now's we said women doing it too remit in girls it seems you have a lot of other hobbies and interests music camera but that we never heard about you getting distracted or pulled down those lines i it we did not hear about you going and surfing and getting herder surfing that you could not scape we are getting really into motor cycles or erase racing cars right u some people went hard laughed out escape boarding into that ken block the at great can block but that became his main thing seems you you knew that scapewoarding was the main frame and stayed with that and yet you have a lot of other interests ye i think i it'd well with others for its especially mother cross i i have the huge respect full to cross i think it superexciting i would love to do it and i know that i would not escape unscathed i would define want to learn the tricks to whips and flip and whatever and i one to get hurt and i i do not want a risk my scape career for that i i i purposely pulled away from that type of thing the last nears nicer dry hat is because i overshot a jump in mammoth o my snowboard that was the lesson like do not what you doing just cruise why ye say on the ground it the powder right free ride with your grows because i learned my lesson and yet you are right but at the same time i still i still loved going surveying and snow morning i do not do him as much obviously but but those are part of of what i did all growing up i and they are important to me i i did do a couple of celebrate car races like can ask car rays and i i told a car an the long be gram are cause the study ram mind to the wall and i got i was fun but ism not i do not i do not have the band with to get that serious about it and now you have a family of course to of course ye i mean that n and those things as fun as they are and is as i do not know i was sort of auxiliary as as they are they require a lot of time just france does that long bescramprede they want you to go stay in palmate for a week and a half in train and and figure out how to truly know how to drive and be safe and s i got time for that yet that is time you are not scape word or with your family right right i feel the same way if i get pulled away from reading papers and prepping podcast and reading lace research and thinking about experiments we could do that i for more than a couple of days i start feeling the itch have a feeling the stuff is programmed in t one's nervous system after a while it yo been scape working for lonely o you go a few days it probably just your system is i like had of raving over the order yes something i i i sure i mean i well just for instance i our ramp is i being torn down on sundae to day is fridge r am as being torn on on sundae at ten a m to be moved tosolic city for our big pertinent ism going there to eight thirty i can get a session for a good story down i love i on father's day that is my father'sday ism going to work at right thirdly m on sundae love it speaking of family and lineage a tell us a about your kids you got some tell t escape orders in your family besides yourself i do i well i have four my own and it to steroids and on they all stayed my daughter not much any more but all the boys five boys are all really into it om my oldest son is the most i he is the most prominent because he turned proud u and has men at has his own following cause the name for himself i rely and he is thirty yet he kills it on the street his streetscape when he does ye but that they are they are all good they are all good skaters in their own ways and a it is fun i mean i i did not of course they are surrounded by their whole life especially rely because when he was young i i did not really have the means to have child care whatever i said taken with me on turn what not he was always around it he got good at it by to fall but at some point started to shy away from it because he felt the the pressure and my shadow and it was i do not this is not fun i do not people expect me to be supercool or i have to do the stuff and he wen shit away from him an then found a munch of his friends and high school the they loved scaring he is still good at us he that he found his crew and they've all found their crews a completely independent of me and when we go on vacation for instance we we were last year we were in a or two years ago we are on the big on why they wanted o the scapparks i wonder o the scapparks on vacationed it is also little harsh stuff it is a great way to get hurt wits that or in hours yet weather worn oh panic my seem but but then i go ism ism ism their chauffeur and ism their feller i love it that is my vacation but but because they all love us much you known mean and it just it is cool i mean o could there asked for more it is making butts tank about frank and nancy of bit just as i have this and odd connection to your family through the a it is really two or three day interaction change change my life forever meaning you was spectacular r as a young escaped wording kid but also just the idea that some one would literally take me into their home mad every reason to not trust me very well as i t no wat billy madman now explanation needed but people who knew billy hope he is doing well have not heard anything about h m but hope he is doing well am but we were wild but he basically took me into your home he and nancy took me in am you don't fed us am merged me a mid another friend with me am and i just have to say as your describing your family i can only imagine what it must have ben for frank and nancy to see you have your kids did they get to am live long enough to see a that rely an you father cant escape board and i dad tat riled a but my dad passed away when riled was too he is the only one of my kids that that he met e mi older smiling i had kids he met two of his other grannies besides rely am my mam got to see some of riles success but a she suffered from on all harm's to mention things slipped away but i i think that i my dad would not believe the scape when hes in the lyrics to him that is that is the top of the mountain because he was really another for he love sports he loved the olympics he loves he loved washingfootball he loved flashing baseball he loves when you limbic were on he just e loved the competition element in in the hope of it in and i think there was part of him the fellow why is not scared wading in the but he knew that there were many hurtles to get through and much more acceptance than need to happen and i do not think he imagine would ever happen he was especially i can still hear his voice he as a very large god to i do not no i was just smaller than a dealing was small i know he he did a big at presents and and i no looks told you this mantises before disasshe ow we got re connected i sent you direct message and said hey i met your parents in fact t a they took me into your home and ism telling the truth and you will know i telling the truth because they took me a dinner and they ordered black coffee after dinner ye and yet for years i would order black coffee after dirt its as a kind yo to impression we these really nice people took me in els tie while this is what a really healthy family looks i ism grateful to have loving parents always did but i did not have the healthy family structure for me was all my goodness these people drank black coffee after an this must be what healthy families do soy the way folks do not drink coffee and within eight hours are going to sleep but ah o i i he will do that but well you does not seem to be holding you back a individualized but u yid spectacular that this lineage of frank to you and and i mention and nancy because it seems while she might not have been at the contests and run around setting up tables and doing all that leste clue is supported as well oh oh she was hat did a lo the events too i mean they need all hands on deck when stor to getting beg and no one was taking salaries he not things the people thought all your dazzling cashing none he never took a money for any of that and he took much shit in my man he just e loved it it was for you why ut don't have any one to ben nearest for me and who was also for the misfits that eyes surrounded myself with and even though he was he was brash and he was he was i now was the word he was foreboding and and intimidating whatever else he did it for all those kids that were countelost you i mean he really he he loved that it brought them together that he gave them a sense of self a gave them a sense of purpose he saw that because he he was that he he really had a rough child and he did everything he could through his adult life to make up for it with his own kids and with the kidsthat they surround him themselves with that is that is what he loved about of course he loved seeing me thrive to but he loved that he created the safe space and this the sense of community and i mama my mama was that was her thing was getting people together gatherings u no oh we shall get together even even mi siblings and i as much as we want to emulate our parents we do not do it as much tat as they did and we regret the there still time no we an my we do but om it is tricky were all differentries sure yet that the person that comes to mind when i think about your dad om forgetting the move but there is this one clone would move where he lives in it neighborhood would where i think its o bunch a young mong oh a gangster sell come me know o comedo ye and i just remember that there is that scene of while can't coming out on his porch and just standing really upright ye everything in his run is front on is everything superman he heard and just standing there this immense presence and that that is how i remember frank talk ye but he was a polite softy that is the thing that is that is there there was a it was it was all apron wet he was certainly very wen i you lit e you got you got to see that side of him weressa oh ya come a will take out you will not us see pony's place let us go i that is not some hard ask well then there is a talk end to the story too where he actually called my mam and i think there may have been a statement or two about hay this kids fourteen he cannot be in into vista boy's club taking the buss back to langcasterr et center et camera i may been some discussion that but then they also paid for me to go home oh ye they flew me home ye i think i owe you couple hunter box for a out west flight whatever air line it was well it is it is fun and i think important to feminists about these people because i they are not just your parents but the they done much and through you a you i i really think that emotions and stories are really the equivalent of energy in humans ye will not peel oi what energy because that gets carried forward speaking of which a we share a common love of some particular music are you somebody who listens to music you to to inspire you to get camped up to escape word is music and important part of your life ya it is for this way i i had i had a playlets for my five for it the other day of fine tune to that trick and what would get demotivated in height to to do it you do not have to share with us what is on t e playlet unless yo you choose to ah man but was at high energy low energy high energy well and and some meaningful songs a ne orders ceremony and i i see nine snails getting smaller because that was a a song we used in one of our big scape tors and it was one of the most high energy sections of of the shell i gas there were i i i cannot go through all of how i forget i gang of for i wait to gang for it is i sh i forgot what is it oh i find the destiny rare fires a i had i had ten there were just on if any of those play it is ism going to make it and and i knew that it was about an hour and a half and that is as long as i mean to try it before i too tired chop listen in the warehouse for you listening in w rehouse on random and then a the song that i made it to was a off of that prodegyalbum out of the lamb and it is called climates sister manner i use it for a bird house at it when foregone one was the thing and when were these little bidding use letter type things yet anyway thou when that song came on i i was feeling at i made it fantastic i love this because the nervous scientists and me is immediately can bayou a we have this brain that loves to take an information and i scared other information but paired association its strong yean when you couple that with some sense of reward the making of the very old below coping as the i as a early in life r making the five fortieths as a come back to the injury after the enjoy is almost i loved all that music but i was indoctrinated by through the scapeharks because that was the sound track to the state was it was pump music it was sex pistils and and nine nine nine black flag and demo and acts backs and that that was that is what i kept hearing and that is what i associate with my best of times it is in your nervous system yet ye others a a few voices brand and him armstrong and and the adoration i operation i e sound test the no system was on that playlet was on the five forty playlet all right him will be happy to hear that and matfreemin the basebloder and jess michaels is now playing again with him die singer about their again you om the new gig what is to call they had a name and the the they a they changed it oh initially it was a why do not i say cause they change to the ares but we know away i know the making m music at which is amazing oration i was incredible my year book photo for i think two years running was the cover of operation ivy to that in short for the year book photo speaking of which did you so up for your book photos or did you graduate high school i graduated high school can't go to any of the events prom or any of the auxiliary i did not know i mean i was i was now cast i was not even though i had success in scaring scaring was not cool a and i was not homes with anyone at school except for two other skaters and we felt very ostracize ye i did show up for the graduation cause my momadan want to see it et likewise i graduate but i could tell you more about the cures in the parkin lot of my high school than aced about anything happen an i broke many sprinkler heads because the sprinkle heads were right next to the curb another was a double sided curb and if you bore slide because it'd go the early on board a slide and then id just learn too far in to break the sprinklehead and never got caught what high school hell i went to a couple i went to para high school originally am then i went to a sandy gusto high school which is in north county and then i ended up a try pines i got bully that sandy gusto that i requested to be transferred because i i could not go i could not survive there as the scatter i would have to hide my scaleboard in the bushes before class and then go find it after school that people would not target me the eighteseward ah twas a doth i it was a john hes fix it a for she o did it was josophers's nerves and then skaters were not even considered in that realm because they are just conger they are getting at hammered came the were few of us wheel things of change and not only have things have changed such that scape boarding is far more popular and respected and at least one mark of that as in the olympics although there are other marks of respect certainly but a huge evolution that have observed is when i was skateboarding is a fourteen year old an it into my close to my twenties an the took some time off for sure am hardly any girls hardly any women there were a few calabash burnt side they got teased ridiculed it was hard on that zebra ya suberhard now largely through in seem am but some other channels as well you can see this young girl rest over scapewoarding better than a lot of grown men who have been scapewoarding for decades i mean and then there a number of other ones in the a in street scapewoarding and also taking really hard slams i this this is a complete revision of the recent history of scapewoarding all hae thoughts on that and on e send there a few others was it is it am dizzy who limo the took a really bad fa that was filmed for her forth a back off for demerit yet these are tour ladies yea ism you doing it and for coming back is he dizzy did the loop she did the full through sixty loo first woman ever do it would you think changed that that paved the way s it just u no a critical mass of o females doing it is it that your sky brown you know you for sure for sure there were there were the pioneers people marabout were inside and i i many others patty hodman was one of one the first virstcators too who were they planted the see and and then there were other women that took inspiration o girls can do this even though there largely outnumbered and they get hosteled for sure and then through the street era a people a like steamer who who paid the way for legit street scaring but then through the years it it started to become more common more accepted which is due to say cause has always been should have always been accepted but the thing that that really tip the scale was when everything was leading up to lyrics there had to be equal divisions in equal disciplines for men and women and suddenly there was no question should we have a should we have a woman's event h we have to have omansven because that is how we that is the road to qualifying for this the olympic stage and vans part serious to their credit they were holding events simultaneously not that we are limpid qualifiers but just their own and they said these events are equal across the board equal prize money equal attention and me have just that was just matter of fact and that shifted a lot it really did now if you go to escape part you see plenty woman there the it is all n went literal women mams the fry there are older women that are learning how to scape season not that it matter much but does any one claim to be the first female do five forty convert is that sort of a known that out e linseyatams fantastic am and she did that o ta how she did that she was trying it am she is trying she is trying to mates ah she is married to traves patron its the no it is the the a need action sports couple am and she was trying up she was she was getting pretty close and than we did a big exhibition in parts at the a grand plait on behalf of quicksilver it was a huge event only put half pilot and we i this giant show the thousands people there and it was very much am unspoken but expected that i was going to do nine hundred at this event ma he gives i wont to say was two thousand ten maybe and a are no two thousand nine and and and the organize kind of li case we can do this and then at some point you do nine hundred knock i i cannot guarantee that ever every time have ever made it it is been pretty spontaneous i have set out to do it and not of come up short i cannot guarantee it it'll try it'll try and they there yoke an i knew the whole time the were scaring as yoga on expecting us i kind i went trough the motions of of a it is doing my exhibition tricks plain the hits and then started shin nine hundreds and at the same time mindset started thing five forties cause she was feeling to energy and it was this sort of not battle but definitely we were we were trading his it was i you are gust was an the a yo missed it and you are got mindset a she missed it and then i a she almost made one was riding down and and then fell at the flat bottom it was ah and then i made e nine hundred and the was kind of the show stop er i got the expected and i on one crazy an whatever people are coming down off the ramp knee sliding down and were staying good by to the crowd and i look up and mindset puts her tail out there's still people standing on the ramp and she puts her tail out i was i think mindset must try it again here we ism on the new she made it love it she stole the show without question it was huge you look it up on on you see i i gets there line tams first first five forty it was also and then she made it and we all grasp her n put her hundreds shoulders that is a saves for the got there is also cause these things are the four minute male as i i her her them people break that barrier and then other people break that barrier it is i may i i watched enough escape what in recent year see the sky brown thing o when she is phenomenal and as she saw her family out to dinner here an lolsangelisand uni with her brother and folks are really gracious really nice and there again your parents going to the scapepark we after all she is could not drive herself i thing she yet that time in in on e probably one of the biggest shifts too is that parents encourage their kiss escape now and you imagine that when we are young never no there were many factors telling us not to which i made us want do it more sure we in now now kids are parents are pushing them into it get out there learn tricks a way that is not restless be doing but it is cool that that i think i think with the the the really cool factor of all that is there are definitely people our age i ism grouping you into my age vatic by forty seven are i new as not but but ted have kids and and scape being with such a special time in our life and then they are re discovering it through their kids and their scaring together and i think that is just amaze that some one of our age would be what i used to do that your in to that lye let us go and then you call show your kid out to the sweeper i can pride you that ion kids yet but when i do it'll so i intend on being healthy enough and ye to do a sweeper people can look up sweeper we do not have to explain it for him but long lay back gun or a sweeper yet o you because they will not they would not think to do it no and there are doing all these difficult flip tricks in just to my some my seeing i hew whats your go to on aga escape fearing a really take out the younger gentry i can do impossibles pretty i pretty regularly on transition consistently i knew on flat since is were basely scrape the back of it is an all he really but it raps around the back what ort radio over your foot ye that is kind of my m sneak attack on gam to shape does rawdney on get credit for that tricks oh yes that is yours to money he still contours with kidney absolutely ye yet hes somebody bit u sorry deserves it deserves to mention and the pioneering of tricks than confess the godfather in modern skip worn i think of rawdeny y you and margins all his goes as their guise that ism honored drove the the progression indifferent partially overlapping directions that set the temple first learn fingers had because rod the first trick you saw me do i learn not because i saw oddly do it on the ground and i thought well i cannot do on the ground but have plenty of time in the air and to do it ransom saw some that stay put you guides together we we mention bones forgat but we really talk about the architecture of it from the perspective of scaleboard progression but it was come any good band it seems there was really good chemistry ye a interpersonally but also that there were each person had something unique you scared way you did mike say the way he did stove when he did and rawdney and and we respected each other but we also fat off each other mommy great up right cause group in the bear in fact mommy scan thrills of san francisco in those videos makes it look easy a those hills are frog they're danadress and they have real life obstacles living bosses you will not he was not stopping as towlines says fantastic ah we could feminists about all these angles put that the point being that spending time with people who do similar things for the same thing but do it differently is one of the best ways to progress this we routinely fly to taxes and hang out with peter tea another podcast likes freedmen just cause they do things differentlymen i do where do you draw sort of primeval inspiration from now they i know you i see jimmy welkin at your amp queen lot the venom jimmy welcome of free how good that kit is who else are you spend time with besides teeth and one of the reasons i asked us is that skateboarding is unique among many sports an that i given session a gathering a to scaleboard we will include an enormous yo vital old man and ten year old girls exactly yes which is to which incredible you do not thing about sore you a serious game of soccer benin professional so but also not even that that were scatting together is that we are communicating and influencing each other i mean that is the last conversation i have with ease was she is talking out like a young to tried you i forty seen go ism going working on it she is what i think she saw me try one she cause i think con need o call out a little more and she was right she is how old again seen and i and i did even consider that because ism just back in my mod and ism not taking into consideration that i do not have the snap that i had before i got her and she was riming always one key to be making it andyou know do that that is but it but to me that is just last representative scapeboardin and the exclusivity of it in the diversity of it where it is me ism fifty five there is thirty year old a pros that are at the top of the game there are seventeen year old up incomers men women ten year old girl that is doing tricks that we have never even thought of or want to do and it is all part of the the whole mix that is really beautiful want it ask you about memorabilia not a topic that i think about much but i think in a prior conversation fours you mentioned something about this there are scaleboard collectors there are people that collect stickers escape words there is a whole market and world for this and i in addition to people wanting series with you when they see you i imagine a there is a long history and continued tradition of people taking a pen putting your hand a sand can you sign this i because you are in this a very a small but very a clearly esteem group of people where your signature increases the value of things o a how does that work a and how does that feel if escapeborder who i are there are the tell talk signs of who isn't who is not right ah u if they walk up to you in the l hay w you sign this do you feel good about signing it or that something that you refrain from in it and if somebody is just merely a collector a trader in their trying to built their portfolio to speak am you can problyalso sent that me not trying to put you ain the hot seat here ah we will dansyou creation through the years i was always open to that and and ism happy to especially when people are skaters are or escape fans an why not in the last three years there has been this knew elements of cellars of people that just go by signaler stub they have nothing to escaping they do not care about scapebaning it all they just want to get my signature on an item and sell it and they usually do it on e bay or through their own channels that is fine at some point a few years ago i respected the hustle these guys are they knew that i was going to be at this event get their outside waiting they havebeenwaiting for hours i it'll sign a couple of things but in reason months even they have figured out how to you get my flight info some hacked into my my actual airline accounts some have a sources at certain airports that get the manifest and they sellebat information have found all the out because have actually held a couple of accountable because i said look ism not in a sign this until you tell me how you knew i was going to be ere i have no business here ism here to visit family no one knows ism coming here oh wo we saw o friends said they saw you at the a destroyed air point nobody did not they would not know were ism going to anyway o got saw on twitter you did not see it on to it ism on to bitter tell me the truth there is a guib from terms o you to gives flat and phony suited to us one thank you but that has increase to a point where it is it is not sustainable i cannot i cannot please everyone the last time i flew out of chico there were about fifteen people one guy had a a shopping cart full of skateboards and they all they all brushed me at security before i went through security thinking that ism in a signs o myiasis cannot i cannot do i unis my flight and i cannot delineate who idiom sorry you got hive sabvatize yourselves i don't what to say and then i went through security and there were fords wining at the gate they had bought tickets proline tickets that it could be past security that they proline tick is there nocking to use to chase this be i ma want people on my autograph but it is weird and it is intrusive and it is count creepy yet just tell them that a nervous scientists told you that you got to get that slaw bear right and if you sign too many autographs that in men on my chance of getting back you are nocking the at took ne no just nocking be do the lately inner it just nocking again with is it is just a really weird you than is have yard has popped up and u other than that and and the tricky parties when there is a public thing or a public exhibition whatever to try to figure out who is the true scape has and who are not usually their pretty identifiable but it it just it has ruined the experience for people who truly are the grubscating we thanks for sharing that and em we will not tell every one what the tell tell signs are that these people do not exploit them the scape orders the i real fans well now a i they will not have to worry about whether not they represent accurately cause you just will on the positive side something up in one to learn more about from you is your philanthropic efforts u i think heaven rose ah who in the ten actor was the first to mention to me that you you guess have done some philanthropy together a and maybe eve done much imthebo as well the great him thebe ache both both him and heaven were board members i him is the current board member of the scape her project but tells a bat escape word project ah it is it is it is mine on profit and we try to develop public scapeparks and are certain under served areas but more by by supporting the community and giving them the resources to do groups that are trying to get scapeparks in the area we are the resource center for them ah we will give them advice will give them funding well give them a our stamp of approval and that can go along we and a to date we have helped to fund over almost the thousand scapeparks now and seven or eight hundred of which are open i make my protestors for sire and and it is because i never i never took for granted the fact that i go near escapepark and that was my home way from home that was where i found my sense of community my sense of identity my my crew and many kids choose the scape or but have no support in doing and those scapeparks are a life one i can attest they they absolutely save lats there's no question where can people find out more about your foundation we can provide a link but what fin o harked out or its where does the funding for these parks i shall come from ah it comes from donations from supporters it comes from fun raisers some corporate ah sometimes funding is is funneled through us for specific regions ah the a ah we have a built to play a project that in a michigan in new york and that is funded by the rape so willow junior foundation am they they give us the funding and then we have to give it to that area but but it is easy because there is plenty of projects and now there is an abundance of scape portions areas well it thank you for doing that for living around that is and i a get to place to scape a curious what is in the immediate horizon i these days you probably have the option to say yes o things and know to things u you have a family of your scaleboard career where do you place your priorities in terms of how to carve up your day or your we coming what would you to make sure that you do there much of the hours of your waking day fur the next must just say five years cause in if you will not extend that out you can well i i want to be available to my kids for inform us and we still have one at home for the next four years i i will make sure that i am available to her and in terms of career i never had great aspirations i can never thought give these this is what a one accomplish it was always as very wore trick specific oriented as always i go one to try this in this n this i would to continue scaring i do not know if it'll be able to scape at the level ism scanning right now in five years but i know that it'll still be on the ramp i may not be doing it in public trying to advocate for public scape parts doing more with the foundation and whatever i i think i think the way i prayratize my time is what will resinate the furthest and have the best impact on scape morning in general i do feel that have come to a point where yes ism some unofficial ambassador to scape boarding and i want to represent it well i want i want to be fair in that scape working is all kinds of different things s not just incomes are on the bigger or or what not it is it it represents a true culture and i want you project that as much as i can and makes sure that people understand that is also positive and i mean it really everything that ism doing now i is just kind of fun i got its for the i would say in the last five to ten years s the first time i have truly enjoyed what scape winding has provided me in terms of opportunity and what it brings to me and and what it means to my family i have a much better appreciation under standing for it and these days it just everything's kind gravy is just fun i cannot believe i go so do for living its cranium fifty five years old and i truly ride my escapewoar i as a career this nuts i would have not any any other way well it certainly is it earned and i just one to say thank you for a number of things first of all thank you for going to the scapepark thank you fucking this trajectory thank you for inspiring me and many other young people and old people older people over many decades now both with what you did on scaleboard and off the scaleboard and including your resilient and determination to push and continued to progress to the point were you badly injured and then to push through that come back at least match what you did previously and i i would wager that you will exceed your prior skill level going forward i want to thank you for your resilience i know it comes from an intrinsic drive your love escapewoarding it just absolutely comes through my share in some of that am of course having grown up in it but not nearly as much as you but also just your willingness to stretch out into these different areas the video game thing or ism talk about excuses the glyptics because that did allow for a lot of growth and lateral movement of skateboarding and at the same time just as you said to bring it right back to the fact that skateboarding is not one thing it is not other sports it is its own sport and it is its own life starlets its own thing and we do consider you the ambassador for skateboarding and am i speak for many people and i say that a were very grateful that you are because you bring that that shrewdness an that prudence to it but also that get after it poncrock spirit and the goodness that your parents in stilled you clearly comes through everything from the philanthropy and onward i cannot say enough positive things ain't you were express enough gratitude for your what you have done in for your time here your legacy and skateboarding but also just in the game of life is clearly demented thank you o thank you and i appreciate the that ethos of skateboarding shines through on your shell and just your true here clearly lot ham come from the

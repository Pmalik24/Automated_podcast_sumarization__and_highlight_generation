welcome to the superman latponcans n of science science pace to we forbid i pandour superman and a professor of neurobiology and entomology at stamford school of medicine to day my guest is him ferries him ferries is an author a podcast an investor and is known for having a near supernatural ability to predict the future which has allowed him to obtain success in a huge number of different endeavors for instance he is a five time number one new york times be selling author but perhaps equally or more important to that he is also exceptionally good at teaching people how to write the entire process of writing and marketing a book his books the for our chef an the for our body in the for our workweek not only explain his own exploration of how to optimize and prioritize his time and learn particular skills but he teaches you those skills as well this is really what sets him apart he is an exceptional learner and an exceptional teacher and today you learn why that is and in a characteristic him ferries way he explains the process in a way that you can apply it he lists out for instance the specific questions that you should ask when approaching any endeavor in order to get the information that you want and to make the process of learning and getting better at something and achieving great success in something that much more likely that ability that him has to identify the specific questions that one needs to ask and answer and the specific action steps to take in order to achieve success is really what i believe sets him apart from everyone else on the internet or on the book shelf that is giving advice as to how to become good at something timferris is also dedicated to various philanthropic efforts the most recent of which is the donation of several millions of his own dollars to research on psychedelics for the treatment of otherwise intractable psychiatric challenges such as major depression suicidal depression eating disorders and addiction and he is also brought together other philanthropists which has rally galvanize the whole field of psychedelic research for the treatment of mental health transforming it from what was recently kind of a fringe area of science to a main stay that is actually funded not only by philanthropy but by the national institutes of health he is really transform this entire scientific field into one that now is transforming the laws around psychedelics and is providing mental health treatment for people that would otherwise suffer to day's discussion was a particularly meaningful one because not only is him a pioneer in the world of podcasting but it also marked the nine year anniversary of his podcast the timparre show now as i mentioned early our him is known for being able to see around corners or predict the future he really does seem to be about five if not ten years ahead of everybody else in thinking about tools for optimization in particular domains of life and we were very fortunate that during to day's discussion he shares with us his current creative endeavors and how he is thinking about and approaching those and he also breaks down for us the process of how to think about and prioritize one schaduald not just on the order of the day not just on the order of the week but really thinking about one's life as a journey and how to organize and go about that journey to day's discussion will provide with you tremendous insight into who timparris is and how that incredible mind of his works in order to do all the amazing things that he is done and of course he teaches you how to do it he will tell you the exact question that you should ask and that you should answer and how to step back and think about those questions and then prioritize that you can decide how to best invest your time ism sure many of you familiar with the timphara show however if you are not already subscribing to the timpharr show i highly recommend you do i still go back and listen to early episodes of the timpharr show and ism a weekly listener to the new episode we provide a link to the temper show in this sh note captions also in the shownote captions you will find links to time many new york times best selling books and a link to its excellent weekly blog before we begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate for my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost o consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is element element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar now salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called neurons in fact in order for your neurons to function properly all three electrolytes need to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to deposits in cognitive and physical performance element contains a science bactolectrolite ratio of one thousand milligrams that one gram of sodium two under milligrams of potassium and sixty milligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if have been sweating lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element doctor slash supermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element element doctor slash supermen and now for my discussion with him parts him parts i am nothing short of thrilled to have you here have been reading your books reading your blogs listen your podcast for a very long time and in preparing for to day thinking who does him remind me of cause i knew you reminded me of somebody but i did not know and then i realized it you re mind me of the exobiologist roman canal you do not look anything him he does not look anything you ah he was a brilliant scientist he won the noble prize in nineteen o six for essentially describing the structure of the nervous system is the first along with another guy to to find synapses my is fundamental connection the nervous system but the reason that you remind me of canal is that it is a well known or not secret secret in serow science that if you want to pick a really excellent project to work on you simply go and look at what canal talked about or hypothesized and then you work on that yet he had this almost am supernatural ability to look at fixed stain tissue of the nervous system much of it is incredibly beautiful by the way and think about how it worked when it was alive and he is considered the greatest neorobiologist of all time without question and it is really this feature of being able to see around corners are into the future that establishes that long for me it is it is absolute truth that if you look back to what you were doing ten years ago fifteen years ago the kinds of things you ere doing the kinds of questions you were asking that translates to much of what people myself and people in the fitness space tax space in vested space mindfulness space psychedelic space all these different arenas what they are doing now am it is not hyperbolic to say that you are the roman canal of all those different spaces and podcasting of course is one of those i owe you great debt of gratitude and many others do as well my first question for you is what was your mind set around the time that you wrote for our body for our work week but in particular for r our body because the photo calls in that book are very useful they were a the time it was published they still are now and many of the things i bath the discussion around brown fat throw agenesis am resistance training in its a an a basic form of just providing enough progressive overload to get an adaptation not excessively long work out weight lost slow car diet a and on and on and on what were you thinking at that time if you can think back to them like what were you foraging for what were you think about when you woke up in the morning thing i own to go find all the stuff that at the time was really esoteric cause it is all played out very well am what a massy saying is if you want to know what is going to be happening hot and useful in five years ten years and onwards just look at what terms doing at any moment there it is ell thank you for the very generous comparison and instill on thriltabier said thanks for having me and the far body represented an opportunity for me to do a few thanks the first was to diversify my identity from outside of the realm of the say business category as a deliberate move since the success of the first book book boat me permission to do something else that publishers would still want a gamble on i wanted to see if i could may be a michael lewis take my audience with me to other topics that was a lateral move shows very deliberate from a a career optionality stamping and then i was doing i think what have done for a very long time and what i enjoy doing which is looking at the most prevalent beliefs and may be dogmatic assumptions in a greenfield could be anything if any one says always never should i pay attention and take note of that they may very well be right but if anything is said in absolutes i to stress test and in the case of a physical performance or physical manipulation tracking two thousand eighty thousand times a very interesting time because the number of different technologies were coming on line meaning being adopted by small groups yet very early stages of sac sclerometers as enables you had a number of different innovations and means of tracking that had never been available before you had for instance and this took a bit of ferreting on my side it was not immediately on the road map further four body but continuous lucks miners at the time that was i want to say exclusively limited to top one diabetic or t may be typo diabetics but largely type one diabetic and what captured my interest and i cannot recall how i came across but it was probably through the very earliest iterations of what later became the quantified self movement and i remember attending the very first gathering at cevenkelly's house in a pacificicalforncis this was a round two thousand nine twelve people thirteen people to discuss quantifying health but the the example of a professional race car driver i cannot remember the the form factor the there is f on or lascar or other who was using this continual glucose monitor for paying attention to glucose levels while driving and i thought to myself would that not be useful for healthy normals would that not have other applications if this is being used by high performer in this type of contact might it have other types of applications which then led me to use the very early refreshments of decks come which were really painful to implant no longer the case of course that is changed the lot and i wanted to see how i might be able to find a handful of different categories of things there is the new the genuinely new we go at that point was genuinely new the very old that might have some room for scientific investigation and i would say when i say scientific i do not necessarily mean randomize control trials at a university i do think as an end of one if you think about stupid design and you can even blind you could even placebo control and i knew people in the small sub culture of qualified self who did this you cannot think approach things in a methodical way where you can make a lot of progress in trying to determine causality or warlock thereof looking at very old things looking at orphan things sir for instance there are many examples in the world of doping where you have say back back in the day were famously barrybonds and others proportively used things the cream and the clear and these were based on anabolic that were sourced from soviet literature or older literature from the fifties and sixties that might not be on the rate are of say the antidoping a groups that would administer the testing all of these different buckets were of interest to me and i begin where i usually do i is intervening folks i would interview one or two people in a given field and i might ask them any number of questions one is what of the nerves doing on the week ends are at night this is also really good for investing as i go what of the really technical nerves doing at night or on the week ends after they have put in a really long work day or work week let us take a really close look at that another one is and all all create allow for this but what are rich people doing now that every one or tens or hundreds of millions people might be doing ten years from now and an example of that would be lets you say full time assistant virtual assistant ay i wrists we have seen the needs and wants being addressed by different technology but it is an iteration of the same thing on some level in the case of say music chat p t tied into rapier for various functions and then where are people cobbling together awkward solutions where are people piecing together awkward solutions and is the room for some type of innovation there these are a few of the questions that i would not only ask myself but ask experts intifinareus if i and up spending time say this was few years prior to writing before our body is spent time an ass names and was interacting with the number of scientists some people who were working on all sorts of biological tests and looking at genomics and had a very frank discussion about where they thought if they had to push right it'll ask questions push a little bit into the realm of science fiction and speculation because ism sure you cannot support any type of projection that with the literature with scientific literature but what do you think some of the risks are of say publishing urgent except the time a number of hyperophyle folks had just made their full genome of fella well i think in the near future be possible to reconstruct some one's face based on there genetic data and they are high degreevof confidence i exeat to under decent how confident i eighty ninety percent my look i should pay attention to that because if you're making your data available as you say and it is anatomized per say you still might be identifiable i cook gat that raises some interesting questions i look will then how might you get around that how might you put in safeguards that you are the one and only keeper of your data to speak i brought up all sorts of targeted weaponry a bisect of big weapons possibilities that i was interested and and then i would a s that person who's clearly willing to step outside of the box of whatever he is working on day to day who are two of your close friends or two thinkers you really pay a lot of attention to are kind of at the bleeding edge of something an unorthodox and then i would just continue to have these conversations over and over again and the the the the the street of development that i paid a lot attention to something along the lines of the following that the the very beginnings are usually in some type of extreme case and i think the extremes in this goes for product designed well but the extremes in form the mean but not vise verses wo can actually learn a lot by studying t edge cases race horses for instance i you will often see thinks start with a race horses a or people with wasting diseases for instance or any type of chronic or terminal illness who are willing to try some more experimental interventions then let us just take one step further body building see a lot of interesting behavior in body building and high of athletes then billionaires then rich people than the rest of us it my assumption is and was for for our body that along the lines of willing gibbon's quote yon the future is already here it is just not evenly distributed ism never predicting the future ism just finding the seeds that are germinating that i think are going o bloom an and spreading really really wetly up that is that is that is generally where i start and i soon the practitioners are gong to be ahead of the papers studying say the coaches whose jobs are on the line who are getting paid based on athlete performance and assuming that a lot of that eventually if it holds up make its way in to say the purereviewed exercise sign papers but its get have a lag time three to five years at least at least at least to long ti as science is often very slow to catch up an you mention many things i have questions about you mention paying attention to the new the very old were the orphan am interesting and i just thought it'd a tell you that when you sit down with the graduates to or a postal and their trying of come up with a project rarely d you say what you want to work on and they fire back a really interesting question sometimes they do but that is the rare person more often than not you will send them to the literature and they will come back okay there is this new technique that we can use to answer a set of questions better than ever before where there is a very old theory i want a revisit or there is is theory that no one pays attention to fact we had one guest on here o dedrarschavy who studying it essentially a inheritance of traits transgenerational inheritance of traits is o little bit although different from lamarkyan ah a evolution but it is a lot that in some ways and your these orphan theories that everyone assumed were wrong and that there is a basis for them i thin there is real genius in that a analysis it also struck me as you were listing off some of your process circa the the writing of the for our body that i and many other people are a probably curious about what the operations around all that looked are you or were you at the time waking up in the morning going o can and take a walk and think about the new the old and the orphan or u ism can take a walk or sitting an hair in thing about what of the nerves doing right now what are rich people doing right now or cobbling together awkward solutions was it was that exploration of structured practice for you or this just something that was the consequence of being timpharris waking up in the morning an just leaning into that beat i been experience both right but i think a lot of us a a curious something that there is a lot of mistime around you whethryou us to dispel it whether whether you it or not o it it it its there and on and we are not trying to to pry but pray is the is the establishment of structure for you something that is the consequence of structure in the first place as li cook an nonce time to think or you just allow things to guise up to the surface i do both and i would say t hat in the case of for our body it is it is a bit of an anomaly compared to my later books because i had recorded effectively every work at i done sinkage sixteen as competitive athletic i just had a lot of records and i kept copious notes on supplement use and everything imaginable i have what you might call typography i just capture it almost everything in writing and that was very useful because at various points of time less you say i looked ad a photograph of myself from make in this up but two thousand for and i thank i would to look and feel that again okay let me revisit my work outlaws let me just replicate the proceeding three o six months of work outs and look at my intake and mi died at the time and lone behold more or less i could replicate the same type of look and feel in performance i had a lot already logged that i thought was worth examining and putting under scrutiny trying to replicate with other people i do think replication is really important and then when it came time to commit to writing the book i thought about what types of many books would be of great interest to me personally and that book many of my other books was written in such a fashion that it could be a choose on adventure book did not need to be read in fact in many ways it should not be read linearly from page one to the end you get to pick an choose which chapters are of interest based on breathhold vertical jump endurance hypertrophy cold exposure for fat loss whatever it might be and then i began talking be and at the at the very hoarder bounds of self experimentation at least in the bay area it is a pretty small community you are one or two lily pats from just about every one and it is not accidental that i put myself in that environment in san francisco specifically and more generally in the bay area silk and valley because there is just a high surface area for luck to stick to because you have many serendipitous encounters you have many people folksong on different disciplines that i think was the fertilizer and the fertile ground for everything else was actually the choosing the wear of writing physically being located in san francisco and then when ism structuring things maybe it'll get into some of the city gritty but i was using at the time when i still to usiprogramm called scrivener which is actually designed predominantly for screen writing it is used for many things now novels and on its expanded its reach quite a bit but it allows you to gather research and all of your documents in droughts that you can move them around in very novella's that you can view say a split pain of your research and what you are working on simultaneously without having to toggle between a lot of different windows and i was very promiscuous in my gathering at data i would gather from say the web using a web clipper from every note which i was involved with as a company and basically without bias capture as much as possible put three asterisks next to anything that i thought i really might want to revisit after i had read something a second time which i would always do then i could control a to find just three asterisks because they do not occur much in normal writing just people authors writers will you to you t k meaning find such and such a a ate data needs to be inserted later but i do not interrupt the flow of writing only cutin tea came evident really appear and natural english much a in turns of structure to thinking the way i approached it was during that period of time in my life it was interviews tracking people down conversations males reading ingestion lest just say for the workday then a break for training and and actually using myself as the human getting pig for various things that in service that might be on the docket where were youtraining at that time i exist goes not a famous for amazing aims it is not famous for amazing aims at the time i was training mostly at climbing him called mission cliffs they don't no much but they had barbells and they and they ad kettle bells yet i also had in the in the walkway leading from the front door of the apartment i was renting his more a house the front door hallway to the first set of stairs there were thirty kite kettlebell various types and was training for certification want to put myself on some type of deadline with countability for that type of training to you get a better understanding of it said train for few hours i also had developed the friendship with kelly starred say san francisco cross fit who have tremendous man a respect for likewise multiple less terrific and his new book i of his great book he is good ye he e really not only talks o talk but walks the walk and exemplifies many of the keepabilities that he teaches which i take seriously i practitioners not just the people with pretty theories although the theories are important i prefer to see someone who can actually put them into practice kelly served that function certainly and i were still very close friends and then after that i shake off the cobwebs get the body moving get the brain moving also eat and then i would actually focus on synthesis i would write generally from let us call it nine p m or ten p m through to four or five m and i would write the way if i happened to be in the on if i were notion the on i would not force it and i would try to get more sleep but i have always perform best with my writing in those witching hours of let us call it ten p m to for m and my experience is that the writers have interbred the the writer friends have become close with if you look it when they made themselves not what the searlywhat they do now right but what they did that eventually got them to escape velocity there almost always doing most of their writing very late at night or very early in the morning when the rest of the world or there social group is inactive wow and i say wow because course all of this was prior to the publication of jaywalkers the semen old book right why we sleep which i really see is the book that shifted a lot of people fortunately from the it'll sleep when ism dead mind sat i to it'll to really paying attention to it and you i do not thing mac gets enough cried i man it there there is been a revision of a few points within that book but the majority of it is just spot on and hyperlendofment good and i and yet what you are describing is a schedule that you will starting to writ at nine p m and finishing up round for m but you talk about research earlier that day and training and eating some where there news in there i wen asleep from say for to may be eleven or twelve i would be getting up later and have had conversations with mat about this and there are night owls and morning larks n there are certainly differences in the code meaning the genetics but that work very very well for me for very long time it is however a very challenging social schedule once you have a significant other and every girl from i ever had is morning person if you want to spend time together that schedule just does not work i made compromises later for the social side of things but if you put a gun to my head and said you need to write the best book humanly possible that is your only priority outside of some exercise and fuel i would follow the same schedule i know several am very successful poetasters laces freedmen an particular who i think he is trying to follow a more normal schedule now but he is pseudo nocturnal least by mi ex my read am and there are couple other on line content a creators am derrick from more plates more waits who viper productive in his domain and is mostly nocturnal a and then as your describing your a writing routine in your over all routine o thinking that the great skateboarder everyone knows tony hawk who is obviously a great skateboarder no doubt about that but money dollar who invented the only on street the kickflip the all we money's basically nocturnal it has been for a long time and would you escape word up and down the boardwalk sanamonic in the middle of the night because lack o destruction as it really ways any he is been doing that since his teens do not know what he is doing these days but thing a lot of creators just need space d and i always wonder if that is because when they at least the ones that are not socially dysfunctional yourself who a when they are round people there is is almost hopefully a desire to interact you almost have to remove the stimulus completely ye it it it removes the plausible deniability which mayst not be the perfect use of that phrase but in the sense that you it is harder to fool yourself into thinking you are doing something important when your checking your messages or social media at two in the morning whore we kitting folks you should be writer in this case and writers will l do anything to avoid writing i remember inland wrote a book about writing which sexually fantastic i cannot member the exact title might just be nonfiction writing something that and she talked about polishing the sneakers of the shoes before writing i really just need to to this one thing which is just clean up that shoe because somebody should really clean it up and some point i should clean it up and thereforewha i do this no time the present ought to do that it is all to avoid writing which is the harder thing and in my conversation of the mat also i should say that as some one who has self described as a person who struggles with onsennsomnia mat made the point and sometimes we need to relearn things maybe shoe just go to bed later and that might address some of this onsensomniaand i do not know the causes for that but i do get a second wend very late could be related to some coatis all release abnormality or just different scripting in my system who knows it'd to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called a g one is a vitamin mineral robotic drink that covers all your foundational nutritional needs have been taking athletic green since two thousand and twelve some delighted that their sponsoring the podcast there in my starry taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athletic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets to me the politics that i need for got health our got is very important as populated by got microbioda that communicate with the brain the immune system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long turn health and those robotics an athletic greens are optimal and vital for macrobiotic health in addition athletic greens contains a number of adaptions vitamins and minerals that make sure that all my foundational nutritional needs are met and it taste grape if you would to tryathletic greens you can go to athletic green stock calm slash superman and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up at h legit greens while you are on the road in the car on the plain et camera and they will give you a year supply of vote him in d the k too again that is that let it greenstone calm slash humoral to get the five free travel packs and the years supply a vote him in d three k to it'll mention one other one other may be juristic that i use for trying to peak around corners which is if i find an example of an outlier trying to find two or three or i because one is an exception two is interesting three is worth investigating that is serve how i think about it and i recognize the thrill of anecdote does not equal data however a lot of interesting discoveries begin as use studies or case histories and there are somethings we could talk about that that have paid attention over e last few years that are not in the four body that i thinker quite interesting when raise very very exciting questions abut it'd love to hear about those ye and in along lines of what i call anew data i me most of what we know about human memory stems from one patient h m who had is hippocampi i v removed for a epilepsy and of course i been millions probably be close to millions of studies in animals in humans focussing on the hippocampi but most of what we know about human memory is from one guy yen exactly there's there is there is a lot to be examined not all of it will get funding for acts let us be realistic this is especially true if you are hoping for any type of directive data i notice om not saying conclusive but if if you are human is can be making decisions about diet health exercise if you want any consensus you are domed you will be not can to get any answers before you die you say that twice say that the inner nan heart loud r are those of you that are arguing about nutrition on water like it it might actually be life wasted i mean ism not being judge mental i mean i think that there is felicity in lots of those pockets there is stuff that is wrong an lots of those pockets ah there diets that work extremely well yon for our diet a slow car i was called a four hour day but the snow car diet it works extremely well any time i followed it i get much leaner and stronger and all that stuff u that it is a reported to do it it works but yet maybe you can just a explain what you mean by that because i think there are some argument slash friction spaces that there truly an energy sink i would just say focus will works for you in your family or your team and if you are arguing on theinnernet recognized that you are discoing it because you arguing on then net you are not going to convince any one of anything and a your just going to make yourself a more frustrated if you plan on changing any opinions for me it is live in let live and a the more people who engage in that type of behavior the more competitive advantage you have if you do not for me ism a give you on a spend this vital non renewable resource of yours called time on that if i ever compute against young and went great all list a it'll it'll also not even try to convince you stop doing that unless you see the logic in it which i have which is why i also do not have at least for two years have mostly had no social laps in stall on my phone i then we could talk about that because i think recognizing that these things you been engineer to overcome any type of self discipline with billions of is at stay i should lead you to believe that you arebringing a a knife to a gun fight i just do not have the as of my phone to begin with and i find it much more gratifying to see disproportionate change from small impetus s that is hat am looking for and ism also looking for changes that are easy to make that can have high adherents that have very limited downside which is very different from proving something for instance in for our body took a look at the potential effect of telephones or the proximity of telephones to say banana function and reproductive health and the literature that was available at the time was very limited ad some animal studies mice rats et camera i recognize humans are not just large mice they do not always translate but i looked at i said bouquet looking at this simplistically is it plausible that there could be similar effects on humans seems to be the case also based on conversations with people who are specialists but would never go on record therefore if your phone is in your pocket to have it on airplaymote i mean that it it does not have a high cost and and then sending any revision we can see but while the jury still out ism going to risk mitigate by taking this step well and i just wont to say i thank you there too i read that recommendation i followed the recommendation of not keeping the phone on in my front pocket or back pocket am and that is anecdota am my spermanalysis is it relevant to this conversation but worked out but you could say well that is not witness because you had the phone off but am i did a very long detailed episode on male and female fertility there is now i what i view as a really quality madanalysis and it is pretty clear that there are a facts of the smart phone on proximity of the smart phone when it is turned on a that are not good forsworn is not nesodigan a render somebody sterile but i oosperm and that can be separated out from the heat of acts and essentially this is another instance in which a you are you are right a and i think more data will come out and am i a m a conspiracy theorists a no am do i wear tinfoil underywheare no a bi a i think it is interesting i down's important and a thank to you code my attention to it in fact i a teach about that in a a course on an naval circuits and biology and health and disease mirin and i do not expect to get everything right at all a that would be crazy to think ism not totally crazy and it is very important if you are going to do self experimentation or experimentation in small groups which the qualifiedself community did quite well and i think still does quite well you should really make every effort to not full yourself which is hart is it is challenging at times but read books bad science read books how to lie with statistics insure that you are able to read studies well you do not have to be the best in the world but that you can on some level identify the strengths and weaknesses of studies this does not take a long time certainly our friend a petechia doctor petechia has studying the studies which is a multiple part blog series dedicated to this there are other ways to approach it i took one of his pod cats republished it on the tempherisho because it talked about how to examine studies what powering refers to things this in the span of one or two weeks you could really become literate with the building blocks of scientific literacy with respect to reading studies and that gives you such an enormous life advantage it is hard to overstate i agree and i also think that there are a lot of things sad just simply will not ever be explored in randomizes control trial a one of things that peter and i have talk about before a he tests me now what a your thoughts on b p c one five seven this is a gastric peptide that is now been synthesized people will injected into a tissue that they are trying to heal or improve lots and lots of anecdota on b p c one five seven making injuries heel faster et camera again anecdota have used it i took connection of it yesterday in fact a peter basically is not a believer because therefore a lack of published date on this which is perfectly fine or i should say he is a skeptical and there is always that possibility of a placebo effect but i do not think there will ever be a really nice controlled trial on b p c one five seven because the financial incentives are not there and no smart graduate student is going to go to a thesis on this that that is the reality i mean it maybe one will do it now that were having this conversation but it just does not that that pay out is not there ye in that last when you mention is one the people mislay people doing these studies are people careers wore planning there careers and they choose what they are going to invest time in very carefully such another limiter on what will end up in a act or not i think that is good for people to hear and is you get more involved with science and in my case through a foundation a sissy foundation funding a lot of early state sides you realize how expensive it is not how long it takes it is a long term investment and if you are looking to make behavioral changes or modifying aspects of yourself cognitive physical psycho motion or otherwise identifying interventions a options that seem to have some plausible upside there is a a mechanism that might make sense in humans if you feel fairly certain there's very limited downside which should include talking to people ho are presenting their results as anecdota then maybe you consider using acts if you can capture downside and i recall for instance looking at transresperitral specifically not for longevity but in potentially increasing endurance for fire body and i ended up testing it and there is funny story say with that did not quite work out his planned and i do not use it any longer but what i experience prior to actually finding this on forums was joint pan albopan the one most consistent side effect was what felt venenose is in the elbows and then i went on line and i had already done this but i had not come across anything e was the five hundred group people had been using five hundred milligrams of transfer rester tall daily for long period's time and one of the most common reported side facts as down pan no psycoca ism not willing to make that train off you ans a sense to me ye i think it would be fun if ever you were willing that we could do a hybrid podcast on supplement fails i have come specular failure as do i and ism dinging ism thinking about a few of them i mean some that were really took me off course there is one supplement a called bulging natelensis this is anonanother one of these shrubs son second infection i mean this thing will really spike your testosterone and free testoserand ism talking back acne huge strange games of graham it is really wiled and then after about seven or ten days it all crashes and you go below baselingson toy o even testicular pain as infill delay you all if you are smart person you halt uses right i can understand why people are skeptical as certain things and then course there supplements that ism a fan of in that you be fan if we talked about those things elsewhere but u it might be one to do supplement fail i was i can never your willing that all i could do a it experimental fails oh ye ye and of one experimental female which include things that people might not think about for instance for our body had quite a bit of real estate dedicated to looking at things party thou plainly which plasma i think there is a roll for it it is not useful for everything but for certain types of injure or repair i think it is very interesting a but i every time you get injected this is where have to be careful case a very few free lunch is out there there there usually some type of feed back loo system i very smart that ought o regulating things this is this is outside of that a consideration that i had not made which is every time you have an injection there is a chance of an infection particularly if the sight in my case was the elbow and the injection was made for the p r p not quite where it should have been slightly to the rear of the elbow were the the skin is very thick and it pushed i staff bacteria from a middle air of the skin into the joint capsid not and that really could have ended very poorly i an't it up having to go to the car and get at get it all removed and on but that could have ended up i an't a in a much much more severe situation you do are to be careful to the staff have become a little more conservative with somewhat i do i including injections o i let me think twice about the injections we must swallow something let me make from really looking at the implications for the liver no smart very smart ism curious about some of the things that you talked about in the for our body and that you have mentioned to a things accelerometers continues clucks monsters deliberate cold exposure how many of those things are you still doing on a red ulnar basis and how many do you ism you not use couple times a week or a couple times a month or go through phases of using and not using cold exposure i use as consistently as is practical from traveling it is little harder but recall i right now one the first things i do to find a few options for contrast theory one of the first things i did and it by contrast i do not mean inform red sand and cold plunge it'd much rather have hot and cold water just in terms of set of speed of heating the japan's approach rite for just speed of azo dilation particularly for injury o recovery i think it is incredibly helpful for mood regulation certainly that is case and cold water for mood regulation or the treatment of say depression or as a preemptive intervention to a voider mitigate depression is old used to be prescribed for melancholy and people the tangos of the world would be prescribed cold baths that what something i we let us take a look at some of the old history read about that and then look into pulled and on to see what might be supported the cold ism still using i become increasingly interested this was not for our body but whole body hyperthermia often excluding the head for depression which i know there is some some research i hand house es yes a right now have really interesting studies too early to report ism not involved in these but think these are really important studies because for all the people say o well is icebathstoff metabolism this metabolism that but one thing that is very clears longlasting very significant increase in the catacolemies doping me an up in u for nourupe an efferent ism not a replacement perhaps for anta present medication but as you said to move the needle toward anti depressant states i that is the cocktail and ism heat as well and the hypothec me a especially the way to formatter right now with some o the researches is very early stages there is going be less adherence it is not as redly viable say culch our called bath i d you think about the practical vocations that but right now its it is very interesting slow care diet still use it all the time it is not my default twenty four seven as it used to be mama just getting older and more self indulgent but if i find myself going off the rails bit and ism oke ism getting closer an muffin top here let us stage and intervention then i will go immediately backed slowcarb die and within within a matter of weeks i eat it is it is pretty easily corrected and just a cue for people i know it is it slow care diet achieved great prominence in fact it was not it figured on mention in an episode of oranges the new black i think it might a men it is made it i made appearances on a hand full oho great i realize that have been referring to the slow care diet several times throughout this discussion for those that are not familiar with the slow care diet i know they can go look up what that is but that we can keep them here i for the rest of this discussion and not have to send the mountain back i just yet and you give us just a brief top contour of what the slowcarb diet is this a slow care diet is intended to be a simple easy to adhere to diet for people who have perhaps failed other diets that allows you to re compose your body t improve muscle mass decrease body fat percentage and the rules are really simple and that is part of what makes it work it is not ideal for every sport in every circumstance but broadly speaking it works for a lot of people who've had trouble with dieting in the past remember one do not drink calories that is a very simple blackcoffee on sweetest great juice out anything with calories out you could add a little bit a heavy create to your coffee let us say but that is that is also bending the rules in a way that i do not in the beginning it is tit follow the rules you can break them later som the beginning let us u say you cannot drink calories number two do not eat anything white sounds pretty basicrajust do not eat anything that is the collar of white or that could be white basically that means you can be avoiding starches and a things that are are similar to starches then close things oat meal then on those things i hope meal roughly speaking just avoiding things that are white or the could be white we will get you pretty far and yes the re exceptions colly flower fine you can have mayflower but again do not get fancy rats it is very easy to outsmart yourself when it comes to behaviour'll change keep it simple for at least two weeks forget about the exceptions rant do not drink galleries do not a anything white and then eat thirty grams approving within thirty minutes of waking up don't get got that and then there are few buckets you can choose from rants you have vegetables beans and lentils and then some type approbating you're going to come up with meals that you can follow without deviating for a period of one or two weeks just come up with the same meals and that is got a sound boring yes but guess what you do it already you just might not realize it and the the lentils in the bean specifically as a prefect we can get into together reasons but add a lot of fire and also inhibit appetite rats that is actually very important component of these meals there may be a handful of other rules but those of the basics and then the redemption is take one day off per week and just fuck and crazy that is cheat day there are some epic cheat days out there some have captured for myself and anything goes when i say anything i do mean anything if you wont to consume multiple pastas pints of ice cream whatever indulge i left one out no fruit during the week avoid fruit avoid fronts sell a gooey sector anything that is sort of hidden sugar avoid all that a it is a no added sweeteners obviously but avoid avoid fruit in fronts and again it is not kin to kill you guess what if you are from yeuropean ancestry your ancestor do not have like blueberries in the middle of winter generally speaking rand you will you will be fine for a few weeks a then there is that cheat day and cheat day anything goes the amount of damage you can do on cheat days pretty limited and there are ways you can mitigate that there is a whole chapter called damage control and before her body but folks sing just on that diet and having one day off where you can do anything means when you are controlling yourself for those six days of the week you are not giving up your favorite foots for ever you can even keep a list all things young eat on cheat a and then you have free license to eat not cheat day and a that provides you with a release felt that you can build in the cheating i supposed to having it occur as a failure point never handful of other things there if you have domineer foods in the house for instance if you eat a lot of almonds a mix nuts and you are discuss sit there compulsively eating them while you are sitting at your laptop do not have what i call dominate foods in the house which are going to really create some portion controlishes but broadly speaking do not drink calories do not an things that are white take from three categories and build your meals out and those of the meals that you follow do not eat fruit or fronts and an cheat one day a week and saturday's a nice day re cheat day for most folks and a just to answer some questions be her can have know that doesn't can twenty four hours you can spread out over two days that will actually say you back but the amount of fat that you can store in a handful of sittings over twenty four hours which legitimately is more twelve to eighteen hours pretty limited up that is slogerbdyke great thank you for that i also not to ask is it o q to take the day after cheat day and fast or do one meal that day when i followed the slowcarb diet i benefited from it tremendously a loss fat gain muscle tons of energy sleeping great required less caffeine all sorts of wonderful thing stable blood sugar i felt good i really enjoy the cheat days really really enjoys it don't boys much fin i at some point there is some gastric distress that comes from not regulating and take a which led me to not want to eat the next day i i tended to do the cheap days on sundae in my case and then i would fast most of money just water black coffee tea and then i might have a small meal in the evening and then by tuesday i was back on the slow carp die i does that seem a am and i sort of a detrimental deviation from the from the plan i think that if that is what works for you then that is what works to you this is the this the slowcarb die templet for me as a starting point and generally it'll say i think this is from pacassa it is ti learn the rules as an amateur see can break them as professional but as likes i recommend tost people can a stick with the foreman for a handful weeks and measure the results write this to there are guys lines for how to measure the the scale is a bit of a blunt instruments o there other ways but if you are extremely over way you disuse the scale and fasting i think is fine or just ratcheting back your cleric consumption significantly and what happens over time for most people also is for the first sake four weeks on cheatday y ruin to go completely insane and i remember i was doing it something much stricter call the sichmical keetorganic diet which the whole separate thing it is much more limiting in terms of what you can eat but i was training for ultimately the nationals and chines kick boxing this is happening in ninety nine us training superhero i was falling a sickleculkeetorgenic get which meant i could eat very few things but i did have this one cheatday and i would do a blikagin to place on work out beforehand which is one of things you can do to limit the damage on deathday do likagin to please on work out beforehand and then i would just go crazy i mean i would drive to the crispy cream by twelve doughnuts and they would be gone by the time i got home and it was not an hour away as a tenpin it drive do not just be on i would go to safe way and i would buy a bag of those outsized snickers and that would be just a tiny portion of my called duff for you it a lot of sweet stuff i also did the savory staff i mean i had my favorites nothing was tafia nothing was safe nothing was safe my my paws got into everything and then over time because the next day your going to feel you got hit by the diabetic thump truck you start ratcheting back i oh maybe i don't need to do that maybe cheadale just be two meals or maybe cheatdale listee the pastries in the morning with the coffee and you start to regulate a bit generally you do not have to but overtime you generally well and i think after you followed it to the tea just follow the commandments first say forty eight weeks then you concern my dulia and ism not saying if you are not hungry do not eat however in many cases people have they have acclimated to not eating in the morning and then they end up over eating later in the day if you have that habit right if you are consuming fifty per cent your galleries or more at dinner and you want to lose body fat i would say get some cottage she's or something that will give you thirty grams easily in the morning worst case cicero use a proline of sometime just do not make it hydrochloric you powdered protein could be powdered weigh powdered way proven whole food has come do a lot more and no carry counting correct no caloric tends to be self limiting when you are eating this much fiber in trismus protein it tends to be very selflementing what you will want to consume in what you can consume once again i had great experiences with slowcarb diet and a iron to go back on end nobody an a nobody needs to buy anything to figure it out if you to search on tiptop log slowcarb diet there you will get everything that you need to get started no purchase necessary why it works very very welli'll say that and it is very straightforward to follow and it does include the the notorious a cheat day i am infamous cheat day i i and it can be done m on it on very reasonable body and if people want it i learn more about that that you go to times blog on for our a a for our body and ism slowcarb diet will provide a link but it is unit i think it is worth high lighting again just how effective that is as you pointed out thousands and thousands of people am using it to great success some of whom were a quite beast and knowing yet what any up dates on those folks are they still keeping the wall i would li to do a follow up i it is i think with diets in general there is a lot of reversion to the mean yen are regression to the means o i would expect that that some have kept it off and some have not they'll be true of i think every possible diet especially for people who are overcoming behavioral inertia of having gained hundreds pounds but it'd to do some follow up wat was fun about the post i put together called howtoloose a hundred pounds on the slowcarb diet we had we profiles say four or five people but there were dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens and this was a very long time ago i would say that a long trofollow would be superinteresting and that did at one point track several thousand people through a platform of the time w things coached of me as they follow the slowcrbdie for the first tough four to twelve weeks and how's fastininting cause i want the data and ism happy to be proven incorrect with any of my assumptions i mean i i do not view that as a failure and i view that as as a huge net gain and i it has a very high at here in start i i pay attention to not just is something effective does it get you the outcome you want not only is it efficient from a time and resource perspective but how high is the her start print if you take a random sampling of a thousand people from us a cross sous economic classes et camera how many people practically speaking will be able to are willing to follow this for say an eight week period time or four week period time and i try to optimize for the widest adherents because i know the the spoke die people conduct bi but what about interment fasting what about this and what about endurance out this this is not for everybody in all cases it just happens to be a good default diet with a high at he in strait and you said it is very inexpensive it can be followed very very inexpensively i just start interrupt you one thing that i really about it is that a many a variance on colonic restriction which is as lows of the to dynamics diagonally apply the ox person when to trying to say they do not am but one of the issues with a lot of things including intermittent fasting which i sort of dow some very into cause i not really hungry to eat until about elevenonling to train in the morning if i can et camera is that they can sometimes prevent best performance in terms it especially resistance training high intents resistance training very low credits have tried them ism even if your paying attention to you other ways to restock blikagin it performance drops off whereas the slowcarb died i feel i can think i can work i can exercise i can sleep everything just works well but there is one thing in it that i want to raise at i when i heard this i thought there is no way this is true which was a making sure that you get thirty or grams of proline within thirty minutes of waking i thought how can that be that how can adding proline early in the day actually make a difference and it really did work i was i still track my numbers some terms of dropping body fat percentage increasing muscle it really does work know whether not that simply because it is offsetting food in take that i would have ism food that i would have taken in later in the day i do not know and i it i can make myself my own control experiments to the point that i drive myself crazy but ism it really does work i quite well ism to get past sticking points o you just get that thirty grams ofprotine early violate and the a ism time restricted feeding component deliberately with some proline in the morning then still train and do all the other things and you will carry on as usual and it is just it seem peculiar eating more and and losing body fat butt works lot's counter tut of and a lot of approaches can work for a lot of different people i to state the obvious but this particular aspect of the slowcarb diet is helpful for lets just say the majority of the people in that thousand person sample of talking about the hypothetical pul from different parts of say to you ask or anywhere because it it it seems to help with a few things first there is just the thermic effect of food and for proline there is a greater thermic effect you also have and i think there is there is decent at the time there was decent literature to support this i do not know it is change that the protein take along those lines has an appetites suppressing affect that the net daily calories con used tends to be less when someone has a higher protemeal earlier in the day and last but not least i will say one of the risks and there are many people who excuse well on this be if to be very meticulous which is true of the keetorjacdiet as well you can go yourself into a lot of trouble if you do it sixty per cent write or seventy per cent write your merely yen there you gat yours in there massive siriasis an he might scalp you sloughing off take when ism in quite is lie non what the hell is going on and ore going back on some complex arbitrates in going away i exactly s i do not need ion need a randomize control trials and oi simply do not want a from that's booty dater scalp minus in the case of say time restricted feeding some people who do intermittent fasting lose a lot of musclemasts and there are multiple reasons for this i think people should make use of relatively widely viable tools data and on to insure that your composition is actually moving the way you think it is moving a make tree standardize your hydration for that as well as time of day just protect that is true for blood test as well but it seems to get nether better effects than trying to teach people how to fast effectively which you can do and we can talk about fasting that is something it was not included for our body that were i to rewrite it to day i would include a section and there was a bit in tools of titans to address that on more extended fasts lest just call it three to seventy fasts a that is an are that is o of great interest to me as is cutouts and metabolic psychiatry a a wrist palmer who we both know incredible timing what he is what the awakening that he is a created through his book and going on your podcast my podcast and others and in you letting people beware that changes in diet can impact mental health to i think in two three years that is going to be a do and we are not just telling about the difference between am slamming back horrible foods a horrible for us foods verses eating really clean ism an really specific diet protocols to treatment health ye incredible that is supers that is that is one of the things that ism paying a lot of attention you rent now they are handful in that realm within the just say the the interplay of mind and body since the care partisan duality in separation of this two makes no sense a biological standpoints sill a that is that is something at certainly captured my attention i paid a lot of attention to even as far back as early two thousands a for mental health and just cognac performance thanks for a revisiting some of the for our body in slow care die and elaborating on i some of the process that went in to that and i think a creators of all kinds thinkers of all kinds and people who are interested in the contents of the for hour body are going to be a very grateful for that information i certainly fascinated by your process om one of the things that you mention along lines of process was the power of places and where one happens to live i think there is a essay by pal graham that talks about this it is a outdated and it talks about the messages that you am the tacit messages of being in certain cities i think it was feeling boson you are not smart enough am i wo as is new york i you are not powerful enough ah and not you always t mi to think it and a or you should be more powerful is the message the tacit message lost angels a what you a what you are doing people are not paying attention a a paying enough attention to it something that to do not ascot messages tat these are stereotypes about cities certainly cities change am the role of places is an interesting one you mention you a small gathering caving belly's house quantifiedself and i think for people who do not know people that right om may we could get your thoughts on you how would one think about where to live and and maybe even curating their own gatherings useful gatherings because it is not that aft imagine it is not that you got sat back and ism timpharisiegs ism heaven telling let us have a gatherings we can talk about it a few hears on a broadcast the stove happens that were your notes dangerousort organically e when people who have common interest decide to get together and talk and listen and brainstorm and i yet to do that in i won i good people and not have something really incredible come out of it not surly that day but looking five years looking back five years later and that was really worth while torment few thoughts in no particular order i would say the first is it depends my recommendations depend a lot on where you are in the ark of your career in life if you are in full growth hyper drivemode and you are trying to bold both yourself and your capabilities in a very concentrated way were you not nearly focussed on family maybe have fewer obligations then if you are serious i think many people should consider moving to an area of high density for period of time it could be three months it could be six months could be longer but putting yourself in a new york or an else or san francisco or chico or as new places developed it'll it'll give you one you might not expect say an automat canada were shopifies based and the presence and growth of shoplift has spawned and entire ecosystem of start ups there may be options outside of the usual cast of characters pittsburg and do a lingo similar effect here are more options than people might recognize but taking a journey and placing yourself in a place where you can be in a very active pinball machine where you may interact serendipitously with many different people from many different worlds i think is i is is hard to overstate the value of and my drive an my filtering functionless just say because when i first got to the maria nobody care come was nobody his driven my mams used many van hand me down that have had the seat stolen out of the jacket when's you earn t were you in the south bay i was i was working in saint obey ye i man no disrespect to san of a ism from the south bay yet but there is of there is a bleakness to the south there is there is a little bit of bleakness and then i lived across the street in this tiny apartment lived across through from the jack in the box in mountain view sit is not i was strolling on to the big stage and just blowing people away why i i i g right in your mountain view on your familiar i i skated the curves to that yaw a you train of the guldsjim and off rang storied actually mama it was a great him that is a great him as graham i do not think it is still a are there superlative before my writing sessions and it had the benefit of being open really really late and w gangster i have not thought about that in a long time that the point is i also started where a lot of people are starting and what did i do i put myself in a high density environment next what did i do knowing no one i started to volunteer at events where they had interesting speakers an interesting people coming to hear those speakers i put myself in silicon valley and then i began volunteering for groups s vase i do not know if it exists any more of the silken valley association of start up bunch printers i think it was ti the indicant printer which is a very sort of india or india america focussed organization that does a lot in the realm of start ups and i would carry water i would take out garbage i would check name badges i would check people and nothing was too low for me and it'll give you guise a tip that will be obvious to some but non obvious to many when you are volunteering a lot of folks who volunteer do the absolute beriminimum because they are not getting paid this is not going to get you noticed but it sets a very low bar that if you volunteer at these events and some one's drop in the ball or there is something happening that needs fixing and you just proactively do it the producers of these events will notice you and this is what happened over time over a few months and then i got invited to join in on meetings that were planning future events and i eventually got to the point where i was recruiting speakers and able to set the agenda for and entire man event and then that is how i got to know say jack canfield who is the creator of chicken suit for the soul and many others who introduced me to my bookagent many many many many years later jack canfield but i was a nobody them you have to play the long game but you can be methodical and how you play that and that is one approach just as an example for how too build your network which snow balls over time do not hump every i geese leg within ten minutes a meeting them play it cool and mar an t e gatherings where that person is i has lot demands on them is the last place you want to do that the way your on to makers nose saliency to that you a way your going to makes o memorable with people that is to be very professional always on time predict what they are going to need or promise it'll run into beforehand and address them before they even think of them and be easy to deal with and people that high performers notice these things they will make note of it now the being easy to work with is something that i used to tell my graduate students stock coming because the opposite of that nobody wants nobody wants spicily the again later ill get great your stove jobs you on to be difficult here and there or a lot no problem i but in the beginning that can be a real liability you can make up for that if you are the best in the world but in the very beginning you paid will not be i to try to stack the deck in your favor volunteering is a short can that would be one way of doing it another now especially given the virtual communities that exists you have sublet its you have an my communities you have twitter groups you have club house you have got a million different options which can be overwhelming club house still going maybe not have now it oh no i do not no ism not say i it is gone i just i remember during the pandemic there were some club house gatherings a hold on there and but have we forgotten to to lethe be not the the platform affinity is really fickle which is why i think to the extent possible if you want to gold a world class ay use that term very deliberately network in record time just to give you nice headline i would say boast on the uncrowded channelwich is in person it is out of fashion it is out of vogue going to a conference and actually interacting with humans in the hallway approaching panelists this is another thing that i did it'll give it it'll give another ten very early on i wold go to conferences nobody cared whit was nobody knew it was fine and i would study the panels let slam going to a big event south by south west and i would this is what i did not two thousand seven which was ghost prior to the first book coming out and i would go to these various person events i was fast mostly on events that had the the thematic focus of blogs we c come back that but blogs were what pod casts for a few years ago they drove incredible traffic but they were undervalued by main stream yo undervalued by mainstream publishers et camera which meant there was an arbitrage opportunity in a way and i would pick say a handful of panels with topics i thought were superinteresting and then the panel would end and what would happen the panels would get rushed by various bones because many them were well known who was not getting rushed the moderator i would go straight to the moderator and i would talk to the moderator i thank them for the panel would be very genuine none of it was made up and talk them for a bit they generally ask why i was there what i was interested and i would mention whenever that happened to be in this case it was and finishing my first book or hade my first book coming out soon up here to hopefully meet people who are involved at a b your see and then if we hid it off which was not sure every time but if it seemed to be going well i would say i do not know any one here ism really sort of warned here making my way through i this entire event is there anyone else here you think i would get along with who maybe i could buy i drank her coffee and vast majority the time to dike o i you should be and and then i get the introduction and then i would meet that person i would have a genuine interaction with that person and if it made sense if things were going well it'd do the same thing is there anybody else here you think i should just say high to and i get along with not who i can ask for something and that was not deception i was being honest someone i could actually vibe with and if would you mind make an interest o yes her no prove many of those people are still my friends and by being surgical in that way not trying to gather business cards to use it really antiquated a metaphor hi hand about you people still hand about i guess depends where you are bishop boson but if if rather than trying to collect people as spoke on cards developing say five three to five deeper relationships through longer conversations at n event that is what directly led ultimately to the hockey stick for the for our work week with intent with in specifically san francisco suppose to be a few approaches for for building your network when you do not have the ability to just walk up to say kavancaly and have a conversation that came over time and whether or not its health practice is or i nutritional practices or at meetings seems your oriented toward the uncrowded but very interesting people in spaces but the keycard there i think is uncrowded and of course the other ye were interesting i ism insulin your standing in the parking lot talking whoever happens to be there although that cannot be interesting i others the serendipity there and on there is always em things to learn from people but in terms give a career advancement and and building new ideas and forging for information ism just struck how you have done that over and over am and again thank you for i giving us some insight an i across please i here is another one i think there is a tendency among people who want to develop their networks were there relationships to be starfuckers not to get to technical but an technical term ye n ye they want to tell other people they are friends with someone more than they want to develop skills or learn from someone this puts you in a very disadvantaged position because then that means are i you on become friends with the unmask good luck or you in become friends with this blister celebrity who everyone else wants to me good luck it is going to be a crowded bloody path to get there and by the way they have also certainly develop really a tuned defenses against people you it is going to be hard on the they have staff too we end a safer they have a falling i protectors to prevent you from every getting to that person on the other hand you are perching it from the standpoint of developing skills learning and actually becoming potential friends with some one give you an example you could go after you want to become better at boxing let us just make that up a may be not the greatest example skin would be another one but let us let us stick with boxing just because of the way it'll explain it if you wanted to say get personalized lessons from flood may weather think can haven look let us go then they be a step down out of the profanes to gold medalist of if it is brannewgald medalist lust you say opera de ahoy when he was really the golden boy and a just thrashed every one still going to be hard what about the silver medalists just had a bad day when he had that last bout against opera delajoya potentially rent from a technical perspective from a personal connection perspective you may have more in comity that person or bronze medalist and they can get you seventy eighty ninety per cent of the way there and by the way you probably do not have the physical attributes to make to a hunter percent anyway if you are coming to it this late and you could get in many cases one on one lessons whether in person or virtually with someone who is of that caliber they are in the same front of the pack as the names i just mention maybe not as famous hunderbuo tunorbux proud for a lot of people that is within reach yet ism not sure wat the value of say one knows somebody very famous is is just terming in something have oriented to it is a common orientation and i think that is true for a lot of things many people you say psychadel lies because they want to tell other people the story that they have of doing cygadelics right they are not doing it intrinsically for what they hope to get out of that experience may be this part of them but it is more the social signaling and validation they get when they project that out at a group dinner into a story that they can tell that is true for many things one the questions i ask myself with all sorts of things if i could never talk about this would i do i what what a great great thing to think about right if i if i could have less you say we did not know each other and as i cook at ism earlier in my career let us apply some constraints ism not where i am i still want to do aby and see in the public eye may go on a build a podcast to em if i could meet with you but i can never tell usual would i do it ion would you i wo i writ would to but it for a lot of folks if they seen it'd meet with you and that thing i yang i way i me o pithy i no the blame me i meet with me all the time and sometimes it is pretty unpleasant yet and and that can be applied all sorts of things it is in it is it is a useful question exact myself this for examining your motivations and ism not saying one motivations always better than another but it is it is you should at least be aware of your driving motivations because you can end of plain games you are not even aware you are playing and that is i end up i think getting into a lot of trouble in life one of the ways that would be a question i might reply i ply other questions there is a great question i that set go and applies who really i admire tremendously and has built and incredibly an orthodox unique life for himself and his family es he is zinged when everyone would expect him to bag and i i and he always has a defensible logic behind it and much ceric zippers but most people of ply heard the hypothetical question what would you do if you knew you could not fail what would you do if you could not fail and set turns on around i think that is a good question but he turns round and said what would you do if you knew you were unto fail in terms of identifying what you old do for the process what would you do if you knew it was going to fail k oat you are considering these five dizen projects let us either all gan a fail but you still have to choose one of the five which would you choose that is a great question much harder to answer and you at the same time ism called back to a when i was a graduates to and still now with the podcast i have this on litmus test which is is the experiment that ism working on the one that i want to be working on most is the pod cast that ism working on the one that i want to be working on most i mean there's truly no other pocks id rather be having to day than this one right and the moment ism storrygtothing oh i wish i was doing that thing over there i realize ism off target ism off target and i think that asking really good questions something clearly that you're very good at and getting a love deeper into your process around that you write those things down that is there a notebook some place in the kingdom of a of him ferries in busting or elsewhere u that says those questions that that esentaly those questions are written are they you collet i i literally hove a document with questions that have gathered from see printed out and at the urban be staying here som i brought it with you i we printed it out here and then i rent through and i read it last night in was highlighting questions from past interviews have had with him on my podcast to revisit his questions i i was literally doing that last night over dinner and i collect questions i collect questions if i am reading a magazine and i come across good question i take take photo or i capture it somehow in notes or i ever now which i knows kind of old fashion these days but used for everything the critical masses beyond in fortis and that i do collect and revisit these things i capture them in journals as well but i i absolutely capture good questions when i find them questions are powerful for the brain at one are going to this an too much detail cops i have a lot questions for you ut i we just rapped a a series on mental health that will come out later this year with paulcontiand he is brilliant as we both know and i does truly important work and and he pointed to the value of asking really good questions about oneself and e because of the way that questions that are really directed at self inquiry cut up the subconscious e yo ask the question and unlike a statement are a mean the brain works with that it the days and hours after asking the question in ways that simple declarative statements probably do not peen the system the same way which is probably why we can see many points of wisdom and truth everywhere and it does not scarily transform us but asking really good questions really does seem to transform us other there is sir i think judging people by their questions is is also a short cut to assessing and learning a lot about how someone functions and what makes them tick thing is alter who said you judge a man by his questions i by his answers something along those lines but when in doubt attribute to volatile sounds good daman that i think about this a lot i do think about the questions and i refine the questions that i ask myself especially while journalling because it is easier to cross examine in stress test your own certainty and beliefs when they are captured on paper or digitally on a laptop for instance i i do routinely revisit certain questions that give found helpful overtime i mean one that people can play with is with whatever is really causing you consternation or stress at the moment some kind of decision or relationship business could be anything just what might this look if it were easy what might this look if it were easy if it had to be easy if that were possible what might it look and ti could apply to anything i can plain anything in could apply to could apply fitness if you do really intents cannlebell swings twice a week with proper weight and load and time undertention and you do push ups a few times a week and handle a couple of other elements ingest in pretty good shape it is simple but it is a lot man hit is your entrepots to your chant if i do some push ups in some quirlwork but if you were not exercising at all because you have made the assumption that it is four hours five hours a week rather than completely remove that objective and call it just impractical can you watch it down the scale how far can you watch down the scale until you have no excuses of just be one one example language learning taken wasting it pleas to everything making life easier untying it define gets my vote i make n easier in making it more elegant the more pieces in your life you have floating around the more contacts the more extraneous loose connections the hard your life is going to be the cognitive overload or overhead is really high som always looking for maybe japan's a flour arranging i going to have how many pieces can i remove while still lie maintaining the essence of what ism trying to choose you and rick rebel and mat on you you two people i an fortunate enough to know personally and that give tremendous respect for in another work and a itself have dent i that is really remarkable a rewind that and listen to that semen right there folks ism telling you have worked hard to apply it because it is not my default and boy does it make a significant improvement to simplify simplified and li take some thought and question asking i just cannot treat things at random till you get down to some fixed number but ism it'd to ask you about another area were you really have seem to see around corners and this is one that i shall carried with it significant risk ism not necessarily risk to health into life but risk in terms of outside perceptions and that is psychedelics as have substantially changed my view on this i we do not to go into my former stands on i talked about that when you were gracious enough to host me on your pod cast for a second time it'd done some psychedelics recreational as a kid it was correlated with ism not great times in my life stayed away from them than eventually re visited empty a may in particular from a therapeutic standpoint for tremendous benefit again therapeutically with a medical doctor again these drugs are illegal a soon to change perhaps hopefully and we will talk about that but a it is becoming clear from the controlled studies by robin cart arris i there are many others i kind know one willies others ism that these drugs have enormous potential to help relieved depression aroma i help people explore their psycheither mind for sake of feeling better doing better in the world for leaning into life not to an drop out but ism you to really lean into life with more purpose and more satisfaction and some cases they have really have saved lives i think i what was your mind set around psychedelics when you first started exploring them what led you to overcome the inevitable me o fear r gap there a because you do seem somebody who takes value in your health you are not reckless now you may have been more adventurous in the past with things i i hate the word but byohacking and self experimentation than you are now but but you obviously have some self preservation mechanism in tact we learn e learn we learn am what was your mind set around at the time and then i want to get to what you have learned from it a an frankly the tremendous efforts that you have put that are now translating to tremendous value for really millions of people and ultimately i think it is going to be millions of people a by establishing funding for the pioneering research in this area helping to promote the movement of these compounds from illegal to legal in the therapeutic sitting on and on take us back to a your first thoughtful exploration of psychedelics would that look you o mushrooms all ado not it was at it or was it am or what's it a a dedicated a research process and who would o talk to what was it all about s let us go away back to my undergrad experience and therefore many reasons that i an't a going ta princedom i think i was very lucky to get in i es say t scores because i can never finish the daftest have much of a perfectionist i got stuck and not doing terribly well but through essays and other things ultimately was able to go hardly wot i let me interrupt you and just say i think at this point we can say they were lucky to have you well thank you f ya y thank youagreat institution a you have done great and you area i a great am a poster on the wall for them really hope really o the i i i just on say cause you are not going to and i think it is important that these are great institutions of great minds go through there and a bench fine wen through there i know at and and their success rest not just on the intestines be t also on the study body an what they go out into the world and do and not just in the romaine really there there lucky to have had you o thank you drew i stupid chines in a rumor i had studies to teach its pretty cool to set foot and spend time weakly in a space of shared by some of these people it really it really gets the imagination firing if we go back to that chapter in my life i was initially a psychology major with focus under science i want to be a neuroscientist and there are many reasons for that i have narrative generative disease on both sides of my family parkinsinsand all timers that was certainly a personal driving interest in terms of looking at mechanism's understanding what therapeutics existed or did not exist how things were developing in the research and while i was there which later i ended up a switching years an transferring to focus on language acquisition and here station studies hence the chines that i mentioned earlier and japan's and crew but on the negro science side ere a lot of cool break through also that came out of a princedom around that time looking at the amazing discovery i say a coronal i i want on less a regenesist but nauru genesis in hippocampus and risguld and fact exactly there as quite a bit happening at that time i was a subject i loved volunteering for studies just to try to get an inside look at how things were done in some of a dance conman's experiments sos ire was a cruel time to be there and within the first two years i one to say i had my first experience recreational with mushrooms and looking back now i am horrified by the lack of control men meaning not control but lack of supervision write them into setting the s t in setting ended up being fine nothing terrible happened but there were lot always it could ha on sideways but that first experience and i must have consumed in retrospect to state dizzying amount e mushrooms mi lady in excess of five grand would have been more yet just knowing what i know now it would have been cutis do not do this at of do not do that and not ism i to say do not do it at home do not do it at all yet ye please i do not this i actually do not think a the young developing brain should be exposed as si can know we can tell we we of about that yo in ti we we to o ti my stance i minute t to an i more now yo o i man in in the world in which we live in the u s i would i would told late rithyou and there are some inti cultural exceptions in other places i where there things are more set up to provide for that type of use but i certainly would not recommend it but but coming back to my my recreational experience my my subjective experience was bizarre and my experience of time non linear my experience of self different from anything i had experienced up to that point and therefore my construction of reality being completely unlike anything i had experienced was enough to make me want to learn about these compounds and very early on still have a scan of it somewhere i think he was in nineteen ninety eight or ninety nine actually wrote a paper one of my junior papers was focussed on examining potential similarities between rim sleep and i list else twenty five i and looking at some of the patterns of of neural activity of course we can no lot more now with with the tools we have available but from a scientific perspective i was very curious about how much we knew and how much we did not know and i would say that latter category gets me more excitedn't i one how how much room is there for growth here and because if if were just putting on the finishing touches with marginal you incremental improvements on something that we feel we have largely figured out that is less interesting to me than something that baffles most people examining them on some level an there is a professing marry jacobus who was doing some veryinting work he did a lot of work looking at the certain urgent systems and i did a lot o work with cats ultimately i could not do personally the animal work required of the sort of indentured servitude that i would i leave the roll in some place onto youth you said when confronted with the a the prospect of a installing a a a computer printer inion the head of their cat a on re a a cat had on the back of a cad they they half had the those like vigil ports on the back of these cats heads because cats sleep a lot answer their instinct study ala that we cats very few laboratories work on cats any longer it is mostly a mouse still some non human primate work my laboratory essentially shut down am or in the process or shooting down even our mouse work i much prefer to work on humans they can give consent and the house themselves and a the animal research thing is tough for and fer any sentient being itstog the cat for what it is worth the cats seem pretty cat they were just sleeping and the the ports were for tracking the cats are pretty i be there were list normal cats the cats refined but i would have been we would have been injecting retroviruses into rats and an perfusing them which means bleeding them to death a to avoid bruising of the tissue because then if you are gin to take thin slices and scans you did not want have bruising and i just could not i just could not do it i think it is important i do think i do think there is a place for it but i could not do its that is why transfer out but the the plan using make is that i had the experience and then i had that drive the scientific interest and then i had a a probably one experience are year for a few years after that and what i noticed for myself personally because i suffered from major depressive disorder an extensive decrepit the depressive episodes lets you say on average three to four year and by by extended even before you had started even on you not from my young age you have from her and age and i would say police just call three to four on average year those could last each a few weeks or a few months man this is this is a a very high percentage my total year and when i had these hired experiences with with mushrooms sir topmast sloshy mushrooms and then if we precooking at the molecule that being examined scientifically sit son i noticed this afterglow effect that was really durable and that was an untie depression of facts or a mood elevating effect that lasted far longer than the e half life could explain ratings forty six hours your your your kind upon the other side and i would experience this this afterglow effect for three to six months and that raised all sorts of intruding questions what the hell is going on here is it the content is it some structural change there were a lot of unanswered questions for me and then i had a very very scary experience that led me too completely stop use of sygonolicswere again uncontrolled environment ended up en rural in rural new york coming out of my trips standing in mill the road e mill the night with headlights coming at me goodness gracious plea don't do that and i was look i two dangerous do were you takin them alone is that how that as akin e with two friends and my two friends without telling me tost much for a walk at left me on o dona prince to the yen i in the these are powerful compounds you under your playing with nuclear bower these these are the this is the nuclear power of the psychological or psycho emotional surgery i is is the way is incirtfuld think about them and i stopped using any psychedelics completely i was still very interested in them and but i basely hippies and i did not revisit that until it is call it two thousand twelve two thousand thirteen wrens still struggling with major do press a disorder and i saw my girl friend at the time completely transformed by supervised facilitated use of in this case iowasca which i was not quite as common as it is in conversation at the time and she did that in south america but she not only explained her experience but i was able to see the transformation in her that seem to have some durability over time and that is when i started stepping back into researching psychedelics looking at what had been published in the last must just call it ten years i as of that plain time and thinking that howiurd approach it systematically with safe guards with proper supervision and basely approaching at the way i would have approached to any of the topics in the for our body and that is what led me back into along with a number of other interventions i should say i was not betting the fare on psychedelics i also started t m at that point i was i was cut lose somepeole might trance a trresidental meditation does are for to ten day meditation retreats this was actually much shorter as a two or three day training and your visiting the instructor i one to say it is once or twice at pro i once a day and getting up to speed and i did this because i was going to the period of acute stress this was finishing for our chef this is actually price in the year's proceeding that and i had one friend who id seen really change from let call viper magnetic high anxiety to low anxiety and he said give the time you have the money pay for the course just take it yes they areal these criticisms of t m yes they are always weird historical anecdotes of people trying to levitate in all this weirdness just ignore that try and a levity against i a actually levitate that we got have a discogan but young levitates since i get why not every kitchen every kin tries all sorts of the give it an ah hes just put that aside because i i kept coming up with bushbuck any us look all ism saying is it is a warm bath for your mind the you take twice a day and it will chill you truck out try it dislike ski fines o god indoors hows as at this point i was i had been burning the candle at both ends intensely spoke there is t m and then i began examining how i might approach notice i did not just jump into using them s how could i preach taking secodolics in a s quench in logical sequence with proper protections with safety assurances and that took me probably a month or two and i was right in the middle of things and northern californium o access to a lot and only then did i start looking at having my own experiences and land behold i mean it'll it'll cut to the chase but the the personal out come and there they are many different benefits and risks i should make very clear these things can be extremely dangerous in certain ways generally not physiologically but they can be dangerous i would say instead of three to four times per year on average i probably have one depressive episode every to ears it is a significant improvement that right i mean from a quality of life perspective those are two different people and a that then led me to and i as i did with all my work outs right i took copious notes over the and i me now ere looking at ten plus years a if i weren't ever write another book a it old proline related to all of the really fine details of the experiments and my learning including some of the more boy the bazaar thanks overcast ten years but it would be a it would be just a beast to create with with psychedelics experiences with psychedelics sign relics and ort of psychedelic adjacent a non ordinary experiences of consciousness a which i think often are touching at edges of the same thing a which which is going to be controversial for some books but to to come back to the story line just to put a bow on that when i saw the personal outcomes for me the anecdota from friends who are facilitators who have worked with thousands of people write which is pretty good samples is still anecdote but these are people who are very smart who keep records and i i believe that these people have spotted patterns that are only going to be possible to test and verify over the next five to ten years si i at least as a is a means of generating hypotheses i take these people very seriously i and then i started to connect with scientists whose work i had read rolling griffin's at john's hoping began looking at the most compelling data related to say empty may assist psychotherapy and complex pasty i i made the commitment to myself that as soon as i had enough money to move the dial cause i really felt these tools were outside of the normal paradise of psychiatry infarmacology and that made me very excited because it was uncrowded there is very little fun in coming to the space it was high leverage and i looked at it just as have looked at my many start up investments a limited downside risk really high upside potential and i should say before that i had already been funding in a very small way science the first check i ever wrote was personally to madam gazali's lab at you see u lava great la which at the time was looking at somewhere he is not in dis description but men simplify it soft where that might attenuate a reverse age related cognitive impairment a specifically related to various aspects of of attention and that was my first for i into funding early stage science which was very analogous to me of a to to funding early stage start ups and then later on to touch on the reputation thing i know this is a tedious to thank you for listening can this is great please you are always gracious on your park as it that this is what people want an this is certainly what i want to here sir on the reputation side your wright that at the time especially let us just call it two thousand and thirteen tor two thousand fifteen this was not a not a comfortable national conversation of any type i would not have had this conversation now then none it lose i do not know that i would have lost my job at just when have raised a lot of eyebrows yen but now such studies are happening stay not a perception yet the perception was these are a professional third rail at the very least i also illegal therefore if i talk about them an mi giving someone probable cause mi going to get myself in some type of really tricky legal situation et camera there are a lot of considerations but i tested that just our saying it i to capture my assumptions on paper i can stress this sons i toque i think that might be true most people i know think that is true but is it true how could we test to see if that is treat and i decided to crowd fund for a hoping pilot study looking at sulicivon for treatment resistant depression and thought to myself toque we have we have a couple of couple of things falling in our favor here number one depression does not discriminate cross to economic classes across gender across race this is a problem almost every one knows some one who takes antytopressence who is still depressed toque treaty resistant depression therefore is the indication sulicivon is the intervention let me crowd fund and i did that throughout the time crowd rise which was confounded by toward north who had become a friend and with the actor the again is very smart very very very smart also one of the vest in vectors i ever met that which a lot people don't know very bright gey and crowd funded and i also to put my a money where my mouth is i said can is in when to see this like ism putting in acts the oldest rays i think it is eighty thousand something that for the following study and than els i let us see let us see what happens and there was basically zero negative global and not only whence was there no discernible negative blow back a number of people and this was deliberate i want to see this a number of people came out of the wood work to support in a bigger way in alsagoh of i see you much a handful of folks i knew in also how interesting oke there at least o half a dozen folks who are studying the same thing or paying attention to the same thing and then i just got bolder elsioka if i tested that let me push and then let us see what happens and it'll wait and lo and behold i realized that the perception did not match the reality the reality was of you talking about indications the cause an incredible amount of suffering for a very large number of people even those who are anti drug perse just say notodrugs want solutions and the current treatments for many of these things do not work very well and in the best of cases are often masking symptoms and not addressing rule causes i would say at that point i just went whole hog an i said do not get look i to think that i am exactly what you see is what you get rat the person you talk to off camera person you talk to on camera same and if i start feeling i have too much to protect i want to do something to counteract that in other words if if if i feel any to censure my true feelings and beliefs maybe not share my hardships perhaps not promote certain things because i have a reputation to lose that is a fragile position i want to be as anti fragile as possible and by talking about this i viewed it as a way of inoculating myself against fear of reputation lass look gal let me push this it'll ride this horse other people might not but i want to remove the stigma for funding purposes hopefully open up federal funding that is starting to happen now from different agencies and then to focus on access and reduction of cost and insurgents reimbursement and son i set a game plan let us call it may be five years ago and have just been slowly methodically executing on that since and i the reason i chose this to focus on and have funded other things but have really focused on this mental health there are puts which is not limited to psychedelics we can talk about some other thingstha i find interesting but psychedelics are i said what makes it attractive very uncrowded you can do a lot with a small amount of money unlike saying cancer research can be very hard look at your deck billionaire great maybe you can do something interesting and ism sure other people could but if you have twenty thousand fifty thousand dollars can be hard to make a dent there and psychedelics you can actually still make a difference and very high average in part because these complaints seem to challenge much of what we assume to be true about treating mental health and as that is a that makes for an attractive that that is where have been then gone ye ism glad you are that with us and that you did that exploration and that you have been spearheading the funding efforts a this podcast has a a a premium channel that is for raising funds for scientific studies we are in the process now making our first for a contribution one of those includes a work in join willies laboratory at stamford a combining a transcurnual magnetic stimulation with ism studies of i begin and a five ameodiam t may be a few other things but basely that he is free to do what he wants with the funds we trust him to do great work but that again was inspired by you write a podcast with a scientific a slant certainly this podcast obviously has a scientific slant but a the idea of doing philanthropy for the sorts of work that a really deserves funding and exploration and by the way it am in thinking about other highbred things that would be fun to do very night would love to a contribute an join those efforts that you cause the as i work to continue to raise funding for psychedelic studies and all these great laboratories continuous right now and you've rallied a collection of ism some pretty a powerful people to contribute to this i know you have joined arms with michael plan now in many ways d do wont talk about the fellowship did as pud the other i find that really quill yo you have got fellowships i in the works or maybe already happening at you we berley s a you see berley yes that what what i try to do and for people want to check it out it is it is the name of the foundation is sissy foundation and let me explain that for a seconds that is s a i s e i sissy foundation tout or i speak japan's i want there is an exchange to and speak redan write it still to the stay pretty well say can mean a lot of things it means rebirth in japan's and have can what can only be described or can certainly be described as rebirth than many conical out comes that i thought it was appropriate to use and what have tried to do with the foundation is i think do what ism pretty good at which is trying to peak round corners and find something to prototype right just the s g man i how can i just getting hold of a deck's come back then when it was just for type went i acoustics was was heart it was nothing that you have to as ho go under the skins i it is it is takin a barbecue prong in putting it under your abdominal skin it was not comfortable can you describe your am sort is all level and i subjective terms when you are at home you got this thing and you are about tin planted you do not have any present it is not this is young levels tore one of these other i we gas that are out there you knows do not stamp the thing in you can look on instergama see some one else do it there is nothing that you are home wondering if you are gin a sure you are live i i met on doing myself and ism sweating a stock par coff sitting there my got i o nothing can is you are front bin there to support you in case you you see viand get the time she was not because she was squeamish in do on to see it and ism sitingthere on my kitchen table i remember this got sweating just thinking about i and nobody was to watch and was not really supposed to have it in the first place and the device for read out by the way no y fun it ass this hanky a your looking thing that had a read out that made you think you were playing plan or something f is very green the green tin street we o a green we in is grot fond is primitive and a put this thing under my skin would cape i would cut a airlock bag and put it on top and and masking tacit to my skin to take showers because otherwise a would work and it was it was great and it'll justify that i do not use yea rate you realize you said it was great i did i did say it was great be conga wedding it was i was afraid i d i gave me a at insist oh we and then once i had the inside or work a course of a handful weeks than i felt i git didn't really need any more and that was also just a a heavy tax to pay you have to wear that thing around look give acting what does it call a lost me bagger some dangers it was big it was bulky a just i did that i wanted to do prove a concept rand the goal was can i use this for a healthy normal applications will the insights be actionable and they were long behold similarly with the foundation since ism dealing with smaller amounts of money and ism not a in the milliner club by any stretch of t imagination and science can be expensive ism looking for small bets where can i pilot something that if successful will be emulated or can be scaled and in e si the crowd funding for for the hoping treatment resistant depression pilot study we ended up exceeding the goal they were able to recruit more subjects in the case of you see berley michael plan and i partnered on this in my foundation funded it the ferias u see barely journalism fellowship psychedelic journalism fellowship is providing funding to up an coming journalists who want to focus on psychedelics as there beat which to this date has not been financially feasible you just do not have the space to do really long form investigates an investigative work and the hope being that these journalists can apply their skills in their dedication to examining different facts of the psychedelic ecosystem therapeutic potential i regulatory issues et camera in a way that can shape in inform national and international discourse in a in a very critical way because these things are not a panacea there is a lot of claims that are made about these that are totally unbacked by any type of science and their lot of charlatans and i want wanted to also invite really competent really good journalists to the table who might want to watch for bad actors i think that is really important and this fellowship has been been a has been awarding fellows with these grants and i think it is relatively small mama's ten thousand dollars our something that but the outcomes have been amazing we had a huge an one a a seven thousand word piece there was one of the main features in rollingstone magazine huge piece on national geographic focaston yoga and fair trade and some of the implications for local harvesting and or over harvesting all the dynamics present in that which i think has some incredible promise for particular forms of a olio use a olio used disorder in particular but a that has been a huge success the hope is that other journalist am schools will say it s great idea and i will have risked it for some other philanthropic are foundation or government say director and agency to say o can will green that because have done it and it is been received very well and its had a real impact on how things are moving along another one would be say at hazard popular this is at hazard law schools the first is the first dedicated team focused on law policy and regulation related psychedelics from a legal perspective is e super important supersuperimportant also another pilot less just call it a proof of concept that psych foundation funded was helping to develop curricula for i think it was male john's hoping and end of you effectively a an an accreditation are model they could put into their existing psychiatry my a programmed such that people could develop the skills necessary and the understanding necessary to administer psychedelic therapies if and when they become legal describable which it i understand correctly it oms within the next twelve the twenty four months mom a assisted psychotherapy for the treatment of drama is likely to become legal in the hands of a psychiatric at least it may be certain clinical psychologists as well in the you ask is that right that the through them through the efforts of the mapscrup yet through through the efforts of bastile origan redoubling many others that is the tip of the spirit i think any one who is interested in psychedelics should have invested interest in supporting those efforts not because we know everything works i want to be clear not because we know a prior that all these things do all the things know but if if media ma fails it is can be very hard to draft would be impossible the draft on that with comrades that are more difficult to administer sillesaven which would be next end line for outfall use disorder r also major depressive disorder i i i really feel that just everything have talked about whether it is networking putting together for our body or trying to change national policy and say a a reclassification of these compounds getting them out of schesuall one to some extent you want to break it down into its constituent pieces you are not doing a twenty analcedisfigure out what the critical feu are and then put them in the logical sequence and execute to plan one of the greatest weaknesses in the psychdelicyco system is there are lot of people who just want to do all the things and save all the people and all the animals and all the places all at once and that just does not work very well there are also s realist people are executing a we could talk about the for profit side on but a have been very very very please with the outcomes that sissy foundation has been able to achieve with very limited money ism prouder of those outcomes than i am of the start up record and the start up records pretty good a and it is the same lens ism using the same the same filters in the same approach a which is kind when i always look for looking for stuff that will translate across fields if possible and then you mentioned on arteamas i thank teams very interesting transcernial my next stimulation yet which et one point was a more commonly used to inhibit specific brain areas this is anomnivasive technique a have had it done weriancs over my motor quartering your tapping your finger in all son you cannot tap your fingers its pretty easy but now it can be used to stimulate at particular frequencies inhancneral plasticity and an incommonation with psychedelics is the this kind of burning question now can you get a a synergistic effect of tiaras and and a psychodolks may be am not just pouring the s u the sill been or a you bogey journey but in the days and weeks after when we know for sure a lot of plasticity is still occurring to keep the plates on board re accelerated and yes a titian's also is another be very interesting to me for depression anxiety even substance used is orders superinteresting and there are many different protocols all sorts of different technology ai would say low intensity or low power ultrasound also superinteresting a for various various applications potentially to addiction i am not to be clear a card carrying evangelist for psychedelics i am a proponent of looking for high leverage uncrowded bets with limited downside an testing them out and very optimistic but psychedelics if any one listening has a family history of psescitzphrenia bottling a personality disorder a which we might which this is being very simplistic but categorizes are describe as more chaotic conditions compared to hyper rigid conditions likeadoci d or anerecianervosa chronic depression et camera and we can talk about we some of these psychedelics leas some of the classical psychedelics seem to have cross efficacy with multiple conditions but psychotic seems very helpful for certain types of hyper rigidity when you get into it sets for in inbordling personality disorder they can be really heavily contraindicated not to say they cause those contos conditions but they can precipitate the onset of those symptoms and for that reason you be very destabilizing and dangerous for for certain people however that is where something metabolic psychiatry comes in and the use of mitosis and condichacdiet which appears to be very effective in some nations for the at grouping of say more chaotic conditions which is very exciting ism interested in in any tools that are off the beaten path that seem to raise interesting questions that have not been answered in a satisfying way yet in medicine and i think we are still largely in the dark ages with respect to psychiatry oh i think om the best psychiatrists would agree with you ye and the best psychiatrists a and the best scientists and the best fill n the blank are acutely aware of the limitations of our current methods and limitations of our current knowledge i think the mark of a good thinker the mark of a good scientist the mark of a good film blank anything is some one says it'd have no idea or we have no idea a lot and hopefully they also say less figural outer fix you to try somethings and i i really want o thank you for sharing am that narrative especially because it makes clear that you brought the same systematic process of using and asking excellent questions to arrive at solutions to arrive at more questions to fund areas of inquiry and to do it all in this really structured way as you said from policy all the way down to how many grahams or a eats of of some substance somebody might take i mean i think matter johnson's laboratory at hoping a romgriffis a a robin carat heresy you see a say a loan willies the mapscrew ricdovlin eater heroic at universe album alegandrios can mention the other things ye you michael pain a en on leaving some names out here and i do not want to take anything away from the a classic a as they are called a explorers of psychedelics and and writers about psychedelics but we are in the moment of a renascence now and it is important that this had a lot of a fuelswho will put a link to am your philanthropy efforts and and the journalism a fellowships as well because i think there is going to be a lot of interest there in am huge supporter of what you are doing is as and i just think it is the way great science and clinical progress is made you a ye it is a a which brings me to another parallel topic it used to be that meditation in psychedelics were have nested in the same territory this to be in the late sixties early seventies the birth of places anilin et camera it the consequence of the duel exploration of those things meditation sort of escaped from the psychedelic's umbrella and vice verse u starting some time in the you mid two thousands when narrow imaging became a littlest more accessible and you n i think nowadays if you told anybody oke you meditations good for you can help a rachetown your anxiety give more self aware n es nohow improve sleep and on and on maybe even give some inside into consciences no one's going to bulk there is a lot of studies or thousands of studies am my laboratories done a few of them their other laboratories who have done a far more o the book alter traits as the one that comes to mine that group out of wisconsin was early to early to the game on this u in any event you talked about t m ism curious from or practical standpoint do you still meditate daily do you do meditation retreats what sorts of meditative practices do you have cause i realize this can be done walking writing is conform of meditation what sorts of formal practices do you still engage in now i do ten to twenty minutes in the morning i am not currently doing the t m twice daily twenty minutes i think thyeould be better for me probably do you set o'clock and you ya at sat o'clock a which would be more of the concentration practice of say a t m were you repeating a mantra honestly it could be any in my opinion some t m parietal bulk at this but i it could be really any none t syllable could be a word although i think something without any attached meaning is prime ore beneficial for host of reasons caught could be a concentration practice with twenty minutes of sitting it might also be a guided meditation and i have no vested interest in this a but i think the waking up out by san hair's fantastic i stud i have used the introductory course which is say leading you through my catnip which is a logical progression of skilled development from day one to three and and forward i have gone through that course multiple times when i am getting back on the horse for meditation as a bit of a reboot once you develop i think a certain degree of awareness and mindfulness i do think there are other activities that probably allow you the parallel experience of doing one thing while experiencing some of the benefits meditation and for me i wonder at times are the benefits of meditation the concentration tracts itself is it just sitting still with my eyes lo closed down regulating my system a little bit actovitting my parts sympathetic in not rushing or doing anything for twenty minutes is that it maybe is it simply correcting my posture for twenty minutes how do i wait these different inputs and tithe shred answer as you probably do not need to know but i have found that spending time in silence in nature with out anything to do disallowing myself from doing things no notetaking no reading et camera and spending i have spent a number of extended fasts in nature water only by myself no talking no reading no writing what is extended sevendays generally well a your camping in nature with just water by myself and the its associated with that i go not be careful not stupid about it but a that does a lot for me with some persistent benefits there is some favorite places that you have gone into nature does not have to be to fast princes i began of aims when the national parks up in the pacific northwest beaus being transported to a different planet yosemites obviously amazing but any favorite spots am where we will not people will not go looking for you there r a you live in busting all the time on the other yes i would say a colorado ta new mexico spending time in mountains around rivers lakes i find very therapeutic in dust gorges i i i do think we suffer from a ad deficiency disorder bit of a d d when were trapped in the money and for too long with too much distraction with too many to dos with too many relationships and there is no space for author there is not the room necessary awe is not from my perspective generally a quick hit that you get in the thirty seconds between using two as there is there is more breathing room required for genuine transcendent experience of awe i try to on a yearly basis as when my top priorities block out these weeks of time in nature at last year was the first year i did that i went out to colorado am in august and just took daily higher i stayed hotel ism not as beauty as you do i water fast i was eating every day but am it was spectacular one thing i notice and it'd to know your process on how do you handle going back into life am great question no because those days were and are amazing i what detached and o maybe one ten message here or there between hikes or something than you s really clouding even that the process of watching a show it night one felt rich and enough i i was in a as esthetic as you or and i a really clean all the clutter but once you return to life it is almost get being a wash in demands and and i can see from a place of for equanimity how one could make better choices but how do you handle those transition the re entry ye before getting to the reentry i think it might makes ten for me to talk about what comes before let us say it is are during post part of the reason i do these one week or longer periods off the grab is because it forces me to put better systems an place there is the benefit that you derive from say that week and have three weeks coming up right after this interview where ism going to be off the grid to set myself up for three weeks off the grit have a team i have the podcast i have a lot of things are in motion at any given plain time if you disappear for say a two to for week period generally you cannot let the whole house catch on fire then come back and put it out effectively which means you need to put some policies and rules and on in place in advance and there is a carry over a fact that has a host of benefits and makes things smoother for the reentries say the related the more you set up the or the easier of the posts economy and then you have this beautiful expansive experience in nature whenever it might be whether your making it suffer fest i do or at a hotel at night either way these things can work and nature in enol itself as superholfuly i do think that a lot of the time we to imagine because we are to even smart accomplish people that our probe are gey complex and at the another day it is i you just need some time in nature and a cold shower and some fuck an macadamianuts and you will be fine you do not need to s all all the existential dilemmas of human kind actually ore fancy farmers you have this experience over this week and what i will do then is set at least a let us call integration tried of two to three days where i will slowly edge back in to my previous routine i will not within twelve hours of getting back to called civilization have a dayfly of caller meetings i will not o that it is too much of a shock to the system and i think it robs you of a tale end of benefits which would also be the case worth say fast er keeper bank diet or any number of interventions you can squeeze out along tall of benefits if you make a handful of changes for instance after an extended fast what if you started with a sub colonic keeterganic diet for a few days you get to extra some of the benefits as supposed to going straight back to say a diet that include the lotocarb hydrates similarly when you create more of a back you more space for awe insist reflection recovery i think you are doing yourself at this service if you jump from park into secure than i plan for that and it is a function o scheduling i also have a predictable weekly schedule i tend to you schedule podcast recordings on monkeys and fridges in preparation for an extended trip i will back a lot of similar activities that we have say bunch of upsets in the bank that are preschedualled everything is figure down in advance and overtime the more you take these breaks the better your system is become and the more liberated you are from the day to day which means when you get back you also do not need to rush as much into hyperactivity and if you do that that is more from a compulsively than from a necessity wile you are on these nature retreats are you writing on a daily basis wo just thinking and blowing thoughts to enter in cheviot system depends on the retreat sometimes in writing but writing i think can underscore for me a desire to be compulsively productive and i think that is inversely correlated to my happiness or sense of well being a lot of the time there are many areas in my life now if you were to ask meet what has changed significantly since the time you wrote for our body i would say that rather than looking for areas to optimize i am looking where i can very deliberately de optimize certain areas to increase sense of well being where can i optimize where can i stop measuring where can i stop reading books which tires can i ignore completely what types of information can i just excise for my life altogether for a period of time defeat twitter stop reading about books in acts related to say a i or whatever it might be i where can i de optimize selectively to optimize the whole does it make woodland before e start recording i gave you a book which is a short collection of poetry by holeliza safari which is called gold is collection of roomy poetry reading poetry is an activity almost by definition which is that's the antithesis of optimization have tried to also integrate more of those activities into my life and this relate to your question because there are times when i will force myself to sit on my goddam hands and not write not read just do the thing that is uncomfortable sometimes which is o bitten there with yourself no and the incredibly uncomfortable i m in part because of the fear that it could become comfortable spahi for proactive people with a strong to use paulconti's words generative drive nayegan it is a yielded which is a good thing i the believe it is a good thing and i it can be a good thing it can indicates really incredible adaptations it can also sometimes i think indicate maladaptations right ins think it is it is helpful to take a break from that generative drive or at least just put it in part position to see if that generative drive is is perhaps indicative of you leaning towards something in a healthy proactive way verses running from something in a long term destructive way one i think pal would say that part of the generative drive process is a peace not as it nearly even as a still state but as a am being able to experience piece even in the transitions and here is a lot more to say about that and he would say it far better than i have woods all a leave it at that yam i me for people who have the option getting in nature it does not have to be all to every day on water fast i just take certain things to an extreme because that is i am but sorry when you say water fast that means fasting with water right i just i thing but yes drinking water it just means your lad to have water and nothing else for for a long time i thought it meant that you are not drinking water oh piano do not do that some people do that right they do these crazy food water fast a mas a wait i think they believe it clears sense cells or something but am write clears a lot more than your sentiment oh ye there might be something to it i may l therefore people who recycle by drink their on your and not my gam a but i would say three hours without shelter r three days without water three weeks that food general rulethum sell be careful with dehydration you go a long time without food you i do not care how i i you a you get eight present body that men you got plenty of time you can go a couple weeks no probable i got calories tonic not calories propouncetor body fat you get plenty go are i sit for people w have the option to be in nature and just exercise several hours a day to exhaustion see how many your probes seem to disco away just my that to my sundae routine a is to try and get outside and move as much as possible i do not always succeed but a ism going to try a longer retreat into nature think a elympic national forests is calling me again it seems once a year i just want to get back up there its asci and i such should get back out there spectacular i have a question about mentors am a big believer in mentors either a mentors that no us and we know them or o people that we assign is mentors without them realizing it a this sort of thing a do you have mentors at the stage of life a for particular areas of life or you i you mentoring yourself are you flying with a a few voices in your head a that serve you well who are your mentors i definitely have people i consider mentors it i think of this point rarely one way in the sense that they tend to be friends i spend time with they get something from it i get something from it not a transactional way but they find it fun or beneficial or amusing in some way redeeming to spent time with me that the but how is that different from the traditional friendship age her sinner friendship are you you for are you spending time winsome orientation toward there r embodying there is of life that youould to ambulate totally and i spend i spend time around people i hope to be more in some way because guess what you are going to average into say thrust the the sum wholistic whole of the five or six people you spend the most time with who should choose that very careful it t includes virtual parts social relationships jankoi if you are listening to film the blank person for four hours week five hours week two hours week whoever that group is comprised of is going to influence who you become and for me then i think carefully about my friendships and they could be older a cavankelly has become a good friend who has a wealth of life experience that i do not have and i might just call him sac govern have question for y but i do that with my younger friends too and they could be younger than i am i might still view them as a mentor and ex quires the i think meant or has a heavy weight to it it has a connotation of maybe never ending ism consuming obligation i i would never for instance an i know allow people try this ask some one to be my mentor it is would you to be my free lifecoach for ever in is i that is kind how it sounds to the recipient no it it sounds very formal yes at very formal let's for me i would say there have certainly been entrust have had resting coaches have had teachers have had resident advisers for reverence who had a huge impacted in my life and followed up with me and paid attention to me and cared for me in more of a one directional sense and i i view myself as the beneficiary of course they they certainly got something out of it if they had that job in a price found it to be very gratifying in its own way and teachers professor ad shaw at princedom i feel in incredibly indebted to these days and for a long time have believed that you can learn something powerful from almost any one probably any one you interact with could be an ember driver could be some one taking garbage out of a restaurant if you really take the time to dig you can find something and before you can i think is not adult effectively think about who you would to learn from if i put it that way it is helpful to have a base line of self awareness that what you might want to work on to either amplify strengths develop skills address weakness is and for instance one my close friends mat mollinweg is younger than i am he is the he is the founder of automatic which runs word press a calm he is the we developer of word press all thou's an open source project of course with many many contributors he was one of the lead developers now powers something thirty two per cent in the inter net and he exemplifies a cool and calm temperament even in the most chaotic periods imaginable during the most chaotic events imaginable and when i find myself getting deregulated this a fancy term losing my she or getting carried away by emotion get and righteously angrier whatever it might be and i recognize at some point that it is really not serving me that i am being owned by the emotion panic ism the dog on the leash not the other way round then i thing about li what would mat to what advice would mat give me right now how would madam in these circumstances and i do that with with with many friends i also think a lot about and this is borrowing from some one in catchy sierra a long time ago focussing more unjust in time information as upmost adjusting case information just in case information i come we to read these twenty books cause in two years i might be interested in quinsy that i think is often to waste of time because if it ever becomes relevant outgoing to to reread those books people do the same thing with humans they are i want to meet some one and have them as my mentor are because may be five years from now it'll do equines and then they will be useful for a v c that is too speculative and i think it ends up in a lot of wasted energies the podcast for me writing the books undoing the interviews even prior to the podcast becoming involved with start ups delving into the world of science and scientists all helps me to develop a confidence that almost any question i could ask i can find some semblance of an answer for by just reaching out to a few people and saying who do who might build answer thus and that is very reassuring and it it relieves some of the anxiety or pressure that people might feel to assemble some personal board of directors of li ex men and women who c help them there a and and then there are people li hire to be accountable to and i might work with coaches therapists and on who i would view as mentors they just happen to get getting paid for it yet the reason i ask the question is because we talk about them meditative process going into nature and you've a psychedelics as it can be viewed a lot of different ways but think of them largely as going inward to explore him in you are out in nature and learning from nature here is such a court truth to not er an now that sounds a little bit a wish washy but it is a it is true if it is there it is concrete it is really something i was there long before any of us and l we there a lot longer than any of us i we will ever be we hope i i certainly if it go s we go e a but the process of learning from others and paying attention others as is really an outward looking thing yon may we have to bring that in but i was just curious how you balance those and as a way to really understand not just your time allocation i to think i we could talk about that an what is has your morning structured et camera i which i think there is great value and and in knowing but more i what what is your mind allocation and i think about this wears my brain is it in my folk as somewhat is going on in here and yes that is there need to excavate the sure you know bout how much time in my out of my head and bringing things in from the outside world hand back and forth you have some sense of i across the year across the day how you mind allocate on of i that is the best phrase but i cannot think of any better one if you can this of a better one please please a ill table it cause i happy to done how do i think about mind allocation or attensionallication i try to and most frequently think of my mine share across a year and across week a weekly time for him and i find that to be manageable in the sense that on a yearly basis on dear's eve or roughly around new years every year it'll do a past year review p we are past year review were it'll go back and it'll look at my tire last year a piece p paper in front of me line down the center plus negative and i will go through every week in my calendar for the previous year and it'll write down the people places activities commitments et camera that produced pile positive emotional experiences tonight we are doing eighty twenty an ace this year ghat to the big rocks that really moved the needle in a meaningful way and conversely who are the people what are the things what are the places that just made me go ah and we are draining produced pique negative experiences why they held this i commit to this type experiences and that presents me with a do more of do less of list then i look forward to the next year and i did this i suppose just a handful of months ago around new years with the positive of my o k here is my list of do more of it is not real until it is in the calendar let us get these things in the counter and then will start talking people booking things having people help with organizing if that is required and getting things blocked out i have already this year and were in the reasonable beginning stages of the year i have things blocked out until nonmember of this year and those provide the breaks in the action not just the breaks in the action but the fun stuff because by the wayguies i thought for a long time a take care of ai an see and the good stuff just takes care of itself give i do not any longer believe that to be true unless you schedule these things that you claim a important their gun to get crowded out by bullshit and maybe not bullshit but just less important things their urgent will crush the important i get these things on the calendar and then i back up and i look at optimal weekly mind application it a t national allocation and there is a there is there is an incredible cost to cognitive switching if you are just tasksquitching all day i will try my best to form at a weekly rhythm a weekly sequence that allows me to focus on certain types of tasks money is very frequently admen of some type just bits and ends lots me jetsam all the miscellaneous pieces that our part of life you got a deal of them that tends to be money whenever possible and especially if i am focused on physical activity lets to say on in a place colorado i will try to sexual most of that for after lunch to insure that i get in a lot of exercise and movement in the first portion of the day not everybody has that ability but i will say more of you have that capacity then you might think because most of what we all do is just not important ostium on social media first thing in the morning is probably the most poisonous activity that i could take part in i i do not one of you not point fingers at any one else but it oh yet i think if people ask what is the amount time it takes to get in a really good work out it is going to be about an hour but a li can be done in forty five for even thirty minutes we think about how quickly that time goes by eats an at an me that ism sure ism not the only one a that this brotleryson i released allot is ask for my fun ass i od be it'd go into the bath room to take a quick bit of business and then forty five minutes later ism how have i bee looking at insight forty five minutes yet lines and for rest rooms have gone very long in the last attendant ten years has any one notice that the wait for the rest rooms as you celadon o you have time for the imborentstuff i can an just look at some of the extreme overseers out there they have the same mount time than you these companies very smart they very good day to scientists they're very good you i specialists if any one out there thanks that they can luck maybe maybe jocko and can discipline his pat throughout ism sure he can gypsies he is jack but in my case an the case of most people your bringing a knife to a gun fight if you think you can use your self control to keep your use of instagrahm to say ten minutes at a club good luck and even if you can people say ah but i do that anyway how much time do you spend sending means and line from instagraham or fill on the blank platform to your friends an group chat howsetime is that consume i spend a fair amount of time on iseramin twitter posting things relate to the pod cast but am i do not have to one to do that for me and i actually enjoy doing it and it challenges me in certain ways but i completely agree with everything you are saying twitter has its usecases i find it useful in some respects it has become much less useful and much less practical in the last year with a lot of the product changes but it has its place it is not on my one it was on my ones for very brief period of time i do not want i find that my ability to be still in calm is eroded if i am too easily able to escape boredom if you cease to have the ability to be bored for five to ten minutes i think that makes you very fragile it makes you very easy to manipulate also and there are a lot of forces at play on line that want to manipulate or shape your behavior in different ways i feel it is imperative for me to cultivate the ability just sit still and not consume the five minutes in line waiting to get into a restaurant by hopping on twitter instruhim that is part why reason the not on my those could you tell us about cock punch i can tell you my cock munch o bunch is a creative project intended once again to make me less precious about protecting whatever brand i think i might have and this is an investment my long term mental health also and i think in my career flexibility my willingness to experiment punch could be a long story but the just of it is i wanted to experiment with fiction writing have been saneness for years and have never done it that is the backdrop on top of that i wanted to get back into illustration and work in the visual arts which i did for a long time when i was younger and i not done that consistent why not because i have not had a countability haven't t dead lines it has not been in the calender this should sound somewhat familiar by now and at the same time i was becoming very interested in webthree and what was happening in the world vanefteasus is probably twenty twenty and i know that they have developed a fairly negative connotation for lot of good reasons but i started to think about fundraising for early stage science and if i could do if i could conduct an experiment as a proof of concept with different novel approaches to fundraiser rather than just calling the rich friends who might would have been to the pressure or be willing to fund i wanted to look at a crowd funding back in the day then i wanted to look at different options for perhaps art auctions and i was going to do this with with contemporary art this is many years ago but an in the process of wanting to fund the the hoping center focused on psychedelic and consciousness research which which the was the first of its kind in reunited states and a the t enology gave me the opportunity to learn about a new lusts call it said of technologies to develop skills and knowledge it would give me the opportunity to reconnect and deepen friendships with a number of my very very smart friends for playing in that area also test fundraising also get back into fiction and art and all that combined in this thing that isn't a calling cock punch because it made me laugh and at if you take your work too seriously you are gong to burn out before you get the really serious work done and i think it was errand rustle is said it is a sure sign of an impending nervous break done if you start taking your work too seriously are believing your work to be very very serious and a for that reason i wanted to give it an absurd name they would also have some word of mouth benefit and that to see what would happen honestly to see what happened some light airlock what is honestly the worst thing that happens people write about you pieces or other shaking their fist at the sky how dare to farms cocrotry a her projicbut you can turn it around on them as you say that what they were doing is a cock punch not waliothat that tempting nodal a will that was kind of the thing i those kind of part of the thinking that it would just be entertaining to watch people seriously trying to critique something called cockbunch and that a the upshot of that is it raised almost two million dollars sold out in something the thirty minutes or forty minutes for the foundation all that money which sic sand foundation all that money has already been distributed in form of grands and that along the way i got to work with artists with programmers learn new technologies reconnect with old friends and power back in touch an its it is extremely fond to be back in touch of these folks and have written the equivalent of a shore book in fiction in the form of short stories that are this fantasy world building exercise for me and om having a blast i am exercising new creative muscles that is led me back into the worlds of comic books which have not created yet led me back into the world's of gaming led me back into my fascination of table top gamin's i played d and for ever when i was a kid that was my refuge as a runt who got the crap kicked out of an left and right and i am having just a blast and the the take way i think on some level is that you should do things should as should as it is of is a loaded term it is helpful for me to consider doing things that give me energy right because if we say are time management is fine but time does not really have any practical value unless you have attention rats than there's attentional management but that attention is limited also physically and sort of metaphorically by energy ranks lea substrates diets nearer transmitters and on if you do not have the the basic battery is required the rest of the things that are higher up on that pyramid cannot really be executed properly for me it is i to et lets cockpunch does not do anything it is total failure right coming back to them when already raise two million of never science i did that science could be break through science that it could though but hock punch a yelled it sir cock punch is at least thus far a success it is but coming back to sethgoden's question i asked myself would i do this even if it turns out to be a complete failure financial an as i get because i think the relationships and skills even if this quotoncol fails from the outside looking in those will transcend this project and be life affirm in and helpful and fun in other areas and that is proving to be true even though the project is on going and i have more energy now because of this ridiculous project and very proud of the fiction actually this ridiculous project called cockpunch people can find the legend of cockpunch on a any fine provider of podcast and hired voice actors i the scripting the production i hit number one fiction world wide on apple podcast for a while the whole things hilarious and and if you could can you explain a obit about the characters and cock punch i c who whose punching whose cock debut which cocks are punched ye which coach or punch which hat is this wore here we go i answered the alleged a cock punch takes place in this calm called varlets and errata is being described through the narrator who we know as the seventh scribe we do not know much about t e seventh scribe but e seven scribe makes an appearance an episode one as the reliable but possibly sometimes unreliable narrator of this space and there is a there is a mind mending time component wherethere something called restarts something the edge of to morrow people have ever seen this move where time restarts may lake ground conman time restarts and ans unclear as of yet in the story why that is the case but people basely snap into being they know who they are and what they do but they have know real memories to speak of the world is constantly being reconstructed and piece together by these scribes the seventh of which is the narrator you can you you might read into this that i am a fanifantasy token you name at era ersulacalaguin a the wizard of areas at or then there are eight primary houses these are the greater houses some might call them clans and they have different characteristics just prior to the seventh scribe beginning his piecing together which turns into this story in the podcast there is a warring states period this much he is been able to establish and the piece keeping mechanism that was devised is something called the great games and the great games is a combat competition and the eight greater houses send their best fighters who been vetted through preliminary competitions to the great games which is in the free tradezone which is this one place where all of the races mingle and trade and on and all these characters happen to the answer promorifized roosters they have i generally each one gauntlet of some type and clearly they punch each other with the scotlent they're many other types of weapons the colloquial nickname for this a lyrics of combat is cockpunch and that is the that is the etymology a the scholars say of cockpunch the legend of cockpunch and there is a lot more to it and there are many wrinkles a lot of master eggs in this entire story the idea came to me and it is started off is a bit of o farsridt it was justcino by something funny see if it works maybe it raises some money very light lift but once i got into the fiction i started doing it superseriously sos become very very elaborate it is become really really elaborate and ism loving it it is great who knows were it will go i have no idea that is part of the reason why i called it an emergent long fiction project i did not call it an then if project also it is not emergent long fiction project where ism taking inputs from the audience ism ism watching very closely what people understand or do not understand or fined interesting ism looking at for instance what is generated when i host an an a i assisted art competition which i did with the fans and a lot o these bits and pieces get integrated in some fashion into this thing that chapter by chap tor is coalescing that is scocklanch amazing and i do buy cock matchlock tam and the at cock conceit we you debut it from some barye oh ye oh old prana i do not wat ask what it was being used for prior to your purchase it was not being used for a fancy world building help it o though got amazing and for many reasons i have much to say that first of all at your excitement about it is tangible the energy you have around it is infectious am and well i soft want to go into the total ism depth and contour of what palconti i has been telling me over the last weak of preparing this mental he's series about what is really great in life that we all should cultivate it has a lot to do with this generative drive has a lot to do with positive energy not just plosive thinking but plosive energy but the am this tread of peace contentment and delight and as you were explaining it it is clear that it brings you great peace contentment and delight as action terms not sit there and just hover in the basking in it is just clear that i was a great idea a and i love that you started it as a way to canovum knowdit n knock the fearful a yourself a little bit by knocking a little fear into the whole thing yeikelie will not would happen if you let your mind go and and allowed yourself to explore this and and what permission would it buy you if it is not a told disaster this is true for the forever body to my what if this harshly works it is not even a home right but let us say i get on base what permission does this then buy me what other impossibles on quotation marks n i willing to challenge and i was able to make the hop from one category in the bookstore to an completely different category and then the skies loment was i con can do anything i can do it ever i want have given myself permission and the market is give me permission but the most important first step is you giving yourself permission and with say cock punches luceusof it is now that have done that my career has an ended has not had any negative impact on my career whatsoever o k that is actually kind of surprising the contrary it seems it gives you energy raised money for science is it still raising money a if there is not it is jot still an opportunity for people to no it is if sill ya it is sold out a if people want to contribute to say the early stage science and less say specifically psychedelics i would say it is very very hard to get a very solid understanding of the field and the shifting sands and the projects and on it it is very rapidly changing i would say just provide money to a foundation that is already doing good work it could be riverstic's foundation it could be belly foundation my foundation say foundation i think does pretty good work and s i say is not just the mourn a the journalism fellowships there also this all that its running for psychedelics ayes ether's tons of stop there is a project page on essay foundation dot work you can see the projects there probably fifteen to twenty of them and they can see the basic science all the way from really basic science looking at possible mechanisms of action for something d i p t which is a very strange compound that i pye out most be paragon to know it that that produces profound auditory distortions and hallucinations in humans very hard to animal model and from that all the way up to really sophisticated imaging studies from that to say at least a year or two ago supporting phase three trials for end assist psychotherapy then the journalism then this them and that but a lot of a lot of difference a scientific studies theatre there being sorted that is that is very exciting to me and but the the cock much side of things it is all done money's been distributed and maybe it'll do more of this kind of thing but i i might take a different approach i feel oke i learned what i feel i wanted to learn from that and may be it'll trass up new next i one thing's clear nobody tells you what to do except you and but that is wedded through many important filters structure filters and very thoughtful filters are the words that come to mine when i think about your process less your turning a have no more thing which is one of the sources of joy of cock punch is that it is not over planned i set some initial conditions and now it is e emergent and is some one who has hyper analyzed and meticulously planned most of my life for decades i think it is helpful to have an improve component if you are a hyper planner four a hyper measurer if you that degree of control maybe you try something it is a less controlled take an improve class try fiction writing do something that is not totally scripted where you do not know the outcome i think it is really good medicine for people just if you spend all your time an yoga class maybe you should spend one day a week lifting wives see what that is and if you spend all your time and the him and you can barely touch your those maybe she disomewoare down or dog try some yoga similar i thank the spectrum of hyper planned to completely free flowing an improve provides ample opportunity to enriched themselves and maybe addressed some weaknesses at the same time for me cop punch has been incredibly are the first time fit eland's ever uttered that sentence but y probably but that is part of what makes it sircool yet totally i love it ism wondering if you would be willing to share with us a little bit about your mind set i say heaven your motivation but ism certainly your mind set around sharing some of the hard personal tribulations that you have shared i preparation for this discussion to day i went back to some of those posts that you did and the i podcast that you did around this and now it'd listen to them at the time and i they deal with quite serious violations of childhood and of self and i they are hard i mean that they are they are hard to listen to and i can only imagine they must be even far far harder to to experience and as curious what led to you r willingness to do that and i ye i mean i have my own ideas about what might have motive ate it but id to hear it from you sure happen you talk about it and i think they are two particular examples that come to mind one is my near suicide in college and if people search some practical thoughts on suicide and my name it will pop right up if you just search my name in suicide will probably pop right up pretty well indexed at this point which is very deliberate people can look at the you are all structure for a little wink and a hat tip i tell tell you something about optimizing for gouge if you look at it it'll just tell you the your all misspells out how to commit suicide but clearly ism not teaching people how to commit suicide but i want it that to be a honeypot for some of that traffic a because it is a lot easier now to find that type of practical implementation advice ait is a bit of harder to find i think compelling intervention first of all he feelings was i had obviously call suicide holing please it that is sometimes the last thing that people want to hear when they are in a place of suicide a audition and the reason i ended up writing a long post about this which was terrifying to write because i had never told my parents i had never told my closest friends this was a secret it is a day dark secret and i wrote about it because i went to an event in san francisco i was interviewed on stage by mason calcanei who was a friend and a very good interviewer at an event and after i got off stage munch people approached me and a sang high and take photos and signing things and on and there was one young man there very well dressed which is not really relevant a just it was striking cause sin san francisco sometimes people ire very underdressed and he was he dressed up for it legs he would taken seriously and he was in a sudentie he asked me if i could sign a book for his brother and i said sure no problem and i asked him what would you me to write to your brother and he but o blanked he did not kind o blanket totally blank but the look behind his eyes was unusual it was not just i do not know what to say blank there was something else behind it and i could tell that he fell under pressure and i said no problem take your time i tell you it it'll just shot with a couple of other people and it'll sign the book no prom i not go anywhere and the chattered it the other folks and then he asked if he could just walk me to the elevator and then i could sign a bocnatect sure and he explained to me as i walked to the elevator how his brother had been a huge pan mine and that it'd really kept his brother afloat for a long time and eventually his brother killed himself and that they would kept his room exactly how it was and he wanted me to sign the book that he could put the book in his brother's room and he asked me if it'd ever considered talking about mental health and mental health challenges publicly because he thought it would really help a lot of people and that just i been like feeling myself tear up right now in it it it was crushing to hear the story and totally unbenonce to him i had lot of history with depressive episodes and when i say near suicide i had it on the calender i had a plan i want to kill myself i knew exactly how was going to do it i knew where i was going to do t i knew all of the variables that i needed to account for it to get it done and the only reason that did not happen for people do not have the contacts which most people want is i had tried to reserve a book at firestone library this is at princedom which had something to do with suicide it was assisted suicide the the clinician's guide to youthanacia something that and it wasn't in and i had forgotten to change my address of the registers office i was taking a year away from school and i was to focus on finishing my thesis is to try a few jobs but it'd ended up in a very bad place and was feeling very isolated and my friends were graduating year ahead of me and i was stock on this thesis and there is a lot of back story that i will not bore people with but it got to the point where i decided not that objective me objectively my life is bad i thing this is where people who have not experienced depression get a little confused or that it is hard for them to identify when they give advice to a depress person because you might say to a depress person but look your life is great there is this there is that there is this and for a lot of doe presspitale say yet i know i look at that and i cannot fix my state because i am broken and if this is pagan have to live for ever with being this broke in and dysfunctional and to have this internal hell that i live day by day i just want to escape it is some one jumping out of he burning buildings they soft wat to kill themselves but they are jumping out of a burning building and i had it on the calendar and thank god this is back when they would still send you a physical reminder in the mail a little postcard that says your book is in and that card went to my parents house and my mam saw it and panicked and called me and i lied i said it was for a friend i went to ruggers who was doing a project on ai an see but it is it was just enough to cone a snap me out of the trance and realize that you killing yourself is putting on a suicide vest with explosives and walking to a room of all the people you care the most about and end plowing yourself up that snap me out of it but no one of this guy certainly did not know that and that is when i went home and thought about it and just decided of there is a chance if i write this it is not certain but there is a chance this might help some one it might prevent some one from doing what i was almost about to do and i spent months getting this post written and put it out and i and i know for a fact it is saved minimum dozens of wise and therefore other thinks including a very extensive list of resources and a that gave me i suppose a not a tone in the water but jumping feet first into the deep end an experience of being that vulnerable and this was a long time ago in thesis i onto say at least eight ten years ago when i put that post own and a then a i want to say it was just before bovid lock down i was in costterica visiting a friend as with my girl friend the time and she knew a secret of mine and she was one of maybe two or three people who knew that it'd been actually bused when i was a kit by baby sat her son from two to four roughly and routinely all the time kind of thing and yet i what your invasion in is is is is is what happened it was knotted and that had been compartmentalized locked away for my whole life as likelat's in the past were folks one moving forward and a nothing to be fixed nothing to fix and that was my my perspective on things a it turned out was not quite that simple and i had done a lot of work a lot of therapy usicudelic sit therapies as well a which once again ore not all upside potential there are some significant risks but it'd come a long way and my plan had always been to wait until my parents passed ecus i did not want them to blame themselves for this and then to write a book and there's something though at the time when was having dinner with my girl friend there was dissatisfying about that plan it there is something about the bothered me and i could not quite put a finger on it and i was talking her about it and she said that is can to take a long time as i have ever thought about how many people or going to pass away or die or suffer between now and when you publish that book and i thought about it and it was at that dinner that i decided to at least record of podcast covering this train i was not at all convinced that i wanted to publish it if i i was terrified of publishing it also because it meant opening myself up to a lot of conversations or may be just hurtful commentary on mine who knows milk people are there lot idiots out the and a lot of otherwise fine people who were idiots on the internet sos very teston ultimately decided i i did not want to do it as a one man shell i did not want to make it a monologue i asked my friend ready milkman who had been on my potato shes in amazing graphic designer and teacher but she had unexpectedly on my podcast based on some of my questions for the first time publicly told her story about being sexually abused and i had leaned on her in years after that in private and i asked er if she would be willing to have a conversation with me about hour respective journeys and what it felt what it looked what helped did not help what worked did not to provide at the very least a glimmer of hope for people who we keeping some of these dark secrets or contending with them not knowing what to do with them and we had that conversation and i sat on it i sat on it i sat on it and then i put it out and decided in advance that i would not look at any social media for at least several weeks afterwards if my team saw anything on social meter got meals i did not want to see anything other than positive feed back which is not my defective ism usually eager to solicit constructive feed back but in this case i knew that my own position was to vulnerable i i did not want to open up the possibility of of destabilizing myself and i put it out and i think it is the most important podcastober put of i kind i thought my job was done from a posting perspective after that and it is been incredibly gratifying i think it is certainly helped a fair number of people and it was also really hard because what i did not anticipate was i would say of my really superrich perform and close man friends may be have reached out to me to tell someone for the first time about their extremely awful graphic first handexperience of being specially bused the percentages were mine blowing like the actual percentages were supersupersuperhigh which is part of the reason i mentioned earlier i think it is good to spend a little at a time in those empty spaces to see am i in a positive energetic sense pursuing something good or am i running away from demons whipping my back and for a lot of those guise ism sure it is true for a lot of women to they they fined medication through intense focus and achievement which is superitaptive in a lot of ways but it does not always have lifetime reliability and that is the story i it is impossible to hear the those stories your story without i feeling some substantial emotion ism not trying intellectualize it is mum both both of those a aspects of your history that you shared are are huge they really are there i be see huge for you and and there huge interns of the positive impact in the world i i know this because i i have read the comments right and i and have talk to people who have listen to those podcast and read those blogs and i and have similar or may be different stories of drama but i think as with your work in the psychedelic spays as with your work and i the physical augmentation's face whatever you want to call it i it is apparent that you are willing to be first man in on a lot of things and really yet you are sitting alone there in those moments and a these categories of revealing tramcar in my mind anyway much more substantial in terms of their impact positive impact and the other aspects for our body in psychedelic work et camera is also tremendously impactful that saying a lot i say thank you for forgoer a bravery and i expander yet it is i it is crazy cause i think that a lot of people mum can imagine telling a story or to a close friend your something but yon to put it out into the world yet it's it is huge take he do not know how that seen a ripple i and youvebeen a real pioneer and example for a for me for for lacks for other people in revealing things not that i but different a peter t is recently been opening up about some serious challenges that he is had in is and is book he does that on podcassi's bending it yet another category ism arguably the most important category for ism exploration and chasing and in a thoughtful bravery cause you did not just put it out there in any form i one thing i do know by experiences there is nothing weirder than being i told thank you for the painful thing that you did i do not want to push that too far but it'd be remiss if i did not because it it really has its impacting and for doing it again here to day because i ye that huge thanks for doing that y mi my pleasure and it'll also say and i got advice from a very very experienced a psygadelic facility one point who said take the pain to make at part of your medicine and the way i think that applies you is we all experience pain we all experienced suffering many of us have experienced drama of one type or another and that can consume you i man it can consume you but it is fire but it can consume you be you can also harness it and use it for different things and i know for i think it is ism not in a hedge it'll say i know for a fact that there are people have spoken too horse suicide all and by the way ism not inviting every one who is listening if you are suicide to reach out ten it will not work have had to disengage from that because it gets too heavy just to engage one on one of people of r suicide but there are resources in that post i mention the practical thoughts on suicide but let yous talk about closer friends people you never suspect in a million years who are this close to blowing the brains out people folk should recognize in some cases the fact that i was also there once is why they listen i have unfortunately ism a subject matter expert and have credibility and that actually very redeeming it provides me meaning to the suffering that i experienced bouquet here i am for whatever host of reasons i am put in this place in time with this person and they do not trust the i put of these other people they are talking to because those people do not know what it is but i can look at this person the eye be oh i know and that is just a different thing you can you can find a way to transmute that pain in to something meaning for into a gift that hopefully you can share in some way not as sharply with the whole wide world just one person that is a big deal one person's a big deal there is a lot out there that is intended for mask consumption that gets in front of millions of people does not really impact a single person very much even if you do not have podcast you do not of books if you eve the ability to sit down one person and really make an impact that is actually more meaningful than most of the crap that gets put out there take heart man to that i to spend a limit of time talking about the rolls you see yourself and i had the list coming in here of get you have done the exploration of the health severe you self experimentation you here ah you have been an vector you are an investor your podcast you you i think these are more than titles i think titles are great but titles are what we get from other people telling us what we do or deciding what we do ah ism more interested in how you think about yourself you your own role identity and i have to room you have spent a l a bit of t am on this if one were to go through the that the check list of possible rolls i i yet i confess i do this i think li coke i i think i call i think i check the box of animal because were were animals after all or humans do not hold it n nothing out answer absolutely not are you still tango dancing ism planner getting back into great that does axis bag i have argentine lineage and ism embarrass to say i do not tank a no tango but u let them you get the mate in the in the green room can we sat mi my a grandparents a tango into their dies i think land he gs a eight stay can smoke cigarettes and a lived until they are night i is by time him had to chant exactly a but am curious about the rolls that you see yourself in am t roll identity to me is important ism in terms of where we see ourselves now and where we see ourselves going forward and who knows may you do not have any roll identity plan but n what are some boxes that you see yourself in now that you really strongly identify with and then what are some boxes that am you would to check off going forward grant boxes i would say the to that i probably identify with most be three but ill focus on to experimentalist which can take a lot of forms ti can i can apply to a whole lot of different spheres experimentalist and then teacher and for the longest time a long long time i thought eventually i would go back and actually be a night rate teacher because i feel that is such a critical window for many kids where they can either hid an inflection point and going a really good direction or they can go in a really bad direction and i certainly saw that on lying long island with lot of my friends lot o overdoses bunch of friends have died of point diction on various things and i had some intervention with mentors early on that that it of flip the switch o the railroad track and sent me in a different direction i thought for a long time i would go back and be a ninth great teacher and my impulse to experiment leads to enthusiasm for teaching if that makes any sense because i feel as good as i might be or decent at taking a complex subject deconstructing it applying eighty twenty putting things in order and learning things very quickly which includes stress testing assumptions in that i would of assumed progression for skill language warning are many meths in languasheleriyng as an example if it takes me say six months to become reasonably competent in field as i can usually get other people to that same point of competent in a third of that time for me it is very gratifying to teach and i view all the books as teaching tools ism no to stop i recognize om not the world's greatest writer i take the writing seriously i do not half ascot i do many many many revisions even for cock munch twenty seven revisions for assort stay i take it seriously but i recognize that ism not the world's greatest words smith but i am looking for outcomes in readers or listeners and i view my job as out of teacher it'd say experimentalist in teacher of the two and those both go a long way and plus to say dog training in lots of sandlots of experiments and for there is listening to him just looked under the table one thing i should have said the beginning and i did not is at am this is the first you were an loud podcast to feature a guest who brought their dog we have i molly is here as well and we are absolutely delighted now there has not been a dog at on the superman laud podcast since a costello passed away and a am in a practically floating in in delight that molly's here to day isn't she is amazing and love done amazing job training her to i curia houses laying ran ex to my feet licking my hand as i speak one and it'd say if i were to expand that by one i probably say explorer but the exploring goes hand at hand with the experimentation a i could be geographic exploration it could be spending time with people who are excellent at anything in any field and seeing where that gingerbread trail leads me and i think the the exploration and the experimentation are for me bedfellows they go together what about roles that you would to explorer potentially see yourself in i men i do not have a magic wand but if i did as a fellow podcast and i consider your friend a i would a o can conflicted wand you to the a succession given role that would not be the way t would work and that wouldn't be as gratifying as having to have figure it all out to that heart of your your machinery ah as you just told us yet what i some role life roles that you are interested in expanding and for stepping into that you have not expanse a more more artist more artistry especially in the visual sense because i want to be a comic pencilled for really long time got paid as an illustrator towards the end of high school and during college to illustrated books and magazines and on then i just drop i dropped it when i graduated because i was kissoff in was time to get serious and be in adult i just cold turkey to stop all of it the skills of atrophy a lot but there is still there is still a bit in there have seen some post on insygram that were ye quite good some still messing around still messing around and especially when i have some structure i do well i it'd to pursue that i would to experiment with animation i do not know if animator would be the right label because i most likely would not be doing the animation myself but playing a role in visual art would be one a father would be another one eventually and i try not to be attached to it but we all play games a various types and if we get really good at certain games that are socially rewarded than you make money doing a podcast or investing or whatever might be but when may when when when the t a ramp of my learning starts to flatten out a bit i tend to get board of those games and i think that certainly one of the biggest adventures must be parent hood it some point i think father would be on there and i should say this is very judgmental me to say but i ire's a big difference between wanting to wanting to be a parent and wanting to have kids ism am very cautious a about saying i want to have kids because hit does not automatically imply you want to be a good parent which is also what that was very important for me to spend a lot of time training molly and to o learning there ye sees they are am i going to do the heavy letting in the hard work recognizing that kids are not deferred dogs but i do think they are action a lot of similarities i in terms of just predictive ability if you see someone who has dogs that are terribly trains look other feds my right see some similar my my good friend have my good friend it'll owed him here who a emdypeisheis their cherabop theology a stamphord eff golfer i once asked him if he hasn't my pats i he said that he and his wife had three children has preparation for having o do here is here is a quote also from a book called do not shoot the dog which is terrible title but excellent book written by can prior who was a and a aquatic name trainer she is training dolphins and wales and on which do not respond to negative reinforcement you cannot really hit them with he roll up newspaper if they do not do what you want and there is a quote in that book which is something along the its of i cant were the attributions another trainer and it was people should not be allowed to have children until they have successfully trained chicken because also chickens they they just do not have the brain power to respond to much negative reinforcement you have to coax them to do what you want them to do with positive reinforcement and i mean operation classical condition at connissam say across the board i whether you are the c i i try to train cock roaches to flip lights which is not making but one up by the way or training well or training a cat or training a human a training sounds bad cultivating a wonderful human then i think there is lot to be learned across the board have successfully prove into myself that i can keep the dog alive and happy and train up another happy nervous system ye ya curate another nervous system this a big deal oh ye was she's also my external nervous system weeks soot of work and tandem i pay a lot of attention to how she relates to different people as our earlier today i i ha some one who is the owner of a bulldog mast if who new one n command which was wait which is a which is the the by default the easiest thing to train a be dog because it when when you by the way folks if you stop a bull dog on the street to scratch the when they look delighted they might you but chances are they are just really relieved that they get to stop is and on costello he had a forebrain and he was smarted about what he need to be smart about but molly is exceptional we she knows where she needs to be and she superconnected to you and she knows a ton of commands it was ridiculous our staff has delighting in the number of things that him could get her to do just by looking at her the e yes she is e she is also quite calm out of the box a which helps although it makes it harder in some respects to train because she is not much food rife if you those man news to she li on bones ye as she loves the martinets a venison sticks but she a gall get it'll give it'll say two things first is if your dog is spas about food that is actually great news it will make your dog very easy to train in some respects re do not shoot the dog it is it is excellent there are some others i could recommend i had a woman named sun sudan garret on my podcast ex i want an objective measure of successful dog training and competitors have objective measures she was in a a dog agility champion for many years which has a lot of metrics any i had her onspeeblerish but the the the tip that i got from one dog trainer early on because i was trying to train molly and i was using to some of her kibble it'd put some kibble in a bag and carried around and she was what are you doing a what you me what i know she is s that kibble yes kibble and she's she is i capped a your at a crowded bar you get a tip of twenties i get your dogs was you did you lay to the dog bargain squirrels other dogs grass hiss on the pavement whatever it happens to be yo have to have good treats of your do isn't responding chances are may be strong a tip singles i love it i love it all thank you for sharing the rolls you see yourself in in the ones that you would to step in to more i i certainly feel i have the jurisdiction to say that you are an exceptional experimentalist and a phenomenal teacher we have seen this cross many you are welcome an and ism not just speaking for myself ism give speaking for many other people as well me have seen this across many domains like blogging podcasting bookwriting stage lecturing being a guest on a podcast and on and on and am in terms of the rolls that you want to expand into more i cannot wait to see the illustrations that that emerge yet please do i grow that flame because i of excited for what comes out a cock punch being am just the first of them leaving the care eh a and i i can say because i know i because i have one and because i am give observed many a kids and friends i who are fathers you are going to be an exceptional father i very absolutely confident of that i him now i appreciate the now and i will not say thanks for taking the time to talk with me to day have been looking for to this much my tea knows this way were sort of buzzing yet we have had some heavy hitters on this podcast a we only look to the top one for sent in field and there incredibly credentials by whatever standards we happen to be exploring and they have to be feel people that i really want to talk to am i have much respect for what you do and the way you do it you have certainly inspired me this podcast would not exist i do not think the joker of podcasting would exist and look the way that it does had you not made the decision to start podcasting and i in anticipation of this up sot i did put out a ping on twitter for questions and there were many many of them i them he will do a and ay some time maybe not who knows but one of the questions that really stood out to me was you how does him feel about all these other people coming into all the spaces that he is work than doing i successful work that builds off much of what he is done and a it'll let you answer but for me i can say that i have been positively inspired and built much of what we have been doing here and in what i think about based on the ways that you have podcast and communicate with the public and maintain your station integrity in the way that you interact with people it is really inspiring and you have always been gracious to me and a humble and giving and i and at the same time i know there is a fire sky and there who likes to get in done once again thanks for being first man and thanks for taking on all the roles that you have and that you are and that you will and thanks for being a giver i all benefit thanksandrew i really fiche you saying all that and i want people to just get after it take things seriously have fun and be really really good watching for instance what you have done which has been spectacular well executed makes me superhappy and i do not view anyone as competition in the podcasting world for instance in the book world i do not viewed that way either and i just hope that people keep experimenting pushing the on below and if people are not say getting better of time if people are not following who are substantially better than me in all of these ways i then told be super disappointed s every time i see someone doing something really impressive or doing something i never would have thought of i get extremely excited i find it really fun to watch appreciate you also is get out there and hard charging and taking your podcast s seriously as you do i mean i have seen the notes have seen the set up ad met the team it is it is

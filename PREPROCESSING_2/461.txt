welcome to the ubermensciencescience oimandruhubermen and of a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day we are talking all about fasting and any time we are talking about fasting we are also talking about eating because we all need to eat sooner or later we are going to talk about how fasting and when we eat influences a large range of aspects of our health and well being both physical and mental were nowadays most people are familiar with the term intermittent fasting also sometimes called time restricted feeding i think most people do not really understand how that process works at sort of obvious that intermittent fasting a c time restricted feeding involves eating at certain periods of each twenty four hour cycle ore maybe even not eating for entire days in some cases but if you think about it everybody sleeps eventually and therefore because people do not eat during their sleep almost everybody is employing some form of intermittent fasting or time restricted feeding what we are going to talk about to day is how particular schedule of time restricted feeding can impact our health in different ways and when i say different ways i mean we are going to talk about how intermittent fasting a time restricted feeding impacts weight loss fat loss in particular muscle maintenance and loss and gain organ health such as got health and liver health the venom the epigene inflammation sickness recovery and healing from sickness exercise cognition mood and life span we arguing to cover a tremendous amount of information i promise to make it all directly accessible regardless of whether not you have a background in biology and metabolic science or not ism also going to talk about a lot of tools in fact ism going to discuss a number of tools during to day's episode that actually make it such that you do not have to follow any feeding schedule or fasting schedule same thing if you think about it in any absolutely strict regimented way meaning if you were to only eat during and eight hour period of each day most of the time but then occasionally eat across a twelve hour period of the day in theory that could actually have pretty serious detrimental health effects and yet there are things that you can do to attenuate those negative effects in fact there are things that you can do end or take that can make it as if you did not eat at all and we will discuss what those tools are and in many cases for sake of health weight loss and performance making the body think that it did not eat at all can actually be quite beneficial today we are on to cover mechanism and we are going to cover to rules before we do that i want to highlight a particular result that was published recently because it serves as a useful backbone as we weighed into the conversation about fasting this is a study that was published in the journal sell metabolism a sell press journal excellent journal and the title of the paper is fasting blood glucose as a predictor of mortality lost in translation and it'll explain with the lost in translation part means in a moment but the basic take way of the study and i should mention that the the first author of the study is paliyagaroo p a l l i we a g u r u guru palm palm kangaroo at all the basic fining of the study is that in humans higher blood glucose is a located with mortality and in fact if you look at blood glucose resting blood glucose across the li spin what you find is as people age resting blood glucose goes up that this is very interesting because for a long time it was thought that metabolism actually goes down as we age to some extent that is true but the reductions in metabolism are not nearly as robust as we once thought that they were across the life span however unless there is something done to mitigate the increase in blood locos associate with the aging almost everybody experiences a gradual but regular increase in resting blood glucose that predicts mortality now the title as i mentioned is fasting blood glucose as a predict or mortality lost in translation and the reason that they included lost in translation in the title is that what i just told you that increases in resting blood glucose predict mortality or are correlated with mortality is true for human beings and for non human primates monkeys but the opposite is true in mice and i thought it was important to use this study as an example of where studies in mice often but not always translate to humans and to non human primates to day ism going to be careful to distinguish when a study was performed in mice verses in humans because it seems that at least when discussing feeding blood glucose and other aspects of diet as they relate to health in well being whether not a study was performed in rodents or in humans can be very important in this case the results were directly hundred eighty degrees opposite to one another in motherworts in mice resting blood locos when down and was associate with mortality lower blood glucose associate with mortality were in humans higher resting blood glucose was associate with mortality and obviously over mostly interested in is health and well being of ourselves of humans ism sure there some people out there that are om intensely concerned about of the health and well being of mice which a you could imagine a a few rare contacts where that important but obviously most of us are interested in human health it'll be sure to emphasized when studies were performed in humans verses in mice before we begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate for my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens the lentic greens is an a in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens on the reason i still take athletigreens once or twice to day is that it helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which our vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called got microfilm and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essential with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens tit get the vitamins i need the minerals i need end the phobics to support my microfilm if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stop come slash supermen and claim a special offer the will give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin d three k too the are tons of stand ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if wore getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient in vitemend three and k to is also important because it regulates things cardiovascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic greenstone come slash supermen to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar have talk many times before on this podcast about the key roll of hydration end electrolytes for nerve sell function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium an potassium present in the preparation all of those cells function properly and all our bodily system can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration end that your getting the preparations of electrolytes if you to try element you can go to drink element that is element do come slash supermen and you will get a free element sample pack with your purchase there all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to element element do come slash supermen o k let us talk about feeding fasting health and performance and i wanted just establish a few foundational terms that we are all on the same n page first of all rather than talk about fasting or time restricted feeding ism largely going to talk about time restricted feeding but please understand that time restricted feeding is just one side of the coin that is a two sided coin that includes fasting on the one hand not eating and time restricted feeding on the other hand i may occasionally say fasting but because fasting and eating establish different biological conditions in the body time restricted feeding is the term that i will use to describe the overall plan of restricting one's eating window as it is called to a particular plays of each twenty four hour day or in some cases to particular days within the week because as you will soon learn there are aspects of time restricted feeding a a fasting that involve eating every other day or eating one way for five days and then fasting for two days and forth it'll be very precise about what i mean and why i mean it but for the time being ism going to refer to time restricted feeding as a way to put an umbrella over this conversation second of all i am going to emphasize a lot of biological mechanism if you have listen to this pods before that i always begin with biological mechanism i do describe tools of how to implement those mechanisms but i wholeheartedly believe that knowing mechanisms and understanding how these processes work gives you tremendous flexibility and understanding and control over the processes of your mental and physical health whereas if i were to just list off a menu of things to do and not to do those will work but those will not give you the kind of understanding that would allow you to navigate through life through travel through dinners out through different exercise schedules whether not your one age or another age male female et camera ism giving you mechanism that you can gain more control over the systems in your brain and body everything's time stamp if you want o jump to the two dos you can certainly do that but i incurve you to hang in there for the mechanism bit i will make it all very clear because if you understand mechanism you are in a true place of power and control over your biology if ever there was a topic that is controversial especially on the internet it is that of diet and nutrition ism wading into this with a smile and in eager anticipation of all the but but but this and but but that and wait but this showed that here is the deal we need to precisely define what it is that were talking about when we talk about nutrition ism going to give you an example of a study that was published a few years ago two thousand eighteen by a college of mine at stamford wrist gardener a terrific professor of nutrition and has done a lot of important studies on how nut trivial impacts different aspects of health this is a large scale study it was published in mama the journal of the america medical association one of the very copier journals in the area of medicine and certainly for a paper on nutrition to show up there meant that it had to meet an exceedingly high standard this paper where chis is the first author its gardener at all twenty eighteen mama looked at weight loss in people following one particular diet verses another particular diet in this was a twelvemonth weight loss study it was focused specifically on weight loss although they looked at some other parameters as well end the basic conclusion of the study was that there was no significant difference in weight change between people following a healthy low fat diet verses a healthy low carbohydrate diet with significantly more dietary fats in them this caused a lot of ripples in the world of nutrition and nutritional science and certainly in the general population because any one that understands dit and nutrition would immediately say but weight there all sorts of different implications of eating one type of diet say lo carbohydrate higher fats verses a higher carbohydrate lower fat diet and indeed there are this study was focused specifically on fat loss and on weight loss as we discuss time restricted feeding we need to be very precise about what or the effects of time restricted feeding and of eating in particular ways an particular times we are going to emphasize again whether not the study was done in mice or in humans in athletes and men and women are both but the study from gardener in colleagues is a beautiful study and really emphasizes that if ones main goal is simply to lose weight then it really does not matter what one eats provided that the number of calories burned is higher than the number of calories invested however any one out there who understands a little bit of biology or a lot of biology will agree that there are many factors that impact that calories burned part of the equation some of those are obvious for instance amount of exercise type of exercise bail metabolic rate how much energy one burns just sitting there have talked before on this podcast about neat non exercise induce their oogenesis where if people bound around a lot in digital lot they can burn anywhere from eight hundred to two thousand calories per day there quoting quotebazil metabolic rate is fatally much higher simply because their fidget's whereas people who tend to be more stationary have a lower ball might a librate on average there is great science to support this metabolic factors and hormones are also very important hormones such as third hormone and insulin and growth hormone and the see story d hormones testosterone and estergan those levels will also profoundly influence the calories out the calories a burned component of the calories in calories out equation if out there on the interned or in listening to a particular podcast or speaker somebody says this is the ideal diet or calories in calories out does not matter or calories in calories out is the anything in that matters i think it is very important to understand that there are some foundational truths such as calories in calories out but that of course hormone factors and the context in which a given diet regimen is taking place are exceedingly important a good example this would be puberty at that time in life storied hormones are changing profoundly in the body as a growth hormone and other hormones and much of colorican take is directed towards proline synthesis towards the production of muscle and bone and other tissues of the body and that is because of changes in hormones that we call puberty there is no way that we can drill into every aspect of a given feeding plan or feeding schedule that would allow us to tappet every aspect of the list that i read out before weight lost fat lost muscle organ minor epigene inflammation exercise cognition mood and life stand but today we are going to be very precise about how time restricted feeding it is very clear from both animal studies and human studies can have a very powerful and positive impact on everything from weight loss and fat loss to various health parameters this is a beautiful literature that emerged mostly in the last ten or fifteen years and as we march into this literature what you will see is that there actually is a perfect diet for you on a given day and that perfect diet for you on a given day is contextual meaning it depends on what you did yesterday and what you are going to do tomorrow there is a perfect diet for you and to day ism gan army with the mechanisms and understanding that will allow you to define with that perfect diet is and will allow you to eat on a schedule and and to eat the things that are going to best serve your goals let us talk about eating and what happens when you eat and let us talk about fasting or not eating and what happens when you fast i did not entire episode on eating and metabolism and hormones and other factors that impact appetite we do not have time to go into all those details now although you arewelcome to listen to that episode as well but we can briefly describe the overall conditions that are set in the body when we eat and when we do not eat the key word here is conditions if i can emphasize anything today it is that what you eat and when you eat it set conditions in your body and those conditions can be very good for you or very bad for you depending on when you eat in fact when you eat is as important as what you eat it'll repeat that when you eat is as important as what you eat at least as it relates to health parameters in particular liver health and mental health some simple rules about eating first of all when you eat typically your blood glucose your blood sugar will go up also insolent levels will go up insolent as a hormone that is involved in mobilize in glucose from the blood stream how much your glucose and insolent go up depends on what you eat and how much you eat in general simple sugars including fructose from fruit but also sucrose and glucose and simple sugars will raise your insolent and blood glucose more than complex carbohydrates things grains and breads and posts and forth and grains and breads and posses and forth will raise your blood glucose more than fibrous carbohydrates let's and richly in things of that sort proline has a somewhat moderate or modest impact on insolent in glucose and fat has the lowest impact on raising your blood glucose and blood insolent what you eat will impact how steep arise in blood glucose and insolent takes place and there are number of factors that are related to your individual health that will also dictate how steep and how high that rise in glucose and insolent will be for the time being ism leaving out people who have type one diabetes the are people that do not manufacture their own insolent and type two diabetes is essentially insolent insensitivity lack of sensitivity to insolent which leads to high blood glucose but when you eat blood glucose goes up and when you do not eat blood glucose and insolent go down the longer it is been since your last meal the lower typically your blood glucose and insolent will be and the higher things like gel pe one glucagon peptide one glucagon being a hormone that is also secreted when you are in a fasted state or a low blood glucose state it is involved in mobilizing various energy sources from the body including fat through what we call lipolysis also using carbohydrates and potentially even using muscle as a source of energy that is kind of a firehouse of information about what happens when great an do not eat but just think of it this way blood sugar and insolent go up when you eat they go down when you do not eat and other hormones go up when you do not eat there are hormones associated with the fasted state and there are hormones associated with the eating and having just eaten state now the most important thing to understand is that everything in biology this is a process that takes time insolent and glucose go up when we eat and it takes some period of time for them to go down even if we stop eating they will remain up for some period of time and then go back down it takes time this is very important because if you look at the scientific literature on fasting on time restricted feeding it is absolutely clear that the health benefits not just the weight lost benefits but that the health benefits from time restricted feeding occur because certain conditions are met in the brain and body for a certain amount of time and that gives us an anchor for from which to view what eating is in terms of how it sets conditions in the body over time and if that sounds overly analytic i promise you this is the simplest and best way to think about any eating schedule or any eating plan i think it is fair to say that in the field of nutrition there are few landmark studies that serve as really strong anchors for building our understanding of what to eat and what not to eat and when to eat depending a no goals the gardener study that i mention earlier is one such study in that it says if your goal is weight loss it really does not matter what foods you consume provided that you consume a submaintenance colonic diet however i want emphasize again that sets aside issues of adherents meaning how easy or heard it is to adhere to a given diet somepeople find it much easier to follow a high fat carbohydrate diet some people full follow a different diet because it is much easier for them to follow and some people are concerned with mental performance in athletic perform at that study does not say there is a best diet what it says is that what you consume is less important then the amount of food that you consume at least forsake of weight loss not necessarily forsake of health now the study that ism going to refer to next is what i would consider the second major pillar of nutritional studies this is a truly landmark study that was carried out by such an panda who is a professor at the salt institute of biological studies and san dingo and absolutely phenomenal institution and an absolutely phenomenal researcher have known such in for a number of years and i want o emphasize that the current literature on intermit an fasting and time restricted feeding can largely be attributed to such in and the work that he is done there others involved to of course and of course time restricted feeding and fasting has a rich history that goes back many hundreds if not thousands of years in different cultures and religions but the science of time restricted feeding can really mainly be attributed to the incredible work that such an is done and ungrateful to consider him a friend in a colleague and we consulted at length in anticipation of this episode i also hope to have on as a guest in the future the landmark paper that came from machines lab was publishing two thousand twelve this was a paper in mice that set the basis for studies in humans that came later and the title of this paper is time restricted feeding without reducing colorican take prevents metabolic diseases in mice fed a high fat diet the title tells us a lot it says that what is varied in this study is not what these mice ate it was when they ate it and there were essentially four conditions in this study and the results are absolutely remarkable some in a walk you through the major results what they did is they gave mice access to different types of food there were four groups one group of mice had access to just a normal mouse diet it would not be die that you would be very interested in i confess that actually tasted mouncecheu if you work with mice at all you just have to do it at least once it does not taste for a good at taste a very bland gram cracker cook and i confess that i only had the tiniest little bit but mice that stuff and if you allow them to eat that stuff what is called ad labium whenever they want you just keep it in their food twenty four hours a day they will eat sometimes and then they will not eat at other times or in this case they all trout a condition where they gave them mouse chow in a time restricted way just for a certain number of hours each day about eight hours or they gave them a high fat diet that was a separate group got a high fat diet at any time they wanted this was kind of the carnival for mice because mice really high fat highly palatable foods and they got a lot of good ease and high fat in their food and then there was a fourth group that had access to the high fat diet as much as they wanted to eat but only during a restricted time period of each twenty four hours cycle now mice or nocturnal humans a what we call diurnal actual were not really diurnal were corpuscular which means it were most active in the morning and in the evening not much in the afternoon but none the less everything ism going to tell you is true also for humans and we know this now from human studies one of the most important things to take away from the study was that mice that ate a highly palatable high fat diet a great tasting diet but only during a restricted feeding window of each twenty four hours cycle maintained or lost weight over time whereas mice that ingested the same diet same amount of calories but had access to those calories around the clock gained weight became obese and quite sick and as an additional second point the mice that restricted their feeding window to a particular portion of eight hours of every twenty four hours cycle actually showed some improvement in important health markers and what was even more incredible is that mice that only ate during a particular feeding window also experience some reversal of some prior negative health effects this study really lit up the world and got people excited about time restricted ending again they used an eight hour feeding window the story around that eight our feeding window as kind of interestingdow not many people know this because was not included in the paper and there was no reason to include it in the paper not to out anybody but it turns out that the reason they used in eight hour feeding window and not a nine hour or a ten hour feeding window is because studies of this sort are actually quite demanding to perform and require the constant presence of the graduate student ere postdoc there to insure that the food is in the cages at particular times and not in the cages at other times and mice are really good hiding food theyleven hide food in their jowls a and there is a lot of work that has to be done to prepare for that eight hour feeding window and to make sure after that eight hour feeding window there is all the the food has been removed from the cage and from the jewels of the mice and forth and it turns out that the significant other of the graduate student and for nostoc i will not reveal whore they were running the study forbid there significant other the scientist from being in the lab for periods of time that were much longer than the ten or twelve hours that were required in order to insure this eight hour feeding window when we hear that eight hour feeding windows are wholly they are not whole and later we are going to talk about how eating for at time that is restricted to eight hours verses ten hours verses twelve hours for instance how that impacts various parameters health parameters and weight loss et camera but the eight our feeding window is actually created because of a real world constraint on the research and the relationship of the research or performing the research not because there is anything wholly about and eight hour feeding window now an important point about when the feeding window falls within the twenty four hour cycle it is very important that the feeding window fall during the more active phase of one's day for humans that typically in the early part of the day or the later part of the day but not at night put very simply there are a lot of data now pointing to the fact that eating during the nocturnal has of the twenty four hour cycle is very detrimental to one's health in fact when we eat can either enhance our health or can diminish our health when we see light and enhance our feelings of well being or can diminish our feelings of well being have talked many times before about this on the hubrmen labpodcas that during the daytime you want to get as much sunlight and other types of bright light in your eyes as is safely possible and then you want to avoid light in the middle of the night it has detrimental dopamine lowering effects can cause depression quarters all increases et camera when you view light is as i portent as the light that you view and when you eat i is as important as what you eat in this study they saw something really interesting which was that not only did restricting food to a particular phase of the twenty four hour cycle benefit things lean body mass and fat loss and a number of health parameters that ill talk about in moment but it also anchored all the gene systems of the body and provided a more regular stable called circadian rhythm or twenty four hour rhythm you may be surprised to learn that eighty per cent eighty per cent of the genes in your body and brain are on a twenty four hour schedule that is they change their levels going from high to low and back to high again across the twenty four hour cycle and when those genes are high at the appropriate times and low at the appropriate times meaning their expression is high and low at the appropriate times and therefore the proper arouse and prolines are made because dean got for arnaarnaes translated into prolines when that happens your health benefits when those genes are not expressed at the right times when their high or low at the wrong times of each twenty four hour cycle that is when you get negative health effects this study showed that when mice restrict their eating to an eight hour period within the most active phase of their twenty four hour cycle many of the genes that are associated with these called circadian clocks these genes have names our b man cry one et camera those called clock genes underwent a very regular in trainmen a locking in to the proper twenty four hour schedule and while this was in mice we now know that this also occurs in humans have said before on this podcassan all sated again that light and when we view light is the primary way in which these genes in the clock systems of our body get organized or untrained meaning match to the outside light dark cycle viewing light early in the day and in the afternoon and as much as possible all day great ideally that sunlight avoiding lightnhemiddle the night is also great its great because it causes the increases in particular genes and the decreases in particular genes in every cell throughout your body at the appropriate times the second most powerful time keeper or zit saber as it is called is food and when you eat and in this study the results they saw underscore this point what they saw is that the peaks in these clock genes became very regular and the dips in these clock genes became very regular and that led to a whole host of really important positive health effects conversely when mice eight whenever they wanted across the twenty for hour cycle these clocgenes became really out of wack and the negative health consequences were the down stream result of these changes in these clockgenes this is now also been shown to be true for humans if you want to be healthy you want your organ health your metabolic health to be in trained properly one of the most important things you can do as to view light at the appropriate times of each twenty for our schedule and to notview light at other times of that schedule and to eat at the appropriate time of each twenty for hour day now again there are rare instances that we will discuss when skipping in tire days or entire twenty for our cycles of eating can be beneficial but for now were talking about schedule of time restricted feeding than solve a window of feeding that falls during or more active face a during the daytime putting aside people that worksheet work during the daytime is when you want to eat and this eight hour feeding window provided a very strong reinforcing signal that combines with light to ensure that these genes are expressed at the appropriate times the short take away from this is you probably want to think about and perhaps even engaging time restricted feeding as i mentioned earlier when mice can eat around the clock that things happen in one of the bad things that happens is that the liver suffers the liver is involved in all sorts of things production of important hormones and other factors related to metabolism and when mice can eat around the clock their livers got very sick fatty deposits in the liver other factors in the liver essentially takin down the pathway of liver disease the time restricted feeding essentially reversed that or led in many cases to even healthier liver conditions and that spared on this study but also additional studies also now in humans restricting your feeding to a particular window every twenty for our cycle has clearly been shown now in mice and inhuman to enchants liver health which is wonderful how does it do this well it happens because food in take as i mentioned earlier sets certain conditions in the body that last for a period of time any time we eat whether not we are a mouse or a human there is a period of time that is required for called digestion but also gastric emptying and other processes related to breaking down that food and utilizing it and that is an active process it requires energy and that process of breaking down food involves certain cellar of functions that if their on going throughout the twenty for hour cycle or even extended too far across the twenty for hour cycle meaning your eating across a fourteen or sixteen hour and eighteen hour window that causes serious problems and this is now been established because of the fact that it increases the expression of different prolines and genes in the bodies such as ten f alpha lie six i one what are all those things they are pro in inflammatory markers the reason that the liver get sick when your eating too often is because inflammatory markers are increased is inflammatory markers are not inherently bad they are there for reason but they are there in order to respond to certain challenges immune challenges or the ingestion of food in the break down of food but then id in an ideal circumstance they are reduced in the period in which there is no food present in the digestive tract or in which there is very little food present o the digestive tract by eating around the clock you are making yourself sicker by eating at restricted periods of time each twenty four hour day you are actually making yourself healthier and you are activating certain processes that can positively impact both wait either maintenance are loss of weight will talk aby weihtgan later and positively impacting things liver health also the expression of different things related to brown fat the fat that increases your metabolism we will return to this also a little bit later and blood glucose regulation the take away from this study in fact the many takeaways from the study it wonderful is that liver health big acid metabolism energy expenditure inflammation liver metabolites many many aspects of our health are impacted by when we eat not just what we eat as we move forward and we talk about interment fasting for eight hour windows six hour windows twelve hour windows for all sorts of different intends in purposes i want to start to establish a foundational protocol that all of us any of us can use in order to maximize your particular goals there are some absolutes within this realm of time restricted feeding here are a couple of absolutes that you would want to consider first of all it pays off in the metabolic sense and in the health sense and in the wait maintenance or lost sense to not invest any food in the first hour after waking and potentially for longer won a repeat that one of the key pillars of interment fasting is that for the first hour after you wake up and potentially for longer to not ingest any food the second major pillar that is well supported by research is that for the two an ideally three hours prior to bedtime you also do not invest any food or liquid calories for that matter and we will talk about what it means to break a fast and whether not certain liquids even coffee in tea can break a fast et better in a few moments but just as a foundation it is very clear from the research inhuman that not eating any food or ingesting any calories liquid or otherwise for the first sixty minutes after waking up each day and for the two to three hours prior to your bedtime that is ideal for the parameters that we have discussed earlier all the different things weight and liver health and metabolic health and forth the two most common quest is about intermittent fasting or when is the ideal time for the eating window as t early in the day the middle of the day or late or in the day and how long should that eating window should it be eight hours we already heard why the eight our window was first established as because of these lab conditions and the conditions of the particular relationship of the graduates do not involve or should it be seven hours or six hours or twelve hours turns out that there is a general frameworks that we can follow in order to answer these questions as we move into this portion of the discussion i want to highlight a very important reference that just came out literally came out last weep in the journal under chronology reviews and the title of this review is time restricted eating for the prevention and management of metabolic diseases although the data in this paper go well beyond metabolic diseases this is a paper from southland pandas lab it is a very lengthy review with an enormous table that is beautifully organized that scrips out all the studies done inhuman well over a hundred studies looking at time restricted feeding in athlete's men women children dies no dies et camera we detailed references and description of the outcomes spent a lot of time with s review eventhougit just came out recently and is a absolute gold mine resource it is also the major resource for everything ism about to tell you if you would to felt deeper into the material let us deal with this first question of when is the ideal feeling window and here again we are thinking about a schedule of eating that involve eating at least once every twenty four hours not to day or three day or every other day fast it turns out that the answer to the question when is it best to eat is actually best answered by thinking about the other side of the coin which is when is it best to fast because we are fasting during sleep it is very clear that it is best to extend the sleep related fast either into the morning or to start it in the evening now this might seem kin of obvious but it is actually not obvious you could place that feeding window early in the day middle of the day or late in the day let us think about what happens when we sleep when we sleep our body undergoes a number of different processes in the brain and body in order to recover the cells and tissues many of you have probably heard of autophagi which is essentially cleaning up a goblins up of dead cells and cells that are injured or sick and this is a natural process that occurs and it occurs mainly during sleep although not only during sleep fasting of any kind does tend to enhance autophagy it is not the only way to create autophagiat conditions autofaget conditions can be created simply by following a sub colonic diet and there are other things that one can do in order to trigger automate but fasting does trigger autifagy when we are asleep the bad cells are getting gobbled up in eaten and the good cells also are undergoing certain repair mechanisms mainly related to or at least governed by those circadiangenes that we talk about earlier those clock genes you are already fasting when you are asleep and how deep you are into that fast depends on how long it was since your last meal if you fast early in the day and you have been a sleep for five six seven eight hours i would hope somewhere between six and eight hours for most people at going to be beneficial when you wake up i mentioned earlier that you do not want to eat for at least the first sixty minutes after waking but were you to extend that fasting to say nine a m ten a m eleven a m or even twelve noon or later you are taking advantage of the deep fast that you were in during sleep and certainly toward the end of sleep now why do i say deep fast well because when we eat the clearance of that food from our gut and the processes in our cells and organs that are related to digestion and the utilization of that food takes about five to six hours if you eat a meal and that meal last ten minutes twenty minutes or thirty minutes or even an hour and then you stop eating you've stopped eating but you are not fasting at that point you can say your fastincause you are no longer putting food into your digestive tract but you are not in a fasted state you are not under conditions of fasting later all talk about things that you can do to accelerate the transition into fasting one thing is certain that you want your eating window to be tacked or attached to your sleep based fasting in a way that makes it easier for you to get into the fasted state for a period of time we can viol that point from the perspective of best better and worst of if you are most people in you sleep at night in waking up somewhere around six thirty seven a m or maybeven right a m let say you were to push your fasting window out such that you started eating at noon and then you stopped eating at six p m well then you are not eating from six p m until let say your bedtime is ten p m but from six p m to ten p m your body is not yet in a fasted state because you just ate however you are starting to taper into a fasted state before sleep and then all through sleep and until the next morning and late morning you are actually in a fasted state now most people find it very hard to only eat in the middle of the day while that is best it is ideal forsake of the fasting related improvements in health it is not ideal and it is not very applicable to most work an family in social situations most people eat breakfast with others and or eat dinner with others some people eat lunch with others but in general it is hard to restrict your feeding window to just the absolute middle of the day but from a purely health perspective in a very objective way that would be the ideal situation let us imagine a different pattern of eating where the feeding window starts in the afternoon starts around two or even three p m some people do not have much trouble or they can train themselves to get there feeding window out to to or three p m and then they will eat until ten or eleven p m right if you do sheath you realize that that feeding window is still pretty short its still constitutes what we would call intermit an fasting or time or stricter feeding but assuming that they go to bed around eleven p m or midnight they are not actually fasted in sleep because for the first six hours or of sleep they be five but probably more six hours of sleep there still digesting the food that they consumed a late in the night it does appear beneficial to grab a hold of that sleep related fast meaning you do not want your feeding window to be too close to bedtime and that is why we came up with this and foundational pillar that i discussed with such in earlier which is at least no eating for the first hour after waking but also no eating within two to three hours prior to bed and because we all need to sleep and sleep as e seemingly important for our health of all kinds you want a prioritize sleep but because we also have to eat then you start to think about this and n maybe it is not good to push that feeding window too late in the day because when you go to sleep you are not actually capitalizing on the sleep related fasting now it is not just the case that it is easiest to fast while in sleep although that is true because when we are sleep typically were not hungry or looking for food or foraging for food or wanting food or thing to resist food were just sleeping there is something special about the fasting that occurs during sleep because it is associated with a number of processes that relate to the call lymphatic system the movement of lymph fluids and other fluids through the brain a kind of sweeping out a cartridge disposal if you will a clearing out of the metabolic tore and some of the autifagy that is associated with bad processes in the brain we could do a whole episode on this but essentially during sleep and in particular during fasted states of sleep we are undergoing a number of automatic cellar processes that clear out debris from our brain enhance to cognition or at least offset domensha this is now well established as well as a number of the same processes occurring in the organs of our body what were starting to see here is that there a number of constraints on when you can eat now i would be remiss if i did not acknowledge the social constraints in the real life constraints some of us because we want to eat with our family and because our family or ore significs another eat around eight or nine p m and that is the only time were together you have to eat late in the day and that certainly not a sin ism not saying that is good or bad here we are trying to establish if you recall best better and worse from both a practical and a health perspective and a purely objective view of how intermittent fasting works and can benefit us starting to eat each day somewhere around ten a m or around noon and then allowing a feeding window that goes until six or may be eight p m that seems to me least based on the data and what i understand about typical cultures where people eat in the daytime and in the evening that seems to me the kind of schedule that will allow you to get the most out of intermittent fasting trimester ted feeding but does not set you up to be really out of sink with the social rhythms in most cultures if you think about it from the perspective of say a noon to eight feeding window the you'll find is that you're able to eat lunch with others if you or by yourself you will be able to eat dinner at a reasonable hour at least in most countries in most cultures eating dinner somewhere between six thirty and seven p m is typical when you say a feeding window that goes until eight that does not mean sitting down to dinner at eight that means your last bite of food or ingestion of any liquid calories was at eight p m assuming that you go to bed somewhere between ten p m and one a m that allows this tapering off or this transition from feeding to a fasted state and still allows you to capitalizes on the special period of fasting that is sleep related fasting and again i wane o emphasize that the fasting that occurs during sleep is vital and eating too close to sleep will disrupt that fasting related sleep now there are a number of caveats and details related to this and there is an important caviar in detail related to people that are specifically interested in increasing or maintaining muscle mass wristlets talk about food volume and food type and how that relates to whether not you quickly or slowly enter a fasted state because clearly when we talk about a feeding window that feeding window could include any number of different foods that could involve can an ice crying beats a hamburgers plants fruit whatever it is or it could involve just fats or just prolines et camera there are at least three factors that are going to govern how quickly you transition from investing food to a fasted state remember as you invest your last bite or sip of calories that is not when the fast begins that man be when the fasting begins on your watch or on one of these as that all refer to later w ice can help you tract your fasting and eating windows but that is not when it actually begins because your body is still seeing food your actually carrying around food inside of you even though you are not putting it into your mouth your still eating in some sense it should be somewhat obvious that very large meals are going to take longer to digest than very small meals that will impact how slowly or quickly you migrate from a fed state to a fasted state there is no way i can spell out what exact volume of food you should in gassed on the size of your stomach and et camera but you are all familiar with being extremely full very full comfortably full somewhat full or not feeling full and feeling hungry learning to gauge food volume is important also foods that include some fats or a lot of fats will tend to slow gastric tempting time and depending on the kind of fats it could mean that a given meal is digested within three hours for sis five hours or more fats might be a large meal with a lot of fats has been can take five or six hours a smaller meal with less fat as can to be digested more quickly a consuming calories in liquid form is going to mean that gastricempting time is going to be faster and then of course there the glucose and the insolent aspect to it which is that foods that lead to big steep rises in glucose pure sugars then your glucose will drop however if there combined with fats than it tends to be more gradual rise in glucose and its more sustained et camera fibrous foods will also created for a longlasting sustained releasing glucose the importanthing here is to establish a feeding window that you can comfortably manage ki meaning that on average you can obey a six hour feeding window or an eight hour of feeding window or a ten hour feeding window and the to place that feeding window in a social and life contacts that you can manage on a regular basis now there two key points that have been gleaned from the sin toxic data about this feeding window and when to place it and this is based on a really important experiment that such in and its colleagues have been doing there is a web sight that they have zeros website called circadian clock you can go to the web side a free of cost your number of important resources there but what they have done is they examined the feeding behavior of thousands of people people will take a picture of the food thereabout to eat and it enters into their account may be your account if you create one on circadian clock and they do this over many days or weeks what is great about this is it establishes what is sensually called a feed graham a time in which people ate and a number of important findings have emerged from these feed grahams across large populations of people indifferent times owns with different schedules et camera first of all almost everybody under estimates their feeding window meaning people who think that they are on an eight hour feeding window or six hour feeding window when there data are analyzed it almost is always the case that there actually on a feeding window that is one or even two hours longer than they think anyhow could that possibly be if people are taking their first bite at noon and there taking their last bite at eight p m well that must mean that they are on that feeding window of eight hours and it turns out that people cheat but they do not seat in any kind of obvious way they might have a glass of wine after dinner or they'll have a cup of tea in a little bite of a cooky and when people are honest than they are honest in most cases a for this experiment well you find is that most people's eating window is actually quite a bit longer in discussing this with such in in reviewing the literature it is clear that if you to be on a ten hour feeding window that you should probably select an eight hour feeding window because there is always a little bit of a taper on either side of that eating window very few people are extremely strict about these feeding windows is just hard to do in the contact of life events in social gatherings and and family and forth o cases as we build forward your ideal fasting slash time restricted feeding schedule we now have several different rules that we can list out first at least no food for the first hour after waking up at least one hour two no food in take for two an ideally three hours prior to your bedtime three if you want to select and eight hour feeding window than you should probably focus on a six or seven hour feeding window because in reality your feeding window is going to be longer reality meaning real life constraints and if you to be on a ten hour feeding window you should probably select an either or a nine hour feeding window because the way it plays out is that people almost always eat outside of their eating window somewhat the other nice thing about selecting a slightly shorter feeding window than is comfortable for you is that it takes into a count that as you take your last bite or you last sip of calories there is this time or taper before which you are actually in a fasted state and because your eating different things on different days presumably some foods leave your got more quickly some thing spike your insolent in your glucose more than others sometimes eat more fat sometimes less fat this allows you to fall well within the margins of the benefits of time restricted feeding that have been demonstrated in humans which generally involve and eight hour window or i think this eight hour window or six hour window is a good thing to shoot for for most people some people and we will discuss the exceptions but some people truly are exceptions to this they just require more food and along those lines i just now briefly want a touch on some of the studies that have looked at using a very short feeding window of about four hours nowadays a number of people are doing the called one meal per day or are restricting their feeding window to just four hours or six hours and that turns out to be an interesting strategy and the data around it actually are a little bit surprising one surprising thing to leap out of this massive literature review on time restricted feeding in humans is that relatively short feeding windows of say four to six hours do produce a number of positive health effects things increased insole sensitivity which we know is good remember typetudiabeties is a reduction and insolent sensitivity improvements in bate a self function and the pancreas decrease blood pressure decreased oxidative stress decreases in things evening appetite positive health facts and psychological facts in general however they either produce no changing body weight or they tend to produce even increases in body weight now of course there is variation between individuals and between studies but this is somewhat surprising the eight hour feeding window seems to be very beneficial across almost all the parameters that we have discussed inflammation weight lost fat loss et camera and adherents i should mention people's ability to stick to the diet seems quite good on this eight hour feeding windows but when people try and undergo very short feeding windows afford to six hours it seems that they are over eating in that for to six hours at least over eating with respect to their metabolic needs now the contrast to this is the called one meal per day schedule very few studies on one meal per day one meal per day unless it is a very very lone meal a sort of feast typically would not last forth six hours guess it sore depends on high to fine a meal but when you look at the very few she memorizes again very few studies on one mel per day people typically maintain or lose weight on the one meal per day schedule t we can say is that the seven to nine hour feeding window produces all of the major health benefits of time restricted feeding as well as being pretty straightforward from most people to adhere to on a regular basis and on a regular basis turns out to be very important it'll get back to that point a moment whereas the for to six hour eating window does not seem to serve people as well as say a seven or eight hour eating window simply because people are over eating during that eating window and the one meal per day while perhaps ideal for certain people schedule may actually cause people to under a and in some cases that might be what people want they actually want to under eat but when we start thinking about performance in work and in sport and when we start considering hormone health and hormone production fertility that when we can really start to look at the seven to nine hour feeding window verses the for to six hour feeding window versus the one meal per day type feeding window with some different objectivity we can start to look at it through a different lens because it turns out that when you place the feeding window and how long that feeding window is actually will impact a number of other things in particular hormones that can be very important for a number of things related to sex and reproduction can be related to performance at work performance in athleticism and there are excellent studies on this let us explore those now let us talk about some conditions where having the feeding window early in the day would actually be very beneficial there was a study that was published recently in sell reports again sell press journal excellent journal pee reviewed very stringent from diorama at all this is a o y a m a at all this was published just recently jury twenty twenty one that looked at the distribution of protein take indifferent meals delivered either early in the day or later in the day and ism summarizing here quite a lot but i should mention that this study was performed in both mice an humans same paper mice and humans and involved hypertrophy training essentially increasing the weight bearing of given limbs to try and induced hypertrophy which is the growth of muscle tissue it does appear that muscle tissue is better able to undergo hypertrophy by virtue of the fact that there is better or enhanced proline synthesis early in the day because of the expression of one of these particular clocgines called b man b m a l female regulates a number of different proline synthesis pathways within muscle cells such that eating proline early in the day supports muscle tissue maintenance and or growth and in the study they also look to the effects of supplementing called b c a as branch chinaminoacids which is popular in a body building circles and in strength training circles and b c a as are essential components of a number of different foods but can also be supplemented the take away the study is pretty straightforward however the take away is if your main interest is maintaining and or building muscle than it can be beneficial to invest proline early in the day you would still want to obey this what we are calling a kind of foundational rule of note not eating any food for the first hour post waking or at least the first hour postdating and the cut off for when you would want proline would be sometime be four ten a m and there ism averaging across a number of different situations but in general this male expression is such that let ay you wake up at seven a m your main interest is en a hypertrophy or maintenance of muscle then you would want to invest some proline some time before ten a m but obviously if you are interested in getting the health effects of interment an fasting that you would invest any food ah for at least the first sixty minutes upon waking now it is not as if at ten o one a m a gait slam shut and you cannot generate hypertrophy of course that is not the case however it is very interesting that it does not matter when the resistance training the load bearing exercise occurs in the twenty four hour cycle whether not in other words people are training early in the day or their training late in the day it still appears that in jesting proline early in the day favors hypertrophy or that one is better or i should say more easily able to access hypertrophy by way of these clock regulated proline senses is mechanisms by ingesting proline early in the day in no way she perform does this study say that ingesting prone later in the day is somehow bad for you it just emphasizes the positive effects of investing proline early in the day forsake of muscle maintenance and or hypertrophy if your somebody whose mainly concern with muscle maintenance and hypertrophy then it may make sense to move that feeding window earlier in the day and certainly there are people out there who are interested in muscle maintenance and hypertrophy who are not doing intermit an fasting at all and that is also perfectly find but this to happens to be an episode about intermit n fasting in time restricted feeding there are of course modes of eating where one eats small meals spread throughout the day or waits meals differently such that meals early in the day are larger than later in the day or fives verse there are a near infinite number of ways to organize this but if you are somebody whose interested in deriving the many clearly established health effects of time restricted feeding and you are somebody who would to maintain or build muscle then in busting prolines in the early part of the day would be important to you at least on the basis of these results and therefore that eight hour window that we we've established as more or less ideal shifted to the later part of the day might not be as beneficial for you i can just personally say that for me when i wake up in the morning it is very easy for me to not eat until noon or one or two p m eating early in the day is actually somewhat of a challenge i discuss this point with such in because we were talking about how is it that one can move their feeding window or place themselves on to a different schedule of intermit an fasting and it is very clear that one needs to provide a transition period in order for that to happen you should allow yourself a transition period of anywhere from one week to ten days in which you shift your feeding window by about an hour each day or and then once you establish a feeding window that feels comfortable for you and that you think you can maintain over time the at you simply maintain that feeding schedule for at least thirty days but ideally you would do that indefinitely now this turns out to be important based on data that they have gleaned from this micirccadtian clock massive experiment that they have ben doing where people are entering the times at their feeding and and eating souse me any time the tog about mice always think about feeding because i come from a background and my labors on both laboratory mice and on humans any time i thing about humans i thing about eating but of course they are the same thing the interesting thing to emerge from that very large data set inhuman is that when people log their feeding times as i mention before oftentimes they think their eating in an eight hour window but they are actually eating in a much broader window however even for people that are very good about restricting their feeding to a for or sakes or eight hour window if they are very strict about the start and stop times when they invest calories one of the findings that is really been important to note is that almost every individual has a lot of drift in wen that eating window resides in their twenty for hour period in particular on the week ends people are either extending or shifting their feeding window in a way that makes it seem that they have travelled to another time zone and are eating according to another timezone and this is extremely important as a mention earlier based on the two thousand twelve study from sucking lab where eating it a particular face of each twenty four hour cycle can help enhance the expression of these clock genes if you are eating within a very strict or semi strict feeding window but that feeling window is migrating around from day to day or five days a week you are really organized about when that falls let s ay for sake of example from noon to eight p m noonday p m money noonday p m tuesday wednesday noonday p m thursday and forth but then on the sturdy it is becoming eleven a m and your ending at early or perhaps your starting early in the day on sundae your having brunch that starts at nine thirty or ten and then it is extending out still just eight hours but it shifting around that can cause disruptions in these circadian clock mechanisms that cause disruptions in the downstream effects of eating that are taking at least two to three days to recover from obviously we do not want o be overly neurotic about the stuff but because this is an episode about the science of intermitting fasting in time restricted feeding as important as how long your feeding window is is were that feeling window resides in each twenty for hour cycle and perhaps even more important than that is that it be fairly regular where that feeding window resides because even if you hove a very short feeding window if it is drifting around from day to day that actually offsets the number of the positive health effects of interment and fasting to really just underscore the way that these different pieces of the biological puzzle fit together if you are very strict or semi strict about your eight hour feeding window but on the week ends that eight our feeding window is falling later then it normally would during the middle the week it is as if you are going to bed at or even if you are going to bed at the same time at least from the perspective of metabolic health because of the way that eating impacts these clock jeans and i pacts or i should say a subtracts the sleep related fasting that you would normally experience if you were to finish eating a coupleouers before bedtime again we do not want to create any overly obsessive or neurotic focus on this i think that most all people could benefit from a time restricted feeding schedule but they should really think hard about what they can stick to on a regular basis and understand that they tend to under estimate the feeding window that they actually are partaking in and that they should place that feeding window in a portion of the twenty four hour cycle that they can be consistent on most days and i want emphasize most again because we are not laboratory mice we do not have a graduate student coming in for eight hours a day because that is what their significant other will allow them to do and then removing the food from our jewels and from our cages we have access to food pretty much twenty four hours a day along those lines however there are things that we can all do that will allow us to offset some of the drift if you will that we experience or that we induce in terms of when our feeding window occurs or that the feeding window might push out a little later and then therefore start a little later the next day there things the we can do in their things that we can take and id to discuss those briefly throughout this episode have more or less been alluding to the fact that when you eat the some period of time afterwards in which you are actually still eating at least from the perspective of metabolism because locos is up insolent is up and you are undergoing different metabolic and digestive processes that do not really speak to you being in a fasted state it it is not just about when you take your last bite or your last sip however there are things that we can do to accelerate the transition from a fed state to a fasted state and i to discuss what those are and i want to emphasize that the term fed state is probably a better way to think about it then eating or not eating because we think of eating as the verb were eating or eating o they were done eating on fasting now we are not actually fasting you because you are fed we should really think about fed and unfed states because from a cellar processes perspective and from a health perspective that is actually what your body in your system are paying attention to and by now with everything that we laid out i think that should be intuitive to underset and there is a fun and exciting concept related to this which is glues clearing you may have heard the old wattage that if you take a twenty or thirty minute walk after dinner that it accelerates the rate at which you digest that food and indeed it does clearing out of glucose from your system can be accomplish through a number of different means but light movement or exercise does increase gastric tempting time for instance if you were to eat a meal that ended at eight p m and to and then plop to the couch watch t v or get on your computer or go to sleep it would be five or six hours until you have transition from a fed state to a fasted stake however you can accelerate that considerably by taking an twenty or thirty minute just light walk it does not have to be speed walking certainly does t hove to be jogging but just walking outside or moving around glucose clearing is an important aspect of the transition from the fed state to the fasted state and just a light walk can allow you to do that ow if you cannot get outside some people will go om through the gymnastics literally of doing things air squats and pushups and things that and indeed those will increase the expression of things glut four in things that mobilized glucose an to muscles and things that sort but undermost conditions most people are not doing push ups after dinner or certainly if you have had a big meal just taking a light walk can be beneficial in addition you could consider doing intense exercise now you would not necessarily want to do that immediately after eating let us take a look at what high intensity training of any kind does to blood glucose because in this case it turns out that when you do high intensity training actually has opposite effects on blood glucose opening on wether not you do it early or later in the day fairly recent study looked at called hit training high intensity interval training which of course can take many different forms it can take the form of circuit training with was it can take the form of soft buries in push ups and spring and all sorts of diver tings but intense interval training is typically training gets people's heart rates up no well above seven you per cent a maximum and then brief periods of rest and then repeating and how long the high intense interval training of course will also very ah there is there are very brief six or twelve or fifteen minute work outs some people can a carry on with high intense interval training from to forty five or and maybe even sixty minutes in extreme cases but when you look at the studies that have explored highintensy interval training and its effect on blood glucose there are couple studies that leap out for instance one that emphasis that blood glucose levels will actually increase if high intensity interval training is performed early in the day and will decrease if high intense interval training is performed later in the day now the purpose for red this exploration was not to explore clearance of blood glucose forsake of intervention fasting it was mainly focussed on athletic performance and whether not that was better early in the day or later in the day et camera but we can extract some information from these studies that are beneficial forsake of understanding glucose clearing if you have invested food throughout the afternoon and evening and late in the day in your thinking about going to sleep and you would to enter sleep in a way that is less fed and more fasted then engaging in intensity interval training in the afternoon will lower or evening i should say will lower blood glucose and in that way will help you accelerate your transition into the fasted state provided you do not invest something after the hyintensy interval training now is the increase in blood glucose that occurs from huh intensity interval training early in the day is that detrimental not necessarily that often times is associated with the huddling of new science to the muscles that have just done a lot of hard work it is not that hyintenste interval training should not be done early n the day in fact for many people including myself training early in the day just fer the way that my psychology biology works is always better for me than training later in the day and the other importanthing to mention is that hyntensty interval training done late in the day can be beneficial from the perspective of glucose clearing lowering good glucose and helping transition from the fed to the fasted state in preparation for sleep however if you reinvesting canine or anything to engage in that hyintencyinterval training in a way that prevents you from getting to sleep well then it is going to be detrimental over all the reason i mention this is of course because it is nice to know that light walks after dinner or any their meal for that matter or hyintensy interval training provided it is done in the second half the day can lower blood glucose and speed the transition from fed to fasted states but i also mention it because what we are really trying to achieve when we partake in intermittent fasting called time restricted feeding is what were really trying to do is access unfed states or fasted states it is not really about when you eat in what you do it is about extending the duration of the fasting period as long as you can in a way that still compatible with your eating right not the other way around and this gets back to this key feature of our biology which is that what we eat when we eat when we exercise when we view light it is about setting a context or a sett of conditions in your brain in body it is not much about the activities that you undergo it is about the activities you undergo and thee relationship to one another over time and in this way it really beautifully highlights the way that your biology is interacting all the time light is setting when you are gin to be awaken when you're going to be asleep when you eat is going to be determining when you are going to be awaken when you're going to be asleep and when you eat is also going to be determining when you are able to clear out debris from your brine in body and repair the various cells and mechanisms of your body when you are able to reduce those inflammatory side of kind throughout your body and this is really the beauty of time restricted feeding which is it is not really about restricting your feeding it is about accessing the beauty of the fasted state now there are other ways to clear out blood glucose that involve supplements or prescription drugs these are called glucose disposal agents glucose disposal agents such as met foreman which is a prescription drug or berberine which is an over the counter substance will lead to very dramatic reductions in blood glucose and they shift you from a fed to affected state and i know many people who take berberine before eating meals that include a large number of carbohydrates for instance as a way to clear out glucose now have tried berberine before and what i can tell you is that if you take berberine which by the way is very much met foreman its effects are almost identical to met formal in fact but it is much less expensive in its over the counter if you take berberine and you have not ingested carbohydrates many people including myself experience a splitting headache you become hypoglycemic because it is a glucose clearing agent if you are going to experiment with things met foreman and or berberine or similar you want to be very cautious that you are not clearing out blood glucose that is already low and the dose response for this varies tremendously from one individual to the next and there is a strong circadian component some people react very well to berberine early in the day but find that later in the day it provides extreme headaches for some people it is the opposite i caution you exploring things berberine and met foreman that you should expect to experience a number of physical and psychological effects that may work for you might be great for you but might also not be great for you nowadays there are a number of commercially available continuous glucose monitors have tried one of these in involves putting a what is essential a patch with the little needle that goes in your skin which is continuing continually excuse me monetize your blood glucose and you can look at it at an a on your phone and you can learn a lot that way about how different foods in pact the increases in decrease in blood glucose if you're doing experiments with berberine a met foreman you can see how those impact your blood glucose can see you exercise hit training or otherwise black impacts blood glucose souse me again it is very hard to assess blood glucose without a continuous blood glucose monitor and ifyoure not using one you are mainly going to be relying on subjective things a i feel i have low blood sugared i feel a shaky i have highblood sugar or shaking s you of low blood sugar i have to say that glucose clearing agents that involve a walk or exercise moderate or in ends are going to be lot easier to titrate and a just the levels of then things that you are going to take where you have to unjust the dosage and then once you invest a certain dosage you are along for the ride at least until the effects of that particular compound whereof it does not mean those things do not have utility it does not mean people are not using them because many people are but they are pretentually a very sharp blade that is a double coded blade i encourage you to approach those with caution if you decide to it all it is worth thinking about what the low blood luck state is and why it is beneficial as well as why it might produce headaches and in some cases can also adjust the effects of other hormones in the fasted state a number of different prolines that are expressed in cells undergo changes in their expression we talked about this earlier when we are fasted we tend to reduce the activity of a particular proline called m tour mammalian target of salamis in m tour is very active in cells while they are growing throughout development it is also very active in cancers of various kinds m tour needs to be what is called phosphorelated if you do not know what that means do not worry about about phosphorelation is a a manner in which certain prolines are altar that they can actually be functional within cells m tours associate with sell growth of all kinds healthy and unhealthy when m tourist phosphorelated there is a marker called p six phosphor m tour expresses p si this is all escaping you do not worry about it phosphor m tour and p six are reduced by fasting now this make sense if you think about it because eating and growth are associated with each other fasting is not necessarily anti growth but it is not regrowth and when we fast we see increases and cells of things a m pa the curtains things transcription to factors pox o a t f and stones or piton bodies you may have heard of the keytogenic diet what is the point of all this to chemistry it is not u just bits you with a bunch of seller biology and you chemistry it is to say that we have sell growth pathways involving m tour and p six and we have sell repair and sell shrinkage processes that are associated with m pa the called curtains which doctor division care from hazard and others are famous for a discovering and understanding things a m pa these two different divergent pathways of cell growth and sell break down and repair and by break down i mean actual clearance autophagy and repair those can be triggered by being in either the fed or the feasted state one way it'd likely to think about the fed state not just eating but having recently eaten or the fasted state meaning highblood glucose and or you have recently eat eaten or are currently eating or drinking calories is that when you eat or when you do not eat when you are fed when you are fasted you are either promoting cellular growth of all kinds or your promoting cellular repair and clearance of all kinds and again this is about setting conditions in the brain and body it is not much about when you eat food a or b it leads to increases them in emptor any time you eat any food does not out of its plant based animal base fat proline carbohidri does not matter you are bracing your system towards a biochemical state of cell growth and any time you have not eaten for a while or blood glucose is low your bracing your system toward a state of cellar repair and this is why people who do not suffer from any blood glucose regulation issues take things berberine as glucose disposal agents or take mat form and are necessarily suggesting that you do that but it is because those things mimic fasting they create situations in the body that promote things a m p k in the curtains and others to push your body and your system down a route of repair even though you might have just eaten a meal an hour ago along the lines of the health benefits of intermittent fasting their nice data showing improvements in the gut microfilm and in particular in the treatment of irritable basin drum in other forms of colitis in time restricted feeding meaning time restricted feeding seems to be able to assist people with those conditions following the general parameters that i discussed before eight hours and forth why and how well by way of intermittent fasting impacting the expression of these various clochgenes end because the clock genes impact the mucosa lining the mucus lining of the gut it appears that intermittent fasting can reduce the amount of called last bacillus that is present in the gut and lactose asylum is when in high levels is correlated with the number of different metabolic disorders at the same time time restricted feeding seems to enhance the proliferation of some of the gut microbioda osyllobactor and some of the other ones that promote healthy mucosa lining and that promote better overall in testing function these are pathways that have now been established and it appears that interment fasting is not just modulating these processes but is actually having a direct effect on the mucosa lining in a way that favors a healthier gut microbic it would come is no surprise that many people who experience gut issues benefit from restricting their feeding window to eight hours or per every twenty four hour period the other very exciting finding about intermittent fasting is one of the major health issues these days is the proliferation of called non alcoholic fatty liver disease thirty years or non alcoholic fat liver disease was exceedingly rare to see in the clinic except in alcoholics fatty deposits in the liver are bad it is essential fly liver disease nowadays children and adults are showing up with non alcoholic fat liver disease some of these people are obese others or not but is a serious health concern and its growing in numbers all the time a recent study there was published in sell reports medicine just a couple weeks ago tested the hypothesis whether not the gut microbial or called brown fat tissue is impacting the liver health and in particular nonalcoholic fatty liver disease the short take away from the study is that contrary to what was previously thought the gut microfilm while very important for a number of other processes in the body does not seem to be related to this non alcoholic fat liver disease the sis surprising to people or should be to those of youtherhav been fallowing the gut microfilm literature however brown fat which is a healthy fat that we have between are too scapulatin in our upper back it does noted to be blubber type fat pats but it sits deep to the skin but creates a thermogenic effect in the body that is helpful for reducing the amount of other fat the typofatha we more typically used to thinking about and talk about white fat and pink fat that subcutaneous fat around the abdomen and forth brown fat seems to have a direct correlation with the lack of non alcoholic fat liver disease what this study showed was that in people that have diminished concentrations of brown fat there is a higher probability of having non alcoholic fatty liver disease now the good news is brown fat stores can be increased and again this is not going to create blubber of brown fates is going to create increase thermogenesis an actually make people leaner and brown has a number of other important positive effects now this is interesting because cold exposure of anywhere from one to three minutes two or four times per weaker may be in ten minutes two to four times per week can increase brown fat stores also time restricted feeding has now been tied to the density of brown fat stores time restricted feeding also seems to positively increase brown fat stores probably because the way that brown fat stores relate to epinefern an a adrenalin which tend to go up when we are fasted what is this all mean this means forsake of liver health and for sake of reducing or may be preventing or even potentially when underline potentially reversing non alcoholic fat liver disease time restricted feeding also appears to be beneficial many people out there are interested in optimizing their harmony and as we mention early are insolent as a hormone and time restricted feeding seems to have very positive effects on over all insolent profiles and forth but any time you mention harmony people immediately seem to leap to the see stoat harmony testosterone and estrogen because indeed they have powerful effects both in the short term and the long term in terms of our mental and physical health and performance there is at least one study that is explored e effects of time restricted eating on performance athletic performance immune function and body composition was a study by morrow at all that was performed on elite cyclists i want a point that out i was a randomize controls a trial but what is really nice about the study is that it explored a number of different hormonal parameters in people that were using time restricted eating or that had a more extended eating window and they tract everything very carefully and the amount of food they were eating was actually pretty considerable four thousand eight hundred calories that loti calories but then again they were very active and they measured a number of different things related to via two mass et camera performance and over all performance at what they did cycling is not the point that i want to emphasize here although there were some plosive effects on their performance related to time restricted eating the point i want to talk about relates to things that presumably relate to most everybody which are the effects on things buncos third harmony testosterone sexhormomining globulin which can bind up testosterone and prevent that called free form of testosterone which is the one that has most of the actions in the brain and body and the major take away from the study was that time restricted feeding of the same amount of calories as the called control condition same calories but either compact throughout the twenty fir cycle to in eight hour feeding window or allowing them to eat over a larger feeding window did lead to significant decreases in free testastron and i think a number of people will raise their eyebrows to that and think oh will then may be time restricted feeding is not for me their number of important considerations of course one is while they decrease in free testosterone was significant it is also get indeed on were people start out if somebody has already low or modest levels of testosterone and it drops by ten or twenty per cent that could lead them into a state of poor performance in well being whereas if somebody has higher testosterone a decrease won't necessarily do that it is important to take that into consideration this is why ism always such a fan of people doing their blood work and knowing what is going on under the hood for them a very interesting change in hormonal profile was cortical called streshormon cops all of course is also naturally released early in the day in a healthy way to wake you up and promote alertness but you do not want its levels to be too high or to have peaks in cortex all late in the day such collar with depression in a number of other untoward things i would have thought that by restricting a feeding window to a particular time each day that these hard training cyclists would have undergone increases in seem cortical in fact the opposite was true they had significant re auctions in drum sort is all as a consequence of time restricted feeding i should mention there were significant reductions in serum sort is all also in the control group but not to the same extent and the two groups did differ significantly from one another now this is important because if you just look at one hormone testosterone you would say one based on these data time restricted feeding is reducing testosterone level significantly even though the number of calories is quite high in is held constant across the study but in fact because sort is all is lower it may mean that the effects of testosterone or the reduction in testastron is offset and that is because sort is all and testosterone are always in this a somewhat of a dance in terms of sort is all inhibiting the effects of testosterone largely and vice verse it is interesting and important to look at the total gallery of hormones and they did look at a number of hormones they looked at other inflammatory markers those were not increased that is not surprising if you remember back to the two thousand in twelve machine pandostudy this early pioneering study on time restricted feeding they saw reductions in stress hormones and in inflammatory markers in time restricted feeding mice and here this also seems to be the case in humans the take away is for sake of hormone health time restricted feeding is compatible with quality hormone health even in high performing athletes basted on everything we know and the we have discussed i would not suggests that people restrict their feeding window to less than eight hours specially if their training hard on a regular basis and it is not jobs athletes that should pay attention to this when we are working very hard when we are psychologically street when we are studying for exams or we are in conflict with somebody on a regular basis that creates a stress in the body that is very similar to that of physical training the body and brain do not distinguish between physical stress in mental stress it is all nervous system remember that its just sort is all in a adrenalin there is no special hormone just for physical stressverses psychological stress again in thinking about what sort of feeding window would be right for you we arrive back at this eight hour time ben that seems more or less flexible for most conditions even high performing in the athletes and i would say just bi logical extension even for people that have a lot of stress in their life and i personally would not suggest that people who have a lot of stress in their life or the potential for stress in their life shorten their feeding window much shorter than eight hours because then you would expect that you would start to increase some of the inflammatory markers you would increase the stress hormones and you would be decreasing things testosterone and estrogen some of the psexteroid hormones again it is all about context and the eight hour window it is not holly but seems to be a really useful guide to extract the great health benefits of which there are many in of which we have discuss from intermittent fasting time restricted feeding and yet that it could still be compatible with decent social schedules and for maintaining hormone health in keeping with this for women that are trying to maintain ovulatory cycles or for couples that are trying to get pregnant i think it is all important to not create a feeding window that is too short the relationship between feeding and body fat stores and glucose and leapt in and hormones is a well established one and we can sunrise it very easily here althoughi've done several episodes related to this previously on optimizing hormone health but basically we undergo puberty when there is enough food and there is enough body fat that the body fat sends a signal to the brain called leapt in that is a hormone that comes from body fat signals to the brain to turn on puberty that's puberty but even as adults for women that are menstruating there needs to be sufficient leapt in signaling to the brain in order to maintain ovulation because the way that the brain communicates with the pituitary in the ovaries similarly for men fasting or extreme exercise plus fasting we now now reduces testosterone its impacts are not exactly clear however if you reduce food intake either in total calories or in duration too much you will suffer a drop in sperm counts fertility will drop and this makes sense the body is communicating to the brain whether not conditions are sufficient in the body to reproduce and to presumably and hopefully support the health and well being of those offspring there is a logical link between body fat and eating and how much food is available to you and how long it is available to you and the signals in the brain that a low for reproductive success there are some data that pointed differences in the effects of interment fasting for males verses females those date right now only come from mice that study was published by stotchan paned a recently we still await the studies in humans some people do not do well on interment fasting either in terms of mood or hormone health and everyone needs to determine for themselves whether not having time restricted feeding window is good for them how long that time restricted feeding window should be i think eight hours is on of a nice minimum to adhere to based on everything that we have covered to day an for some people time restricted feeding is not going to be compatible with hormone health for them for then eating more meals spread throughout the day presume smaller meals sing color intake is going to be more beneficial for their hormones this is something that is going to be individual and its going to have to be determined on an individual basis however if you are going to try time restricted feeding i do one remind you that taking a period of three to seven or ideally ten days to transition into it not just going flipping from eating to three male a day that stand from six a m to ten p m and suddenly going to an eight hour feeding window but rather winnowing down that feeding window about an hour or per day is going to allow hormone systems of your body including lept in the hyprocret nerecson system which are systems within the body that signal to the brain that food is about to come allowing those systems to adjust that you are not overwhelmingly hungry irritable and you are not throwing your whole hormone system out of wack i keep coming back to this eight hour feeding window and i want to provide a little more basis for it and just to encourage that it is not complete the arbitrary the lengthy review that i mentioned earlier feature's a number of studies that have used this eight hour feeding window but there is a particular study that the highlight mainly cause i do not expect people to delving to the full reference list of the other review and this is a study that was carried out between such and pandas lab and christopherities lapses is a collaboration the study was carried out inhuman and is entitle effects of eight hour time restricted feeding on bodyweight and metabolic disease risk factors in a beast the the adults excuse me and this study a mentally showed all list read the conclusions that an eight hour time restricted feeding produce is a mild colonic restriction and weight loss without carry counting that is key right these people are not carry counting somehow just by adhering to an eight hour window they are taking in fewer calories than their burning off and clinically it reduced blood pressure i mention the study not because there are not many others involving the eight hour feeding window also in humans but because the eight hour feeding window has been tested in jobs adults and bonobos adults and there are even a few studies in children this eight hour window seems to be a really good rule of thumb and a kind of anchor around which we can each think about incorporating time restricted feeding there are of course other patterns of feeding and while some people have engaged in longer fasts of twenty four hours thirty six hours or more alternate day fasting meaning eating one day not eating the next day or in some cases eating one day and eating very few calories five hundred or six hundred calories the next day has been tested a few studies have also looked at eating a sort of maintenance level of calories for five days and then taking two days and fasting clear through or eating very few calories three hundred or five hundred calories in fact there is a a sort of a community on line of people that are exploring longer fast for sake of trying to offset do geisha o reverse effects of dementia thus far at least in my awareness there is not any quality clinical pure reviewed study on that yet for sake of domensha although i await those studies and if any one's aware of them a pile send me a link in the comments but alternate day fasting has gotten the called safe bill of health this has been written up meaning that people didn't suffer bone loss they did not suffer any major detrimental effects it does seem that it can n create significant weight loss and can help with ones individuals that it can reduce resting blood glucose and every other day fasting in many cases can produce more rapid effects on weight loss and reductions in blood locos than time restricted feeding however every other day type fasting for most people is not going to be feasible there just not can be able to do that for a long period of time and what has not really been done is the follow up to see whether not people who do every other day fasting or five days of eating followed by two days of fasting whether not that leads to a rebound in weight gain whether not that leads to a rebound in blood locos et camera for now they it hour feeling window and time restricted feeding seems to be the most tested supported in animal studies and in human studies and the one around which i think most people should orient if they are considering getting into time restricted feeding it is also sort of hard to imagine how one could include a significant exercise schedule or work schedule on every other day fasting remember in any study people are often being compensated or at least are in centivised in some way to adhere to the study this is one of the major issues that i have with any study that says that three or four different diets are essentially equal in terms of their ability to produce weight loss adherence is very different in the outside world where you do not have a research or monitoring you were your not losing all your food most people do not do that consistently and we can take a low bit of a neuroscience perspective on this to try and arrive at what the bast kind of or organization of eating plan or if we wanted to call it a diet we could would be for you many people find it easier to just not eat for certain periods of each twenty four hours cycle than to eat smaller portions portion control is very hard foursome people other people it is manageable but bull me i do not eat half the crescent i do not think it is a real thing it is not a is not available to me i should say now of course i could eat just half a crescent but i notice that when i eat the crescent because they are delicious that it creates arise an blood glucose arise in the other hormones and chemicals that are associated with investing delicious highly palatable food and it is rashly a lot of work for me to just eat half the cresset there something that is much more thoroughly satisfying about eating the entire present and actually there is something that somewhat satisfying about not even the croissant at all and just knowing that later i can eat the whole croissant now that to me other people find that they do not have any trouble with portion control that for them just eating small bits of food throughout the day is what sets them in the right psychological in physical state for sake of work et camera and i mention work and mental focus because one of the aspects of fasting that have drawn a lot of people to time restricted feeding and fasting is the clarity of mind that people get when first of all they do not have to think about when they are going to eat because they know when they are eating window begins they also do not have to think about regulating their behavior because they already know when they are going to eat and when they are not going to eat whereas when you are restricting portions you actually have to make decisions all the while and i think i many people decide well is that exactly have for could i have another wrung on the chressant this kind of thing i do not negotiate with food that is why i of a time restricted feeding window i know ism going eat for in my case i use a ten hour feeding window or some and it'll eat the whole crimson i just do not have to think about it now the food choices that you make coincide of that feeding window are of course also going to be very important certain foods will increase blood luck such that you are going to get hungry and hungrier others will maintain lower blood locos and will allow you to be a more controlled in the foods that you pursue those are all individual considerations that are deserving of their own entire episode but i do want o point out that the advantage of time restricted feeding is that it involves a lot of the decision making in the brain the called go no go circuitry's of our basil ganglia if you want to know this arias that control them any time we have to restrict a behavior that is called a logo any time we engage in a behavior that is a go no go behaviors require a lot of what is called top down control and it is very metabolically demanding and time restricted feeding allows you to depart from the whole no go go negotiation that you have to undergo when you have to restrict portions and i think this is a reason why many people have gravitated towards time restricted feeding and why for people that do not want o have to think about all that which us very straight forward one of the more hot button issues out there is whether or not given equal amounts of colonic in take and equal amounts of activity and equal amounts of nutrients et camera whether or not restricting food to a particular window basis more weight loss toward fat loss verses loss of other tissues cause of course when we lose weight we can lose that from any number of different storage sites within the body muscle water gliadin or fat now this is such a hot button issue that i almost do not want to get into a but mom to get into anyway because they are data that are very interesting this is covered in the review that i mentioned earlier that describes how if people follow a time restricted feeding schedule for long periods of time sixty days or longer there some metabolic changes in the way that people metabolize energy that do seem to shift the system toward more fat loss relative to burning of other tissues when in a state of colonic restriction and i want to say when in a state of colonic restriction because there is really no way to cheat the system there is no way that you can invest far more calories than you burn or excrete when i say excrete i certainly do not suggest this but that believe is and other people that of in disorders will use laxatives that a way to eliminate food quickly from their systems to it cannot be converted into fat or other forms of energy that is a very in that case it is a pathological situation but in general calories in verses calories but as i mention earlier as this kind of foundational element but in states of colonic restriction meaning submaintenance take time restricted feeding does seem to bus more of the energy burned to compensate for that deposit from fat and the way it accomplishes it is very interesting it turns out that it drives more fat loss by way of increasing a hepatic lipase this is something called all c hepatic means of the liver and lipase which any time you hear a s e is means it is an ends in it seems to increase hepatic lipase it increases the engine that metabolizes fat for lipolysis and energy production and reduces something called side c i d e c which is a lipid droplet associated and lipolysis inhibiter now that is a mouthful none intended but what side really is this lipid droplet associated molecule is it can inhibit lipolysis extended periods of time restricted feeding meaning ait our feeding window or ten hour feeding window that is obeyed for several months or more seems to allow the system to shift told burning more fat or rather using a higher percentage of fat when in a colonic deposit now i doubt that this is on a resolve the truly barbed wire almost hair ball ridiculous on line debates about whether not time restricted feeding is better than another feeding schedule look i do not think any particular feeding schedule is wholly if you are sub colonic meaning fewer calories burned than calories in busted you are on to lose weight but the day does seem to point to the fact that if you do time restricted feeding for a fairly long duration of time and you maintain that that you are increasing these lipases that increase lipolysis energy use from fat and you are decreasing the lipid droplet associated lipolysis and hitters it is both a your removing the break and your pressing on the accelerator of fat loss i think that this logically points to a case in which using time restricted feeding with a sub colonic intake seems to be at least to my mind the most scientifically supported way to in sure that a significant portion of the weight that one loses is from body fat stores any discussion about fasting would be incomplete without a discussion about what does and does not break a fast however there is no black and white answer to that question and you should immediately understand why it is because eating and not eating are not equivalent to fed and fasted it depends on when you ate how much you ate and where you are in your circadian cycle we can actually arrive at a simple answer to whether not something breaks the fast or not now the technical way to go about this would be to wear a continuous glucose monitor and to ingest little bits of food of different kinds or large amounts of food of different kinds and measure blood glucose because ultimately blood glucose is the read out of whether not your system is in a fed or fasted state there are other parameters to of course but that is the dominant one in far as the scientific literature says drinking water will not break your fast drinking teed will not break your fast drinking coffee provided it is black coffee will not break your fast in jesting coffin in piliform will not break your fast there are other things that will not break your fast for instance eating one peanut when deep in a fasted state will not break your fast eating a whole handful of peanuts might not even break your fast if you are in a very low luck state however if you just finished a meal that included carbohydrates or it was a very large meal of any kind an hour ago yes indeed eating one peanut could break your fast it is all contextual that is what is really important understand unless you are going to wear a continuous glucose monitor and unless you are going to wear a continues glucose monitor and set an absolute numerical threshold for what it is to break your fast i think there are some simple rules that we can follow first of all anything that involves sugar in particular simple sugars can potentially break your fast and there is actually a study on this which shows that if people in jest even one one gram of sugar post dinner if they had a full meal for dinner that can actually disrupt the expression of some of the circadian genes related to fasting and to sleep and sleep related fasting now that is pretty extreme it is almost con a scary to think about but that is how sensitive our system is if we already have somewhat elevated blood glucose from a meal that we ate an hour or ago whereas if we have run for an hour or trained hard high intensity training and we have not quite reached the beginning of our called feeding window will eating a small amount of food take us out of that fast well depends with the food is if it is mostly fat probably not a number of people out there now days talk about called fat fasting fat fasting is away can a regal past the stringency of either eating or not eating as a black and white rule for feeding window her sis non feeding window some people will in jest medium change triglycerides called excites or people will ingest fats only until their official feeding window begins these are a sort of how the negotiations that people carry out tend to go but of fat of course will not increase blood glucose and insolent as much as carbohydrates will proline will have sort of i and intermediate effect and as i mention earlier in jesting carbohydrates with some fat will tend to blunt the rise in glucose and will extend the duration over which glucose is released we really cannot say food acts or beverage acts breaks a fast however at the extremes we can say that for instance if you drink a can of soda pop unless you just ran and ultra marathon you are breaking your fast yet a piece of pizza your reading your fast if you eat purely fast maybe probably not if you have been fasting for five hours or more strictly fasting for five hours or more you can start to see where there is a lot of will room in ate very contextual and this is why any post that you see or any information that you see that something does or does not break your fast that does not place it in the context of when the last time you eat and what you eat and your activity and your time within the circadian clock schedule of twenty four hours it is a sort of meaningless discussion in general i think what is really useful if your nock in aware continuous glucose monitor is to try and be fairly strict about when you initiate your feeding window and when you stop your feeding window and as time evolves and you establish a more regular routine of eating certain kinds of foods and not others that are right for you cause as have emphasized before on this podcast and i will continue to emphasize quite work strait for some people vegetarian quite works grate for some people carnivore diet work scrap for other people some people are omnivores some people are carnivores some people are vegan all of that is great and fine by me everyone has to establish what is right for them to day we have really by past the discussion about foods of a particular origin or type animal based or plant based but all the same rules apply within this thing that were call intermit in fasting or time restricted feeding what breaks a fast will depend and what you want to eat or what you are willing to eat that is a totally separate manner from when you eat but as we've establish when you eat is vitally important some of you are probably wondering whether or not artificial sweet nurse or non artificial plant base sweet nurse stein break a fast this will vary somewhat and i have to say the date on this are somewhat mixed there is evidence that when people in jest artificial sweet nurse that it can create a transient increase in blood glucose followed by a transient decrease in good glucose below base line this is thought to explain the increase in hunger caused by ingestion of things ascertainment solos and things that sort there are not a lot of good studies exploring the plant based non sugar sweeteners things stein even things monk fruit which is a separate category to itself there are no lot of studies on this i think most people need to establish this for themselves the best way of course would be to wear continuous glucose monitor to go into a fasted stayed of either one hour or two hours or may be ye been fasting all night and then in just stein and whatever form you want or coffin whatever form you want with solos or aspartame et camera setting aside the discussion about the effects of these things on the up microfilm which is a different topic entirely i thing it is fair to say that in moderation the plant base non sugar sweeteners stein in particular stein seem to have a minimal impact on over all blood glucose when considered over a fairly large time been aspartame surculose sacring i think we can say more less the same but as soon you get into a discussion about those you else have to get into a discussion about some of the evidence published in nature and other excellent journals now pointing the fact that when consumed in excess not when consumed in moderation but when consumed in excess that those might have some detrimental effects on the got mycrobaio do artificial sweeteners break a fast depends on the amount depends on the type and in general i think your probably o ka provided that you are not indulging in them too often however some people just by virtue of tasting something sweet feel a spike in their appetite that makes it harder for them to adhere to the feeding window and this is why you can imagine that a really well controlled study on this would be very hard to carry out and ism not really sure that it is worth our tax dollars to actually design and carry out a study that because there would be much individual variation in terms of discipline in adhering to the feeding window whether not people experience increases and drops and blood glucose how that impacts them whether not their exercising it just becomes an infinite variable space as we say on experimental science you really have to determine that for you but i do not think that we can fairly say that artificial sweeteners break fast i think that would be incorrect to say earlier we were talking about glucose disposal agents both behavioral and compound base things met foremen an barbering in in fact cinnamon is even a mild glucose disposal agent can actually reduce blood glucose lemon and lime juice believe are not can lower blood glucose you may have experiences before of eating something very very sweet and almost feeling kind of overwhelming on a poisoned by how sweet it is especially you are not accustomed to eating a lot of sugary things one quick remedy for that is actually a half lime or half lemon squeezed into juice and drinking that just by virtue of the taste and by virtue of the fact that it will reduce blood glucose you will notice that that effect almost immediately disappears that is not magic that is the effects of acidity on blood glucose levels there are number of things that can adjust blood glucose there it miserly i postal agents there not sweeping it out of the blood stream in the same way that barbering or mat formal wood or that high intensity exercise at the appropriate times of baywood but there is one particular thing that one can invest that can help manage psychologically and performance wise through the fasting portion of the intermit fasting and get you to your feeding window and that is salt have talked a little bit about this on the pod cast before but because neurons use salt sodium end potassium and magnesium the called electrolytes in order to perform their magic of chemical an electrical signaling everything you do depends on chemical electrical signaling and all that chemical an electrical signalling requires electrolytes in some form or another neurons on on the passage of ions sodium in and out of their selmembranes i should say across their salmembrianes to be accurate many people find that the kind of lightheadedness the shakiness that is a costume with having slightly low blood sugar can be offset by taking a half teaspoon or of sea salt or even just a tiny pinch of salt and putting into some water and drinking it some people find because of the glucose lowering effects of acidity that if their feeling kind of shaky and not well and they put some a lemon juice into water and drink that it drops their blood locos further there is a common practice nowadays that is discussed on the incident of waking up drinking some water with some a lime or lemon juice in it with a little pinch of salt i think that little pinch of salt is a good idea what is it doing how is it offsetting all this well salt water actually has a mild effect as a glucose disposal agent but it it has a stabilizing effect on blood volume and because sodium brings with it water and the called similarity of your blood in your body depends on the salt levels in your blood and brain and body many people find that if their feeling shake their feeling light headed they cannot concentrate they think they meant sugar or food but what will actually remedy that is some salt and i know number of people that have incorporated this practice and have written to me and saying oh and if i just take a litigate assault in some water they mayor may not include the lemon or lime juice they immediately feel better and find that it is actually quite straightforward to get out to that to wait until the feeding window kicks in this is a specially true for people that are using caffeine because when you invest coffin you actually street a lot of water has a diabetic effect and with that water goes salt it actually causes you to excrete sodium now the roll of sodium in blood pressure and hypotension is quite controversial science magazine one of the prefer scientific a journals out there had a special issue all about salt some years ago talking about the research around hypertension indeed people with chronic my pretension or high blood pressure or very high blood pressure in particular o be wary of in jesting too much sodium but for most people in busting sodium provided they drink enough water and they do not have chronic my pretension or high blood pressure is actually beneficial that does not mean sou be drinking sea water does not mean you should be over indulging in salt but many people find that they can manage they're mental and physical state and even feel really terrific real clarity of mind and really enjoy their fast when they are investing sufficient salt and all it requires really a small pinch of salt that daily himmilaner see salt if you want to get fancy about it but table salt would be fine and just drinking that in some water maybe with lemon limes use to offset the taste a little bit can really stable eyes ones bidders and can stabilize the mind and you might also notice can offset that turning and yearning in appetite where you cannot imagine going another five minutes before eating something suddenly feel o we and that has to do with a lot of the effects of blood volume caused by investing salt an the appropriate amounts in other words sometimes you think you need food but what you really need a salt and salt can make you feel better immediately it'd to mention to excellent zero cost resources if you are going to explore time restricted feeding or may be if you already are young time restricted feeding i have no affiliation to either of these the first is the website that i mention before my circadian clock which is the weight hosted by such and panda and colleagues there lot of resources there where you can log your food and take get information about time restricted feeding all the science the ongoing studies et camera the others the called zero a that makes it very easy to mark when you are beginning your feeding window and when you are ending your feeding window and in doing marking when you are beginning your fast and ending your fast where at least initiating the beginning of the unfed state as we could more accurately call it it is a terrific a have used it from time to time i do not tend to use it in an ongoing basis ah because ism just sort of use to eating in a particular time of day now but any time have shifted that window for instance of feu weeks ago i started moving that preaching and take and my entire feeding window earlier in the day a and because that take some attention on my part cause ism not used to doing that ah have ben using the hero a and i it quite a lot at logs your progress and it gives you averages and you can see how many other people are fasting again totally zero cost i actually do not know who owns that a but am i think they done an excellent job the interface is really terrific an as far as i know it is available for apple and android but it is at least available for apple phones which is a tepophonei happen to have check those out my circadian clock a just put that into guru you will find it and the zero a both excellent zero cost resources in a moment it'd to re view the parameters of a ideal feeding schedule for you and give you the variables that you can plug in to your life style in your preferences there are couple of things that i would place into the category of frequently asked somewhat odd but still worthy of discussion for instance people have asked will brushing your teeth with toothpaste break your fast i think unless you are swallowing the toothpaste no now if you really want to run out and get a continuous glucose monitor and brush you teeth and you can valuate that but no people have asked will a half glass of wine after dinner couplhouers after dinner break your fast absolutely it absolutely will and it is been demonstrated to do that based on the one graham of sugar can of ere or carry a fact that i talked about before scary ere because o it just seems one gram of sugar how could it do that but these are metabolic processes and they are very sensitive post meal a few months back i did in experiment wearing a continuous glucose monitor and i got a surprise when i discovered that going into a sand increase is my blood glucose quite a bit it actually spikes it as high as a meal and then it tends to drop back down to baseline or even slightly below baseline afterwards when i talk to people about this somebody said oh it is data be that the continuous glucose monitor was getting destructed by the heat in the sand that is actually not the case turns out that when you go in a sand because you dehydrate your losing water i was not drinking water and your dropping a lot of water the concentration of sugar in your blood actually goes up and actually a put these at out on in a social mediopost on twitter and people were kind of shock to see how much a sand can spike your blood glucose now i do practise time restricted feeding internment fasting ism not superscript about it i use a kind of eight to ten hour is window ah either early in the day or late in the day i saw this effect of the sand personally the psychological and physical health effects of the sand are valuable enough to me that i continue to use it i do just not concerned about this increase in blood glucose to the extent that ism gin eliminate sand i to use the sand three or four times a week before sleep a use it an hour two before sleep and yes indeed it creates this big spike in blood locos that then drops based on change in the concentration of blood sugar ism just not gin ta worry about it now if your concerned about blood luck spikes then you might be worried about it but in my case it was one of those things where was interesting and it was worthy of discussion i thought because it was somewhat surprising to me although it makes perfect sense why this would be the case but at the end of the day literally it just make sense for me to get in the sand o case and now you have heard a lot of science you've heard a lot of examples even a few anecdotes and let us come up with the ideal intermit in fasting a c a time restricted feeding schedule for you and when i say ideal i mean what are the variables that are negotiable what are the ones that are non negotiable what is ideal for you will depend on the context of your life and what you are willing to do consistently first of all we established based on the discussing with such in who is truly the premiere world expert in this area who knows the animal and human scientific literature better than anybody has written this incredible review and for whom i consulted that you do not want to invest food for at least one emphasize at least sixty minutes post waking up second you want to avoid investing any food of any kind even one grim of sugar remember this is the ideal one grams of sugar even would be too much for the two to three hours prior to bedtime he also mentioned ideally you are spending eight hours in bed i can tell you that earlier i save that for now but ideal you a sleeping that entire eight hours but simply by being in bed for that eight hours and avoiding food after waking for an hour and before bed for two to three hours you starting to build out the duration of this fasted period remember that the sleep related fasting is particularly important for the health benefits of time restricted feeding again the sleep related fasting is especially important because of all the cellar fair processes that occur in the liver in the gut in the microfilm in the brain all over the body and because of the way that that coordinates the expression of the clock cheers that are then going to wick out and have many other positive effects on health including wait and fat loss but in addition to that liver health et camera in eight hour feeding window as a target seems to be the best target feeding window at least by my read of the literature and in discussing it with shut such in shorter feeding windows fort to six hours tend to lead to over eating and potentially increases in weight one meal per day type eating do not seem to do that but those are special cases in that most people cannot adhere to one meal per day types schedule at least not on a regular basis in its not very compatible with most social schedules although some people may be able to adhere to that in a straight forward way but their aren't any robes studies exploring the advantages of one meal per day if you feel there are advantages of one meal per day for you as opposed to an eight hour feeding window will then by all means use a one meal per day approach or use a for to six hour feeding window and just make sure you do not over eat in that window remember that most people ten to not adhere to the eight hour feeding window they say eight hours but they tend t eat outside of they eight hours a little bit on each side if your goal is a ten hour feeding window you might want to set it to nine hours or eight hours if your goal is six hours you might want to set it to seven or eight hours and this is simply based by signs a simply this is based on thousands if not ten of thousands of human subject data points that such and colleagues have collected regular placement of the eating window or feeding window every twenty four hours is important you do not have to be absolutely rigid and neurotic about this but you do not want it sliding around on the week end that it starting two hours later and ending two hours later a couple days a week because then you start to offset many of the positive health effects that have been demonstrated for time restricted feeding remember if you eat your food within a certain feeding window but that feeding window shifts by a couple hours it is effectively jetlagging your system it is effectively travelling a couple times on over eating there for a few days and coming back when in fact you are not travelling that is because of the way that food adjust these circadian clock gives now you can offset some of that through the use of light and have talked extensively about how to use light in previous podcast but again early morning and all day bright light exposure as safely as you can ideal from sunlight not through window et camera avoiding bright light in the mill the night extremely important for mood offsetting metabolic dysfunction et camera not incidentally such in's early work was he was one of the three to discoverers of the cells in the eye the called melons and cells that set the central circadian clock he was a pioneer in that field which led him to be pioneer in this field and on when should that eight hour window be placed within each twenty four hour cycle will let us talk about ideal ideal if you really want to maximize all the health benefits of time restricted feeding you need to extend the fast a round sleep on both sides you would place it smackdab in h mill the day it would be a schedule in which you started eating for instance at ten a m and you stopped eating at six p m an absolutely dreadful schedule for any one that wants to have some semblance of a normal life in my opinion it is not really compatible with most schedules though some people might be able to do it maybe you and your family or your friends your your eating a late breakfast or a and then you are having a latish lunch around two p m and then you have dinner at six and then assuming that you go to bed around nine thirty or ten p m that is going to extract the maxim amount of wait related bodyfat related metabolic fact or related aspects of time restricted feeding some people tend to fall into a category where they do best placing that feeding window later in the day and provided it does not run too close to your sleep remember you need a two or three hour buffer before your sleep where you are not investing anything that is in order to extract the benefits of time restricted feeding well then starting your feeding window at twelve p m an ending into eight p m pluserminus half an hour or day to day seems a perfectly reasonable schedule for some people starting at too p m an ending at ten p m will be that schedule of course you have to take into consideration when you exercise if you exercise princes i t exercise early in the day if i run or if i do some moderate or light intensity exercise regardless of what type of exercise it is i have no trouble waiting until my feeding window kicks in around noon or even two p m but if i do high intensity wait training for instance early in the day or if i run prince and i do that at seven a m r eight a m by eleven a m i am very very hungry and it is hard for me to do other things concentrate et camera now am not faradic about my feeding window as i mention before i can let it expand and contract a bit around the eight hour mark and feel perfectly free to do that to where talking here in in ideals not in necessarily practicals but other people find that the very hungry when they wake up early in the day if you are one of these people or your somebody who really is trying to emphasis hypertrophy or maintenance of muscle then it does seem that investing proline early in the day is beneficial that it can be more readily converted into muscle tissue and this is been demonstrated and at least one study there is another study under way that is exploring this further for people that are really really interested in hypertrophy and building muscle will then time restricted feeding is usually not the way they go i inlet us be ones there are many people out there who are eating four or more meals per day and there doing that from seven a m until eight p m i realize that not everybody is over weight there is an city crisis indeed on the percentage of ability in non of call lady liver diseases just cosmic through the roof at least in this country and an other countries as well this country me in the best but other countries as well but there are of course people that are thing to rainwater who do not want to lose weight or who are trying to maximize physical performance or hypertrophy or things of that sort and of course time restricted feeding for them might be as long as ism awake i meeting and i i tip my hat to those people in just say provided you understand what you're doing and the burden than that places on some the other processes in your body if that is right for you than by all means pursue that another thing that we can add to this summary or key points related to time restricted feeding is the use of g locos disposal agents and or behaviors if you find that you have eaten too close to a period of time in which you would prefer to be fasting that is when a thirty minute brisk walk or even modest walk after eating can be beneficial investing some lemon sucker lime juice can help lower blood locos somewhat and then there are the things met foreman and berberine there even some supplements out there that combine things berberine cinnamon which can lower blood glucose and things a romeo an things that have a mild effect on blood glucose but berberine and met former are very high potency glucose disposal agents and i mention earlier why you would want or approach those with the appropriate level of caution and figure out the dosages for you and for some people the dosages will be zero milligrams is going to be ideal and then of course we discuss how making sure that you are investing enough fluids in particular water and salt especially if you are using caffeine in order to increase your levels of alertness regardless of where that coffin source comes from coffee to your otherwise that can cause the excretion of sodium and can lead to a kind of shakiness a light headdress a and the feelings of hunger that may or may not be related to blood glucose some people genuinely need to eat i certainly would not want to see people getting hypoglycemic to the point where its dangerous certainly if you are diabetic you and in fact for all people you should consult with your physician when exploring any major changes to diet or editions or subtractions of anything including supplementation but for most people maintaining relatively low to modest blood locos levels is going to be pretty healthy and will low all the passive effects of intermittent fasting to occur and when you find that reaching that start to the feeling wind is challenging that investing sodium can often stabilize your system mentally and physically and allow you to reach that window often painlessly and then as a final point as i mentioned earlier provided that they are consumed in lo no or modest amounts artificial sweetness or plant base non sugar non colonic sweet nurse do not seem to really impact blood glucose to the extent that it would quite in duo take you out of your fast but that fat fasting is something thatsgoing to be highly individual and that you arguing to have to experiment with for yourself and being able to recognize when your in a fast and when you are out of a fast at a subjective level and not constantly having to measure your blood glucose ere do things of that sort can be beneficial and i think if you watch for the feelings associated with eating and post eating foods of different kinds in different amounts and you watch for the feelings associated with being fasted for long periods of time or short periods of time of having got in sufficient sunlight of having trained hard or not trained hard earlier that day et camera you can do the most important thing which is to start to learn to evaluate your own system to run simple safe experiments on your system in a way that allows you to really establish the ideal nutrition scandal for you whether it be time restricted feeding a ka

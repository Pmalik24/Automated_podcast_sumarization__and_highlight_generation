well this week amidst all of the domestic political hub up here in the united states the world economic form is happening over at divas now why exactly is the world economic forum important with a do facts to over you to busiould check out for all the background an the u e f but the short story is this in nineteen seventy one there was a organization that was established by a final class show who is a german engineer economist and professor with a mes on villain accent he created this organizations that heads of business and heads of state could talk over what he called stake holder capitalism stokehold a capitalism with was a theory he was expressing that essentially suggested that if you owned a company you ought not to answer to your shareholders if you manage to company you ought not answer to prophet martian or shareholders instead you ought to answer two every stakeholder in the world meaning governments meaningpeople w did known stock in your company meaning every one now you might ask yourself well then exactly where you accountable to because it turns out that the panda who does known shares in your company cants actually fire u or sell your stock or change anything bout the way you run your company and the answer that classhaw would rabbis you are answerable to no one you as the head of a company should be a king with his own little kingdom you was that of a company you should be a lord and the company acts as your fiefdom and you can pretend that your acting in the name of the general will but really what you are is some sort of profit from on high brought to spread your vales and this was the basis of stakeholder capitalism now this theory was promoted the what was called the european managements in podium that is wit the e f was originally called in nineteen seventy one by nineteen seventy five this thing grew fast that eight hundred and sixty participants including the c es and chairman of the largest european companies started showing up and that same year only four years after creation the e european management form the m f was now partnering with the united nations according to the w f website itself after five years the form had gained acceptant that the highest levels of business and government will not advocating police strategy the form had become a respected organization that served as a valuable platform for business government civil society another stakeholders to confer and collaborate n nineteen even eighty seven the european management form changed its name from the e m f to the w e f what is the w e f to day well it is the same thing except bigger much more prominent ten thousand people show up at the w f every year bathe people who on stage the people who are meeting in the backrooms are all of the global influential people your me at the heads of major corporations and the heads of government and they all come to pat each other on the back and explore what they have in common what they have in common is a very peculiar set of values that you do not share with them to set of values that suggests that they are responsible for solving all f the worlds problems what are those world problems well problems war and piece they should collude and decide what system prevails everywhere problems intolerance they should collude and decide what in formation you are capable of seeing and under standing problems the climates they will get together and they'll restructure entire swathes of the local economy in order to fight back against climate change this is what they do and let us face it this a weird group people because the people at the top levels of power particularly in the west are a strange group of people they are just proportionately secular they are just proportionately of the political left they people who do not have tides to traditional ways of life and traditional values they are also people who seem to have scorn for the culture that actually bore them and instead have embrace this peculiar notion a mufti culturalism in which all cultures are created equal and that leaves to this really sort of paternalistic and of look at the w for people are walking in wearing five thousand dollar suits and twenty thousand dollar watches and then they are paying homage to poor native america or natives of rope forever who are showing up in breathing on them ill get to more on this in just one second first a you are ma there is not a day that goes by they do not call or test some one you care about i can't to t my family every dow do notary about all the rest you my

sort with her face painted breathing on the heads a various company owners heads of state top level bushcraft turns what a look it is weird gala a way why that i what hi like od is lace need dunderhead i thought they all hated cove bet apparently they love covet but again this all part of the show they hare about all of the stakeholders from the most remote natives to you we people and these can of ban knock offs except in the corrie garb they have come with all sorts of interesting in were ways to restructure the global system in order to run the thing in order to control you this is presumably why the and the world health organization were talking a lot over the course of this week about something they call disease acts now must be frank about this obviously every government has to have some sort of contingency plan in case the country its it by an epidemic and localities have such emergency plans but the w ho botched covenineteen damned badly that the notion they have any sort of leg to stand when they preach to the rest of the world about how exactly we should duel the future pandemic it starts to look was as though they are tempting to great a contingency plan and more their sort of wish casting something this into existence because they really loved the levels of control here was the head of the who tender us at honor gariisis who by the way massively works for the government of chine as we exploring just to moment talking about disease acts in preparing the globe for disease acts after we start o putting a a place holder you know the first that came was tin that is is ex is is covet we have experience now ten were preparing base on that experience a litlefusasment has been don by independent panes and and and and experts and based on the recommendation many e initiatives have we have what i started manynsiticts and then the other kin order to have better preset and caress that dis is is is the pandemic agreement the pandemic jurymen can bring all the experience all the chalks that we have faced and all the solutions in on and that ugryment can help us to a prepare for the future in in a better wit that is right all the people who failed dramatically during coven nineteen who covered up for china and who remember was a chines cut out china was actively hiding information from the rest of the world they knew this pandemic a spreading since about nonmember of twenty nineteen and they said nothing to the rest of the world than they like to the do so that it was not being transmitted human human and the w tho dutifully repeated all that because they wanted to keep china in the fold sponsoring the world health organization these shine people are still insisting that they ought to run things going for there is never any accountability because is the beauty of a stakeholder system as supposed we share holder system when you own a share in a corporation of the vote when you have a stake in something broadly speaking can means nothing you're now a stake in the w who you are of a share in the to the got no control over the w to and that is what they w have is really about by the way in exclusive from the wall street journal today who chines researchers isolated and maps the virus that caused cove nineteen and late remember twenty nineteen at least two weeks before nation revealed the details of the deal virus to the world congressional investigator said raising questions anew about what china new in the pandemics crucial early days documents obtain from the just department of health in human services by a house committee and reviewed by the wallstree journal show a chines researcher in basin a floated a nearly complete sequence of the virus destructor to a us government run can base remember twenty eight when nineteen chines officials at the time or to publicly describing the dis easy outbreak in what is a viral begonia of unknown cause they still had not closed the noon it seeled wholesale market sight of one of the initial clue in nineteen outbreaks and again china continue to life a full month that there was no dangerous human to human transmission the chines research who submitted the virus sequence doctor lily ran of the dashing based institute manage in by ally did not response when ye mu seeking comment well you will never hear of her again since her name has now been publicly report in the pass in china is an authoritarian tyrannical government w judge an amazing job and naturally this means the we have to continued to include them in the world system all the people botched it last time we are going to keep them in control dis these acts is one methodology of control other methodologies of control climate change there is language the people in less love to use when they are talking about controlling you and that is the language of war the war on poverty is about controlling income it is about controlling redistribution of wealth the war on climate change is similarly about controlling exactly how you live your life is why people in pox a constantly eager to use war language because in a war it is put your entire population on rations in a war yo unto draft people and put them in barracks in a war get to take control of literally everybody an all times day and night is why miscarry is eager to talk about war he compares climate change to fighting hitter is over the w e f ad am here again to day because ism convinced that the only way we win this battle is by stepping up exponentially from where we are to day and begin to treat this fight almost as if we were in war hate the war analogies a was we get tired of than the prove over use the fortunately it is a it is it is aft war or two when we needed to gain control over the skies of the ocean an learn had at penetrate witless defenses in order to in the battle of freedom it was mislabel facts we made look decisions at actually helped in the war again that sort of language ease he lever for exercising power now the was one wonderful moment during the w f how your delay who is become a spirit animal the president of argentina who is colorful and wonderful economist rock star and just all around wolf man he was speaking of the w f and he just laid into them and it was wonderful to not surrender to the you upon of the state e states of the is of the state is of troofthe of

stuff and good for hover delay going to the down slapping people across the head it is precisely what they deserve but it is not just the promise said the w y therefore plenty of people in the united states who hold this same peculiar globalist vision in which the leads office y ought to construct pretty much everything up to an including the demographic shape of the united states that is the only reason i can think why we continue to puts around over america southern border weight to more on this in just one second first put some prep in your stuff with good rancher's new year new meat special

apparently no compromises coming on emigration that is because the white house refuses two just pass h a to h a to is a strong on the border security bill from the house republicans instead there proposing a series of changes they would remain extremely soft on illegal emigration speaker might johns to his credit is refusing to go ahead with any sort of compromise border bill along lines the democrats are looking for according to the new times speaker might johns on weekday dug in against president n bit's efforts revive starve legislation to send ad you crane saying the re publican light house would not entertaining unless democrats agree to a far morse of your crackdown at the just medical border than the have been willing to consider he said i told the present when have ben saying for many months it shag you have must have change the border substance of policy change we must insist the border be the top priority hell jobidon had summon the law makers in both parties to lecture them about u crane about the importance of repelling russia invasion but he refuse to actually commit to any serious changes at the border meanwhile some of the senate republicans are ready to cut any sort of deal apparently sent a republicans said they are hopefuls under much minor of century whose fairly soft on emigration the senate could vote as soon as next week on a national security spending bill combining border measures with military assistant for crane and israel as well it seems to me that what is being proposed in the senate is far too weak for republicans in the house two signor to leading set a republicans are saying that to the best chance the get pe has had n years to secure serious word policy concessions from democrat but i really doubt that i think that jobidon is willing to cave more than he has thus far what exactly is being proposed at this point hell something called the dignity act the called dignity act was originally brought up in twenty twenty three by represent maria of car asylum a of flora minute delightful person but she is wrong on this bill and other postponers including people veronica scalar democrat of texts and again this is a fairly weak emigration bill it includes twenty five billion dollars for more borders securer barriers and technology and it does higher and train more personnel both regard to asylum reform it essentially says that there would be humanitarian compasses manage bi s b p along the southern border were migrants would be held asylum officers within conduct asylum interviews make final determinations on the compasses migrants would have access to medical staff linen social workers mental health professional hold advocates private organizations the provide humanitarian assistance and legal council under that bill within the first fifteen days the staff would provide in initial screening including criminal background checks by metric data verifiidentification conduct medical adjustments and migrant unable to establish a credible feed during i initial screening would be subjected to expedited removal from the united states then presumably asylum seekers would theoretically be held for another forty five days all those in clear to me whether the would ten be released into the united states because otherwise things are listen continued to swell at the border obviously one of the problems here is had u establish credible fear what exactly is credible fear look from a migration official with the staff of these humanitarian compasses according t the bill within forty five days of passing the initial credible fear interview a trained you a citizenship an emigration services asylum officer would a view the individuals asylum clamant make a final determination asylum officers must deny approve or after a complex or uncertain cases to an emigration judge basically you would end up with the same sort of backlog they currently have for those who are referred to an emigration judge the build then creator sister by which asylum seekers would receive a notice to appear and then be released from the humanitarian campus this would continue to maintain catching release wold just do in a more delayed fashion n then is currently being apply this is the reason why re publicans in the house are not willing to go forward with this it also creates worker status for legal immigrants hare already here in the country it is a very very soft bill which is precisely of course the re publicans are saying an keeps the border open to the question his why do not demicrastus cave there is moon they juscapef aren't they give republicans more of what they want get some sort of actual border compromise done in the bill they go back to their basin sillier we needed the you crane funding we needed it and we had to cave and ten they could go to moderates unsay we she did something to stop the flow at the boarder instead they keep doubling down on open borders generic and then there blaming republicans for conk on not wanting to fix immigration that tog gink an shun jo biding is onewho broke the emigration system beyond all repair here is command herristhy in top an advice presidents of the united states blaming republicans for failures on emigration everyone of a emigrations nitro re a the first bill that we top the first bill that we offer right after an operation what the fix emigration item be comprehends if plan to fill wit emigration t the the they have they have taken it up no we want fpolutia the positions are at hand but frankly serin a election er and the folks who wan a return oral from to the white house wit prefer to talk about a broken emigration the the the o fora thing on the files o theater at hand and engage a in by part thought but the solutions the want are in open border again they keep saying things this we need more processing in the border what they really mean is they want you allow more people to use the asylum system to get into the country until you change the actual rules with re hard to who is dedicated eligible for asylum nothing is actually going to change went t more on this in just one second first if you are looking to treat yourself this years you deserve nothing but the most ism talking about mommy john they are lounge o our underwear everything i see it is just the best stuff with over twenty million

private kin down tins to day do that is is too complicated to to right now o may be sure that we take care of our border is not to complicated it is not it is not if people come together in good fate as they have been doing in the senate we can get this time we can get ten not and let us not forget the present actually put forth a comprehensive emigration proposal almost three years ago very almost three years ago we have three years three years to work on something if that was what the sticker wonton is concern about we ha three years to work on it i mean and it was a terrible proposal you had three years to do something and yet did not do it and the reason you did not do it is because stay terrible proposal now whose that happening why is that happening the answer is a back the d u have there is in fact in a agenda to do away with america somthenborder and some democrats to more clear about this than others for example democratic representative mas frost who is a flora he says that if you want a char too which they way of solidifying the border changing the rules with regard to asylum for example why you really want to do destroy the statue of liberty is my favorite stupid rhetoric is this is this notion of the statue of liberty is somehow coincident with the constitution of the united states it has some poetry on it and that is it it does not dictate the policy of the united states being an open emigration policy it is absurd here is this democratic congress person saying the quit part you loud my colleagues on the other side of the isle let us be on us with emigrants who deserve better than what you are offering them do not welcome emigrants if you plant to reject them if you keep pushing your bigoted h a to bill than also pass this bill have taken the liberty of drafting it for you it removes the statue of liberty are larges symbol that tells people the come here this is who you are removing the fabric of america i wouldn't know which republican who supports and voted for h are too we will introduce this bill the own people tearing down statues by the way rat now our demography that is absurd alexanero cot cortex she of the keeping at the border over child operations but only one trump its president she's also saying inquired pied a loud which as they do want the open boarders they want those open bearers they want bad virtually every single member of this committee is here to day as a result of and thanks to more open yours emigration policies and the idea of flaming the door when we desperately meed these migrants when we desperately need it and what we need is an orderly process we want it is not that we do not meed or want folks to come it is that we actually have to make it easier for these individuals to participate in our economy get a job support themselves and live the america dream and what this what this conversation is about is about defending the america dream the america dream presumably is that there be no border whatsoever now again countries can have open emigration policies long as there economies are not giant welfare economies l on as there is the courage of your conviction with resold with regard to assimilation ins your culture you can have open borders under the circumstances that was in fact a policy of the united states in the light nine in late nineteenth century that sort of thing was part of america policy and did not destroy the country but once yo had a welfare state it changes all the mouth pretty dramatically and not only that once you an on that a multicultural notion that people do not have to learn english but they do not actually have to learn america customs in ways of life then of course the social fabric of the country is going to fray but aisle does not care abaft any that she is perfectly happy to see the social fabric of the country trade because she agrees with the base of premises of many of the people the you have to top down administrate of control over nearly every area of life is better for you and that borders are parochial borders are wrong of course that the world economic form not the national economic for him now there is still some democrats or soon to be former democrats who who acknowledge the reality about this mansion is one of them the senator from west virgin he says well of course the border is worse under by everybody knows that a what of the leaders of the present's reelection committee colas red bare yesterday as said jo bud up to nothing at the border and the borders better under jo by do you think that is a correct assessment that is absolutely false there living in lawlawland it is a disaster and they know it is to disaster let us fixity and anything i would implore the present to do to consider this and to do it immediately if congress can not come together because the perfect could be the enemy the good you have republicans that might want to shut everything down though a border a though a any type of emigration out the out the wind and you have real democrats who right think everything's far it is not fineness o disaster it is dangerous and i would impose the present to declare national urgency and secure our border immediately if congress cannot do something this week by the way it's worth noting here that emigration is a topis you for but democrat and republicans in the upcoming election which is just another reason why dona trump is running durably against a coming despite all of his legal troubles foibles and myriad accesses speaking of which there is a brand new pole out of it new samphire this is not a see lustrated america research scruple this pole is from the shine asylum pole of likely voters and finds the dona trump colonelcy has a fourteen point lead on nick daily in new samphire he is at fifty two per cent i ye hailyat thirty eight per cent in rondo mantis at six per cent as have suggested i think that true has momentum i think effectively speaking just based on the data the race for the geopenomination is over ma democrats have no strategy of course to dealidon from other than simply targeting him as the human being this of course is comely arras's plan here she as yesterday suggesting that she is scared attack she is running against the crazies of coronal trump what could happen of top have a became got forbid present an again and what are you going to do to stop the crazies i have cared at i ow its is him tat there i ta o there an all fang that the barely two ate to rat for office lethe without in upon it are scared on all of the plan fat we should all be cared o but as we known tolly this is a that table very powerful women man we do not run away for something a we scan we fight back the can as yer this is what we caught a little bit of strand treat here with the bouncing of the shoulders that is when that is when that she is bout to lay one on a real thick what is hilarious about all this of is of course if the entire pitch against true is leva are in competent side and folks in on the fact that donate trump is a big bad mean orange man that is not going to work jam diamond again jam diamond is not remotely radical republican the up organ yell he was asked yesterday about robin's campaign chaos like joined in a lot of trouble and demonizing man republicans is not going to help him and and i think people should be a little more respectful your fellow citizens and when you got have people a pair shows just bead not likely to binary thing your supointrup not sport o why you short to hate seventy five tough of your fellow bickers it u i agree the c any o the democrats to don a pretty good job with the deplorable we ogginots the bibles in the beer in their guns i mean really i could greet to stop that stuff for that should grow up and treat the people respect the listen to a l but the and i do think the come will effect i think this this neat of talk about ago is going to hurt bines a let hands a from jam diamond jimmy demon is not some sort of wild island he is bringing you cream pin on the err wile he is talking with hem as en b c talking about all this now democrats are banking again on donate trumps legal foibles to drag him down they are looking it polling the pulling from dipsos yesterday that pulling found that if dona trump weren't convicted of a felony crime by a jury an that mike ding him in the poles according t this poll fifty nine per cent of america say they would not vote for dona trump f you're convicted of a felony crime at by a jury is supposed to twenty five per cent who said that they would a majority republicans said they vote for trump fifty two to thirty one even if he were convicted of a felony crime democrats of course split eighty six eight against but there is no shock tor split eighty six indies from generally independents are t one really shift sixty six percent say they would not to for novel trump if convicted of a general crime if he is currently in prison even thirty nine per cents of republicans say where it connote for him if he is currently in prison sixty two percents of america over all thy would not v for none trump if he is in prison of the chance of him actually being in prison by the time we gets the election i think are incredibly low very very low based on appeals base on the the length of time it takes to actually do a trial i also think it some these poll numbers about being convicted of a felony crime by a jury endmost america do not even know what he is being charged with they did that he gets convicted of felling y miss handling of classified documents and that a bunch f inspans li void i will not over thank i any more i i just on i do not see that as being a a real huge concern for the trump campaign particularly because there are lot of obstacles that are coming down the pike for these various legal cases four example as political points out there is a case called josh fisher verses united states which the supreme court has agreed to hear in remember it does not explicitly mentions on a trumpet at could knock out a bunch of the canary sixth charges against trump at issue in that case is whether prosecutors and the parted of justice have been improperly using a two thousand to law originally aimed at curbing financial crimes to prosecuted canary sixth defendant in josh fisher should the outside with fisher would call in to question the use of the same law against other canary sixth defendants including trump smith's indictment against trump again carries four charges for counts two of those are for obstruction of an official proceeding and for conspiracy to do but that is all under say ban saran only the carbine's only act was originally designed to make it criminal to obstruct official proceedings of ours up government in financial scandals not with regard to for example the counting of the vote t of course dona trump taking legal means filing lawsuits or calling people on the phone and saying if you could theoretically get certified as an alternative state elector for your state would you go and talk about bad and washingtonly first of all the crime may not be crime second all the crime in this particular case may be completely in the wrong category and the supreme court could easily say carbine's only was never went to apply to dona trumps canary sixth activities as politico says the inactive fisher on the canary sixth trial against trump may not be known until after the supreme courtraps up its turn tune at which when could knock out half of smith's counts against trump meanwhile the other case is there that are currently in play for example the plan brag case manhattan that case is a joke that cases a joke thing about this way dona trump wright now is running an incredibly durable even campaign against obit right now he is up in many of the poles he is in the middle of his second defamation trial of eating carol and he is yelling at the judge mean literally yelling at the judge and no one cares literally yesterday there isn't exchange between trump and e judge in louis caplin in which the judge said mister trump has the right to be present here but that right can be forfeited mister trump i hope i do not have to consider excluding you from the trial and trump setback i would love it and caplin said i know you would i know you would you just cannot control yourself in the circumstances apparently it is a lari and noons can care about that his here is the no how is that can her trump has i get the answer is it is not because everything is baked into e set for will every single thing is baked into the cake except for the circumstances of the united states and that is not a not trumps control that is it abidance control and increasingly it is looking very bad weights more on that just one second particularly s n economic news first mayhap noticed wether aware we biology because there are only two sexes and that is obvious should be omens to everyone but some of our loyal customers point down a flaw in our germ's shop only hated to one of the sexes jerky's razors is all about equal opportunity to shop that woke free economy that is what we have jerky's razors for women because women deserve the same quality woke free blades as men two saxes two razors it really is that simple when god makes a new sects then i guess el have to make a new razor blue we have a line of personal carproducts for a better haves in putting moisturizing shave crane lotion body washing toy over ant ladies hat never to germ's razors not comrade now get your rase a in personal can products to day o can meanwhile i speaking of jobidons economy story out from waste journal to day and points out that we have a budge of economic trains coming down those tracts n we are tied to those tracks we now it is not thin be great an jobidon is a very very bad doubly do right according to the waster journal the troubling commercial real estate market is bracing for a record amount of maturing loans boosting the prospect of a surgeon defaults as property owners are forced to refine as at higher rates in twenty twenty three five hundred forty one billion dollars in at back by office buildings hotels apartments and other types of commercial real estate came do that is the highest mount ever for a single year according to date up for trap commercials that maturities are expected to continue rising with more than two point two tailband coming due between now and the end of twenty twenty seven most those loans have fare been repaid or extending in twenty twenty then twenty twenty three many owners were able to exercise one or to your extensions builds into their original loans but those extensions are now burning off there coming to that means many bowers have to confront that higher rate environment and that is depressing property values what happens when a bunch of for closers happen because people cannot afford the higher commercial lending rates what happens then we means some people can get laid off an means that in floated real estate prices are going two come down because again mobile's economy was always inflated and what goes up must come down and of course the problems are mounting for jobidon pretty much everywhere they are mounting with regard you crane as well according to twenty blinking a sense fire is nowhere in sight with regard to u crane which is kind of amazing because just a couple of months into the war a cease fire was actually on the board and ladmarpooten and ut backing aware a her further you cranial war action here was twenty blinking talking about how there is no sense fire imminent in e crane are we anywhere your ante minor negotiation o for o o take enters for not in this moment i do not see it a we are always open to it attentive to it because more than any one else do you cranial people office but there has to be a willingness on the part of russia to engaged to m go ad in good fat these on the basic principles that have been challenge bit regression ha well good luck with that meanwhile tomato officials are warning than things are going to get uglier before they get better in you crane according to the associate pass to crane is now locked in an existential battle for its our vital almost two years into its war with russia western armies and political leaders must drastically changed the way they h spit fend off invading forces according to a tomato military officer on wednesday as the war bogs down with the you us in european union running for your cranes conflict ravaged economy held up by political infighting this dato general is appealing for a whole of society approached to the challenge that goes beyond military planning he said we need public and private actress to change their mind set for an era in which everything was plantable for sealable controllable and focus on efficiency to an era in which anything can happen at any times that sound a great pitch for robin's administration that is the bumpersticker began twenty twenty four anything can happen at any time does that make you feel a sense of whyessent an internal an internal solidity does that make you feel secure mean the answer is of course not because why would not the world has become significantly more chaotic under join that is particularly true obviously not just you can but also in the middle east john curly has now been force to make the unfortunate statement that removing the whether the meiny who the from the terrorist in twenty twenty one which is just one of the things the body administration did to encourage cranial aggression that is actually was not a stupid move he has to say that because now now of course they are realizing the ho these isiterr agree are is john curb yesterday we i er a a a a a a i the no now is not a mistakes take them off we just had put to bacon but sure no not in

cameras the new occiputs in southern israel showing t life wielding government spring the new of dead is rails evidence beheading cementing and is rely new the mamas he is now a kin to ghat groups a kids on thalamic state sis mu seems say they might have some evidence for that proposition in fact that is not even the worst beheading story of the day according to a man named avid at thar his son ora a kid named a deer thar his son was i believe nineteen years old and he was marred on october seventh and then he was beheaded and apparently they then took his head back to gaze and tried to sell it i dearest father said i demanded to see the body they warn me against it but as a father i need to know every detail about my child's death half an hour before his burial the body arrived at the semiterin and open the casket i realize what burying he was unrecognizable as we buried i dear i knew i was in turning my child without his face wo in to keep searching for it the green father spent weeks searching for a lead i reviewed all that was in eventually found footing o my son missing a critical part of his body said avid three weeks ago during the interrogation of too compass terrorist arrested in israel they confess that one of them had attempted to sell my son's head for ten thousand dollars in gaze the idea then entered gaze search an ice cream shop's freezer and there an y suit case they found my son's head which had also been desecrated at least i was able to bury him with the little dignity that remains at clearly palistinian is daily pieces just over the horizon it is gong to happen any time now and probably that will make the onions calm down again anything can happen in any time as a very good slogan as it turns out for these twenty twenty four biding campaign because it feels anything can happen at any time meanwhile the supreme court is about to make a very critical decision that willing fact shift an enormous amount to power back to the legislature this a really big story that is going largely under the rat a betas a little complicated according to the washington post a divided secrete court treated weather and how to curtail the power of federal agencies on wednesday with liberals urging the court to ever to the judgment of government experts and conservative saying judges should not systematically favor government regulators over private companies industry or individuals in litigation after more than three hours of argument it was unclear whetherthe courts conservative majority would overturn or simply scale back the forty year old precedent that is under a view in a pair of cases brought by herring fishermen from new jersey and rode island very often the circumstances surrounding very important cases are really really small and peculiar basically there is a federal rule requiring commercial fishermen to pay for patsy monsters the court decision however is not really about that it is about weather federal regulatory agencies are capable of regulating huge swaths of america life or whether it turns out those regulations have to stand up to constitutional scrutiny conservatives have been targeting a framework that was set up in nineteen at for ut under a case called chevron you savers is natural resources defense council that case sat up something called chevron a deference which suggested that if the congress pass the law and the law was specific enough that basically regulatory agencies could then use their expert es to read the tea leaves they could sit there in roarshock test this thing and come up with giant books filled with regulation based on the vague language of statue and then presuemetly the courts would have nothing to say about it because if congress really wanted to do anything about it they could pass a new regulation taking that power away from regulatory agencies but they had not to therefore basically the the the courts could not sit in judgment on anything these regulatory agencies we are doing that of course is ridiculous that creates of truly perverse and cent give structure or congress these members are elected they pass much o vague laws there never held the countable because if something goes wrong it is not happening because of them ans happening because of the regulators regulators get to do whatever they want there is huge amounts of industry capture in the regulatory agencies if you are a regulatory agency and you are overseeing for example laws with regard to the sea major industries are going to get into the wood work and they are going to start reading those laws for you that is have many regulations are written and again congressmen are perfectly happen to kick the can over t the regulatory agencies it is up to the judiciary to maintain the balance of power the checks and bales that were set up in the constitution which is we chevron deference should die on wednesday justices bet catena and new corsage both nominees of present and trump took turns peering the bid administration with skeptical questions as solicitor general elizabeth prolonged defended the trump administration initiative and longstanding sheverun precedent cave said chevron has allowed federal agencies to flip flop an oppose different rules every time an new administration takes over leaving judges with little choice but to defer to the changing interpretations of agency officials which of courses very weird because if regulatory agencies can take positions that are directly opposed to one another and congress supposedly authorized both those positions to the same time how could that possibly be how could that be gorse has called long ago for getting rid of chevron references of course democrats are very much in favor of it because they believe in a autocratic and minis stative centralized government were elections do not matter much in the legist actor ranch where everything can be done by a powerful executive ranch this a model of government first push by work willow in the early twentieth century the notion of a autocratic administrative government of experts would administer the government on your behalf four the people looks very much that w f globalist centralized power idea except applied to the america government it will be interesting to see which way chief justice robbers and justice amiconibarat go on this one it is possible that what they do as they say we do not how this particular regulation is being pervade it is also possible tho get rid of chagrins deference entirely they should if you get rid of chagrins deference entirely the notion tat get regulatory agencies ought to be unanswerable entirely when it comes to her interpretations of statue by the judiciary hands weigh too much power to the executive branch of government a restoration by the ay of checks and balances in government where the legislature legislates and the executive ranch executes and the judiciary a indicates that would be the single best thing that could happen in the united states to restore any level of credibility in our government is right now we think congress is in competent cause they do not even do the legislating they pass giant omnibus packages and then we think the executive grabs too much power and thus is in competent because they've too much power over our lives and we did not let say anchovy touchy whose the autocratic administrator and then we think the judiciary just sits there and does nothing about any of this when the various branches of government do what they were supposed to do in the first place they reestablish their credibility that is why i would be excellent if the supreme court did get rid of chevron deference are not y coming up e going to jump into that vaunted benthic purusha mailbag

target takes a major market hit as conservative's boycott the mass of chain store new poles show donate thrums electability numbers of below water and the biding whorehouse you spending on climate as pelicans struggles to may the bills ism bent were of the sismench barely show the shows poster by expressly plan its time to stand up against piglet protect your dada expressivypiandacoms lash men there is a lot of talk these days about whether conservatives can win any more and that serious stalk considering that republicans have not one the popular vote in any presidential election since two thousand and four and before that since nineteen eighty eight as been a very long time since republicans regularly one popular votes in the presidential election and when you look at how republicans ran in the latest run of center races they really under ran where the umber should bin an lace house races they should have walked away with a far broader house majority there is always the serious question but whether conservatives cabin and the answer is yes but order to win concert give had to really follow the rules of salt kolinsky because those rules works all link of course was the community activist in chico who basically provided the ideological foundation for people hilly clinic and barokomama he were a book called rules for radicals in nineteen seventy one taken about how you go after your political opposition and one of things that he said is toy have to personalize every issue and if to polarize every issue and yet to put your your enemy on the wrong side of that polarization that is basically the goal what you do not want to do is make it easy for your enemy to polarize you what you want to do as make it hart for enemy to make you the target and make it really easy for your enemy to be the target that is the way the actually win and republicans conservators have shown that they can when when they actually followed that rule when they actually personalize and polarizing that is what they did with for example target fascinating the report out from the wallstry journal title target much by light is stung by culture wars target discovered the lost of it and caught in the middle of hotbutton social issues in politically divided united states sails it both businesses from target to by light suffered over marketing efforts the back fired and caused shoppers on both sides of the topics to call for boycotts and his er bush came under fire for a social made promotion with a trains gene influence for target was criticized for store displayed merchandize for pridemonth that included general neutral swims then when each companies were to backed office original point the eld you be tea cue plus of idea by sine community divided that they were going to boycott in return targets had shopper back lash over its pridemonth collections whilst cautious consumers push sails sharply lower in the most recent quarter the retailers said it expects sales to do cline again in the current quarter and lords prodigal for the full year executives said hey would still mark pridemonth next your with a more focus assortment of merchandise that would be a conserve if win that is a major corporation that is backing off of much of it social push for wild leftism an gain if you look it targets sales change year over a year what you find is in first quarter of twenty twenty two they had about three per cent increase in sales over the prior year in second quarter twenty twenty to bout two per cent third quarter over to per cent fourth quarter thy were down to about point five per cent first quarter of twenty twenty three there are about zero per cent petty much flat and then second quarter absolute collapse you see an almost negative six per cent growth rate over the prior year which he is a massive sales drop off the stock had fallen about sixteen per cent this years through tuesdays close back each surrounding the pride question aid into sales particularly in tune after target sale a started selling the annual collection stales recovered seedily in jury according to trying cornel whose target's long titrate chief executive it is an multiple economic press runs are putting pressure on consumers a target coppers continue to spend less on a panel home goods and other discretionary items in the midst of high presses for food another a central part of this is jobidons in stationary economy but a lot of this actually is politics andtheway that you can tell that is because retell rival cha acts which owns techs man martial and gumwoods a she sought six per cent jump incomparable sales in the same quarter and raisetet sales growth at propetargets for the year send the words munch people who were going to target instead when to cha man marshals and home goods by the way my family is one of those family use to go to target almost every sundae to pick up to necessary household items we stop going tor went to palmar instead in may target offered pride products for sales at house for the past ten years but this time they decided to go with a very aggressive pride display those targeting children and consumers reacted and that consumareaction tanks their sales and here is the thing in politics in markets it does not take a mass movement in order to effectuate change all that r queers is they consorted quarts of people for willing to take a hard stand and a bunch people or cents favoring that is all it really takes but the hard stand has to be a popular stand ay notes popular stand do not trains decades to turns out that a really popular stand for the vast majority of america vestmajory of america are not in favor of walking into a target with their three year old and seeing bathing suits encouraging little boys to tuck their penises beneath them s tat they appear more lake girls it turns out that most people are not in favor of that in target took it on the chin and this should be a lesson going fort for republicans pick particularly popular causes and then polarize those causes make clear what the lefts perspective on those causes it is and wrong foot the left and the left is perfectly wiling to step intuit bis the left is right now in gorged by its own power the left actually believes that it can do pretty much anything in the united states specifically because they have won many elections in role or done better than expected in many elections in arrow but the thing that republicans camp to is make it hard for the sensor person for the independent for even maybe the slightly left leaning person two even look at them and think about voting for them or thing about backing their cause in one of the things that governor rondos tested in florid that he has not be e doing in the national ray far in florid they are a bunch of the san to stemocratsas are people or very happy with the way he ran the state because ye took really common sense driven perspective with red r ticket with regard to education the are all popular issues in the state of florid now on the national level he can a ran as trump light he took many of the most pulverizing social issues and he decided that he is can to run almost solely on those as post of solid governments in the state of florid that stop made him quite popular with democrats in the state of floated there is no need for that and now looks to giants maybe shifting his campaign away from the sort of trump light approach which up is is little late but necessary obviously it is why are also seeing some popular upswing among some republicans for people gland young can insure in virgin or trying company georgia then a lot of this has to do with the idea that if re publicans and conservatives wish to win than he is pick issues that are popular and the they need to run on those issues all of this raises the serious question as to what republicans are going ton do in the twenty twenty four race because if they inside to once again hitch there wagon to the twenty twenty election horse that does not seem a particularly smart strategy whatever sympathy you have for president trumpet of human being who is been put under pressure by dozens of indictments virtually all of them on specious charges you can feel that sympathyand you can still understand that talking about that endlessly for the next couple of

democrats trolling pillar canton was on with rather amadou the other night and of shoo did a full s call twenty sixteen elections an i all retire and this sort of stuff it is this sort of stuff they're really gets the goat of conservatives and leads them to one to throw the orangemental finger i totally get it here as pillar canton last night certainly a nterern reaction an it with cleriinterfer german to help my porn an rani interferon ariranin we know ah that a run was instant upon helping trump that is no longer subject to do bay me interfere an with the election virgin just stop you sain touch screw computer voting because it is vulnerable you can run the bast campaign you can even become the nominate and you can have the election stain from yo hero i a that the hes a element ament preside election end i after election and lie after election now hilleryclin for literally years on end and no one seem to care about that that was perfectly legitimate not only was a legitimate it launched a thousand legal cases against on a trump the muller report was specifically based on the idea that democrats could not handle the idea that killer coin had lost the election there's a perfectly plausible solution is to why killer lost an twenty sixteen she was one of the worst candidates in america history the prove is that the lost urinal trump who is the second least popular candidate in america at that point killer was the least popular and trump was the second least popular that that is how bad she was but they decided instead she must not have lost and they watched a bunch of legal cases against trump an investigations based on specious nonsense and now of course trump is facing serious charges across a wide range of jurisdictions and those en a bog him down for legitimately the entirety of the election cycle when you look at the slate of cases the he is facing it is can be a full skill disasterarea for him mean forget about whether he goes to galena just in terms of the politic just intros the money they met the legal bills here i here is his current calendar right now here the case of their calendar he has the new york man hazan nonsense case about hush twenty payments two stormy angels that trial is schedule to begin march twenty fifth two thousand twenty four meanwhile the classified documents case is slated to begin mad twentieth twenty twenty four right in the middle of the election cycle we still don't have a date on the washington d c case regarding canary sixth and the lead up to canary six from jacksmelt but he has proposed canary seconds twenty twenty four which is just two weeks before the idea presidential cocasense and fanny wills onsalonch our case presumably within six months of the indictment she says which woulds put at smacdab in february twenty twenty four just a look at his calendar that is a stack twenty twenty four calender for the presidents of the united states that that is a that is a calendar that starts of the legal case and c in canary a legal case in georgia in february a legal case in new york in march and legal case in florid in may ay that that is can to be the utility of the year each one of those cassis going to take months at a minimum dona trumpets can be consumed with that day and he is consumed with the right now and the haven't been launch the trials gets here is thequestion what is the evidencethat this is going to benefit re publicans again you can have as much simply as you want for president trump an i feel lout of the some sympathy i just do not understand why that is the case for nominating him for the presidency give the data that we do have there is a pull out to day and it shows that again donate trump is soaring among republicans sixty three per cent of re publicans now say they want the from a president to run again according to new polling from the a p that is up slightly from fifty five per cent is had the same in aril when trump began facing a series of criminal charges seven an ten republicans now have a favorable opinion of trump and up took from the sixty per cent who said to months ago by the way those numbers are not enough to win reelection if only seven and tent re publicans actually you that is a major problem that is a major red flag if jobidemer facing in approval rating among democrats of sixty or seventy per cent which is what trump is looking out right now they'd be a disaster area for him but here is the problem fence you get to the general election the vote it is not just the matter of getting out the base the base is not large enough for dona trump the base for dona trump is may be forty per cent of the population at its height we get all those people outs about they know the not wont you are slogan an need another five or six per cent of voters minimum seen get you in competitive range that cut ton competitive range in the electoral colleges of forty six per cent that is competitive in thelectroral college maybe to win he really needs more forty eight per cents where is that other eight per cent con to come from they'd have to theoretically come from independents or democrats to satisfied with gabion but here is the problem look at those poll numbers seventy four per cent of republicans say they would support him in nonmember twenty twenty four that number itself is wag to lo the means a full quarter of republicans would sit it out rather than vote for trump in twenty twenty four fifty three per cent of america say they would definitely not support him if he is nominee which means the election is over if that is that is real if a pure majority of america say they will never vote for you under any circumstances how do you win you cannot lose fifty three per cent often vote and win a national election another eleven per cent that they probably would not support him in nonmember of twenty twenty four which leads to sixty four per cents of america saying that they certainly would not or probably would not vote four dona trump in nonmember twenty twenty four what is the case that this is suddenly going to turn based on the indictments tat the more we talk about the indictments and the injustice of the segments was true the more we talk about that the more people will rally to dona drums cause that seems echo chamber kind of stuff to me and there is some people who are in my industry or gan a fib to you and tell you the t the more you talk about this the more popular dona trump will be come i do not see the evidence of that if that were the evidence i would tell you i promise you because i would to see a republican replace gabion and if that republican is dona trump that is fine but the problem that i have is that i do not see that in the data and n the it is very easy for people to one to blind themselves to reality because their feelings on these topics are strong by the way this it have serious down ballad effect i lest we forget dona trump did just lose the twenty twenty election he also led to additional loses in places georgia twenty twenty one georgia is a red state it is a red state how do i know cs bran cap crushed stay arums in his last gurney trial run the legislature in georgia is red and yet it has two democratic senators why because dona trumps a drag on the senatorial ballad you's a massive drag not person twenty twenty one but also in twenty twenty two when he hand pick tertial walker ante marshal walker ran basically on twenty twenty and turns out people do not that sort of stuff it also turns out that the people of georgia are not particularly interested in hearing that the election was stolen and that they do not know how to run an election in georgia i understand why people are angry at my pence because they believe that pence should be standing stronger with trump against legal ans amines i also understand my penis view on some of the stuffwhiches well i was one the dona trump was saying could stop the election from actually being certified which is false and then people wore threaten for kill me ism not superior on that but when might pen says the georgia election was not stolen he happens to be correct the evidence is not there now dos from says his gan present a slate of new evident on money no as i think i do not think he acutes can present the slate of brand new evidence that totally shakes things up and he is been prevent present an an awful lot a speculation and re warmed sort of mike savable left overs that have already been examined none of these things been filed in court what that really is more about is establishing that he does not have requisites in tend to commit the crime that he is being charged within the take of georgia he is going to i legitimately believe dis deprived of the election even if ism wrong i legitimately believe it that is really what money i think it is more about he suffices say ism not sure that you can wind georgia as h presidential candidate after saying over and over and over that every election in the state of georgia is rigged against you and ripping on the popular governor of the state of georgia in the process trying to primary him with avid perdu who then got wiped out by forty points in the primaries ghetto more on this in just one second first we have a wonderful dog his name is happy happy is just the sweetest it dog his he is now no he is get to be a big boy are happy and we want him to maintain his health this is why we give him rough greens every morning the dog would you ben giving your dog is dead food it does not have very

come lashes to day or call eight they three my dog thirty three that is eight they three my dog thirty three rough greens is pappy's delight he really enjoys it your dog will to pat and over to rough greens tot come slashpensiday or call eight they three my dog thirty three i gey mi pence yesterday became out he suggested that georgia election was not stolen this should not be a matter of mass of public controversy at this point ism sorry really should not in fact the gorge a secretary of state literally went and asked true the vote which would people behind two thousand mules they ask them for the evidence of the charges that day had bee constantly making and true vote asked them to stop asking i here's my pen saying the thing that you are not post to say apparently o spit were the former persedeni o i a for no more than two f the georgia election w o no stolen and i had no right to over turn the election of on gander or i hey have not to be correct about that but here is the even more important thing a president who keep saying over and over that georgia steels elections is not likely to do a making an elections especially has republican voters in georgia may say while if the elections can get stolen anyway why do i bother going the pulse again the one question that trump really has not answered to having any one satisfaction if their watching is you say the last election was stolen you one but who stolen from you how do you plan on preventing that this time every cans thatyou put up for secretary of state the varioustats lost how do you actually plan on stopping of the steel this time if debut stopping the steel trumpchu says we will stop it a you d with but at some point if you make a claim that the election was stolen you shouldhve a plan to stop all that the problem is that these sorts of places are not chest ripping a part republican party an a national level in terms of who they nominate they're ripping a part state parties sure look of the arizona state republican party is in a state of ti spray because half of the arizona state republican party is always trump the other half is not hot on trump virtually all of the sort of politicos in arizona look at the people who've been nominated for various positions in prison and that is what the hell are we doing arizona just a few years ago as a state with the republican governor and two republican senators and ow his democratic governor in two democratic senators something has gone wrong that is not evidence of victory that is not picking the issues that matter to the people of arizona and focussing in on those issues a lazerbem that is focussing in on mark colic county audit which by the way that audio resulted in more votes for jobidon than it did for votes added for dona trump and y is focussing it on carry lakes bear critic quest to reclaim the governorship of arizona on the basis of presumably no evidence that she can actually present in court and win with what is that what they one run on an what is the plan here ad when you taught people in arizona where in the prison grope there turning their hair out because there on their money raising is gone their fun raising is gone allow f their ground game is gone betas been dedicated to the force ops not just to arizona by the way michigan is getting torn apart right now because of all this according tote pastry journal when a fight broke out at a closed door meeting of the michigan go estate committee a kick to the going and broken ensures interrupt the discussion of the dismal finances of the state republican party the altercation last month at the dorty hotel in claim michigan made clear the michigan republican party now dominated by its right flank staunchly aline before a president true has de ended into chaos it can barely for rays it has all but gone broke state waw makers have taken raising money on their own unable to rely on the party at a time when re publicans are seeking tor a clam majority in the take legislature and prepare for the twenty twenty four election in michigan a crucial presidential swing states michigan coo pes in fighting is an extreme example of the dysfunction in many states as the chamber of commerce republicans who used to to find the party gave way to populous or deeply skeptical of heuleades and institutions o power now you could make common cause between those two things the call chamber of commercsyo people actually marabout business climate states there have to be at odds with the call populist but what you do need to do is pick issues that or candidates can win on and then run the parties in order to w n the elections what do not understand is the the party political parties believe it are not are not suppose to your repositories of principal principally that is really not with thereabout political parties are supposed to be about victory they are vehicles for victory i explain in just one second first the bench per so is supported by grand canyon university and a fordable private christian university with vibrio campus and beautiful phenix arizona that is a rank top twenty in the country according to nice dot come have been to g cut it is a gorgeous campus and man that landscape is just victacular g c u is a mission christy rented university that strives to poster culture of community giving an impact g c u school is to help you develop into at servant leader who makes a difference through finding your purpose and fulfilling god's plan wit the aren't thirty economic programs n over two hundred seventy on line as of tune twenty twenty three g you integrates the three market system with ta welcoming christian world view ins your bachelors masters or doctors degree find your purpose at gran canyon university private christian a fordable visit g c u dot e d u to day hits political parties use to be vehicles for victory what that meant is that ya there were a set of party bosses and those party bosses focus in very heavily on who could win elections then in a populist move a lot of these parties democrat and republican decided to devolve more authority to the voting population inside the parties with that then is the best to organized positions inside those parties were likely to win the best organized positions were often held by the people who had very very strong positions all that is fine if there is a counter balance which asks the question of who can win however when the party becomes a non profit then got a problem can in the non profit were where is the way the non profit work world works in general i know use to work for conserved non profit non profits work to lose cay this is very often the case non non for everybody there lot non profits going a making work but the general non profit model the metric of success is what what an profit is non profit right he metric of success for daily wire in terms of marks we have to it is audient size and money earn cause we are business and we have to employ people that is the million in which we work non profits are designed not to make money how do they actually make their money the way that they make their money is by magnifying the problem what happens to a non profit if the problem it is designed to fight goes away win what happens by what happens if you are a non profit what a non profit that is dedicated to school vouchers and let tat the school vouchers actually get done bet the school teachers actually work you get them well then presumably you just cannot go back to your day job non profits very offer are interested in the problem of magnifying the size of the problem and presenting it as we most important problem in human history well if you are the re publican party journal is to win elections that should be our right that was your metric of success but what if the metric for success changes another metric of success is no longer winning which would be actually measurable an if it were measurable you would be punished for not hitting those metrics right when people at daily wire don to their job they get fire when people an non profits do not do their job very often thy just stick around and claim that the proven their fighting has got worse that the re publican party is supposed to work more can ell ell see than an on profit in other words either delivers victory or everybody gets their spotted out the door but lately that is notches way that it's working if you lose you stick around and you claim that your that you have to stay and that you lost because the problems just obey in fact overtime you lose the problem gets you've bigger which is why you are even more necessary but then you lose but that's because promise getting even bigger and are even more necessary butts just because the pom is getting even bigger which is why you lose you see's an endless cycle of uselessness andthat is a real problem because again meanwhile democrats our winning then democratic party is a party that is dedicated to victory which is why they have ben winning consistently now you could designed ha party with an apparatus that actually is oriented toward victory i that is happen in the state of florid where the party is oriented toward taking political positions that are victorious across a abroad swath of the population for example there other states that do this to s notes florid the network republican party actually out did itself in the last election cycle by nominating a series of pretty good candidates in swing seats and also pursuing redistricting the was very helpful but if you have state r publican parties they have basely decided that that their goal is to just yell at the problem lot and the louder they yell the more they lose which means that to yell even louder which means they lose then how exactly to they plan to achieve victory here i do not see the plan give me the plan and may be aside with you but ism not seeing the playwright now anteing is people who believe but the louder they yell the more the problem get solved that is not how any problem in your life has ever been solved is the tiny political problem get solved either that is a mean you cannot have a populist grantors movement in favor of a position on a topic that is popular that is how you win the parents movement is a very conservative position it is superconservative it is ow you and up wit the republican governor of virgin glen younker that was a very conservative movement but why it was driven at a parent population that just did not want sexual indoctrination of kits they picked an issue and they polarized it it'll all you the one issue that if republicans run in in they will get skunked in twenty twenty four and that is the election of twenty twenty if the section of twenty twenty is what they chooser noon and twenty twenty four in all of these states and everything becomes a loyalty test two present in trump as opposed to about getting rid of hoiden re publicans will lose ad they will not they will not lose it cheap it will be very very costly by the way i should remind everybody at this point that because of the intertexture of dona's from it in those gorge cents races if you worry about bid inflation if you're out seven trillion dollar spending packages that is because democrats had control of the senate which they never should have had and again we should be focus on jobidon's record because it absolutely sucks by the way jobidon is now in the consistent covered asshole jobidon has now announce that he is going to be visiting valley on money shots after he spend the entire week vacationing and ignoring questions about it this is the way that jobidens stick actually works he way the yobidih stick actually works s that he makes a booboo another the research the at worse and worse and worse and then finally he slaps to bandage on the booboo and i ask the gangrenes wound sets in leading to possible amputation the media declare that problem has now been f ts jobidon and first lady jill will travel to awe on money the president and first lady will travel to mall on money according to the white house are secretary barren john pierce to meek the first responder survivors and federal state and local officials in the lake of deadly wild fires on the island maybe all vacation there may we on to bite gride has mi screen moll is there as well of some con ice or something are we really enjoy himself because that's what jobidon of course is best at meanwhile jobidon and his teem they continued to promote the idea that he is doing a wonderful job you're paying seven hundred dollars more month in basic expenses now thanks you jobidon but at least jobidon and to have spent trillion of dollars on useless climate policies that is exciting the white house is now celebrating year one of the inflation reduction act one of the largest scale bandages in america history a ginormous bill largely dedicated not to reducing inflation but to passing along subsidies to green energy companies here is green john pierce pushing the called inflation reduction act as you all know a to day is the first anniversary of the inflation reduction act i most one year old can barely walk but the been this one is the this one yer old is up in running i could help myself sorry up in writing that is very excited were very exciting about of the inflation reduction act in everything that its dealing this one your old has run directly into a wall and is bleeding on the floor and your standing their cheering is it absolutely insane meanwhile the a deputy an e seesirec or baric mamamorty he showed up and an explain that the inflation reduction act is actually a green invest remember when we said that we are told the that's true has ho was called that for all the inflation reduction act in every act that is named after a thing is that thing reduced inflationunve did not reduceinflation i will now they are finally admittingthat it was just climate bundle e pro was the port ta the pressman a that e concerns er the a her say that e copy was an the pas name la the flagon at wondering a the wit out wit wat call the the we peseta maybe you could call the economic growth in platoon reduction gets an reduction cost savings act soon o green has as an a action bill it did a lot i e ta accomplished a lot of really important priorities for this country it's putting us in a position a to lead one energy production remember this is going to be a bulplitrally in dollar global market for plan energy wile how a houssiting is me the lie nevereade laughs about because this way this white house works mean the lie they said was batinflation reduction and that is the pastor an mansion said would reduce inflation all the rest and the it was just among yo give always to the friends of the bine administration which as have this place works me not john pods to the white house deputy chief of staff another bomb hold over and hi'llery clintonhold over he he says people across the spectrum support jobidon's green mandates which is weird because i do not see any at is that effect cross yo political spectrum they support the movement to cleaner forms of energy a cleaner forms of transportation the other of processes a mention industrial processes is well because it has enormous benefit to the economy the job creation tebusinessanbestmen and and to public help to public up to everything is ten how do you feel about the bid administrations bending a trullyan dollars of your money on random crap while you cannot pay thrills do you feel good about that because a i feel you probably should not feel that good about that filing many people do feel tit good about that you do not be great is the the republican candidates for talking about that have you seen any of them talking about that butler ruler but also the amazing if a the republican candidates continued to talk about the corruption inside the biding family as well talk about but later on in the show this stuff has been well known for a very long time the level of corruption in the biding family is extraordinary it is absolutely extraordinary it extends to his brothers him and frank it extends to his sister it extends to his kids mean jobidon has basically been the piggy bank for this entire family for forty years closing feels getting people hired all on the back of the influence that he could wield in washington to see and he is not been shy about it for any amount of time at all again i mean hunter bison literally sent the taxed to his own daughter saying that he paid his dads bills i do not know what else you need here but apparently the bid administration just on trying get away with it here is correncon pieresaying that the real thing about hoiden and hunter is that join just really proud of how hunter is rebuilding his life that is that is really the story here as it relates to hunter bid have been very clear we refer every one to his representatives the present at loves this sin he is proud of how his see has rebuilding his life and as far as anything specific about any investigation and criminal investigation we just are going to be a consistent and just not come case here is the problem of course well jobidon tries to pass this office just you know in interior family notion avid is the special council who is now been given special council status after having tried to cut a sweetheart feel the completely blew up in his face well now i the critically he could be going after hunter biding as he should for foreign agents registration act violations faraviolations we will he do that we will find out but we are we are very far from don we are very very far from don with all the hunter biding stuff why our republicans still talking about you know other thing focussing an anal if you follow the shiny object you will lose if you fall the shiny object you lose again the

it will end august nineteenth at even fifty nine piano eastern time can meanwhile can the biggest issue here is jobidon's economy which is failing for the vast majority of theamerican public of experienced mass in elation under jobidon and theocrasy you trying to hap you talk this thing chuxhumer who is in explicably the senate majority leader a he said to day that our economy is doing just fantastically well as of yesterday most economist fear the most in the future and it is two things one the finest economy this weakening too quickly and that will have in pact on export import and to that the unites fates economy is two strong it is our economy is doing well and its in good part because of the work we in the senate in the president did over the last summer the inform structure bill thesis and sciences bill and to day were celebrating the one year anniversary the aye treaty probably the most significant pieces of legislation this can passing the since the great society e w he he keeps talking ow wonderful the economy's which is weird since the us mortgage rat is now seven point one six per cent this match of the highest rate for mortgages since yo thousand one is tripping both sails and refinancing activity the contract rate on a thirty you are fixed rose seven basest points to seven point one six percents in the weak ending august eleventh the latest jumping borrowing close presents the fresh head wind for the housing market just as the sector had been showing signs of finding its footings we have credicardat that is stacking up we have people where no can be able to buy new homes which means that the price is eventually are going to drop because the market is going to drop which means there will be people for underwater on their own homes which such us up for another real estate problem meanwhile there is a rising risk of bank down grades according to the hill that is a serious problem as well obviously fitch rating's annals wrist wolf has world that dozens of yospents including chap mortal chase could face down grades if the rating agencies to sussment of the industryself the lines a little bit further wolf is the lead author on pitcher's commentary when the rating agency lowered it to operating environment score for yosbanks from a double to a double mines in tune if fitch down d grates the industry score even further from double minus to a plus the agentcsued then be sorry valuate ratings on each of the more than seventy banks it actually covers and then if institutions shape organ are cut fitch would have to lease con ordered down grade is on all of its peers ratings what we are looking at is the real possibility of a massive economic problem coming and meanwhile robin just keep talking about how how wonderful you have it how incredible things are republicans should be talking about the economy nearly full time at this point again that that is were the public the public does not approve of jobidan's economic performance mean again if you look at jobidons approval rating right now topic by topic on the economy he is getting absolutely skunked it is a massive problem for him and yet somehow republicans are not focussing in on that which i do not understand the focusing on everything else again at a certain point you have to you have to wonder about that given the fact that the economy remains according to dipsos the number one issue by a with a bullet twenty per cents of america count the economy on employment an jobs as the number one issue facing the country followed by crime and corruption and those are issues that that republicans should be hammering the third issue they say is environment and climate but the fourth is immigration republicans democrats and in penance all say that the economy is the topics these are and by the way all america sixty nine per cent of america say that the countries had in the wrong direction they were on the wrong track would not that be evidence that republicans can win if the reforms a little there the question is whether they actually will or whether they will not meanwhile the democratic party continues to prop up elderly senile people here ism speaking specifically about dial fine skin in fact there's a bran new court filing out from the daughter of dial fine skin alleging that she is acthuly the victim of elder abuse according to is the san francisco gave dicot the to trusted of a trust in the name of richer bloom that sense wealthy husband of dial fine sin have not ban accuse give elder abuse against fine skin in a recent court filing vomited by her daughter gathering was limited power of attorney over the senator the filing suited augustave partially confirm would a previously ben report by other wallets the gathering fine sin of former san francisco county sgurior court judge and current san francisco fire commissioner has limited power of attorney over her mom which the senator sine over to her jury twenty third twenty twenty three the recent court filing notes this invites gatherings make legal admissions for her mother in certain civil related matters we in the augustate filing catherne fine say made the striking allegation the michael line mark scholvic and merit them who control the disputed trust are committing the financial elder abuse against the ninety year old senator in the filing catherne lectures the trustees didn't fund a trust her mother is the sole in commentifissiary of and the if not made required to tribulations to the senator since bum's deaf in twenty twenty two catenane who is findstensdaugter from a previous marine also a ledgers that the to trustees are purposely slow pulling payments to the sent because they intend to benefit richer blues at by a logical daughters who stand to inherit millions of dollars that should go to senator fin skin if the trustees never make the required at distributions to her among other asked cathartic wants the sort to spend the to trustees pending a decision on whether it is remove them now all of the suggest that perhaps this should not be anoa sitting united states senator given the fact that basically all her financial decisions are not been made for hers to she are her vote is making your financial decisions for you but she is having all her financial decisions made by trustees at this point these are the people that we have o this we have appointed to the highest positions o power in america meanwhile next week is on be the first republican it debate president trump its putting the arms he an bit of a bind he is refused to sign the araks he loyalty pledge he said that last week he is expected to anancemen coming days whether or not he is going to attend the event it is very unlikely i think that he is going to attend the event according to the hell rains e chair woman a on out hominy mactanial bus now navigate the thorny situation of appeasing trump hell maintaining her con tools head of the party brain psychic a republican strategist and trump campanile one says hit is a distinct possibility the republican hominy for president could simply decide to shun the ran he itself when candidate refuses supply by the rules at obviously real weakens the araks he is position but here is the reality dontruple as never on a sign agreement this and frankly i think it is ken of a due thing because it no matter what dona trump says can he be held to it what are the consequences if he does not if he signs the pledge an the eateries i meant everybody but cries crispy then what is hen man to do about it the answer is nothing mac dance told mean ans wrist walls recently it is beat biding pledge and what we are saying and the bate committee has met for over two years people from last godtaile annoys tot tenners is if fir con a stand on the araks he debate stage ho should beagle to support the hominy and beat bison everybody has to sign the beat bine pledge everybody it is a cross the board the pledge states the candidate will support the eventual hominy of the party primary and the candidate will not part tisipatin any debate the araks he has not sanctioned the pledge is part of a criterion republican candidates must meet to qualify for that presidential debate but again in august twenty fifteen then candidate trump as the only candidate on stage one of the bates who would not raise his hand to show the he would support the eventual hominy in the twenty sixteen primary and the something kind of wrong with this g is just a general rule if what you are about is republicans winning that you would seetrobid copy an office the fact that loyalty only runs one way that there is just expected loyalty from everybody two trump at the minute that trump its asked whether he's support another nominee if that person beats him he re fuses to raise san an cannas shows you wear things stand right now the only reason there was he needs do loyalty pledges because of dona trump said ale strumming and republican strategist an rains kalimba that is not true obviously because trump himself has for of refused to we it to sit i sign on the doubted line right now i mean it is it is trump that everybody is afraid of here it is not that the republicans a can have to pledge to support trump they did not twenty twenty it whether dona trump ts willing to support the party if he is not the person who is in charge gene for horn who is a spokes person for try p she says the irons we means trump about more than trumpets the iron see if they lose trump thy lose the sport of the trump voters in their balefire sent of candidates that house candidates their stake candidates torn also said that a trump to sides to bay without siding the pledge the other candidate should be given the same treatment we will see where this had honestly a debate without trump on the stage is very likely to benefit some of the fringe car candidates because again those candidates are you b able to free wheel and there not can be the titian of agents if trumpet on the stage presumably some of whether candidates would go after trump andtheygh i turn into a brawl if he is not then it will turn into the lobster pot right the capotes can be a bunch of people trying to drag down the nearest competitor presumably that means onto basis will take the grunts of the incoming in the debate next week sol continued bring you the latest on all of that again in the national pulling to basis is still running second but his numbers have decline relatively markedly although corn quinnibyac he still up at about eighteen per cents which puts him thirty nine per cent perceptive points behind trump in well for what it is worth he is trailing right now in the real geopolitics pulling average by twenty seven points forty four to seventeen well continued bring you latest on all of that already time for some things i and then some things that i hates things i today i said er earlier the biding family is deeply corrupt an has been for forty years the best book on this is book by report him ben shreckenger call the biding inside the first families fifty year rise to power he goes through the details of the entire business relationship between job and hunter job and frank job and him they silly has since the earliest days of job bisons rise to power he was using that power in ways the benefited members of his family and his members of his family we are using jobidon's name an ore to get ahead and it is a consistent pattern and i to always the same means literally the same story over and over joining is a shadowy background figure being used by members of his family in order to obtain benefits for themselves and then him denying that ever knew anything about it antis rangers from everything to fun raising to the kind of jobs if he was able get hunter coming out of college and law school it it includes things how he presumably helped his brother obtain financing for some of his business is even thus brothers complete near to wellies a complete narrator well some how the families benclearing tens of millings a dollars over the course of the pasture decades and none of it has to do it job despite the fact that none of them have any real qualifications for literally anything the book is definitely wort the read again the biding inside the first families fifty year rise to power one things its pretty making actually is tax u search for biographies of jobidon they do not really exist he see is memory is they got couple of biographies there may be two hundred pages of jobidon but for a man who is been in politics for fifty years that really should be more there there rally is not because no one wants to do a deep dive on the guy why we number one he is really boring but number two he is old school just corrupt he is t an old school normal corrupt politician who cares much more about his own personal benefit than he does about anything remotely resembling a policy a agenda or the country the fact that he's been able to get away with it for all of these years is again just in homage to the medias of ability to whitewash s body who is been obviously dory for decades on and out a time for some quick things that i hate som thing that i hate number one the governor of calforni gavenusom he keeps troubling down o this idea the parents i really bad and the teachers her one wo ought to decide wat your intern which is totally crazy when your apparent you delegate power to teachers for a certain umber of hours in a day in orders that they can teach things that you might not know however this does not mean that they can act outside the scoop of the agency but gavenusom seems to believe that when you give your kid to a teacher that is each your basically has plenty power of your kid for the foreseeable future many nine per supported or or were simply agnostic that is prenotion et i do not know what they refrained o that is that is and i think one has a responsibility drop of what specifically referring to is it the soon that if you reference some one been gay that somehow that equalizing our kids is that the case with strait people is well an if your strait is that equalizing i do not i mean it is it is rather perverse that i offer that is a rhetorical question because you go of course not by defend i do not know what it is her sir it is orwellion double speak what its just profoundly ignorant that they bengindu y outside agitators which i think perhaps is a combination teaching shows r about the morality of particular sexual orientations and behaviors is in fact in indoctrination gave that that is what it is no one gave permission for a teacher to teach their kids about the virtues of same sex marriage which yes inevitably in's going to involve discussions of sex of course it will that does not necessarily occur in the contexts of say straight marriage why because a child can see mamma and daddy make baby dow you've have to now the mechanism what they do know is the baby comes for mama and daddy however what is that differentiation between a same sex couple and two god to just live together as roommates the answer presumably would be something sexual would it not and how else would you explain same sex marine what is the thing distinguishes two men who live with one another from two men who are married to one another explain what is it what's the actual distinction in from of life style there is some distinction now can name you the difference between a male female roommate and may female child family structure i can do withthot even explaining sex because people know from the timethat they are born that they have a mamma and that they have a daddy that the fact that this to become something that is that is very controversial to say is just monster of have stupid everything as but in o again you have to say the basic things in their controversial because the left has been overwhelmingly successful in quashing basic truths of life i can meanwhile one more thing that i hate to a this has to be yo the demist story of the day there is the republican congress person a man miller republican from oho and he stepped in it after he told a christian republican activist to defeat a quonquot bigoted post her name is sizzle maria can she treated there is no not hope for any of us outside of having faith in jess christy alone miller who served as an aid to form preside went true before who is elected to congress twenty twenty two then said t thesis one on most bigoted tweets have ever seen to lead it sizzle religious freedom in the united state supplies to every religion you have gone too far that is really stupid that is supersuperstupid truly why christian believe in jess they also believe that jess is the way the path and the light right this what they believe obviously they are christian ism not asking them to believe what i believe they can believe what they want to believe long as they are not attempting to forcibly convert me we do not have a problem here you can believe ism going to help many people do i do not care that is fine we will find out afterward the fact that anybody would say to a christian how dare you this is offensive to say that that your faith suggest that there is no hope outside of jess i mean i believe that there's no hope outside of say these seven the seven midsfol nay goal ism i think that you are your dusting for a a rough afterlives you not perform certain basic commandments that is true pretty much every religion some ism relatively confuses to why exactly it is bigoted it really is not bigoted miller said god says the jewfish people are the chosen ones but yet you say we have no hope that thanks for your pearl of wisdom today well again that is jewfish perspective but you cannot tell christian what to believe that it it is a very strange take he ended up actually walking a bath was he should have i he ended up apologizing for it actually again as he should have he says i post end something earlier the convey to message i did not intend i will not try to hide from my mistake or run from it and then he added i sincerely apologized to vision every one who read my post and that that is om that is the we you do in apology at least least there is that but let me just make it clear that religious freedom means among people can believe stuff about religion that you do not yourself believe that is totally fine o k coming up or can be jumping into the mail bags stick around for that become member

a quick warning there are curse words that are beeped in today episode of the show if you prefer a beep version you can find that at our website this america life dot o work cant er and her husband and the two kids move back to boson and it was not going grate for her she is a teacher but hadn't ben a teaching job yet she did od chops little thing to the john of kenned presidential library she work is not ashes for the boson sad my orchestra which can i say these knowing the kind of boson specific jobs you would give a character who moved to boson in a bad moving the only thing i was not doing is selling foam finger at runway pack and i made very little money she is actual pretty depressed just dragging herself through the motions of living bogging forward to anything and i when go away show could not shake it i would wake up in the morning and feel sort of irritated o this again i went to work and i would put a smile on my face but i often times would not hear anything any one said to me she foremen into this new downer of life and she gets off work and aril on the first bright sunny days after a long dark winter she excited to take her dog style to gallstone beech near her house on this pretty day wanton's good for a dog she says cause she big atom maniac and this speech is perfect because really no one was out on we started walking i let her awflysh because she really wanted to splash around and she was just frolicking and i saw her moving closer to the water and i realized my feet were starting to sink we would what you mean sink sure my one foot started to really sink and then i was attempting to pull that foot out and then my other foot started to sink and i realized i was not hitting a hard bottom there was no one to cannot call or cry and it was really happening fast i was really sinking quite fast and i should note era ism not a tall woman ism a forefoot and woman for me the start sinking i was i was practically up to my this in this muddy sandy watery mixture very quickly very quickly how get i would say maybe the whole gravitational pull down into the sand was thirty seconds it could have been three minutes for all i know because time just slow down as she struggled the anger feet up she realized t mud and sand and waterformed a kind of seal round her boot holding it down making a too heavy to lift and s carry right she thought to herself am i about break of bone pulling my wag out my trapped mi just come to keep sinking i had no idea what to be afraid of i just know that i was very afraid did you think that you could sink all the way underhand just go all the way down oh yes that is that is one hundred per cent where i thought i was headed quicksand she thought ism in quicksand in massachusetts and basis inviting badly you i yourself sinking in quicksand not on a tropical island or jungle not when you are looking round some ancient ruins rating tlosstumes of dead part as in an old move but what it happens just the ten minute drive from your own house on a beach and quinsy massachusetts nine minutes from one dona done its in easements from another the thought that inevitably goes through your head in that situation is seriously i said this is bullet this is new inland you are telling me that quicksand that something out of princess bride what is it doing at walliston beach and why are not there sins to warn me about this yer this a bit thou john malady does the committee jonmalane that when when i saw i felt he was saying out loud something that i have always felt he said that base on what he saw on t v is a ked he thought quicksand was going to be a much bigger part of his adulthood than it actually turned out to be because if you out tar tones quicksand is the third biggest thing you have to worry about a it e i real sticks of din bit and viand and gills falling on you from the sky o o o a t lev i never step in quicksand a never even heard about it i also was thinking about john milady you knew that that oh john milady is he is on heavy rotation with my kids and me and i remember thinking eat your hard out john milady if you could see me now how who o we n looks here she was first up to in ankles than her knees not to her this and still sinking herself was in the car the beach was deserted except her dog was dropping round happily got ammityit no one save her or hew out and then the thing happened and she says she somebody who usually has a hard time expressing it when she is angry she some of cries rather yells but now is we have you were rage shot through her rage and outrage just corruption i was pis what i cannot freaking believe this is how my days going to go kick me while ism down i was oh how no you are nock in a join my day sand i i have fought for this lovely spring day i am not going down and with a burst of hoke fury she moves into action she is quicksand no problem i would embrace the ridiculous awfulness of the situation and i will make something happen right now d she starts squirming around this way and that i started to leaned backwards and at that point when i leaned back an i was still sinking but i was hoping that i could sort of just wiggle out of my boots and at my boots would be the sort of sacrificial land that i woald just leaven the sand but i realize if i just leaned back and kind of shimmy a drunk person getting on to a bar stool pi could lift my legs out of the sand little by little by little on et only sort of impediment was that make dog was looking at me this is a for gave i just do not know how to play she was just kind of darting around me watching me move this then i was getting really really frustrated with her as well o the she led her way out of solo ground at that point she says she is completely covered in sand what sanding her hair liver clothes she collects her do g climes in a car drives how teens up a week or two passes and then one morning s wakes up on realizes she kills oka i remember clearly sitting in bed and saying to my husband oh my goodness i i think i good i was filled with this content feeling that i can only describe as they depression fating i did not feel any of the heaviness and i could only trace it is disappearance to the quicksand candor thinks it has something to do with the anger she camped intointo a stuck in the same e somebody ho cannot always expressed anger she thinks letting herself get furious for once and flip something in his that is the moment she was able embrace just how bad things have gotten and fight away out to tea an o program we have other store of people put in difficult sometimes impossible situations and the only way out to put the arms around the badness feel it for what it is and then figure outs some moves to wrestle the problem to the ground whatever be easy chico it is this america live i maracas stay with us y coin telling marry pass it is the most the magical week in america politics right now yes it is ism speaking to you right now during the eight days between the i caucus and the new samphire primary the great works the results and car reset the political scores and possibilities reveal all the cards and this week that we are in right now can be an enchanted eight days we under dogs tell themselves that anything is possible anything can happen no matter how unlikely it is to in fact happen and t o witnesses in person one of our producer we chase went to new samphire this week to hang out with two people to old friends of chosen to embrace hope in the face of long and difficult gods they know very well the small trump will probably be the republican nomen for president and they are not hope about it is got to democrats but the are embracing the likelihood of dona trumps rise with a giant bear hug and they are trying to do something about it and they are making a last stand to try to stop him this very weak easily what the trying to do is there trying to convince new samphire voters tho get real about their options in this historic moment and vote sober the actually want to be president but vote for the only person these guys believe can stop dona trump from becoming the republican hominy and that person is nick daily that wright is two democrats are stumping day and night to elect a woman who stands for many things they personally hate he caught up with them one day before this enchanted week began that is a day before the i caucus these guys are not even from new samphire their policy wanks from at of state outside agitators ones from d c and the others from new york they both work for do grocery international interest time places they prefer not to name on the radio robot schwartzs has been living in new samphire for three months he took a leave from his job left his family moved up here with his good friend canny can shuffler runs from care an met up with them at a bury indeed new samphire and they're here this particular afternoon because the politician is on stage some one running in the democratic primary which is happening even though jo bide in decide to skip new samphire this years the guyot stage congressmendin chilies is making a random run for the presidency but robot and can are not paying attention to deem chilies they're here for the forty or fifty voters in the room robot is sort of irrepres bible says all his thoughts as he has them kind of thing and starts whispering to me as soon as they get there ye i at is all the people years ears wing days a little we axis fly maya one notice cease to began just talk to them cause e grin an is is a not of people tears an the we hosiers i the way it works on samphire independent voters can vote in either primary democrat or republican and there is a tons people that something forty per sent of the electoral in this year wit jo biding skipping you samphire robot in ends mission is more plausible all these people who probably would voted for biding are free agents robot in canter here pick off some of those people democratic leaning independent voters you might be willing to vote for nick half as a way to stop true o all i soon as the tan striper o at toxins an voter he does not know anything about what who some one all bundled up in a blue park o to see if he can convince her to cast a vote against everything she just heard on stage an throwing with the republican primary instead he is a very slow roll up it is is what bring e a is curious wat brings you to this event i an the a i the of sand like ether on other a i i to o i an o toe do o o to yo do not ado a are you a the history demit after i mire i i dependent o lastly o a mom he is found his target index pendent voter leans to the left you think you make his pitch but he is learned this kind of voter does not it when you open with a hard cell on nick half cause they do not make half and he does not hale either ut he is to sell her on half it is kind of a weird conversation a lotto dramatics o gas sorry o thinking li is a o ti tin your definitely an about in ta demo critic primary you thinking about man boy a an o o the o body against to i i ane i even tho vitally is prove is stoat that i i in i e

if he took a shot or not but he thinks this is the best way to talk about mike half he has this cautious reproach partially because of this thing people keep saying around sure all the time you samphire voters have to make up their own mind do not pressure me can be hard to tell how he is actually doing with this crowd even though this woman says the most important thing to her is to stop trunk but you still do not know what the i ha this that is right o o y y pit is i pit we wee no poetry feels that way we just a not i i ice an a i come for parole and at its car decision not mine bi i pis would be if you want a stop trump we got about we gat even a at for somebody don't l no and with that the voter has to go t we move on this strategy getting people to hate vote for nick daily there is a word some people used for this kind of thing a technical term of politics for sneaking round and doing dirty tricks inside the other party's election here is can celli hated that this is the must agonize the lucking operation about that i fan hem at that him my a ta you that i a but do not see ourself satisfy a w it you feel i semen i i believe it was a compliment yes ye it is we om in this whole quest of robot in kens began one night last summer they met up in decree and got onto the subject of how they think trump is an existential threat to democracy can we get off the road to autocracy and can was you know you have done stuff in the past til i help other countries in this situation maybe we should actually do something can i think given his can of consulting bacon's let us do a brainstorm and this is how you do a ran to rather tie other i yell in i tell her about your other idea that we can can has some really good ideas and som not really good ideas and the other idea he tried to pitch me on that we can was that the national foputig is too dangerous and we need to have is last half of mac as fin we have we have let us let us create a seven on seven football the that is more sake and and robot told him that was ridiculous t an there is the sort of person can is and then he pulls out a powerboat so yes like a defer yet i e fortfolly and as that as this is giving me serious doubts that we should proceed along this fret but he still actually believe the see yet et anyway after they got this idea for defeating trump they went out and raised money and they say they raised twenty thousand dollars on their own and then they got this big chunk of six hundred and fifty thousand dollars from doters who wish to remain anonymous and that is real money that could have in pact on small but mighty election this one with that money they bought targeted voter lists of undeclared left leaning voters that they regularly message and send jailers out to mailers and messages that can is got in focus cup and tested with professionals they got a lucky break when nick daily started to poll within ten points of donate trump in new samphire and writ it this moment going to the of a cakes their hope is you'd come an sick in an la that would giver the momentum to win new samphire outright beat trump with would make her credible in south caroling and beyond that they even hired two people in south caroling in case they have a shop there we always saw this is hires i reward the if you at the pulls it has always looked trump will win denomination but if there is a five per cent chance of stopping potential dictate that it is worth putting a at that into that eve for that five per cent chance tit daily shocks trump here and there is an alternative in the republic it is worth it for our democracy robot is really emotionally invested in this idea that make they these two college friends could actually do some thing to stop dona trump he is intense about his work always get's overly invested it seems at his day job he was waking up having panic attacks about that work on top of this work was is this work helping now this is not extremely healthy either am i tied myself into my career and then rather than seek balance and view myself as a father in a brother in a son and instead of that i have now identified myself as a part of this mission and ism wrapped up in that in my whole self worth is going to be determined canary twenty third and that is not healthy at all ism really worried from a went from a mental health in all that perspective of what happens after canary twenty third or what happens after the election in nonmember at some point there is going to be a reckoning and ism really afraid of that to be is robot's not alone of course they're not the only any trump group then sway undeclared voters tad there not big players but the real players still they can go from sophisticated to bumbling very quickly he we found ourselves screeching around manchester and a car on away to an analcayday celebration late as usual they were glomming on to some one ease's a van hoping to meet people who know more people who might carry their message out to other new hampshurings the volunteered to bring the coffee in the drinks your friend we less was supposed to do it but he is stuck it you p s printing up fliers with the car cod the event has already started robots freaking out a we are right we are i to we are right by there to working stop there you get to the you get to the event and do damage control place there upset with us yes to the event but robot thinks of himself is responsible and when he is not seen that way it kills him cause we are going to be five minutes ten minutes late to an e a we of it senberisying in something has your shamespirol samsfiles not in a good place i now when they get there robot jumps out with three boxes of coffees two huge bags of creamers he is running around in the fold cannot even find the door we a a at how to get the creeping building why do not they sin thank you one tho the to did he not pick up just really lose when is there end it is apologies in taping their car cod fliers on to gunman donates boxes and robot works the line on people tabling for various social justice he causes mostly white active is you hampsure is mostly white can in robot a wite and i get to witness just how tired people are of dis con pitch this is the third any body but trump election ye known y mean he talks wit deb opera males he is lack trump is not sophisticated snog to hide it's white supprimis write in ecahaleas mar sophisticated at it et she is more and ting is shes a brown woman right lifting up white ofpprimasy she is she is she is just a most sitisticated from well but she also condemned she said canary six was a terrible day right she does not call our military better an succors and losers she has which she launch a to against our country with she would harden from well would you rather would you rather part would you rather vote for the criminal or the one who pardons the criminal would got prepare not to go e et will to you right i get that but then but then who who are you only have one vote in the primaries and the question is where can you yes you prefer not devote for either but then but then are you just throwing away your vote and letting trump win i saw this move a few time is from robot talking about people's vote it was a commodity what just a piece of currency that you could spend at this store or that store and you seeded to squeeze the most value out of it that you could that is a hard selling new samphire and has not always seem tuned in to how people mat e thinking about their vote is theirs something between a personal statement and a moral obligation and at heres heres o got wit what you are saying to y is throwing away my not yes ay is that nick half as yet really to a dress any blow is she has not gone another way all his try wind the racism question came up in a very actually simple question to answer she ran he get on morale to give a horrible answer noshalan my for is sacred am i going to spend it on her no well there is one person who will tell you what their join or what their mat doing e i we carcass we that night money we watched alley returns in a bar again robot was really rooting for nick hailed to come in second after trump turn the primaries into a two person race that is not what happen she came in third just behind to mantis and well behindshrump it is a huge set back and robots upset things feel their starting to slip away and he spends the rest of the night scrolling and angrily tweeting the next day they have to regret the text message s tea been planning to send to the eighty thousand voters their targeting built around nick halloing better an ideas wo know now they have to frame things to make class seem less important a can suggests a stock photo o guy scratching his head with the words does any one actually know what a canvas is new samphire picks president absences robot points out that he is butchering a famous new samphire saying and there both stressed out love here is how that conversation goes down the line that everyone here recognizes the political line that shows were plugged into new samphire is that line i would pick corn in samphire picks residence that is the niseis another picks president yea youexchanging i ways carcass who is ever heard of a caucus was it is not a goo line ism sorry i do not it's y it is o is the famous line as johns in his line here's a history of it people recognize it we yes she her gesso is mention going i the lone is any hamster other ones i understand how the leads a viewing this ism telling you that is the line the people know they do not one to say what is a cacao give me credit for being here for three months in talking that every freaking person that i can that is the line that but that is the line o cam tost saying the first thing that i said at the meeting to day was that line robot wins out they go with the famous lines and a photo of a cornfield that robot insisted is provocative he told gan that is why i one i have the cornfields but you do not want to have that it is edgy it is insulting ti was inn and at my last voters o new samphire later that day robot brought me to meet this couple in a lovely house on a snowy street in mampchester he want to run the cornfield ten messages by gorge brunt for her democratic party chair again gorge had volunteered to be a public champion of robot's cause and robot had managed to convince this august new samphire and to publicly change his party registration from democrat to undeclared only problem was gorge still had not decided if hell actually do the thing robot was asking wrote for nick daily i underside but i could even er ioihover grab of si have been working out i for i e come more clear as we guy closer to for your twenty third no canary twenty third do not is you gone e i found this to be an ominous tale for robot's quicksotic omission if gorge brunt this advocate for robot's cause could not even commit to doing the thing crossing parties voting to save america the republican primary but then robot turned to gorge's wife dona who been in the kitchen while we been talking offer tea and reading the new york times she changed her party registration to undeclared to robot asked her what she was thinking she said she would never vote for some one who did not believe in reproductive rights robot said even though trump killed off reverse's went she said will that is a good point actually no my original after and crossing over was to a sure that trump would not become present in a very me and dear to a my values is the ability for women to control their own bodies in the reproductive rites a it would be hard for me to cast to vote for somebody who might not respect that on the other hand the most important thing is to assure that he is not the candidate tit is not present you are still son might have been i might have to compromise would you vote for likably she is the one that according to the poles looks the most likely to be trump right am recently i read some of her stances and she was really ruffling on reproductive rices scared me a on the other hand i did this primarily to defeat trump if it mean voting for her i might do it you have we wartime to days is all turned out it just because it is such an uncomfortable thought but i wanted to feat trump and if it takes floating for nickihally to do that i think i might do that i think she my really do it when i left new samphire it was half way through america magical eighty period between i was causes and new rapturous primaries robot seemed to swing from happily cherry picking poles that told him what he wanted to hear to despair and real fear that they had no chance and trump could not be stopped by any one he told me he woke up crying on thursday morning this might all be over in a few days he said the lama the project was a long shot from the start they did their best and now since trumps overwhelming when and i a it gone way slingshot here was it worth it if trump wins by fifteen or twenty points i will view everything we have done as a failure and an i will consider myself a failure and i know that is not likelier doing everything we can and it is not and i need to be this they tell you you have to be nicer to yourself and tell speak to you a friend might speak to you and a friend would say nice try good job way to go away to fight for it anyway but i will look it li i made all these sacrifices on this gamble and if the gamble turned out to be a wrong gamble and our c trees not up to stopping true then i made that i made him eugenics calculation that is robot's anxiety here is was you feel this is a reread to mind yourself too to now i just really on a wonton o is o there is three hundred forty three thousand one hundred ninety two undeclared voters in new samphire robot in can had just a few more days left to catch some of that tell them to vote against everything they care about and hold back for just a little longer what appears to be the namable course of his the he cases oproduceecoming out a baby get's in trouble with the law that is in a minute gogabubagradio when our program continues to smart knife my or glass to day show embraced the suck patently that phrase us started in the military and then moved into more general use meaning you should just own how bad it is but your arms around it hold a close to you that is the only way you are going to get through it to day we have stories of people doing exactly that we have arrived at at two of our program a too the dream police is bargaining baby d go to sleep every knows hat an different parents get through a different ways now long one of our producers i trees contrast an his white gemma war struggling with this with hi son were at one and half years old a very could us say your words and he was actually able to hold an umbrella and caudally pull off a few of gene cells moves from singing in the rain while it played i seems i you're this he was not great but he was amazing for somebody under two feet tall wearing a diner the to say for all that accomplishment very was still not on a proper sleep chiral until his parents embraced the awfulness of the situation they were in and invented something here is i very is the loudest my i know ism pretty soft spoken he did not get that from me whole thing he did get we both really prefer to be awake but very takes it a little too far when he was about one i tried to put him down for a nap iris crib he had bags under his eyes his eyelids were heavy and his head was doing that thing where it falls and snaps back then i saw him slap himself in the face to stay awake a long hall trucker fresh out of five hour energy and it is not just that he would fight sleep when he did go to sleep sometimes he would wake up in absolute terror but he needs to go to sleep we all must in we tried everything at five months we tried sleep training we did not take at one year his soon to be take cure provider suggested the crypt out method which depending on what that apparent you are is either the most deficient way to sleep train or the most barbaric when they cry it is you re job not to comfort them do not go in even if it sounds really bad which it did we were a few weeks into this hellish ritual until one summer day hero was looking sleepy and it was time to attempt the one p m tap i carried him to his room drew the curtains turned on the lollies gave him a fresh die or lowered him into his crib love you very see you after your nap and closed the door the crying started immediately and i turned on the timer for the next forty minutes em and i were clenched and approaching the upper threshold of our tolerance wrench he asked can i pick him up yes please she went into his room and then i heard our door bell i went to answer and on the other side r too and why peaty officers e man and a woman the woman asked is that your baby crying yes were responding to a child in endangerment call my mind was slowly grasping what was happening leery the loudest guy i know hade been screaming much that a neighbor called the copse on us they thought we were abusing very we need to do a child welfare check they said i knew these checks can turn into investigations if you are poor it can isolate fasted uneven if you are not it can be terrifying does leery have a scratch or bruseright now are there piles of laundry lying around my a dredge in his pumping and the voice in my head is telling me to say fuck you slam the door and run with very out the back but do not listen to that voice we do not have a back door i studied myself you really do not need to do that my wife she is feeding him right now he is busy the male officer countered either we go into his room or you bring him to us we will not leave until we complete a visual inspection o i went to hero's room and told them a the cops are here they need to see very but ism breath feeding i told them that she brought very to the door the woman officer asked are you making all that noise very was calm in mama's arms ma said sleep training is hard the woman officer nodded she gave him a little has baby wave and in a sweet voice said o you need to go to sleep before they went i asked e just out of curiosity can you tell me which neighbor called duties no oh boy i i make us i started to hate all the neighbors who lived within ear shot and did not make y contact rely training experiment was over we were back to laying on the floor next to his crib and trying to tiptoe out of his room when the coast was clear often it was not one night very pass the point to no return crying whether i was there or not and i got scared that the neighbor might called the copse again then i heard a police iron going past our apartment i thought i can work with this did you hear that very stopped crying and listened the policeman he is driving by to check if you are going to sleep and you are crying loud he can hear you leery asked what will he do now there are moments in life that feel they define what kind parent you are would i be the kind of morally banker apparent that scares my child to sleep i looked sweetleroy in his big beautiful brown eyes and told him if the cops come back they will take us away in different cars he curled up under his blanket and closed his eyes tight i left the room shut the door behind me held my breath and waited silence incredible it worked and oh got what if i dot i reported the news to gemma oh know she said he must be scared do you think i should go tell him they are not coming i do not know of e well butts never talk about this again the next night very asked about the policeman is he coming back i said yes and very went to sleep gemma i did it again please do not tell me that do you want me to stop i do not know i said well now you are complicit this became our new routine warm bath cold milk gemma would virtuosically perform all the voices in a stack of books then i would take very to bed in threatened state violence and we would all go to sleep after a while it stopped working he got while that the police were not actually coming to our apartment every night and he started crying again when i would leave now i think it was shakespeare who once wrote and ism paraphrasing here when you find yourself half way in a river of blood either way you go he got go through half a river of blood i forged towhead one night when zeros crying i closed the door behind me took a deep breath and band down his bedroom door it is the police go to sleep just cancel me now and yet it worked we were living in an imaginary police state for what ism sure child psychologists would agree was too long then one night very asked me a question i did not see coming will the policeman take my nightmares away take his nightmares away not him somehow in hero's cool weird mind he figured out that if the policeman was scary he could also scare whatever was haunting his dreams i was stunned of course i said he will take your nightmares he will put them in the back of his squad car and take them to jail very had taken his fear and more it into something that could protect him i tried to teach very out to sleep and pass along a healthy fear of the police he learned neither her is three now our bed time routine is less violent i lay down next to him in his big id bed until he is asleep the plan is to do this until he turn say to what are we down i a o test a sounds easy he just going i you fever then give the hungriness over i street kindoraga as pretyturn i shall currently iupparrentiblye with a new baby to sleeves and likes it well on his own skep this n o and a three notes on cycling we

with the home office it overlooked a dumpster in the driveway he threw stuff out the window a girl from germany helped me to fenestra she was a high schooled who through some sort of exchanged program in turned at the church i asked her what sort of responsibilities a church in turn had and she either did not understand the question or rise t ignore it and i did not press the issue the hard part was the furniture bran and i tackled the heavy stuff the drawers and dressers and cabinets the dumpster was overflowing we had to break down the furniture before lifting it up and tipping it in i felt a child satisfaction turning the detritus of the strangers life into ever smaller bits of torn wood and pop nails towards the end of the day bran and i move two red wood bookshelves on to the lawn we

turn looking at you at the end of the summer i lost my best friend lost is not the right word to use as it implies passivity in my part broke up is closer except that seems to only apply to romantic relationships pushed away my best friend rejected her something that i spent the summer biking to her apartment down town i told her about the chain smoker and the dead woman and the weird scent of loneliness in their houses we cook dinner played board games watch movies we did the things we always did except now i did not wanted dozen i told her that e did not spending time with her that i did not er that i did not want to be your friend that it was not her fault but mine that i did not understand it either that i continued doing the things i did cause i did not know what else to do that therefore i should stop and therefore we should stopping friends it struck me even then as a pretty shitty explanation lush this came out in conversation we had walking back to the house i was living an my big going as i felt a twist in my chest was hiding a terrible secret except when i revealed it my heart twisted tiger a few days later she sent me nine hundred eighty eight word casebook message an exert o with read things are bad can you just ask for break instead of thing i do not want to be friends any more and if you actually do not want to trying you more and your certain you want to let us go then you can decide to break up but it is literally the most hurtful thing you can do when you do that only do it when you really truly decided that you want to let me go and i will let go which does not mean thati'll stop loving you or caring about you or praying for you but in the end all get to be coquet with not having you be apart of my life you are more important than this relationship i sent her toward response hoke for before the school yer started i saw her one more time she told me that he did not mean what i was doing that self soothing was warping my thinking that pushing her away seem the right thing to do now but when some anything in retrospect is my last chance she folded the piece of paper into a five pointed star she been in a church soul tree the previous week end an told me an illustration she heard about queer youths who come out in the church when they start out they have their family friends classmates acquaintances in the church she pointed to a stars point reach category when they come out in a conservative christian setting they usually lose their family first she said ripping off the piece of the star she went through every category tearing the star part piece by piece until all that was left was a jagged pension i do not remember if i said anything i laughed and in seer for year let me tell you the point these days the breaks on my bike do

welcome to the huborman capon a n as science science pace then li i manner supermen and ism a professor of neurobiology an opthemology at stamford school of medicine we are now live to day with our annual and lifetime members of the humeral labpodcast premium channel first off i just won a welcome everyone thank much for being here i hope you are having a good holidays and ale wish you a happy new year at this point and again at the end i want a kick off our discussion to day by just high lighting some of the incredible things that you all have already done the premium channel as most of you presume we know provide support for important research and when i say important research we can define that as research that is done on humans with humans with their consent of course that we believe stands the highest probability of leading to you quality treatments and improvements in mental health physical health and performance support from the premium channel that is from you has already allowed us to make several substantial gifts to serious laboratories as well as some other on some other endeavor it'll just quickly tell you where those funds have gone and they will to you something really truly exciting about where were headed and twenty twenty four we will get to the questions in a moment but i think this is important to hear first of all we made a u a your long gift and when i say your long gift at were tugging gifts that i certainly can say for my perspective as a research or whose run a laboratory for a very long time these are the size gifts that allow researches to do research that they otherwise would not have been able to do they pay salaries they pay for materials in the laboratory they pay for the sorts of things that allow science to happen that would not otherwise happen we made a gift o doctor area drums laboratory at stamford in the department f psychology she studies mind set some of you may have seen the episode with alley as she is called am doctor drum on the human podcast she studding mind sets an how they effect both mental health and physical health in children and adults and that work hopefully willet a report back on at some point soon about how those mind sets can improve performance in school work athletics and other airs of life the idea here is that you supported that work through the premium channel and then that work can happen and then we can get the information about what the conclusions of that work are out into the general population meaning into the public that people can benefit from that knowledge right away and in many cases implement that knowledge we also made a gift to doctor scotching panda the salt constitute for biological studies such and panda is in expert in circadian biology and intermittent fasting and the study he is using those fun for relates to intermittent fasting as a specific tool for improving mental health we also made gift to doctor carleshats in at stamford university school of medicine she studying how the immune system and maternal conditions and in especially infections or a serious kinds that am pregnant women sometimes encounter or get can affect the developing feudal brain and that work also relates to stemselvs i northers a lot of excitement about themselves nowadays it'll give you not date on that as soon as i can we also made a substantial gift o doctor gonna stun glass at colombia university school of medicine doctor stun glass has not yet been on the podcast bufleeco we will have time to come on the podcast at some point soon a she studying and developing novel treatments for eating disorders if you did not see the episode on healthy in disordered eating madly a anterectia aroma is the most deadly of all the psychiatric conditions that is a great number of patients that have anterectio serosa unfortunately go on to die a a man nourishment in things related to man nourishment it is it critical critical issue that is not talked about enough and frankly is not am well funded enough at the level of federal funding but am through your support there is now funding am siphoning into her laboratory and she is directing those fun directly at novel treatments based on hero science and habit formation for eating disorders anorectic and others being disorders doctor eolian willies also at stamford who does work on transcrinial magnet stimulation which the tool to non an easily alter neral circuits in the brain a for purposes of relieving depression and p t it and excitingly doctor willies laboratory also combines t mas trains chino manic stimulation with psychedelic treatments a in particular begin but also silicivan others a lot of excitement about that and then last certainly not least a we also funded a chronobiology conference they were am desperate for funds a reached out and we were delighted to provide the funds for that a conference those funds aloud graduate students and nostocs who come from laboratories that could not afford to send those students in stocks that conference to attend that conference and i must say from a lot of years of experience in the scientific commune the ability to attend these high quality meetings is absolutely critical for those young scientists to be able to glean important information and go back to their own laboratories and to make novel contributions also can be the difference between a new collaboration going sparked up or not and a i should is mention that that the research laboratories the we fund were at a much higher level than the conferences but the conferences i think are also really important am way to direct funds doctor those ye done chronobiology is how the timing of light temperature and exercise and eating affect health s all things that i think a people are interested in a that is it for what we covered am and what we supported in twenty twenty three a very proud of the support that we were able to provide thanks to your help and i am very very excited to announce that while in twenty twenty three it was sitcom us the chevron lapodcas through your premium a channel support that allows us to make that support and we had a matching donation dollar for dollar donation from the tiny foundation heading into twenty twenty four tiny foundation is going to continue to do a dollar dollar a dollar for dollar accuse me which is exciting and we have brought on in addition to that to other donors who are going to also do dollar for dollar donation another words for every dollar that the hurt lab premium channel has or raises in twenty twenty four there will be three dollars to match that this is phenomenal and what it means is that the si common human lapodcas are now doing on what is considered on universe cases as major philanthropy very exciting am and thank you owe very much for your support you are making a difference in the research and i do not jut say that i know any time there is under razors things that sort by the way this is not a fund razor this us thing saying thank you to you but it is always hard to know where this funds go and am we make sure that the whole process of very street line we cut the fat on the on in every dimension that m the money can go to discovery new tools for mental health physical health in performance thank you much oke first question is up caroling a writes i am interesting studies about the intermix singular quarter oh yes such an interesting structure we you please share any information regarding those thank you or all you do in the advancements idea thank you for all you do and the advancement of science caroling and others listening o case to the entermidsing quarter for those of you that a may not have seen the episode on will power and tenacity but even if you have is a region of the brain that is involved in leaning in to difficult challenges of all kinds this is an area of the brain that gets larger when we embrace effort that leads to a bit of internal anxiety but it is something that is good for us an adaptive thing and this is an area of the brain that gets smaller when we do not engage in challenging endeavors now we need to to fine challenging endeavors very specifically challenging endeavors that stimulate the growth of the intermix singlet quarters are challenging endeavors that we would prefer not to do we may want the enroll writes we may want the the consequence of the exercise the consequence of the learning the consequence of whatever the challenge is but that the challenge itself feels uncomfortable and here of course we want to be a uncomfortable but safe challenges is what is what gun grow the inter midsingulat quarter now another thing but the intermidsingli quarter at important is that for people that end at being successful dieter successful a pursuit of fitness for people that am complete a degree or finish an exam or things that sort the intermidsingli quarter bigger for people that fail to do the work required to prepare the preparation that is ah the interamisingla quarter actually shows a bit of atrophy that intermidsinglit quarter is an anatomical and hurry reflection of will power and tenacity and i think what people get wrong over and over about the sorts of findings is that the intermidsingula quarter is really responding to a variety of inputs as a lot of different and puts an out puts we know that base on neral circuit tracing but it absolutely responds best to things that feel that they are indeed difficult that they are a challenge if you are me and you enjoy certain forms of exercise and its just pure bliss for you the whole way through that is not going to grow your intermix singular quarter however if you ad of it of let us say a higher intensity work i doing a long run or height on sundaes i do not do sprints too often at the end of that ah but if i were to do couple hillsprints at the end and i really this this is rough this socks that is actually the sort of thing that is can a stimulate the intermidsingulate quarter the steroid lingulate quartexince caroling you asked about studies was actually a discovered in cases where people were stimulating this bran area and the subjects these were peoplwere seeing their a surgery for other reasons reported feeling something was impending some not impending doom but there was some challenge they were going to head into a storm something challenging was coming but the other subjective feeling that they reported was feel they could lean into it there ready for there ready to meet that challenge wat you are looking for when you are interested in growing your intermix singular quarter it'll tell you why that is a good thing to do is you look in for that feeling of leaning into challenge that friction if something is too easy or its too delightful that is not in a contribute to your intermix lingulate quarter a function and growth i might contribute other things indeed it will am and life is not all about leaning into challenge but why would you want to stimulate your intermix lingulate quarter in this way and by way those challenges can come from physical endeavors and come from language learning it come from hard conversation that your on you been putting off that is hard for you to have lord knows we all it'll have those aspects of our lives of tings that were putting off r that are hard for us or that feel difficult again keep these endeavor safe never one to do anythngtht would damage your mental health or physical health but leaning into challenge in that way does seem to activate and grow the intermix lingulate quarter now the advantage of that is that there are studies excuse me showing that the called super ages they super ages i do not that name much as should its a bit of a misnomer they call them superagers but they really should be called superior ages because these are people who seem to maintain healthy cognac function much longer than most individuals their memory the i cue is remain stable into their much much later decades of their life or even improves over time and then the correlation and gan thesis correlation but these are these people's intermix singular quarter does not atrophy and in general what the studies point you in there still needs to be more data collected on this is that these people are regularly engaging in things that are hard for them and challenging and they have embrace that challenge lot to say it about intermix singular quarter ah but i think i that grabs the top contour and am ism a big fan of trying to do something difficult at least one thing ideally every week am and perhaps even every day a little bit it does not take much a maybe en just five minutes it is that friction that feeling h i do not only do this i cannot do this and then continuing to practice are continuing to lean into that challenge safely of course a that is going to grow that intermix signalling correct and i just think that is amazing right we are much about brain atrophy and memory loss and et camera et veterans we get older lot of data now about he tigers ore health healthy physical function here wee really talking about how to maintain healthy cognate function and the intermix seenglit vortex seems to be a barometer of how well we are doing that mark s ask we love to hear more about an evening routine and not just morning especially when it comes to light i love this question log this question because have made a lot of changes in the last year related to this because know there is thingy on the inner net that talks about the importance of getting morning sunlight ism just getting there are several of us but an gals but i suppose have been quite vocal about the imports of getting morning sunlight as soon as possible after waking and of course of course of course unless you have powers ism not aware of if you wake up before the sun comes out oubaoiys ask what do i do you wait till the sun comes out if it is overcast you get outside a bit longer if you want a wake up before the sun comes out turn on bright artificial lights o these days of out shelve been playing around lo it with some bright artificial lights ism before i because i tend to wake up before the sun is out is the winter months but in any case love talked a lot about the morning routine in the early part of the day and a bit about the afternoon a part of the day evening routine oo kat we'll tell you ideal and then it'll tell you what i do ism always shooting for ideal but ism human i think there is this idea on the internet am that have seen that you my whole life as is protocols protocol protocol protocol and indeed sometimes it looks that in indeed sometimes it does not ism human things happen we all encounter different challenges chance your crust a question directly mar i think it is i know it is very important that if possible that you get it we will splash o sunlight in your eyes in the afternoon in evening why why is that important and what we really talking about here is not necessarily seeing he sunset of the beach a though it'll be great if you could do that be getting some sunlight in your eyes before the sun goes down maybe for five ten minutes it is not as important as the morning sunlight but it does have a great benefit and the benefit is it a just the sensitivity of the neurons in your retinal in your brain such that it protects you against brighter artificial lights later in the evening now does not protect you completely but what it does is if normally and this is true bright light viewed for fifteen seconds or more between the hours of ten p m and for i m ism toning about somebody on a standardscedual not shift worker bright lights viewed for fifteen seconds or more between thehours of ten p m and for i m can dramatically quash millstone and levels milestone of being the homo that involved in feeling sleepy in falling a sleep it does other things as well of course it secreted from the pineal we know based n a really nice study published since reports that if you view that afternoon late afternoon evening sunlight do not to be too strict about the time yet young pop sun glasses off as long's you can do that safely get some sunlight in your eyes or if you cannot look directly at the sun and by the way never stare directly at the sun at least getting some day light in your eyes before the sun goes down that can offset that monotone an reduction by about fifty five zero percent which is pretty impressive now you would still do well to dim the lights in the evening and one thing that have been playing with recently is a using red lights am a lot of people when they hear red lights i think oh your talking about you red light panel which that has its use is those ten to be very bright red lights or a in a portable red light i ash use a small portable red light looks a piece of thick piece of toast a i use that for other reasons this is not what we are time out with evening routine with evening routine it can be beneficial and very very cost effective to get some red bulbs and put them inlay the bedroom where you read before you go to sleep or in a particular room in your house you tend to spend time and in the evening makes for r nights mellow feel but at also does several other things first of all it if there the correct red bulbs andi'll mention the once that have been using in a moment they eliminate all the blue wave wants that tend to be stimulating for they well we all the noragenergic system a drendallind nor drendlind carters all et camera indeed there is a study shows that when shift workers who halve to be up at night use red lights of the time this describing when they work under red light they have lest of a quotes all increase than where they to work understander florescent lights or even standard belly d lights number one thing would be dim the lights in the evening in at night as much as you safely can to perform whatever functioning you do not fall you ow don't burn yourself of the stolen if you have to write and do work as i often do you need light a but to the extend you can shift to red lights a that can be helpful and many people many people an myself included fine that you get sleepier when you do that s i might just do this for the last hour of the evening even if ism up till ten or eleven or if i do it earlier than i ten to get really sleepy but those red lights u i but became above my bed it'll do that if ism in a read in bed i make it much easier false sleep probably because of the reduced cornice all associated with eliminating the blue wave languid and they tend to be fairly dim and now there is one brand of red light that a you actually can the ash will work on a dimmer this is important a i suppose you could use a red party lights or christian lights those can be very affordable am some people do that buts countiffestive a feel in the room other people myself will use a red light that is disable i want a mention that what ism about to say i do not have any financial relationship to this company in terms of the bulbs a red light panels are different i use the u ah i use jive type but for red lights that for the purpose ism talking about that would going to a standard lamp and that you dim where that is a very different purpose right the red light panels of a very different purpose an then red bulbs that you would put in to a standard light fixture a the disable ones a are called they you can find them as red light and just put dawn am it is the technical name a of the company is sorry forgive me for goggling this now ye it is a on charge b o and separate were charge em and those are disable and they have the proper wave lings o that is what i use em they are not superheat but they are not expensive either in cutting comparison to most a red light therapies or something we are not what red light therapy were telling about reducing the over all mount of blue light in you environment at veteran now for many people who do not want to purchase something new and again have no financial relationship to on charge i do notglean any thing i buy them with my own money and i just have one or two it them than i dim the lights even those red lights i dim while ism reading at night then fall asleep if you do not want you is red lights for whatever reason then you would be wives to just dim the lights that you have and where possible to have those lights beset fairly low in your room environment now why would that be o can will first of all the cells that activate the alertness system a in the brain through i o the retina your eye a tend to look up into your environment and mac sense because there essentially there to view sunlight and the presence or absence of sunlight but in addition to that think about it logically if i take a flash light and i shine a beam on the ground or at a tree in the yard it looks very bright but you are not getting all those photons in your eyes right you are seeing it at a distance i suppose to shining the light in your eyes it is very very bright o we whnyou have lights that are overhead and going into your eyes it is very different in the light being on the floor or on a surface this gets back to something that i often get asked how could it be that viewing sunlight through a window takes fifty times longer to activate your circadian system than it does when you step outside will it is think about that when you step outside their sunlight everywhere if you face the sun there is even more coming at you but when you are inside unlessthere is a beam of light coming through that window and the window is very clear or open for that matter you are not really getting the light in your eyes in the same way that if you are outside with the sunlight in your eyes right it is the same thing is looking it a beam of light from a flashlight against a walkers as the beam of light going at your eyes oke we talked about am dimming the lights setting them low in the room the i it is not red light therapy but changing over to red lights on charge is put just one of many out there have seen it done pretty nicely with just somebody a people grab red party lights go on whatever your favorite such engines side in red lights and yo can o that that is can be better than any blue lights and then if you can be on your screens here is what i suggests a short a cut function in your phone where you can triple click to switch your phone over to eliminate all the blues this is very different then just using the night time function very different and a i thin we should my put out of vision how to do this but what you do as you going to the accessibility function on your phone you going to color filters and then you do rag down the the blues but that is not higyour phones going to be set all dight cause then you do not see anything that is in blue but you can introduce a triple click function it'll put out eclipse soon on how to do that a when i go to sleep at night or in the evening what it'll do as all triple click and all switch my phone over to a to red only and that is completely zero cost by the way it does not cast anything and then in the morning when i wake up at clicliclic i turn on although i trying at the sunlight an miles before i look at my phone okay tom m asks light therapy recommendations for those that live in northern regions with limited morning light or two cold to get outside for morning light dark wen waking do red light therapy great question an take a sip of this bone frog because the rate om speaking if i try an keep this up for an hour and a half i i might get a little horse red light therapy is different than what i just described red light therapy is the use a red light panels t can be smaller panels the small jive that i use which is a you nits about the size of precious they call texts toast they theca thick piece of toast imprison knows why it is called texustos e pizzas big about the size of a piece of toast provides very bright red light and in between those red lights on there there tends to be near simpler red light far red to a by all just red does not mean as much as the wave length of lights o ravelings an light the six hundred and fifty to eight hundred animators is what we are talking about where as blue light is down in the you know four and five hundreds and really five thirty five to low sixes you the rainbow right red orentri a green blue the are also larger red light panels and nowadays i also see a lot of a advertisements for red light panels he rashly light down in red light beds here is the story red light we will often be marketed as the most powerful the most intensity the most locks most important is the proper wave lengths or are the proper wave lengths and that is why use the jive because eve has the proper wave lings of red and far red the distance to view a red light of that sort generally is about eighteen inches sometimes a lit closer now some nice people w put red light on different parts of their body i covered a bit of this in the light and health episode but red light because it is longer wavelength light can permeate through tissues to fairly substantial depth how deep depends on the tissue if you put up against your skull is again to get down into your brain no it is not ckingto get through your skull may be a little bit if it is a very high powered red light if you are holding a red light of that power at home somethings wrong i do not that is a medical it is a medical device however jet are medical grade red light and near him for red lights and they are quite powerful there the right wavelets actually that is why i prefer jive because they are they are medical grade they can be directed at your eyes in the morning for the purpose of there is a a study out of two studies actually out of glen jeffrey's laboratory the universe c college onion showing that viewing red lights at a distance of about eighteen inches or in the morning for people who are over forty but not for people younger by the way that can offset sum of the age related reductions in maticondr function and vision loss i look at a red light in this you myth you texts tost light or ever a of panel am at a distance of about i confess i stand about twelve to sit eighteen inches away and i do not force myself to look at that light i do not hold my eyelids open i allow myself to blink him comfortable truth told you probably close your eyelids and some of that red light as can to get through your eyelids not a ton but some no problem blinking you never ever ever whole ta look at any light sunlight or otherwise red light any light bright that is painful to look at if you have to blink it is too bright step back if you have to blink every once in a while that is look abut if you have to blink in order to to close your eyes in over protect your eyes then you are standing too close in the morning you can do red light sarape on skin you can do it on eyes will it wake your system up will it provide the kind of a quarters all increase which by the way you want early in the day and a drendlein a dopamine increase that sunlight can provide the answer is no sunlight as you unique in that way however if you living an area of the world that is too dark or am you wake up long before you get sunlight in your eyes what can you do well you can flip on artificial lights you do that the opposite of how i recommend in the evening you would want a flip on overhead lights as bright as possible if you a have the disposable income and you want to invest in a ten thousand lucks light panel or nine hundred lucks light panel again have no financial relationship to these companies but am there is a light panel nine hundred lucks drawing tablet that have set on my desk for a number of years recently i confess have started a experimenting with some of the ten thousand lucks light panels that sit on your decks desk excuse me those are very very bright and i do use that now if i wake up early early in imine to do some work it'll turn that thing on and it sure wakes you up now is it as good as sunlight no it does not have the right color features and alternation between yellow and blue that morning sunlight has and that evening sunlight has and without doing a whole tutorial when the sun is low in the sky call lo sol or angle sunlight you will nose if you take a picture with your phone provides not a cloudy day you will see that there is a lot of blue yellow contrast and that is the optimal stimulus that said if it is overcast out you should still get outside because some of those way y lings are coming through even though you cannot perceive the blue in the yellow these you can get a ten thousand lucks light but if you cannot afford that or you do not want to oh and by the way those you you set on your desk you turn on for five ten minutes while your making coff here in things that sort the action recommend thy do not keep them on too much some people she in feel to you for i can have even gel all headache as it is a lot of blue light that is one thing the other thing you can do is that if you cannot a a access light of any kinds a dark dark dark that is where the cold shower really an help could you get that a renal and bump am early in the day which is goods early no e day provided you are not going into states of annas tidy as a consequence of it getting a dredge in dopamean carters all increases as great and then as the day goes on and the evening and night times certainly you want a taper tale levels of those narrow chemicals off now of course there is always going to be some quarters all there always going o be some upwind veteran there always be dopamine your system if you got dancing you go to a party at night should you worry about the lights now gay i ham not despite what you might presume or hear read i ham not a the fort a person were son glasses an a party although the other day i was at a party in some on was wearing some last i theknows for other reasons the a the that a that gives the impression her with something bad going on i think thy were just looking cool by the way am and they did look cool but i do not do that and if i drive at night at an were i do not were am sun glasses i do and i have been exploring the use of a blue light filter glasses in the evening and those red lights in my house but are them for most people if you get out every one lo go out til late night you out dancing you hae a party with friends nan w yo get home dim the lights buses those red lights gets asleep early in the day bright lights i really from sunlight bright bright bright bright bright how bright as bright as possible and as many as you a is reasonable except to the extent that it could damage your eyes o do not be staring at any bright lights successively oka i think that a preach summaries it and of course early day it is really about sunlight or light of other kinds cold water if that is your thing if that is not your thing that is fine there was no tablet that a descended down to us telling us that we had to get into cold water each day it is an option it is all an option penis from eunuch i eunuch in there in a while but s to go an mocks plonk eunuch for a number of times beer year and i is the food a miss chnizil as we approach a new year what health and fitness metrics you recommend checking oh good one and could you share your annual medical fitness check routine oke a what am about to say ism sure will u generally jib with what doctor peter aria who ism sure you all know n i m respect tremendously also grateful to coma close friend a basically asserts is important for fitness a i think if you are gin to do a fitness last you know peters got it in mind and i generally gree deli your body weight ten times in the same set hang from a bar for a minute or more of in the same sat a these sorts of things i tend to be far less p e class about it frankly a might is always the same am forty eight years old have ben doing the same training program ever since i was sixteen more or less i man have had young it peaks and valleys an terms of my consistency based on other obligations and course when ism sick i do not train sick people stay out of gems please nothing makes me more frustrated than people showing up to get their work out and getting everybody sick here is the deal i try to been capable that is ready for various things what the ability to go on a long hike what is a long hike five to ten miles with some hills the ability to sprint for the airplane without blowing a gasket the ability or that means hurting oneself for having a critic the ability to carry some heavers furniture with assistance safely or god forbid to take a trip and not damage myself and of course to have some level of agility and coordination how how does one do that what help fitness metric to i recommend checking well ism in to do this next week because it is the end of the year but pretty much every week it is the following three party vascular training sessions one is long meaning an hour to ninety minutes that is can be slow for me this could be a weighted hike weight vested hike re you just put some weight in a backpack we just be a hike if it is really steep or a longbow jog once a week for me it is jogging or hiking for other people cycling or swimming some time in the middle of week ism doing a thirty five minute run may be five minutes of warm up and then a faster or thirty five minute run get also do it o rower you could also do on bike but you've really pushing up around ion may be i i do not tend to measure heart rate but where it is i could not hold a conversation ism working ism working working ism not sprinting but ism working and then another time during the week a shorter work out of a twelve minutes s to give me three minutes of warm up some calisthenics little bit of cycling on an a salt bike or something that sort of salt bikes to the ones where you have the handles with the fan work of the a rail or or could be any sprinting hill and then doing sometimes one minute on one minute of for twelve minutes sometimes doing twenty seconds on ten seconds off for eight rounds and it is real work it is getting the hart race all the way up vet two macks the commination of those three types of party of vascular training sessions a that ism ready to sprint for the airplane ism ready to take a long hike any time ism i can go out for a two mile run and really enjoy that if i i need to it is a readiness thing and i think it covers all basis am i ever going to be a marathoner or a champion sprinter with that or a mile or no but that is not my goal and it never has been i ran a cross country races in high school and tell out story another time it was e loft fun until i hat the second mi the other thing i do three times a week as i work out with the resistance training i train my legs one day that is calves hamstrings quads i train my tor that i do some pushing for my shoulders an upperchestn some dips that kind of things some pull up some rowing the sort thing i train my neck as i ma big believer in that for the upper spine but i do not do not go at it heavy is just really to maintain a posture and to make sure that up wit upper spine is supported somethingthat most people neglect and then one day a week i do smaller body parts it'll do my cap the train my cars again basis triceps it'll make sure that if there any small body parts that happen a miss during the mile the week because of scheduling rearrest or sone the it'll do that may be lo it more neck work or some work one those are spread out about a day apart i do not get too obsessed with the spacing between those work outs but they are not all stacked against one another might be in my case it is it is long run on sundae this is just how i do it money tends to be off a excuse me long run on sundae or hike money is legs scutes me money is always legs tuesday off wednesday i generally would do that shorter run or the torso work i flit flop them depending on how my legs are feeling and the next day i do whatever i need to do either the torso resistance training or or the thirty five minute run and then fridges that faster clip cardie sturdy tends to be the smaller body parts basis crisis et camera i must say these days of the week always have the able ability to slide one way or the other for instance if ism travelling and i do not get back on sundae out until late it'll if i was not able to do that training whiles on the road than i will do it on money and then i just slide things around that i finish off the week with everything done and i can get back on schedule but the way one arranged it everybody park gets it twice once directly once indirectly and the cartvascular training is is covers all basis why train this way well it in sure strength it insures whatever esthetic changes you want you can emphasize working harder and more sets perhaps for the things that you one a bring up certain body parts camera at a weaker you can am certainly recover cause your only training likes once a week but gets what your you are doing them on money and you are sprinting on fridge there getting hit indirectly on fridge even if it is on the bike those that fast hard peddling with resistance is going to make sure that your legs are not going atrophy can still get but you can still train them again on money again this schedule is design in a very specific way none of the work outs except the longer work out on sundae that a roger runners longer than an hour ever it is ten minutes a warm up in fifty fives were minutes of work in the gems sometimes sixty sometimes all truncates of forty five or forty if ism really i have a bunch of things going on this sort of schedule sounds a lot but it is not it is actually of very small investment by an hour a day and not even on tuesday which is a rest day what are the metrics that i recommend checking well ism a big believer that if you are sleeping well your appetite is consistent and your feeling generally good that is an important metric it is very subjective metric but that is important are you sleeping well ore you waking up sore and you are not able to recover are you feeling no matter how much sleep you get you cannot feel rest end these kinds of things now there could be other factors involve but that is the sort of basic one the other one is how much energy and pep are you bringing to your work outs that is important and it were late to alien and fueling in all those sorts of things which we are not talking about ray nonce far too much to talk about here but we did cover in the foundational thinness protocol by the way all of this is put into a pity f that is a ribbon line at you remain paddock calms your cost simply go to the news letter that tab under the manor and you can scroll down i blah find the foundational fitness erotically gets into sets and raps and loads and all that kind of stuff completely our o cost i do take my morning resting pulseryt i know what my pulsate ought to be if it is elevated substantially and ism not particularly stressed about something then ism mi pay attention to that and back off a lo bit in the intensity on things if have a throat tickler ism not feeling very well ism really careful about working out sometimes it'll do it sometimes i wont it'll make sure that is not just some sort of dust or allergen in the environment but if ism feeling under the weather it'll take it'll just skip i skipped that work out and some yo will go you skip because you are you it'll be honest ism forty eight been training very consistently i am fortunately knock would will be suspicious knockham wood i have avoided major injuries have been able train consistently and have also do not tend to succumb to colds and flues i think about once every eighteen to twenty four months have had a cold er flew of some sort for for many years that is been the the kind of cadence but not more frequent than that i think in part because i do not tend to push really hard when ism sick i tend to be the guy got right ism ism feeling count under the weather she train may be not of coming to take a hot shower and get in bed at six p m read in go to sleep if i wake up at three a m because i went to bed to early chilling bed and read may fall back to sleep may be not i think taking care of oneself in that way is very beneficial and then people say will you have an ad kids have had kids in the house and i also know what it is to get sick because o mates an all the stuff and working with people an working in a medical enter your always exposed to thing ism i hear you loud and clear we cant avoid exposure to ism infectious vectors n as they are called ism delightful in the form of kids but i the reality is i trying back off when ism not feeling well i push when ism feeling good ism not one to do to a day work outs and ism very careful about not exceeding my my program i ism very careful about that i do not go crazy i do not do too pollutes classes than go to the him and i'malso not the i was complaining about his back or always being sick and i do not have young like phenomenal genetics for with respect to fitness you'd small jointed or relatively eve a medium size joints ism not particularly strong nor do have particularly strong in durance i think ism con n the middle in arms of medical fitness check i do blood work every six months i find that to be that is identified a few things that for me needed taking care of and i pay a lot of attention to over all feelings of well being and i chart them frankly i on my calender is my are my work out it but the level i put lay ell one to ten to my my work outs or in the six to eight out of ten intensity ism not measuring this up by any kind of ism device and if i get sick i tend to look back and say what was going on before i got sick ism if ism getting substantially weaker or ism feeling o fatigue i i i take stock of what is going on i think ism some you all get the impression manly hi branalitic about all things and am you know i would say a teas much more into measuring things and i love that about him ism more of the mind set we chi if ism feeling good and i feel in i can move my body well not to any makes in pains location i get a little something of a lob o disboulder something but and then take care of it but in general it is about being able to feel good seated feel good moving be able to have that readiness readiness readiness for me that is the foundation of of health a other a things you get a regular as an i do have an appointment opthemology department do that air puffed for glaucoma there are treatments for glaucoma but you need to know if you have it a lot of people do not now if they have it it is the second leading cause o blindness world wides i can only cataract it is very easy last you gadget from optometrist or opthemologist get that i miss your vision is precious invasion is precious i i cannot overstate that enough a generally pretty inexpensive as well specially from the optometrist and the drop's work pobloev asks what do you do with waking up wit the mill midnight and cannot go back to sleep oh such a good question i have three different tools that i use first of all long email breathing just to trying call myself i was a than relax my face if i do this righteous need me funny but relaxing the face tends to relax the jaw and then of do a progressive body relaxation i do use the revert r v e r i a and they have a specific hypnosis for falling back asleep hypnosis is self directed hypnosis david'speagle who is been against on the podcast is voice is terrific for hypnosis you men just think mama's voice makes me wane to go under typically with revery you practise the falling asleep falling back to sleep hypnosis only eight minutes long you practise that the daytime and then you can use in the mill the night if you need to that does require that you have your phone present and by the way if you are going to do that hypnosis you can select whether not you are going to do the one were you have to interact and speak ere not i the on we do not interact also if you sleep new to some one it will not wake them ugh revery's great for this purpose and and you might think hypnosis that is wacky or that is a nounomagic carpets but it is not this is a you now hypnosis by the way is one of the few a proved medical treatments for very psychological psychiatric conditions were not talking about stageshypnosis people clucking chickens we talking about you learning to self direct relaxation which is a skill that you can enhance in hypnosis such as with revery i think revery now is a a free trial and available and android an apple and it is a nominal cost when you compare to thing is supplements or sleeping bills it is a few dollars each month it be seven eight dollars something that some one will tell me but ifyouthink about the cost relative to some other purchasable it is relatively low the other thing and this is something is completely your cost and i cannot encourage it enough is that you get into a regular practise of non sleep deep breast and it are or yoganedra and that you do that during the daytime there is a ten minute ants r that i did which is available on you too be just put ends to a humor minutesofvail completely s your cost it will teach you how to self direct your own relaxation and you can all we us in the mill the night if you wake up many people fall sleep during anestiars that fine or yoganedras many of which are available on the internet free acari completely for yoganegers a like bit different the enemy are it is a category of non sleep de breast that includes intentions and things of that sort self directed relaxation but relaxing is a skill now there are few things that you can do to avoid waking up the mill the right one is trying limit the total amount of fluid that you drink in the last couple hours before sleep do not go to bed with a superfuse belly ah some people find that if they take threonine which is something that is in the sleep stack that i recommend and by the way i do not necessarily believe that everyone needs to take supplements in order o sleep i thin you should get the behavioral stuff the light the exercise not drink caplin to late in the day avoiding a can ideally completely but maybe late in the day especially et camera et camera and if you cannot get your sleep right that way then perhaps you start to rely on er enhance your sleep capabilities with supplements but there certainly not a requirement the sleep supplement thiamine which is in the called he were in lav sleep stack which it includes magnesium three in eight and apigenane ah and threonine threonine for some people can really crate vivid dreams and then they wake up from those dreams they have hostile falling a sleep in that case i would just reduce the dose a job or eliminate the therein some people to use a nocitall nine under milegraman coital because they prefer that and it without works better or ah for them then the sleep stack or some be believe in take it addition of the sleep stack as long as dosages are followed there is no reason to thing that any the stuff it is not safe but of course check with your doctor before adding or removing anything from your supplement protocol or any protocol for that matter i say that to protect you not to protect me the other thing the you can do if you wake up in the mill the night is to not look at the time now that is a love it different if you are going a look at your phone but this is something that folks at the stamper sleep clinic taught me that people look at the time when they wake up in the mill the night generally have a harder time falling back asleep to extent the you can refrain from doing that and certainly do not get on your phone and start scrolling frommedia try and stare try their every a try yoganedra try some long email breathing all those protocols by the way include long ex breathing and if you are taking melatonin before sleep often times you will fall asleep very readily and then wake up if your tigamill tony you might want a re consider that melatonin does have its place for treatment of jet lag an things of that sort in the acute situations and not taking it too often but in general dosages are too his people take too much of it and too often in my opinion but that is just my opinion and then i would say if you wake up in them on middle the night and you simply cannot fall back asleep just remember that you can survive one night with minimal or no sleep unfortunately we have all had to deal with that it starts becoming a chronic condition then you may want to talk to a sleep specialist but we have done multiple episodes if suberin labor cast the master sleep perfect your sleep e have a sleep news letter that you should defiling download its zero cost again hover in labdaccom news letter go to menu news letter and can find that for those have the subscribed to the premium chantelon messing the years of it aware of these am various tools but one thing we know from the sleep habit stamford is that when people are excited about their next day sometimes they wake up and that their sleep actually can be less than normal an they can function well the next day in fact there been two studies at least that ism aware of two studies there may be more showing that when people are given quoting poor sleep score their coolant performance and physical performance is diminished even if they slept really long and really well they have lied to them in these studies conversely if people have not slept that much and they wresleep receive a great sleep sore they perform really well these sleep scores while i them i look it my eat sleep sleep score or whoop sleep score some people us or a ring somethings that sort you do not want them to drive your perception of how available you are for hard work and cognac function y i tend to rely largely on subjective measures unless you were telling about things ape be or collateral levels you subjectively a guessing what grate will be level as it is not a good approach right er resting heart right there real metrics but you only be careful about relying too heavily on am bow metrics glean from devices even if there accurate do not put too much weight into take the average see how you are doing lately if your sleepscore's dropping each day by fifteen twenty points well then pay attention to that or your hart rates going of or going down averages averages averages and be a scientist of yourself coach ruby writes what is the best protocol for strain training without hypertrophy for women great question when have lifted heavy waits at in to bulk up fast oke want to embrace more resistance train without the but great question here is the interesting me about wait training it is kind o cool you will never get larger then the called pump that you achieve in a single work out what in me by that well lot of people and women in particular are concerned about getting quote too big too bulky and indeed some women some men react very quickly to wait training they have high fiber density and for whatever reason om could be form hormones but it probably also has to do with different types of prolines that are expressed in the muscles and even the connective tissues some people yes grow quotiquot faster from wait training but i will ell you this no one's ever looked it await or picked up await done a set and then i portrayed much that it was permanent right the the call pump the bloodflow that you get into a muscle gives you a little window into what that muscle might look if you feed it and rest it properly can recover and hypertrophy does that mean that you should avoid the call pump the blood flow into the muscle now what we know from got sh because to be forty years of a physiological data and probably hundreds of years of a just outside the laboratory data that very heavy weights in the range of one to three repetitions generally make people stronger but there is not much hypertrophy when you get from three to five repetitions you are still in the mostly strength some hypertrophy range when you get out towards six repetitions out even thirty repetitions provide the sets are going to failure you cannot perform another repetition in good form will then you are stimulating hypertrophy now there are exceptions to this there are exceptions if you do for instance a one repetitions set with a weight but that weight allows you to do that set over the course of seventy five seconds that is a lot of time undertention an you can get hypertrophy in addition to that weight training the involves in sensation of the negative the e centric the lowering portion of each repetition also a stimulate hypertrophy but also strength gains if you are somebody who wants to strain train and strain training as oh important not just for muscles but for normal function in the brain and elsewhere in the body then you really do not wat to put on any size whatsoever i would encourage you to explore some of the photo calls the doctrine y gallant and i discussed on the exercise series that we did with doctor gasping tot mud be largely training a after a warm up of course in the one to three repetition range and even some training that is done strictly for power moving the weight quickly at loads that are substantially lighter although for some people just because there genetic make up they are going to react with hypertrophy of that kind of training i would say if you want a weight train which is a great idea and you do not want to put on size be want o get stronger training that one to three repetition range now that does not necessarily mean one repetition maximums you eking you the absolute last want single rep that you cannot wit the most amount of weight maybe back off on your single repetition maxim you still just doing one repetition but course you want that repetition to be of any value in in inducing strengthen you should be getting close your one repetition man but a keep in mind also that if you are doing three repetitions heavy weights but your only resting don't thirty to yon hundred twenty men between sets well then you can get a kind of compounding a fact where you can induce hypertrophy if you react that well you a and by the way a many people do or there are some excuse me many most people do not some people do to low repetitions than you may have to increase the weight and lover the repetitions even further long rest just make sure that if you are going that kind of training if your concerned with over all health and not just power lifting are being really really strong that you are also doing some party of asculartraining which includes you do not walking plenty in the sorts of cardie that we talked about earlier stove said what are your thoughts on these full body scan and more the are becoming quite popular do you think these are beneficial or the unnecessary why got on and i paid for it i did not get it comet or anything and i must say i learned a lot fortunately i learn i do not any tumors at least not of the size that could be detected by that smart i also learn that i have a discbulge that explains a lot of times ton my life for it do a certain movement there is one or two movements that i do in the him we are running at certain stride were that thing goes and confirm that us mention a have en very grateful that hi only had one white spot on my bring the white spots are considered naturally occurring typically lesions of the of nurses everyone has es i you are allowed one perdecade of life before they start on consider a potential problem i think have that right s not whole how you can do for those by the way except do not get any more headwinds if you are doing a contact pork or construction or something where you can you now but some people still have to continue to work and if that is their work the have to work yet i think it was it was informative for me i watch a not flicks moving there was piece the move it was very good but it was cool can watch an afflicts in there and pretty easy to do they are not cheap a couple o thousand dollars minimum it was reassuring to me to not see any and tumors on my liver to mess on ma kidney noncom wood o i i mean it and to see that i did not have a lot of interior fat or anything that i mad i i doubt on the healthiest specimen that roll as ever roll through there but it was it was reassuring to me that i was it dealing with a bunch of white spots on the brain was not dealing with that sort of thing and you now is it necessary no no it is not also some people do not want to know what is going on under the hood is it unnecessary is what you asked that is a tricky one i may really depends on finances and how curious you are i will say this my good friend and former guest on the burin sapotas doctor adychang who is a medical doctrine char of nor a surgery at university californium san francisco when i told asked him about it an i told hm i got one he said oh yet we get people coming in all the time patient all the time who have got these whole body scans for recreational purposes or because they were curious and they will identify issues that need to be resolved with narrow surgery now that splits my answer in two because that is kind of scary right that could there wo be walking round with tumors on the brain and not even know it y absolutely for lot tumors or benin a lot tumors do not impinge on arras of the brain or body that create problems and never create problems and others three problems and do you want to know you want it get that numeric size their lot of non in evasive ways to deal with tumors nowadays i guess is a question whether not you want to know and when i say want to know man obviously everyonewould love to know that they have a clean bill of health under the hood but d you are you prepared for what might happen psychologically and medically in what you would have to do in order to removing issue that maybe not an issue right am it is possible that y of a you have a growth or a mass that s benin but in then y of the anxiety of the period in between s tricky i some tissues prostate tissues or i different tissues in the a female reproductive track can be enlarge but not be problematic but then people might not to make changes that to an sure that the enlargement does not continue ism a big believer in data i data while ism not being on tracking my sleep every night i do track et at night but i do not necessarily put too much weight on any one individual nights sleep score am and by the way if you get a really lousy lousy sleeps scorching are you let poorly gets great sleepscorchances are you slept well am s the stuffing between that that kind of gets people interested am i do not know i i think for me i i was happy to get the bill of health i did and had i a discovered something that needed dealing with like guess it'd be grateful that i went in for it am that is my answer but again their expensive i hope the cost comes down i hope insurance will cover these eventually working vista what a great name or killavista also am asks would you as a dog lover considering doing an episode on dog wellness an communication yes yes absolutely i love dogs o dog much it is ridiculous i just do i is a i been around em i lie thinking madam i came you with them and their family members right hostelled was a family member and i am ism eagerly anticipating getting another dog probably when we get back from tour in australia from australia am ism not can bring back an australia shepherd they have weigh to much energy for me i the hello dogs i economy of effort in a dog with us why a bulldozer a mastiff as probably good one for me yes yes and yes pat health is key relationships with pats a key do not get dog they cannot take great care of in bulldogs are a ton o work and their very expensive plan on spending at least ism not getting twenty thousand dollars o your medical bills on a dog to keep a bulldog keep i healthy adopt if you can lo dogs out their need need be adopted hide m says i need advise some thirty two ism working out for two three years but my left arm is weaker than my right how do i balance muscle strength between sizes different weights or strange great question well i guess you suing that is a lot weaker i mean i am a big believer in doing later movements i cannot remember last time into barbell curl or were a ere a the the t thing they all the easy bar this up extension i a must always do unilateral stuff doorbell curls i think the real key if you want a weaker arm or limb to get stronger is that mine muscle connection i means presumably unless there is some sort of under lying near logic thing and i soft want a scare you it is always possible but seems unlikely base on the way wore the question is that you one may sure gripping the handle the weight really tightly by thewy that will increase your strength in performance on a set to grip tightly there is normal reasons for that and that you are really working hard to contract the muscle and also use weights that you can control remember when you lift weights for sake of getting stronger it's not about lifting weights your a heal using the weight as a tool to stimulate strength and hypertrophy increases it is a tool and you do not walk around with the weight number on your body you walk around with the muscle development that you achieved and the strange that you achieved with a particular weight and no one cares with that weight is if you i you cannot carry two bags or groceries up the stairs it does not matter if you were able to carry four hundred pound dumbbells through the him right i mean that is why i think the readiness thing is key i thing we think much about the him as tat as the and point but the him is a place for training for the rest of life in my opinion else haven to be fond for me but if your left arm is weaker i would emphasize well you could perhaps do more sets certainly i would do you could do all your left arm sets first than your right arm sets if it is really substantially different you may actually want a stop training the right side as intensely for of period of time to get that left arm up there a things that but i you the lateral a work i do not do allow to on a lateral work for my legs we think i do leg curls not that is both same time i does not try in pull with both same time leg extension same time a haxquat same time glutehemory same the o e yet just keep training it but do not over train it if it is really weak because you are giving it twenty five sets may sure your allowing time for it to recover and by the way i do not know a how i cap do not recall the questions gone now how old at your but you give your body time give your my tombs our training one a sixteen give your body time it it takes time to train correctly and it takes time to develop a strong mind muscle connection and you do not do not rush do not run out there an start using do not get cavalier with form suitable or anything else just take your time enjoy your training the best advice i e or got about training am wat someready very accomplishing he said and i really internalize sos i learn to and you may toe lead the learn to learn to enjoy training really hard or just love training hard i love training hard i love it i love it i love it just learn that li lean into that process and enjoy it and if you and if there reran parts that are challenging remember your increasing the size f that medial i enter mid singular quarter last question really i was what's on wen wages keep going may will do lie a twenty four hour marathon of this and then we also do it as a as a study and sleep deprivation that don't want a vote for that have done that before i used to work thirty six hour stretches when i was in graduate school no joke we would do these physiology experiments might producer here sitting here going do not do it but is tried by the end of those experimented be wearing tinfoil on our heads and we are doing the experiment s but we built a lot of raziliencs we sit survive on in and out burgers and oi do not eat the bun cause it the carves will make you sleepy and than we we would argue about in and we i we would start to illuminate somewhere round the thirty hour mark and my friend polenta he's now professor back it a universe mainland he can he can vouch for that story but gash the as fun i i do not miss it is in my twenties a thirties yet no twenties late twenty but if people think it we may we do a funderasor the great raise extra money for research and it'll do twenty four hours a just answering questions round the clock and just see how see at what point i just complete and then i can also tachyon us had to a proper all night cause there are tools and one of the ain tools is do not trust your thinking between the hours of two thirty a m an for i m may be during that time we just all meditate together a it last question until we do the twenty four hour humeral lab a ma marathon you have plans to produce more content or photo call specifically for children development and health yes we are going do a children or child development series that also extends into adolescence and young adolophood mols not going to be doing episodes on that f some amazing guess for that man do some solos as well are there any current resources recommend for this topic yet i a allay shores book it is a little little detailed little technical s c h o r e i'llan shore i thinks how you speloplemn the the at u side will ten plan or ye a l n separate word s c h o r e is my call just some research of really talks about regulation of the he touch about right brain left brain in a way that actually is accurate the very few people ti bout right brain left brain accurately he does and talks about attachment and emotional regulation and m it is mainly folks on early childhood development there is some beautiful that there is some beautiful stuff out there that that been comes from the the psychology literature and neurosis literature on this but most gin to get my friend doctor line wilbricktd on the pod cashier of professor u it berley stays adolescent development there is just many grate folks out there that we want to bring on to the podcast and we will organize that in to some protocol something is that sort lot of work to do for us to get it all you know to since i realize sometimes podcast her long some nice people ask i often get asking what are the plans for twenty twenty four what on do keep i proving the content we are sh have some shorter form content coming out i dot want it give away what that is you no thirty minute episodes that ism capture the essence of of the most important protocols and science and yet the goal for twenty twenty four and forward is just keep improving the content and try and make it as sanction digestible for you as possible but also as thorough i if i go real short form than important details will get lost but child development is extremely important to remember where always in development development does not stop when we i twenty five development is an arc from berth until death which holy will be a long time a from now for all of you and there is just the time to explore their lot of science psychology protocol sowers on to get in to all of it was told that is the last question i confess i m but sad about that i could just keep going but may we will do this again at some point and i thing we should d that twenty four hour marathon as a fun razor i know what you think but an it'll i would do it anyway that is the that is the truth i be here anyway will not thank everyone for tuning in thanks ever much for your support of the labs i mentioned earlier if somebody who you think might be interested in that the premium channel let hem know that they can watch the early parts of those premial channel episodes on you to been listen to the on apple and notify without having to to log on for the when ism to pay not everyone has the resources for those re the devoted resources to the podcast the premium channel just know that it help support the regular podcaswhich or courses available cost free to everybody it really subsidizes that and it is also subsidizing this ah this research that is taking place in these laboratories an were going t expand the research we got the three to one dollar match of for twenty twenty four or i really enjoyed today that is the truth i love your questions i could do this all day every day ah we have win record anepso to day and to morrow and ism busy just can keep talking til they tell me it is time to stop when some one in the corner goes wet than it'll stop gerbil one our live events there suppose to and neither there go there telling me a stop it is time's up thank you everybody i hope you a great holiday i hope everyone has a very happy new years if you are meaning you may sleep by ten thirty on new years a enjoy the good nights sleep and enjoying new years day ill owing new year's day get out on new year's day enjoy something and just remember whether not you doing behavioral protocols or your superinto the supplements of the red lights the most important thing is those pillars of young sleep nutrition exercise stress management sunlight i guess were getting up to six and social connection it is is a lot to try and do all that all the time do not pressure yourself meanwhile thank you for everything that you do for us and last but certainly not least thank you for your interesting s

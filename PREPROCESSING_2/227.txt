rehab to recover from what cove did his body but it did to his life was different there is now had for that body som mans o producer on her so at on bad bless america in air when we first started talking to the staff at henry ford the intent of carrion was struggling with something they had never seen before all these patients which is not getting better these recopied patience would either die for they stay stuck on fenawaters for weeks and the staff had no idea how to get them off when the doctor red out is sh we heard the beginning of the show which circulate through the hospital talking a staff and checking in they all knew that she has a very particular approach to medicine an patient care bout making meek welcome back pagan era that rents whole approach to medicine comes out of an experience she had back in two thousand ah she was a doctor here wit henry forward and then she landed in her own i see was a patient she had milt system organ failure went on a ventilator and she told me her coworkers acted she could not hear them but she actually could what shocked and at set me the most was over hearing a resident in the halfway say she is trying to dye on me an hearing in the operating room she circling the ran the wonder scared to hear that yah it was an difficult to imagine my own recovery when everyone around me was talking about me as if i was dying a i i had said similar sales she circling the train ye an it was a culture a forgone and it was showing that you were untouched my suffering it was that it did not manner and one of the things give always felt for to be shamed agoutis the er patients have been telling u testings for years o when she recovered she returned to her job at the hospital with a new mind sat it was all about empathy the empathy would make her a bet her doctor not worse which was the opposite of her training she been taught that to much feeling clouds of doctors judgment she an a small team revamped the way the whole system tons to patients and render what a book about her experience that now used in metical schools but wouldn't covet hither i see you it became impossible for the staff to do some of the things ran up in place before loved when someone arrived unconscious orcidated into the icy new hit always asked the family would you think her love one would want me to know about them families would put up votes and bring quilts personalize the rooms the staffed that they really wanted to get to know the person they be caring for but under covet all that was impossible mammies could no longer come in get to know the staff i had one nurse farm just yester go i you all my patient for the fame likeuhat does not mean all the same and in this case they all have covidnemonia there all proved there all in the ventilator and there was the risk of of d personalization far the patient she that getting to know their patience was a part of their job but they really got a lot offal infection out of but they did not wholly realize that until cove took it away this change throughout the hospital was biggest for the nurses there the one to spend the most time with bovid patients and our next troy is about the nursing staff and pod for the i see you and hemryfor is broken up into these pods pod four was one of the front line in the hospital's coma nineteen effort it was the very first pod designated as all corn of iris patients for the other i see you pods also became all loved all the time ban callous spent weeks talking to the nurses in pod for by mid aril the nurses in pod for had adapted to the alternate universe of bovid nineteen at least in certain ways what i mean take just the p p e that is the personal protective equipment they had to wear to go into covet rooms this was a high stakes thing at this point people had seen ten icy staff get covet two colleagues were in ventilators one nurse had died some people got superstitious about always put on my gloves in this order always wear a scrub cap under the paper cab and then i will not get sick what i did not get about the p p e until talking to the nurses and pod for was the mundane relentless crazy making this of the very gear keeping them safe this arduous virtual of rubber gloves tie up gowns pe one hundred respirators that look gas mass clear plastic face shields it took five minutes to put it on to go into a room five to eight minutes to take it off when you come out you might have to do this as many as two dozen or more times every single shift how long it took to get into a room because of all the p p e is actually a good example of how bovid changed what it was for people to do even just the basic and normal parts of their jobs van gaff is a nurse in pod for he says you have these i u rooms with windows out on to the hallway all ship long you hear people banging on the the glass windows because they need be only wont into the room and they forgot the supplies to to draw blood or they forgot one medication that is a regular sound yes it is very irritating oh but we are all doing it to each other that there is a little bit of a boombooboom oh not again yet ye it was hard in the new world of loved to even communicate with these patients to explain where they were and what was happening and to reassure them and to connect with them in the way that they are used to the way ran wish tons about it were still puzzling out the ways to do that these patients many of them were sedated alone in a room with the nonstop sound of the ventilator which is loud it is like a vac nurses had to shout through their pop one hundred mans which is a gas mans and a clear plastic face shield over the roar of the ventilator now its really you are speaking through your eyes is that is really all i can s anchovy salary another nurse in pod for you got a speak through your eyes because they cannot see it or you just explain to the that you are smiling only times have said that i said i ism saying good morning with a smile on my face right out then aril a month and a half into all of this the nurses from pod for seem people who were in the throws of a crisis but also people who are used to crimes the first me i to to even asked how he is holding out ah objet ye you n i would a good ability to condo weave work at work non the second i leave i can kindogist a think about it but afore to good para avid is another nurse and pod for she would been hoping to take on extra shifts because her husband lost his job thanks to bovid but you asked how she's doing she is got the same kind of i see you nurse toughness which i porter grew up around my mind was in new natal i see you nurse she talks even the talks para i cannot kind of what i i do an most of us do here in the i ho thing a hard but we i what i kindofayif you put ta wanton any do it you cannot complain about it that you canto make it worse than you did you ye got do it why may a month later things change now it seems likely that pod for patient who ad been stuck on life support for weeks most of them old probably never recover even was used to helping patients get better or giving them a dignified death now he felt he was seeing too many situations that were neither the nurses had not seen this coming para dais told me she braced herself for the surge but nobody in vision this part you you go to work because you on help people that we be patient any patient or why we go to work in the morning ne and when we cannot when we cannot how somebody or word to in of ben dam jut get through the day when a lot of that and that i do not want to to cut the wrong way but we know that they're probable reckon to make it out of there i are not ma o can i an i you ow ism a not person optimistic by nature too and recently in i feel that and i feel i have changed it'd more ism more of my husband in the real li thing i and ism not an it the now i feel we are we are kind of changing plait when i take to even puffy an may he tells me about what he struggling with the most that families are continuing to tell them to do everything they can to save patients which he gets but there is a patient who cone o typifies what he seeing the man several underlying healthy shoes who is been stuck on life support for weeks he is heavily sedated breathing to down his throat eventually the man's kidneys give out he is on constant dialysis his lungs also give out and even when they stop sedating him he remains unresponsive it is now what what are we you now what are we doing here we are just continuing to you now make these people suffer in a way it is told to see those people suffering every day hooked up to all of these different lines and too and there sensually on responsive and we know if we were to cut a couple of the interventions off they would pass away very quickly n us i think i cause a lot of frustration with the nursing staff you nowt was we we feel in we are prolonging be inevitable some of the trust creation o photo yesterday om can we wont of or nurse s talking with their positions about likely when when is enough one or we done even means that the caring thing would be to let them die i do not know mama car no but fond lie theater one of from when i could tell from the rounding there just really first it oculi er for we to in mac e since iron the same time men odd is checked in with errand did evanan saris bus they were standing outside the nurses break room talking about exactly but even was saying they feel i very mean to a yet e the preventing the suitable and every one we do is not do anything we know in no us i to right n h we all they a et all belie yet yet like there just see ting somebody ale when there's nothing we get is change no o i i now completely understand lag wo nor know to talk about how podfour nurses are stuck in the worst position in medicine the caught in the middle between patients who they worry or suffering were clearly dying and their families were holding out ho tut's not they don't understand it its abstract no the would not believe any of us if we were it here ray no no it is any you don't in less y the heyday and an say all yet a an letting it every day you and underpaid that you you cannot have the feelings that the we all have and its ut give been wondering if there's anything we should try to prepare to do differently may be o tor the next a o it is an i hen oman b i know bi give there are different time finds for these conversation by these conversations renaming conversations with patient's families she wonders if doctors and nurses meed to change the language there using with them takin when a patient is a getting better ye were tire a to the the the day thing of how we thinking i teat of tang when the can then on ti o tang you seen progress to day maybe we say we seen a change to day you now i i wo we t i o er is false o rat a see not tot i do one and still tot we other tin better to a the self o easy say by if we said a be a we are i ever to get good her of right li we want to and we no but some times it is felt yet at o the a telling a really wise an sat they can change rascal in a the rascal lot of e anyone a a lot yes that same week is week lying one of the nurses i talked to para dais she had a day were too patients died and neither of them had family in the room with them the first was a man he was intimated he could not speak para stood with the doctor and held an eye pad wrapped in a plastic bag an front of the face of this dying man as woman said good bye to him and you hearing that conversation with that women who pul talk in to the patient who could not beak back to her om yo than how much tit she wo can man math wit e pleasure i have him i have him in her life an yo jo really jo how much tan it how in normal times sera would not even be witnessing this final private moment families would come into the room doctors and nurses would leave an the second death is the same shift para and others in pod four gathered outside the room of a man who was dying alone and they prayed with the mans son he was on speakerphone o that an a that with hard probably less than an hour after that para says the other patient the man with the i pad a couple of family members were supposed to be there when he died but things went wrong the family told the hospital take his ventilator too bound and will be there to say good bye at seven thirty not long before seven thirty para was in the room he was excavated but then the man starts dying much faster than normal and his family is not there yet o is waiting for them to come but why all om who wo i was waiting for them to come and i was making him comfortable and om an i faced with him while he died but before his family came o and he ended a hatting right before his family came i cannot stress enough how different this is from para's normal job being alone with the dying patient since bovid it is common for nurses though in hospitals everywhere but this man para stood by herself and held his hand and stroked his head she told this he did a good job the she stared through the window hoping desperately that his family would appear and then i came home and you would appreciate the the your can om i thought i wen o ay and it'd come home mi cop the normal weep are not i de it in the room that that they were in and they both i were looking the we tipping out o kind of looking at them crying om and them they were bought up and my fun wit oh are you that and i thought falling my eye and o i on that day and he an he know what i do when we call ta bi is the world bug and om he ad the somebody died and i told him and i eye the liken plural terms that i would between that he would comfortable an o tot probable e manikin that i had ism sorry i cannot image om a genthrilly a generally that around the same time early may comic cases have finally received enough that parts of the hospital are starting to go back to normal non bovid floors are reopening people have been unload are coming back to work specialists who would been a signed to covet ice used go back to their normal jobs even the belly reopens some people tell henna that their surprised to find themselves feeling upset about other parts of the hospital going back to normal not because of jealous but because it makes them feel this awful thing they would all gone through was being erased and for the staff of pod four with their sixteen ice u beds their still a hundred percent bovid patients and the cove patients are going to

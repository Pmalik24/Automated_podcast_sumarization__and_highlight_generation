uncover look e i was just living in wood ye just that ion wooded area at the corner of a country and about three try her on i had ad had first closes o usually but i only could do fashion when we often they round she i smelled the great out doors for the that factor on and down i a very much new i needed net a ts christy needed his medical home worse he had no one a pay per no out he made money wiping camps and bottles on the street when ever e got a doctors o special services he was acid outland that they would even doctor in a person it would not even look him in the eye he of a thing isn't wanting y contact not getting at but then if you lock somebody puts up the listen whatever y ye ten h go it this america live distracted aby public getting i connection a on ora glass our program to day a quartered on a live tor o five cities a bostaand washington do see portend organ denser and our o town chico s he chiasmas took he needed money to go to a doctor and then he got this idea he remembered how a couple years before that he had wandered off the street into a shopping mod to get warm and there the state of new york had set up two laptop computers on a folding tabanid to see the lady just look at me not her head and smile when i walked up to the booth i was just want at anybody was was great such is don at the computers and on these two computers you could look up your name and see weathered the state was holding money for you that you did not know about and there was all sorts of money utility bindery fun tare finds lost checks owed all sorts of people and institutions lost money are not even losing must be put in even to his missing this is like money in purgatory there is money in window and then he about all this chis sol realized how he could pay for his doctors he would look on line find money of theirs that they did not know about moneyed the state was holding for them and then he would present that to them we i am was hoping that i would suddenly get a couple of for call and a couple of checks ion people would say oh well thanks for an having having done this and then i was hoping that these doctors would just even talk to me in it in a civil matter and then work my way up for now the christipik that have to tell you about chis fuel of this on in the story as chis is great at finding the people's money an these day debases on the entreat and when he looked for money for the doctors at his local university hospital not only did he find hundreds hundreds o unclaimed blue cross to shield checks reimbersmens lost dustman checks he also about a hundred checks that were owed to the hospital itself was a huge victory but when e went to the hospitator tell the doctors there that there was this money out there for him he always got the same reaction white is i was a total was a total since except for the people who ere telling me to buzz off e i actual went out in i printed out the claim forms and an cover letter forward and tried in my own humble fashion to a pure professional i went to the selection or me wont myself of blue pen strike so the even with my long hair my beard an went around in hands livened all of them and had that work that was the one that did not work and give responses but there was n o conversation he as sun's i talked security people just know a pure out the woodwork he tried letters he tried to e marlin everyday just thought it was a scam eventually he got doctors to help hm out throughother means and then he turned this then elsewhere he used it wherever and whenever he could when is local public dibs station was during the pledge drive he could not actually give money of course but he looked a line found a thousand dollars of theirs call them up it is sitting up this interview

christian andiron queen elizabeth the first my grandmother's prophetically name brother uncle hetman and i knew it was the kind of thing that could happen to me days would turn into months months an to years and e actually i would drop dead in a men hotel and be buried sexless and a single cemetery plot squeezed in on my side between my parents and i began at an early age what i thought of as my life's work the work of not dying o version at ten i met versed my first crush she was in from israel with her family and was staying with our neighbors since this was the summer grease came out i invited varied upstairs to our living room where i played the soundtrack on our stereo while it played i danced for her my feeling was that you had to give girls everything you had your showman ship your best moves even your dignity as the music played red sat there with quiet indifference i one point i tried to bring her soul to life by lying down on our coffee table and spinning around on my stomach a spastic lazy sudan when i did the splits i fell to the ground with a ferocity that almost tore my curdle sacking to before very went back to israel i handed her all ten arch digests that i owned i stacked them all the spines lined up perfectly i wanted them to look solemn and substantial a package rapped in rope from the old country it is how i feel about you i wanted to say but her english was not good enough to understand for the next several years i would say some variation of these words to many different people but no one's english was ever good enough to understand at the age of thirteen i entered the service industry the self service industry i spent all of my time listening to music yellow while fantasizing about the high school him teacher playing tetherball in her brazil or steeve new strumming a guitar in in her bazar or in my darker moments gold my ear ruling a nation and her bursar and then at fourteen i family got one of those early model elephantine video machines i rented early eightye'steen sex comedies private lessons private school for girls and reform school girl i would make each twenty second shouerscine last anywhere from six to seven hours pastry wine frame advance became my version of the holy trinity one time having lost the remote control to our vicar i watched the entirety of sorority girls on vacation lying on the basement floor with the visit on my chest getting its buttons a seventy pound a cordial it was around that time and spared by a potent cocktail of sexual desperation and move starring phobia hates that i left the comfort of home for the streets four fourteen inch fermion drenched cabbage patchedall with hackney on the prowl and thus at sixteen i met toward every one had a locker partner at our school and i shared mine with toward just knowing that no matter what our winter boots were alone in the dark together for six hours a day was enough to make me feel at least that something in my life was going all right one day i finally worked up the courage to ask her if she wanted to see the eurythmics concert with me because i knew she was a big fan and she said yes i do not know where i came up with the idea but i had decided at some point during the concert that i wanted to whole to mara from behind and sway with her back and forth to the music it was all i could think about all night it was not the kiss or a held hand i was after but something else something in less definable it was i wanted to prove that i could get us into some kind of groove finally during a slow song i snuck up behind her and put my sweaty pocket hands on our hips i tried to ease us into it my movements were halted and completely non musical rather than dancing at looked i was trying to hoist a resistant woman into a mail box while in the throws of a painful pile's attack toward freed herself and for the rest of the evening she was afraid to come near me at home that night i ate a boll of cold serial while staring at a bottle of my mother's nail polish on the kitchen counter carefully i painted my nails in bed my fingers sidewalk the length of my ribs quick tick at me i told myself i have to make this an early night i grabbed my hand and flung it away for myself roughly but it always crept back if fully eighteen see cities hat taught me anything which unfortunately they had in abundance it was that college was going to be a nonstop nooky fest i was not fat enough to be the one who sees on dressing sorry girl shortly before falling backwards from a ladder nor was i daring enough to have secs of a friend's mom nor was i near sighted and good enough that science to create a fixation not but i did know that i was the i my the one that drove everyone around on the way to getting action and that before the credits rolled i would receive my due it was only right well the credited rolled the curtain had come down there was a man sweeping up acorn and still no due for winter break my friend toward and i decided to spend the weekend new york city as we rode the train there we passed a burned out schools in a field and i thought yes that is my heart my heart is a burned out schools with no windows sitting in the middle of nowhere but then after about fifteen minutes the train passed a little gray wooden control booth the door flung wide open and i thought no that that is my heart the train continued along through february fields and i looked for more things to call my heart a rusty bridge a chop down ever green a discarded can of mountain de it turned out my heart was everywhere that winter month we stayed with towards ant in flushing and every night we would go to the local bar and take pictures of ourselves scribbling in our note books our faces illuminated by the neon juke box it was at that bar that we met at twenty five year old even hiswailand furniture salesman named hose hoard and i thought hose was the coolest while we drank our human cokucolas hose drank bloody clears something we considered very sophisticated sort of drinking a salad toward explained his dilemma hose and i explain mine heard had had cancer when he was sixteen and was concerned he would not ever be able to produce seamen and have children i explained that i had grown weary of being a virgin and really really wanted to see nakitchenmy changes hose furrowed his brow and listened to our problems with concern then he said he was taking us to a hothouse i caught to the idea of a boathouse by telling myself that it was very old school very need simony or but refolds or something it was probably how my father and his father before him did it mi imagined my grandfather had lost his virginity to a kind hearted madam who after the deed had cooked how a brisket hose took us to an apartment above a fruit store an span is harm where we were invited in by a small older latino man wearing a shoulder holster come told us not to worry that this is how things were done we were seated on a couch facing an east india man in what appeared to be his two teen a sons there were three women dressed and nighties who walked by carrying balled up faded linen and punchbowl sized metal basins with copy sponges it was after sing toe basins that i realized i would never be able to pull this off there was something to ma digital an matter of fact about the whole thing not only that but i was terrified sex was one thing but if i was going to be getting naked on a strange bed with sheets that were dubious i at least wanted to be with some one who mildly me an that of course is something impossible to gage when the exchange of canada travellers checked involved i told honey i would sit this one out toward on the other hand was rearing to go a woman came over to woman introduced herself as crystal toward introduced himself as mister kolonovsky which was the name of our greats seven matteacher crystal took toward by the hand and let him into a room each person got twenty minutes toward remained in the room with crystal for forty the india man sitting opposite me kept pointing to his watch while smiling and winking there is nothing that makes you think about dying o virgin more than sitting on a couch in a hothouse waiting for your best friend to finishhavi a that couch just then fell the loneliest place on earth as it turned out crystal saw toward scar and they spent most of their time together talking about what it was to have had cancer crystal had lost her brother to ischemia several years earlier she told toward that when her and her brother were kids they poked toothpicks into bubblegum which they ate our serves she told toward that she missed her brother very much on the walk back to the subway i lagged behind toward just watching ham eventually we asked toward how it was with crystal and he said that it was different any that would be and hose told him he was being to emotional what i had not taken into account was that before you lose something in this case the albatross of one's virginity you had to first find something to enable that loss at eighteen sort of by accident i found halite her name meant little wave and when we kissed it was a little wave of blood was sweeping through my chest we kissed long and hard our eyes wide open elite's face was always sad i told her she had a frown that lit up a room elite would be the first person it'd ever sleep with yet losing my virginity with her even just after it happened was something i can never remember i could still recall what her brethsmot after she had eaten chocolate how she would almost cry when she saw little boys with big lasses i remember a thousand other small things too yet our first time together this thing that i had waited for ever to happen to lose a virginity i had waited for ever to lose was completely and utterly lost to me ism not sure i understand why this is maybe when you are coming towards it hat looked big and all eclipsing it looks the finish line you imagine champagne well wisher certificates of merit then you reach it and pass it and you understand it is only the entry point to a lot of other worries worries that proved to be much more immeasurable and complicated my fear of losing my virginity was nothing compared to my fear of losing halite i can never fathom how she could love me and i tested her love all the time let any i smashed your card i said then it'd kill you she said bill you would still love me i guess she said before i meant elite i called myself a virgin it was very clear and definite a virgin now there is no name for what i am but ism sort of partial to very i age o t love a love a i eye to the next look which is working an right now is a relate of the bible on whets ton to have a cry i wen the bod is not

turn a require seems live on there nineteen fifteen nine grams award winning recording of the song on bias leading a sing along at a black college in burin ham in nineteen sixty two went with the traditional die in my opinion die is the way to go when you get rid of tho or die you a raise the most moving idea in the song that if cries died for us we should be willing to die for each other why give that up this s the one clear cut case where you can ask yourself what would jess do and the await jess do die and of course be will disagree about the wording we disagree about everything else in this country and when we sing this song today i think we been disagree about who the serpents are that our heels should crush some of us see our enemies abroad some see them at hone some of us are still mad at france not so i to being with this song all through its history it gets adapted for one use than another the melody is powerful the word strong you feel you really would lay down your life for a just cause of your choosing when we sing the battle him and i say we because that is how the song is traditionally performed at public events as if sing along in which a group of citizens turn themselves into a choice we sing about taking action about marching on about doing something and this is the best part about singing the battle him you are not standing there alone doing something your part of something the song starts off with me eyes and eye have seen and by the end it is you and me and let us die or let us lives what ever us being the pointers all in it together if

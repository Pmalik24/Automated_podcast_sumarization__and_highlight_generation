well folks elm did it he opened the can of worms elm you may know as the red furry mump it from sesame street h made a big boobs yesterday he went on the ax he went on twitters ax space and he and he promptly treated elm is just checking in how is everybody doing oh no the world unweighed it is hell fir on with users from all a cross the political spectrum immediately unloading on elm to tell him how disappointed upset and depressed they were one use o replied elm ism suffering from existential dread over here another replied every morning i cannot wait to go back to sleep every money i cannot wait for fridge to come every single day and every single week for life rather kegler who recalls the actress from so white made to shoot it because she made of noxious comments about how terrible snow i was she treated that she was quote resisting the urge to tell elm that i am kind to staff a it was really funny right this was the thing that was going on all over acts yesterday and it the funny joke it is a funny joke because up at asking how everybody is and then everybody responding that they are experiencing existential angst and upset is really funny elm then replied duo was elm is glad he asked elm learned that it is important to ask a friend how they are doing elm will check again soon friends elm loves you hashchaggy emotional well being keno oka that is that is kind of u funny kind of not joke any more and then jobidon comes in from the wings with a can saw to massacre of the jo jobidon to tell quote i know how hard it is some days to sweep the clouds away and gets a sunnier days our friend elm is right we have to be there for each other all for our help to a neighboring earn above all ask for help when we need it even though it is hard you are never alone here is my question today what they will happened our sense of humor why cannot we just laugh at this it is really funny why cannot we just laugh when elm asks twitter how everyone is doing and people are answering with their suicidal thoughts that is funny oka it is just funny it is o say for us to laugh at things but it seems as though in the country it is not o say to laugh at pretty much anything any more comedy i believe really died during the agama administration when pretty much all of our comedic leaders decided the day were actually politicians and barokobams actually a celebrity the complete murder of celebrity and politics that occurred when barokobama became president totally eat comedy because comedians decided that they were going to a festively becomes spokes people for barokobmam's administration you'll recall chis rock suggesting that barokobamo was his father these a a father figure to all of us you recall there ware comedians we are suggesting that it was impossible to make fun of barokobama because he just there was nothing funny about t man which of course is in an of itself pretty funny barokobama was a highly hackable character he thought that he was a transformation figure when in fact who just con of a corrupt chico politician with delusions of grandeur it butt because comedy decided that it could not stay separate from politics what that did is it totally under mine one of the common spaces tat we have as a society comedy is a is a space that we used to share as a society ant no matter where you were politically funny was funny and how is the basic idea for decades in america life it did not mater where you were on the political spectrum richer prior was funny it did not matter where you were on the political spent from gorge marlin was funny johnny carbon was funny jailenno was funny and then it turns out that as the social fabric breaks down it is very difficult to laugh laughter becomes incredibly difficult because if you believe that the person who is making the joke is laughing at you you are no longer laughing along and if you believe that the person who is making the joke is a she not joking that underneath that joke is is her and rage and laugh that is non funny either sadness the impression and get these are not emotions that can to exist with laughing at things and we as the society were having come a mental break down an that that that is act is happening right here because we should all beagle to laugh at this thing this and and this is one of the things that have found can of hilarious about the rap song that tomb donates and i release which is now number one world wide on the dieting tastes the number one song on the planet that is hilarious i mean that is that is the best cultural troll of all time i i do not mean to explain the joke guys but ism look at me i am not a rapper i have now ambitions to be a rapper in fact if two weeks ago you had done a pull of people who knew even my name and ask what is the thing benthcro as least likely to do it would probably be that is on that is why it is funny and yet you are already starting to see people fore getting angry at the song people who cannot laugh at the very idea li it is ut it is a joke it is a it is funny went ism a chalked tat up to the fact that social fabric is breaking down and that is having some really deleterious effects on all sides of the political late law a cross the political lie for example the the weird cultural break down that we are having now over tailor swift what the hell of a tailor swift and traves else there romance basically being a a plant by the an a fell or by her stage matures whatever is a funny idea it is funny it's a joke we can all laugh at that because tailor swift to spent per entire life in music two wing songs about how she has a horrible history of men an breaking up with very famous people and what if she really is in a sincere romance to the splendent we all wish the best for her n that is fine and by the way if tailor swift actually does marry traves kelly and then of having babies there will be a tailor swift baby bones that's how stutter culture is an we all take pop culture to seriously s there's be a bunch of thirty year old women who suddenly decide that is oke to put their heinous boneifieties on the shelf and get married to a man and then have babies if tailor swift to sides that it is made to do and she stops acting seventeen year old girl in a thirty four your old woman's body in any case the whole stick is really funny there's who been making jokes about i man jokes aba titans the aniffell started showing her up in the say box an cause we go mi got i love football about and it is just all ridiculous it is supercity but the joke can never jut stay the job because people hate each other too much and you cannot even joke about tailor swift and the politicization of tailor swift and traves else is a men it'll are a joke about tailor swift and traves else or you will or some one else on the right we unless will cause you hate them right are you hate them and think t no because there celebrities and celebrities are funny and the whole thing seems really stagy and maybe it is real and again if it is good for them but ism allow to make a joke about roger god ell assassinating em our action to make sure that traves else gets into the superable something at really high ratings as he proposes two tailor swift on windy and then so rejects in right to break up song that is that is o ka we get's more on this in just one second first if

other people have no sense of humor in response to that we members of the trump campaign who are reportedly angry about tailor swift because there suggesting that tailor swift is a plans the see i e twenty years ago its orgnamac tailor swift o star ay knowhow else were gin to drama craft an entire an entire football will had and then we are going to from youth breed an incredibly talented tight en and then we are going to fix up these two in perfect alinement just in time to reelect a dowering old man roumbuf that is what we are going to do what they why this can we is let us just laugh it is o ka it is o just laugh everything is funny eh yes politics and life in general is tragic comedy i politics is hysterically funny when viewed from on one lends and then deeply tragic when viewed from another because politics can have such an impact on all of our lives but if you will lose the comedy that really is not because this is not funny stuff you are losing the comedy because you do not the people hoar around you you don't the country your in you do not the people wo are existing this may be the funniest time in the history of america politics just on a raw level this thing is chicken hysterical ism star just a women o it is all very serious when went me get the seriousissies in moment but it'd to say that its okay for every to lighten up and laugh a little bit one have donate trump who is a real estate magnate whose president of the united states once and is a stands up insult comic running against a vegetable and in the middle of this we have projected all of this on to a football star dating a pop star in the middle of the anafell playoffs and pretending this has world historical importance which is does not the near times by the way jumping all over this the fulmination surrounding the world's biggest pop icon and girl friend of traps else the chiefs stars idea reach the stratus there after cant city made it to the superbly for the fourth time in five years and the first time since miss swift joined the teems outrage the conspiracy theories coming out of the make america gratagan contingent were already legion than the swift is a secret agents of the pentagon that shows blistering per fan basin preparation for indorsement a president bids replace or the chin mister celsiara contrived couple assembled to boosting fell or cold vaccines or demo cats or whatever gave that last one account of that that might be right that the contrived couple part because again tailor shirts that sort of a history with this stuff apparently this has now taken the form the the again you he always have to doubt these sort of anonymous reports especially from rolling stone with is not a credible source but again for the humor effective at i'miscunery to because it is it is kind of hysterically funny according to three people familiar with matter trump loyalists working on or close to the former president's campaign long time trump allies an writ we media and an array of outside advisers to the ex president have long taken it as a given that swift willeventually endorse bison but apparently members of raglan's upper crust are plotting to declare a holy war on the pop megastar especially signs up publicly backing the democrats in the twenty twenty four election behind the scenes trump has reacted to the possibility a biding in swift teeming up against him this your not with alarm both an instant projection of ego in recent weeks the former president has told people in his orbit that no amount of aimless celebrity indorsements will save bison that of course is true trump has also privately claim tees more popular s swift get that part mix be true and if that is really buy that is six superfunny again guys maybe the predict to us rebuilding a social fabric in this country is to be able to laugh at funny things but here is the thing nobody's laughing and that by the way is one of the reasons why jobidon is down in dumb as the social fabric breaks down jobidon doing the trust me routine when it comes to politics no longer helps in no longer helps comedy requires trust and dos political success and jobidon is not have trust right now comedy is in and by the way archobidons twenty twenty four prospects are is a tough new swing state pole out for jobidon from business insider or a bloomer business rather and morning at consult that shows in the swing states dona trump is now up forty eight to forty two forty eight t forty two that is a bigger the percentage of voter saying that emigration is their top issue went up in six of the seven state sixty one per cent a voters o blame jobidon for the border crisis only thirty eight percents he re publicans in congress these are bad numbers for jobidon truly bad numbers that same pole again the is a swing state poles to the states the matter because who cares what people in californium think that states arty foregone conclusion who cares what albata thinks already foregone conclusions the swing states the matter basically the selection is on to come down say three states as he usually does those three states was poison michigan pennsylvania that is wat it can to come down to donate trump is going town aerizona dona's from is going town georgia the other states michigan wright now he is in the lead pennsylvania he is trailing wisconsin it is at ad die the gin be a very tightalection anybody things that can be a blow outright now the evidence just not there for it but the fact that its state is almost solely due to the fact that jobidon is a deep can popular president who has reached trust with america weight to more on this in just one second first wind treatments can make an enormous difference in your home or office cure flora it gets very very

swing states would you say the economy is going in the right direction or going in the wrong direction for the country wrong track seventy one per cent only twenty nine per cent think the economy is going in the right direction generally speaking will you say the economy in each of the falling places is going in the right direction or in the wrong direction or city or town right direction fifty two per cent wrong track forty eight per cents what is that mean an means that people kind of arolcay wit their local governments but they are really unhappy with the national governments jobidon's favorability rating in this pole in the swing states is currently at thirty eight per cent that is not a reelect number that is not even remotely in reelect number donate true by the way is currently at a forty six per cent approval rating end which is his on jobidon in the swing states jobidon has lot of probes and he is exasperating those problems with bad governments which of course is why the border continues to matter jobidon continues to trip out there in suggest that the border crisis which continues to to simmer that border crisis is about him not being givenough power which of course not true because that borcrisis did not exist whole dona trumpets president then jobidon came en as we have explain many times and as we explain an our new border documentary available of or daily wireless jobidon has the executive authority basically prevent the border from collapsing the way that it has but jobtdon is still trying to blame it on republicans as though he needs to be given legislative power in order to do things by the way the that is an amazing statement coming from the same present who has declared the anal lateral executive ability to relieve student long at and force you to get a axing those are all things that jobidon says he can do with presidential power but the one thing he cannot do apparently is close the border which is a specifically delegated power that he already has legal authority nay legal obligation to fulfill here is jobidon telling a i o are not that that is not true he has the power he could o it literally right now but he is not and everyone knows it which is why his border numbers are absolutely horrifying now democrats our trying to make the claim that is republicans are whooshing up more border power for jobitdon and is not working particularly well their something to blamed on a trump for their trying to say that trump is scuttling what would be an amazing bordello heres the thing i cannot analyze the bordereau beausihave not seen the border deal have you you have not correct because no one has how do you expect me to say whether the border deal is good or bad it count be worse than the status quail if jobidon with just an force the all but perhaps the proper republican play in the face of a bad deal is to walk away from the table and say that jo bid needs to enforce the laws that are currently on the books that seems to be the current republican play democrats are trying to claim that that is a trump thing that is not a trump thing if the border bill that is on the table is bad then its bad and you cannot expect the their bunch of senators who frankly a kind of a that senator haven't crater of north to coda for example good senator senterton's lank for voklohoma good senator on many issues they keep saying things where we need this ordeal i do not know whether we need it until i see it i cant again trust has been violated trust has been broken i have no clue whether the border deal that you want jobidon to sign is good or whether it is bad republicans out there trying to stump for a ordeal that no one has seen that is on conto make a lot of headway which is why presumably speaker might johns is sanglasson were not stopping the bordereau to help trump i have a majority in the house of three seats a that that that republican majority's extremely slim necks as ism not going to bring a bill up that is going to get immediately ejective e are proposed when is called h a to it is good bill just pass it here is the speaker of the house make johns she in marshes cordon benin by common to seen can an ans for tan to tan color and o we then does toholanon camping no mono that is absurd we have a responsibility here to do our duty our duty is to do right by the america people to protect the people the first at most'tbor job the fetal government is protected citizens we about doing that under president widen were it we have only a tiny as razor then actually a one vote majority rat now in the house our our majority is small we only have it in one chamber but we are trying to to use every outs of leverets that we have to make sure that this a issue is address i have talk to to e farm president trump about this issue at length and om and he understands that he understands that we have a responsibility to do here the president of course present trump wants to secure the country and the polls are against jobidinhere which is wire nothing republicans give ground to join and the shunt give ground to you by meanwhile democrats are busy in the house trying to fin alhandro orcas the secretary of homeland security who keeps the clearing and the border is in fact secure and is not in fact open when in reality the catching release policypers a by this administration means that the borders effectively open we republicans have been pursuing in impeachment of alhandro medical here is representing mark green saying that meccas has no respect for the law now does that amount to a high crime or misdemeanor meaning there no crime is really allege my general view of impeachment is that you should allege a crime however democrats didnitpeachtonal trump twice without actively alleging a crime there is that for just coning use impeachment is of political toolitsgood for the lose s good for the gander and alehandro orcas is absolutely not fulfilling his constitutional oath to uphold the waw to day is a grave day we have not approach this day or this process lightly secretary mericasis actions have forced our hand we cannot allow this bordercrisis to continue we cannot allow dentinal to flood across tour border or criminals to waltz in under awe cannot allow a cabinet secretary with no regard for the separation of powers i the rule of law to remain in office that is why to day we present this committee with the articles of impeachment against secretary alehandrof my areas meanwhile of represent dangolman who first and foremost on the trump impeachment trances o this my actively participated in the trump in preachment both of them actually and tat he says it is demeaning to the institution to i peach maracas ism sorry i think were well beyond the demeaning of congress what you are upset about is that secretary my orchards receded prior executive orders that were working and you have a right to be used about that and you have a right to talk about that and you have a right to express your dissatisfaction in any way you choose and you have a right to make that case to the america people that they vote secretary my orchards and this and this president out of office in nonmember if that is ultimately w hat the people believe but you do not have a right to de mean this institution to bastardize the impeachment class of the constitution to belittle the standard of constitutional impeachment to such a degree that you cannot even produce a legal memo in support of your articles of impeachment that do not existing history and do not exist in the law of again you invoking the law when you literally did not even a ledge crimes against annal trump before i peachingham twice is e pretty astonishing display

also cunning against provide the situation in iron continues to bubble it continues to be really bad that there's bend hundredand sixty five attacks on america troops between october seventeenth and canary twenty nine ranging from serial to a rock to jordan to the red we obviously and hoiden really has no plans to do anything about now you ontomace the case of wo do not need forward deployment of all f these troops in these places that is fine ism opens that argument ism open to the idea that we do not actually need as many bases as we have currently in for example serial if we do not need as many bases we currently have in in epoch but if you are going to have troops on the ground you defend the troops that you have on the ground that is the way that it works and then the other half that a equation is you allow america allies to do the work that you are not capable of doing because you do not have the lots on the ground the intelligence gathering the terrorist fighting you allow south to go after the soothes in demon you allow israel to go after his bell you'll you take the chains off of all of your allies and allow them to do the dirty work that you yourself do not want to do that would be a a rational form policy jobidon has decided to do the posit of both of those rein a for employ bunch troops but not defend them and we are going to ham string our allies in their pursuit of terrorism that that is that is apparently robin's plan now he just keeps over and over and over and of telegraphing exactly what he says his going to do yesterday he said have decided what in to do what whining just do it in understandlike is it is get points for calling your shot this a big ruth at the world series aah ism no an arm in i do now good for you dude maybe you should just do it an not to any o i the any more punches that you love to telegraph apparently he told the press that you holds iron responsible in the sentence that they are supplying the weapons to the people who did it ill get thank you for that vague formulation president biding hearing up all right well ism ism just going to point out right out that to your sense of responsibility has mounted to nothing far all you've done is exacerbated the promise of the run they continued get morgressin because you've doing nothing enter o tom cotton of course yo come a member of he military marking he says the the way you actually do deterrents is through you note getting people i snowed super complicated have laid out the scenarios which option to choose bill you laid out for options for how we could retaliate againsteron at that a fifth which is all of the above there's to be devastating military radiation for the targeting of america troops in jordan a friendly nation to cross international borders leaving three dead america and more than three does wounded and some of those bill or are in grave critical condition as well this is not an anomaly for iron this is what they have been doing for forty five years but they have camped it up under jordan beforehand brocoboma because there the obomabinn foreign policy has been one of a element and conciliation we have to totally reverse that policy starting with retaliatory strike strike nail and continuing beyond that to insure that we are no longer trying to drive to tolls with filings of dollars we not looking the other way whenever they cheat on sanction and we are certainly not in a tolerate even the slightest provocation against our troops in an itteleast anything tell else will simply in vote more tax and by the way i agree and is tom cotton with dona true dons from policy was that after a you as basin rock was attack by eonian proxy forces in late twenty nineteen early twenty twenty down from killed custom solymoney he top goods force baronial terror official he kill himalis an rock and iron out massif retaliation into nothing he's a turns out you modern does not likening punch directly in the face they do not it at all as i ben trying for quite a while here it turns out the detergents requires you to deter meanwhile jobidon is resting his campaign on the supposed evils of nomad trump and a lot of that is predicated n the legal charges an honestly the more the headlines appear about dona trumps legal charges the less effect they are going to have they wills facing for cases with ninety one charges that looks political prosecution ism sorry that is what it looks an looks particularly political prosecution when several of these cases are clearly trumped up or falling apart the jaguar sixth case in washington d c is a stretch of the law every which way the fanny willing case in georgia is in attention seeking ploy by fanny wills in a in a legal stretch of reeks that does not even really a ledge the underlying organization to do the chiming which is what you require for ego charge not only that fanny wills is now caught up in her owns scandal because it turns out that she hired as a prosecutor personal no prosecutorial experience this she happens to be slipping right now that that that turns out to be candent paid hem bunch tax paredollars wont on cruised with them s that happens

merited all is the classified dock case down in florid an that case donut drum can just pointed help client and politically speaking all this looks political persecute not only that it looks thoroughly this doc is a political tool of the died administration the most obvious and insane case of this is the charging of proline demonstrators over they're blocking of an entry two tennessee abortion facility in twenty twenty one here is film of what it looked when these supposedly evil violent terrible people where outside an abortion facility in tennessee in twenty twenty one they are being charge with charges that would give them up to alevin years in prison they were accuse by the pritmanof justice o violating the called face act and civil rites conspiracy violation people civil rights for a protest that to place in a hallway outside of a mount quiet abortion provider march fifth twenty twenty one as you will see this group of demonstrate gathered on a second floor of an office building in the hallway outside the caravan health center clinic the group trade and sang hymn and urged women strung up to the clinic not to get abortions here is what that look a man to an wow frightening terrifying stuffer absolutely terrifying the verdict was delivered on the fifth day of the triage took place in nasal one the government s u witnesses was caroling dais woman who is arrested with the group at cariffam during her testimony day is claims had a change of hart about attending the protest and that her rational side was in the toilet at the time for participation she said that you changed her mind over time that being indicted by the federal government terrified her apparently some people talked to the police one of i showed one parts has been telling another to speak in love to a man with his girl friend who shown up and thattomon's baby was a gift from god and tum now these people ore onto face eleven years in prison for all of this for this for the brutal violent terrible activity serve cramping who homes more society senior council and turning for one of the people trartza quote or discipline withe outcome this to peaceful demonstration by entirely peaceable citizens filed with prayer hem singing and worship oriented toward persuading expecting mothers not to aboard their babies unfortunately the biding to apartment of justice decided to characterize these peaceful actions as a fella conspiracy against rights to intimidate and punish the people charged and other proline people and people of fate crampon suggested the beans debases pattern of arresting and prosecuting peaceful proline advocates is disturbing and of course that is true remember this s the same administration that basically decided not to charge huge numbers of people where involved in the black lives matter riots that did two billion dollars and damage in twenty twenty this the same administration tat is basically decided to facilitates shutting down of highways in democratic party has as absolutely in major city facilitated to shut down of airports to shut down of highways by protesters who been sometimes assault the police but these anti worship protestors sitting in a hallway and singing that is the violent stuff that is the truly threatening horrifying terrible stuff you wonder why many re publicans and many people general y are this bi in dona if they're inditing trump o ka are reposed to take that superseriously this done the same tea that says the this sort of activity i e standing outside n abortion clinic and non violently singing hymns that deserves eleven years in prison or if you are grammar and you walked through the capital building on ganuorsic on not one the people is violent now won people assaulting the police officer

for members of congress in and that it is to spend on private security the scope of the investigation and allegations of wrong doing were not immediately known but in recent months in investigators of contact had multiple current and former staffers according to the washington post inquiring about the congress woman's campaign spending apparently this has to do with her paying all f her friends and calling them securities she came under fire for using sampan money to hire her husband corner merits as her security but the office of congressional ethics dis miss to complaint filed pagans bush t

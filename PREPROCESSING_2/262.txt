and in the office of doctor else drake fitch who examined the dead bodies for the police and pony much again and hes running tho this caramel sides all of the murder victims the closing of body parts to say as he slake through these things i the grislier sledge her see like every side is some and there is another story yes every crime seen is a story of it to is a novel and it opens up in every direction ndtillustrate he does me this story back when he worked in the wing county coroner's office and decried there is young woman history by the way probably is not suitable for younger children anyway this is young woman she apparently killed herself by taking her boy friend's on putting in her mouth and firing is roe a suicide that is of the police thought that is whit the other medical examiner's thought but doctor drake fitch wonder this woman did not have a history of depression in note my collins teas me is being baron in the seeing things where they were not is the examination scolding the inside of the woman's mouth and this particular case the tongue so to hols two holds he says is very strange in this dimming case was usually toll me this gets a little explicit again usually he says wen people shoot themselves in the mouth to kill themselves the count of point the gun upward toward the bran the tongue does not get invoked at all does not get intend the only way this couldhave happened he realized is it the tongue was all bunched con of pushing against the tip of the gun the muzzle of the gun whin the gun went off but why would you do that why put your tongue there if you were killing yourself in my as sentiment o this this was a homicide no to i know for sure no i did not but that is to the logic to i told the deceives the test was my finding they went check to interview the moisten and they said we know that you shower i did no i did not did yes we know the doctor told us is did what dock s is the doctor that did the audibly said what autopsy i call the corner's office two weeks ago and he told me they never did autufseson suicides e cops yin her why call the coroner's office to ask that question if you are not panting on killing anybody it did not take very long after that he said for this my to confess s doctor drakeovitch says every crimescene is a novel rredanerate your program we dive into those crime scenes and the novels that led to them from the bye easy chico its this america life m eyeglass and you know the thing that makes a crime scene such a strange kick off to any story any detectives investigation is that the crime scene is filled with details but it is totally a queer which one to the important ones yours back i was talking to this former friends that criminologist recotoniary about this and hes as surer at a

and his never found again though we wanted to big nice river my bender has this story about a boy who would be handy to have heart at lots of crime scenes a to say this wormy favorite pieces of fiction we have ever put on the radio shop her story was read fry by after mambo once there was an orphan who had a back for finding lost things both his parents had been killed when he was eight years old there were swimming in the ocean when it turned wild with waves and each had tried to save the other from drowning the boy woke up from a nap on the sand alone after the tragedy the community adopted and raised him and a few years a or the dead of his parents he began to have hi sense of objects even when they were not visible this ability continued growing and power through his teems and by his twenties he was able to actually sniff out lost sun glasses keys contact lenses and letters the neighbors discovered his talent accidentally he was over a jenny sugar's house one evening picking her up for a date when jenny's mother misplaced her hairbrush and was walking around complaining about this the young man's nose twitched and he turned slightly towards the kitchen and pointed to the drawer where the spoons and lies for cap his date burst into laughter now that would be quite a silly place to put the brush she sad among all that silverware and she opened the drawer to make her point to wave with the life for brush her hair with a spoon but when she did room there was the hairbrush added with gray curls sitting on top of the foreside jenny's mother kissed the young man on the cheek but jenny herself looked at him suspiciously all night long you planned all that did not you she said over dinner he were trying to impress my mother well you did not impress me she said he tried to explain himself but she would hear none of it and when he drove his car up to her house she fled before he could even finish saying he would had a nice time which was a lie anyway he went home to his tiny room and thought about the word lonely and how it sounded and looked lonely with those two ells in it each standing tall by itself sinews spread around the neighborhood about the young man's skills people reacted in two ways there were the deeply appreciative and the skeptics the appreciative ones called up the young ma n regularly he would stopped by on his way to school find their keys and had give him a home made muffin the skeptics called him over too and watched him a talk he would still find their lost items but they would insisted was an elaborate scam and he was doing it all to get attention maybe declared one woman waving her neck's finger in the air maybe she said he steals the thing we think its lost moves the item and then comes over to save it how do we know it was really lost in the first place what is going on the young man did not know himself all he knew was the feeling of a tug light but in listen a child at his sleeve and that tug would turn him in the right direction and some where look each object had its own way of inhabiting space and therefore messaging its location the young man could sense could small an objects reasons he did not need to see it to feel where it put its gravity down as would be expected items that turned out to be miles away to much harder concentration tan the ones that were too feet to the left when missus all's little boy did not come home one afternoon that was the most difficult of all leopard allay was eight years old and usually rived home from school wat three five he ad allergies and needed a pill before he went back out to play that day by three forty five alone missus land was a wreck her boy rarely got lost only once had that happened in the supermarket but he would been found quite easily under the produce tables crying the walk home from school was a straight line and heard was not the wandering kind missus allay was just a regular neighbor except for one extraordinary fact through an inheritance she was the owner of a gargantuan emerald she called the green star it sat glass cased in her kitchen where everyone could see it because she insisted that it be seen sometimes as a party trick she would even cut stake with its bevelled edge on this day she took the green star out of its case and stuck her palms on it where is my boy she ride the green star was cold and fact she ran weeping to her neighbor who calmly walked her back home to gather they gave the house a thorough search and then the neighbor of believer recommended calling the young man although missus allay was a septic she thought anything was worth while idea and when the phone answered she said in a trembling voice you must find my boy the young man had been just about to go play basketball with his friends he would located the basketball an the bath tub you lost him said the young man missus allay began to explain and then her phone clicks one moment please she said and the young man held on when her voice returned it was shaking with rage he is been kidnapped she said they want the green star the young man realized then that it was missus land he was talking to and nodded oh he said i see everyone in town was familiar with missus all's green star it'll be right over he said the woman's voice was too run with tears to rested in his baskopall shorthand shirt the young man jogged over to missus all's house he was amazed at how the green star was all exactly the same shade of green he had a desire to ticket by then missus allay was in hysterics they did not tell me what to do she sobbed where do i bring my emerald how do i get my boy back the young man tried to feel the sent of the boy he asked for a photograph and stared at it a brown haired kid at his kindergarten graduation but the young man had only found objects before and lost objects at that he never found anything or anybody stolen he was not a policeman missus fallen called the police and one officer showed up at the door oh it is the finding guy the officer said the young man dipped his head modestly he turned to his right to his left north south he got a glimmer of a feeling towards the north and walked out the back door through the back yard night approached and the sky seemed to grow and deepen in the darkness what is his name again he called back to is us fallen leopard she said he heard the policeman pull out a pad and begin to ask basic questions he could not quite feel him he felt the air and he felt the tug in side tho green star an object displaced from its original home in aria he felt the tug of a tree in the front yard which had been uprooted from virgin to be legend in hear and he felt the tug of his own watch which was from his uncle land an attempt to be fatherly his uncle would insisted he take it but they both knew the gesture was falls maybe the boy was too far away by now he heard the policeman asked what is he wearing missus fallen described to blue shirt and the young man focus in on the blunter he turned off his distractions and the blue shirt came calling from the north west a distant radio station the young man went walking and walking and about fourteen houses down he felt the blue shirt shrieking at him and he walked right into the back yard right through the back or and sure enough there were four people watching toe including the tear stained boy with a runny nose eating a candy bar the young man scooped up the boy while the others watched surprise say did nothing and one even muttered sorry man to for fourteen houses back the young man held leopard and his arm an e brie leopard stop sneezing and looked up at the stars and the young man smelled leopard's hair rich with the memory peen at bynerhe helped leopard would asked him a question any grub but leopard was quiet the young man answered and his head son behind to in see and the word rolled around a marble on a marble floor son he wanted to say when he reached missus alien's door which was wide open he walked in with quiet leopard and missus fallen promptly burst into tears and the policeman slunk out the door she thanked the young man a thousand times even offered him the green star but he refused it leopard turned on the t v and curled up on the sofa the young man walked over and asked him about the program he was watching but leopard stuck his thumb in his mouth and did not respond feel better he said softly tucking the baseball beneath his arm the young man walked home shoulders low in his tiny room he undressed and lay in bed had it in a naked child with nothing on no shoes no necklace no hairball no watch he could not have found it he lay in bed that night with the trees from other places rustling and he could feel their confusion no so he not o again where am i this wrong with this air crossing his hands in front of him he held on to his shoulders concentrate hard he thought where are you everything felt blank and quiet he could not feel a tug he squeezed his eyes shot and left the question bubble up where did you go come fined me and over here come find me if he listened hard enough he thought he could hear the ways hitting maybe bender shirt story is

the scene of your crimes and e little kids make fun of you can the garden con in a minute chicory bub a radio when our program continues is sericin life more glass eat looking a program of course we choose some theme bring you different kinds of stories on that theme to day show crime scenes in the stories they tell to day's used first air years ago an i someway we realized here ad a program that we had a question an actual question about crime scenes something wondered about watching the news i a om banal amok a sic ecologist o years ecologist a question was about always shootings in the way the crimes evidence could be in interpreted after the fact differently by different people s for example after stuff on clerk was shot by sacramentapliese back in twenty eighteen sonny coroner did an official stops for the state but in addition to that the family also hired a well known french is pathologist this man you're hearing right now then it a mayo who down autopsy for them he announce his findings of this press conference and don't if you remember that case but stuff on clerk was twenty two years old unarmed shop police multiple times doctor main and alibis came out before the county corners and he was definitive about a number of thing e we a to the lo it con so once me go he was heat i e hole the first shot amazes said it stuff on clerk in the side widen spun him around his back was to the officers then six of the eight shots were til his back that is a different story thin the police had told plea said he was advancing towards them when the fired the caasishi tat hose i see a a he was a silly the i sees is a to into i i fit filly fora sic bit weeks later the county reeked its report it was different doctor always report in some significant ways first it said there were seven bullets not eight it said only three shots were to the back not six and as for the first shot the county said it was probably to his hide and the clock probably was walking towards the officers when it happen and we wondered here to show how could something basic be in dispute the number shots whether they entered from the backer from the front dos that indicate the one of the autopsies was deliberately spinning the results or these actual honest scientists we disagreeing about the evidence its in front of them hi asked doctor jury melanic a veteran friends of pathologists who performed autopsies in the area for fifteen years and she said these kinds of discrepancies happen all the time when they were two autopsies of the same person said in these kinds of cases the official autopsy the coroner's office usually happens first and then the family gets to do their autopsy after that it's true even though the family usually goes public with their results first as happen in this case doctor melanic says picture oka two autopsies by two doctors the first autopsy down by the corners office alters the body and changes the evidence it makes it a lot more difficult for the second pathologist when the second pathologist gets the body it is already been watched queen doesn't of any blood stains or trace reside the first pathologists already cut open the body it is already removed the bullets when doctor solo got the body he did not have the bullets any more they had been taken out by the first autopsy and he did not have access to the race of the body from the first autopsy wench ways shown him where the bullets had been he also did not have the organs in their proper orientation in the body the organs had been taken out by the previous autopsy pathologist and lie stop two identify the wound tracks and then put in plastic bag inside the body cavity the first pathologist has that advantage because they got the body pristine and it was not altered in this way doctor melanic says there can be lots of disagreement and it can be honest disagreement between pathologist they are people looking at different sets of data they come to different conclusions and with that we have arrived a fact three of our program act three we turn to the scene of the crime in o this is some true is i in detect fiction that a criminal always returns to the scene of the crime it turns out in real life that actually is not very common at all except among arsonists arson apparently to see the fires they have set and then some of them are actually caught when police look at pictures taken of crowds at fires and then i con have this is rare may be not nobody really keep track o this kind of thing here e the people who circle back to the scene of the crimes to undo to race something ear least a promise that it is never on o happen again kat dais discovered the one of her own neighbors in washing in die an old friend of hers was trying to do just that bobby comes up my

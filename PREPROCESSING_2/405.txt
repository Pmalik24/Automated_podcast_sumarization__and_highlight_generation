welcome to the superman science science pact i am indrcuberman and on a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day my guest is doctor edgy change doctor edit change is the chair of the our surgery department at the universe of californium at san francisco doctor changes clinical group focusses on the treatment of movement disorders including epilepsy he is also a world expert in the treatment of speech disorders and relieving paralysis that prevent speech and other forms of movement and communication indeed his laboratory is credited with discovering ways to allow people who have fully locked in syndrome that is who cannot speak or move to communicate through computers and ai devices in order to be able to speak to others in their world and understand what others are saying to them it is a truly remarkable achievement that we discussed to day in addition to his discoveries about critical periods which are periods of time during one's life when one can learn things in particular languages with great ease as posh to later in life and we talk about the basis of things bylinguillism and try linguinis we talk about how the brain controls movement of the very muscles that allow for speech and language and how those can be modified over time we also talk about stutter and we talk about a number of aspects of speech and language that give insight into not just how we create this incredible thing called speech or how we understand speech and language but how the brain works more generally doctor chug is also one of the world leaders in bioengineering that is the creation of devices that allow the brain to function at superphysiological levels and that can allow people with very syndrome and disorders to overcome their depicts if you are somebody who is interested in how the brain works normally how it breaks down and how it can be repaired and if you are interested in speech and language reading and comprehension of information of any kind to day's episode ought to include some information of deep interest to you doctor change is indeed the top of his field in terms of understanding these issues of how the brain in code speech and language and create speech and language and as i mention movement disorders and epilepsy we even talk about things such as the biogenic diet the future of companies curl link which are interested in bioengineering and augmenting the human brain and much more one thing that i would to note is that in addition to being a world class nerd science researcher and world class cognition euro surgeon and chair of our surgery doctor et change has also been a close personal friend of mind since we were nine years old we attended elementary school together we aptly had a science club when we were nine years old focus on a very particular topic left to listening to to day's episode to discover what that topic was and what membership to that club required that a side doctor change is an absolute fanon with respect to his scientific prowess that is both his research and his clinical abilities and his one of these rare individuals that whenever he opens his mouth we learn before we begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate for my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is element element is an electorolike drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called neurons in fact in order for your neurons to function properly all three electrolihts need to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to dephisites in cognitive and physical performance element contains a science back tolectrolike ratio of one thousand milligrams that one gram of sodium two under milligrams of potassium and sixty milligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if have been sweating lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element doctor slash supermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element element doctor slash superman and now for my discussion with doctor end change eddy welcome i i enter great to be here with you this has been a long time coming just too i come clean we have known each other since we were nine years old but the there was a long gap in which we did talk to one another i heard things about you and presume we i you heard a thing to about for better for worse and then we reconnected years later when i was a p h c student and you were medical student we literally ran into each other in the halls of university californium san francisco were you are now the chair of nerve surgery it all comes full circle when you were at you see a s a you were working with milk mersonik and i know that name might not be familiar to a lot of people but es and a for synonymous with negro plasticity the ability of the brain and nervous system to change in response to experience for a listeners i would just love for you to i give a brief over view of what you were doing at that time because i find that work fascinating and it really points to some of the things that can promote and may be hinder our brains ability to change oh will that is fantastic we did bompinto each other i serendipitously back then and at the time i was a medicals to you we us studying with my moronic in particular i was studying how the brain i organizes when you have patterns of sound and i am particular we were studying the the brain of roans in try an understand how different sound patterns organize the frequency representation from low to middle high are quench maps an the brains of baby wrote and one things that i was very interesting was trying er stand out the patterns of the natural environment let say the vocalizations of the environment that the catsups were raised in were just the natural sounds of the hear how that shapes the structure of the brown of the brain and one of thins we did was to try an experiment where we raised some of these rat pups in white noise continuous white noise i was essentially masking all those environmental sounds and what was the consequence of animals being raised in white noise environment well one of things that we did not expect but we found which is quite striking is that there is is early period in brain development where were very susceptible to the patterns that we hear or see and in nursing recall this a critical period or a sensitive period and we have this for our eyes but we also have it for our ears and oh one of the most striking examples of this is that any human can essential grow up in a a culture where they hear different speech sounds from one language to another n ins after a couple of years you lose sensitivity the sounds that are not part of your native language and you have high density for for the languages of your native culture and om that is pretty pretty extraordinary that human brain has that flexibility yet at the same time has that specialization for language and we were trying to think about how do we model this for example and enrodencs who obviously do not speak but we are just understanding how sounds and environmental sounds modulate organize the auditory quarter and one o things that we found that was quite striking was that if you basically mask environmental sounds from these rat pups the critical period this sensitive period where it is open to plasticity it is open to change it is open to reorganization that actually that window can stay open much much longer in it and in one way it sounds that is good thing but on the other hand it it is also a a retardation it is actually slowed the maturation of the auditor quarter it was ready to close when these rapes were really young but by raising them in white noise we found out that you could keep it open for months beyond the time period that informally closes and i think one of things it taught me was that it is not just about the genetic programming the specifies some of this sensitive period but it is also little bit about the nature of the sounds that we hear that how keep that window for the critical period open and close it is fascinating and i know it is difficult to make a direct leap from animal researched a human research but if we could speculate a little bit i can imagine that some p pole grow up in homes where there is a lot of shouting and a lot of inflection i maybe people are very verbs others grow up in a home where it is quieter and more peaceful ah some beolergan to got up in cities its came back from new york city is all night long there is honking and sirens and non stop and then i return here where it is quite quiet at night can we imagine that the human brain is going to be shaped differently depending on whether not when it grows up in one environment or another and would that intact their tendency to speak in a certain way as well as here in a certain way would we know about that well i i think that it is from my perspective it is really clear that those sounds that we are exposed to from the velvety earliest time even in uteri in the womb were the sound is hearing the mother or father of friends around while in the whom actable influence how these things organize and and there is no question that the sounds that we hear can have some influence and those sounds are on a structure the way that those curl networks actually lay down and well forever influence how you hear sounds and speech and languages is probably one of the most profound examples of that i get a lot of questions about the use of white noise during sleep in particular people want to know whether not using a white noise machine were a machine or a program that makes the sound of waves for instance if it assist there infant and sleeping is it going to be bad for them because it is flooding the auditory system with a bunch of essentially white noise were disorganized noise we have an answer to that question not yet i think that what you're asking is really important question because parents are using white noise generators almost universally now and for good reasons it is heart ah to have kits up at night have got three kits of my own and a was very tempted to think about how to use some of these tools such as sooth them and get them to bed and especially when i was tired and exhausted am but i think that there is a cost to think a little bit about we were not exposed to continuous white noise naturally am there is a value to having really salient structure sounds that are part of our natural environment actually have the brain developed normally a whether or not that has an impact why you are sleeping it is not clear i i do not think that those studies have been done what was really clear was that if you raise these maybe rats in continuous white noise not superload but just enough to mask the environ mental sounds that that was enough to keep the auditory quarters the part of the brain that hears ah in this really delayed state which could essentially slow down the development maturation of the brain in one probably assume that slowing the maturation of arias of the brain the responsible for hearing might y under score might impact one's ability to speak right because is not it the case that if people cannot hear they a shall have a harder time enunciating in in ha particular way s i audit not be able to hear my own voice a would my speech patterns change well i think part of it is that a over time we develop sensitivity to the very specific speech sounds an at given language and a the sensitivity impress as we hear more or more or more of it and then on the other hand we lose sensitive each other speech sounds for the same time but it is part of that process we also have a a selectivity again a specialization even for those sounds a even relative to noise noisy backgrounds and things that i i tend to think about it what is the signal to noise ratio and the brain has it is own ways of trying to increase that signal to noise racial in order make it more clear part of that is how we hear and how it lays down a foundation for that signal noise ratio and you can imagine a child that is that is raised continuously and white noise would be really deprived of those kind of sounds that a really lesser for to developed properly i think with regard to am those tools for babies i think we we should study we should try to understand this definitively i think what we saw romance would tell us that there is potential now things that we should be concerned about but again it is not really clear if your just using at night whether i has those effects it's the critical question that a number of people are going to be asking is did you decide to use a white noise machine or not to help keep your any your three children sleep well a i think the short answers now i may i oversee that a lot of work thinking and work on this and thought about it carefully but there are other kinds of noise or i knew i would i call a noise other sounds that you can use that can be equally soothing to a baby oh it is just the white noise has no structure and what it is doing is essentially masking out all of the natural sounds and i think the goal should really be about how do we were place that with other more natural sounds that structure the brain in the way that we want to be more healthy well i know that after you finished your medical training you went on to were specialize in your surgery in not last i check you spend your most of your days either running or laboratory or in the clinic or running the department and your clinical work in your laboratory work in wolves often removing pieces of the skull of humans and going in in either removing things or stimulating nor on om treating various ailments of different kinds but your mainfocas these days of course is the neurobiology of speech and language and for those that are not familiar could you please distinguish for us speech verses language in terms of whether not different brain areas control them and i know that there is a lot of interest and how speech and language and hearing all relate to one another ye and then we will talk a bit about for instance emotions and how facial expressions could play into this or hand gestures et camera but for that the uninformed person and for me to be quite a direct what are the brain areas that control speech and language what what are they really an especially in humans how are they different amen we have such sophisticated language ism compared to a number of other species wat what is all this landscape look in there ye well a that is a fascinating question and ism an at just try to connect a couple of the dots here whale is that in that earlier work during medical school i was doing a lot of what we call narrow physiology putting electrodes into the auditory porters and understanding how the brain responds to sounds and that is how we actually mapped out these things about the sensitivity to sensitive periods that experience a with mike mess and i an thinking about how pastose is regulating in brain an particular about how sound is represented by brain activity was something that it was really formed for me and because i was a medical soon was going back to my medical studied am it was that in combination with seeing some awake brain surgeries that our department is really well known for o one of my meters michburger really pioneered these methods for tan care patients with brain to me and be able to do these surgeries safely by keeping patients awake and by mapping out language there talking and listening in your associating conversation with these patients wile there is a portion of their skull removed ad your stimulating or in some cases removing areas of their brain is that right that is that is exactly right and the only thing off there is it is not essentially it is it is just that the only difference between the conversation that i might have with my patient is undergoing a wake brain surgery is that i cannot see their face and they cannot see my face i we act to have a sterile a drape that actually separates the operating field and they're looking and interacting with our in our psychologists but i can talk to them and they can hear my voice and vice virgin its really really important way of how we can protect some of those areas are really critical for language at the same time accomplish mission of getting the seizures under control are getting a brain to murmur it is that because occasionally you will count er a brain area may be your stimulating your considering removing that brain area and suddenly the the a patient will start shuddering or will have a hard time formulating a sentence is that is that mentally what you are looking for you looking for regions in which it is ora or not out to probe exactly the first thing that we do is that we use a small electrical stimulator to probe different parts of the ares that we think might be a related and point for language or talking or even movements of your arm and that is what we call brain mapping and we use a small electrical current that is deliver it through a probe that we can just put it each spot and the tires that were really interest in er of course the areas that are right around the part that is pathological the part that is injure or the part that has a brain tumor that we want to remove we can apply that probe and transiently meaning temporarily activated sure stimulating the part of thrintht controls the hand the hand wilmove ah it will jerk sometimes a physic will be made something that a other times while some one is counting or just saying the days the we can can stimulate in a different area that stops their speech altogether that is what recall speech rest or if some one is looking at pictures and they are describing the pictures and y u stimulate particular area they stop speaking or the words stare coming out slurred or they cannot remember that the name of the object that they are seen the picture these are all things that were listening really carefully while we apply that a focal stimulation that is what we call brain mapping t whatever some of them were a surprising or maybe even if you want to offer one of the more outrageous examples of things that people have suddenly done or failed to be able to do as ha consequence of this brain mapping well i think the thing to me that has been the most striking is that some these areas you stimulate and altogether you can shut down someone is talking person says i wanted to say it but i could not get the words out and even though have seen this thousands of times now it is still exciting every time that i see it because it is it is exciting because you are seeing the brain it is a physical organic is part of the body outside of the veins on top of it does not look ah a machine but when you do something that n you folk lave change the way it works and you see that because a person cannot talk any one you said i know what i want to say but i could not get the words out you are confronted with this idea that that that organ is the basis of speech and language an way beyond that obviously for all the other functions we have for thinking and an feeling our emotions everything that to me is a constant reminder of am this really special thing that the brain does was compute a many o the things that we do in particular in the are round speech and language generating words something that is really unique to our species am is is just extraordinary to see again even though have seen a thousands of times it is just having that connection because it does not look machine but it is doing something that is quite complicated precise and remarkable you ever see emotional responses from stimulation in particular arias and do you ever here or see your emotional responses that are associate with particular types of speech because for i for this curse words are known to that people torts coffin will curse not always but it use was the left tax other theroid but am what i learned from a a colleague of ours is that ism cursewords have a certain structure to them there is usually a heavy a or kind of a sharp consonant up front wrist that alohas people at least as it was described to me to have some sort of emotional release it is not a word murmur which it has a kind of a soft entry here ism not using the ti language and it you pic your favorite curse word out there folks an i can and i shout out any now or saying now but that certain words have a have a structure to them that because of the motor patterns that are involved in in saying that word it you could imagine has at an emotional response unto itself when stimulating or when blocking these different brainareas you ever see people get angry or sad or happy or more relaxed oh well a definitely have seen cases where you can in woke anxiety stress and i think that they're also areas that you can stimulate you can also evoke am the opposite of that sir a calm state i think that brainairy is is slightly hyperactive in you or at least more than a than man all the years have known you you you have always been at least externally a very calm person i always funded musing that you work on speech and language in yo a very calming voice i a and ism being really serious kidding that there is a huge variation a right an interns of how people speak in the the how the accent words absolutely y there are areas for example am the orbit frontiquartex that we showed that if you stimulate there the orbital frontoquartex a part of the brain that is above the eyes that is why they call it orbital frontal a meaning it is above the eye or the orbit and in the frontal its sanserif wrist in here ah it has really complex functions it is really import for learning and memory but one of things that we observed as when you stimulate there people tended to have am a reduction in their stress and it was very much related to it their state of being meaning that if some one was already kind of feeling normal you stimulate their did not do much but if some one was in a very anxious state it actually relieve that and then we have seen the quarreller of that which is true too which is that there are other areas the misdeal or parts of the insula that if you stimulate you can cause an acute temporary ah anxiety a nervous feeling or if you setula insula people can have an ace feeling of disgust the brain has different functions in these different notes that help process the way we feel ah certainly i think that to some degree never psychiatric conditions reflect an imbalance of the electrical activities in these areas one of the things that was something i will never forget was taking care of a young woman with uncontrolled seizures a we call that epilepsy it is a medical condition were some one has in controlled electrical activity in the brain sometimes you can see that as convulsions where people are shaking and lose consciousness there are other kind of seizures of people can have we they do not lose consciousness but they can have experiences that just come out o nowhere and as just as a result of electrical activity coming from the brain and about six years ago i took care of a young woman who was diagnose psychiatrically with anxiety disorder for several years it turns out that it was not really an anxiety disorder was actually that shed underlying seizures an epilepsy activating apart of her brain that evokes anxious feelings how did how was that discovered because i know a lot of people to their have anxiety of yah in the absence of a brain scan how or why would one suspect that maybe they have a a tumor or some other condition that was causing those nervous o become hyprayet that is really important because many people have anxiety and the vast past majority or not having that because they are having seizures in the brain i think one of the ways that this was diagnose was that the nature of when she was having these panic attacks was not triggered by anything they would just happen spontaneously that is what can happen with seizures sometimes they just come out of nowhere we do not fully understand what contriver them but they were not things that were typically anxiety provoking this is something t just happened all of a sudden and because you brought it up this is not something that you can see on an emotion we and not see and look at the structure of her brain with an more that she was having seizures the only way that we could actually prove this was actually putting electrodes a into her brain and proving that these a taxis she were have she was having were localized to part called the misdeal it is a medial part of the temporal ope which is here and ism associating the electrical activity that were seeing on those electrodes with the symptoms as she she had and she ultimately needed a kind of surgery where she was awake ism in order to remove this safely speaking of epilepsy a number people out there have epilepsy or no people who do are the drugs for epilepsy ism satisfactory you know think o not things depict you have known adjusting the excitation and and ambition of the brain or men are the good drugs for epilepsy we know there are not great drugs for a lot of other conditions but i and how often does one need narrow surgery a in order to treat epilepsy can to be treated the most often just using pharmacology yo great question well ism a lot of people have seizures that can be completely controlled by their medications a lot but there is about one third of people who have epilepsy which we define as anyone who is had three or more seizures am that about a a third of them actually do not have control with all of the modern medications that we have nowadays and some of the dato suggest that if you have two or three medications action does not matter necessarily which of the antiseisure medications it is but there is dato suggest if you have just try two or three the fourth fifth six in beyond it is not likely to help control it ism we are in a situation on fortunately were a lot o the medications are great for some people but for another subset they cannot control it and it comes from a particular part of the brain now fortunately in that sub set there is another part of that that group that can benefit from a surgery that actually either removes that part of the brain and nowadays will us simulators now to am sometimes put electrical stimulation in that part of the brain to help produce to secure and you said a third of people with era epilepsy might need her a surgery well what i what i mean by that is they continue to have seizures that are not controlled by all medications and there is can be another subset of those that i may benefit from a surgery it is probably not that whole third it is a subset of that it is just to say that epilepsy can be really hard to get fixed and i for people were the seizures come from one spot er an area then surgery can do great if it coming from if it comes from multipilareas if it comes from the whole brain then we have to think about other methods to control fortunately nowadays orsecxy other ways am surgery now to us does not just mean were moving be the brain ah half of what we do now is use simulators i modulate the state of the brain that can help produce seizures have heard before that the qeitogenic diet was originally formulated in order to treat epilepsy in particular in kids is that true and why would being in a erogenic state with low blood glucose reduce seizures that is a great question and ism to be on is i do not know actually if it was originally designed to the seizures but i cannot tell you for sure that for some people just with some medications it it can be a life changing thing can completely change the way that the brain works and it is not something that is for everybody but for some people there is no question have some very beneficial the facts i think it is to be determined si why why and how that works have heard similar things about the keytogenic diet for people with alsheimers dementia that am there is nothing particularly relevant about ketose is two alsheimers per say but because alsheimers changes the way that neraunts metabolize energy that shifting to an alternate fuel source can sometimes make people feel better and a number people are now trying it but it is not as if am blood glucose and having carbohydrates is causing all alsheimers and people get confused often that at just because something i can help does not mean that the opposite as is harming a somebody that i find this really interesting a a sometime all check back with you about what is happening in terms of a qeetogenic diets an an epilepsy but it you said that in some cases it can help as that observation been made both for children and for adults because i thought that originally the keytogenic diet for epilepsy was really for pediatric epilepsy yet that is right a lot of its focus has really been on kids ah with epilepsy but certainly it is a safe thing to try lot of adults we will try it as well interesting it'd to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called a one is a vitamin mineral robotic drink that covers all your foundational nutritional needs have been taking athletic greens since two thousand an twelve am delighted that their sponsoring the podcast treason i starry taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athletic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets o me the probiatics that i need for got health our god is very important its populated by got microbioda that communicate with the brain the in system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long turn health and those probation enthetic greens are optimal and vital for macrobiotic health in addition athletic greens contains a number of adaptions vitamins and minerals that make sure that all my foundational nutritional needs are met and it tastes right if you to try athletic greens you can go to at letter greens dock calm slash supermen and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up at lentic greens while you are on the road in the car on the plain et camera and they will give you a year supply of it him in d three k too again that is that legit greensdock cam slash supermen to get the five free travel packs and the years supply a it him in three ka to ism curious about epilepsy a for another reason i was taught that epilepsy is not in balance in the excitation an an ambition in the branceithing by these electrical storms they give people either grandma shaking in i can of convulse in convulsions but years ago as reading a book a wonderful book actually the einstein in love by tennis overly is about einstein in his were i guess his personal life ben people who knew him claim that he would sometimes walk along and then every one sow i would just stop i can a stare off into space for anywhere from a minute to three to five minutes and it was speculated that he had absence seizures what is an absent seizure and the reason i ask is i a occasion would be walking along and it'll me thing about somethingand it'll stop but i in my mind i think i ism thinking during that time but i realize that if i were to see myself from the outside it might appear that i was just absent what is an absent seizure because it is strikingly different in its description from say a grandma convulsive seizure sire well luck i mention before depending on howl the seizure activity spreads in brain or how it actually propagates if it stayed in one particular spot and does not spread to the entire brain it can have really different manifestation i can represent really differently t absent seizures just one category of different know seizures were i you can lose consciousness panic and what i mean by that is that you are not fully aware of what is going on in firemen o case of your serve taken off lying temporarily from consciousness but you could still be for example standing and to people who are not pay attention they may not even beware but that is happening what are some other types of seizures well i think some of the other kinds are the classic ones are temporal seizures these are ones that come from the medial structures the make old and hip i campus i oftentimes people when they have seizures coming from that they make haste something very unusual a metallic taste or smell something the smell of burning toasts something that i there are some people will a with temporal seizures will have de gave they will have that experience that you have been somewhere before but a that is just a precursor to the seizure and it just high lights that when people have seizures coming from these areas they sometimes high jack what that part of the brain is really for they make to a and hippocampus forks i pare really import for learning and memory it is not surprising that when people have seizures there that it can invoke a feeling of de savor or that it can invoke a feeling of anxiety am and am and the areas that are right next to it for example a these air's are really inborn for processing a smell a these areas are right next to each others you can have these connect complex set of symptoms the weir taste smell of tost and an a feeling h desk that is classic for temporal of seizure and it is because those parts bring the process those functions are right next to each other ism told that have had nocturnal seizures and have woken up sometimes from sleep having felt as if i was having a convulsion the or sense of buzzing in the back on the head i s happen o me two or three times in college my griffin a well i woke up in my griffenwas very distraught your having a seizure you an full convulsion in my sleep a what are is that correct a there is there such a thing as nocturnal seizures what are they reflect they eventually stopped happening and i could not tether them to any kind of life event i was not doing any and a combats bort or anything at the time i was not drinking alcohol much it is never really been my thing a what are nocturnal seizures about oh a well and do i need brains a nocturnal seizures are just another form again pilose in seizure can have many different forms and a not just where in the brain but also when they happen and there are some people who ah for whatever reason it is very time to the circadian rhythm there is icy not just happening at night but a certain purity a night when people are in a certain speech of sleep that the brain is in a state that it is vulnerable taco having a seizure and that is basically it just one form of that again it is not just about where it is coming from but also when it is happening how that is time with other things that are happening with a body well it eventually stopped happenings have stopped worrying about it but ism haven had seizure since returning to speech in language a when i was getting wand in near o science i learned that we have an area of the brain for producing speech and we have an real the brain for comprehending speech what is the story there is it still true that we have a brokers in a verity's area i those are names of neurologists presumably or news surgeons they discover the different brain areas am maybe you could familiarize us with some of the the for textbook version of how speech and language ore organized in the brain maybe sure with us l a bit of the lesion studies that led to that understanding another i would love to here a bit about what your laboratory is discovering about how things are actually organized because from some discussions you and i have had over the last year it seems we its just be blunt it seems that much of what we know from the text books could be won well i i i love that question because for me it is very central to the research we do and it is for the intersection between what we do and laboratory in our research interfaces with what i see in patience and one of the things that fascinated me early on in my medical trying was in doing some of these brain mapping are watching them with my mentor or taking care of patience and had in a brain timerson' town part of the brain was that a lot of times what i was seen a patient did not quarrel with what i was taught in medical school and some people will think well o this might be an exception but after you see it for a couple times in if your kind interested in this problem it poses a in it imposes a serious challenge to what you have learned and how you think about how the sings i operate and that actually got me really interested in trying to figure this out because earlier we talked about just this extraordinary thing that the brain is doing to create words in sentences and that is the process by which ism getting ideas out from my mind into yours it is incredible thing wright it is the basis of communication i i hi high information communication between two individuals that is really unique to humans in his in historical times how this works has been very controversy from day one of narrow science i long time ago people thought the bumps on your head corresponded to the different faculties of the mind for example if you had a bump here might be corresponding to telligands or another one over here division and these kind of things i that is what a nowadays call phrenology and i that was kind of the starting point lot of that has been of course debunked but when you see those little statues of different brain partition on summons had that is essentially what how people were thinking about how the brain work back then m to a hundred years ago modern narrow science began when actually was very much related to the discovery of language modern narrow science meaning moving beyond this idea that the bombs on the scalp corresponded to the faculties of mine but there were things that actually were in the brain themselves and they were not corresponding to things t at you could see superficially on the can for i externally that it was something about the brain itself i mean it seems obvious now back then this was the big academic debate and the first observation that i think really was really impackful and in the airy of language was n observation by a nerve nersurgen a french nerousurge name pirbroka in what he observed was that a in a patient not that he did surgery but that he had seen in taking care of that the person could not talk and in particular they called this individual tan because the only words that he could produce was tan tan for the most part he could generally understand the kind of things that people were asking about but the only thing that he could utter from his mouth wore these words tan tan and what eventually had happened was this individual passed away and the way that neuroscience was done back then was basically to wait until that happened and then to remove the brain and to see what part of the brain was affected in this patient that they called tan and what book have found was that there was a part in the left frontoloe the frontalobe is his apelike i describe earlier which is up behind our forehead up here and in the back of that frontoloe he claim that this was the seat of articulation in the brain he literally something that in france the seat of articulation meaning that this is the part of the brain that is responsible for us generate words about fifty years later the story becomes more complicated with a german neurologist named call wernicy and what wernoky described was a different set of symptoms impatience that he observed a different phenomenon where people could produce words but a lot of the word they were fluent in the sense that they had am they sound they could be real words but from a different language for example and some of us call that word salad or jargon it is essential they were essentially making up words but it was not intentional is just the way that the words came out but in addition to that he observed that these people also could not understand what was being said to them ah you we could be having conversation and it be asking you a am i woman and you might knot your head just because you're not processing the question and am here two observations one is that the frontolobe is important for articulating speech creating the words and expressing them fluent my and then a different part of the brain called the left temporolope which is is airy right above my ear that is an area that i think was claim to be really important for understanding the two major functions in language to speak and to understand we are kind of pin down to that and we have had that basic idea in the text books for for two hundred years certainly when i was taught is that right o every ye it certainly no what we still we still teach you undergraduates graduates since in medical students that well that is what i learned to a medical school and what i saw in reality when i are taking care of patients was that it is not simple i the fact part of it is fundamentally wrong just in a nut shell nowadays a after now looking at this very carefully over hundreds of patients we have shown that surgeries for example in the posture part of the fronolope lot times per have no problem talking at all at all whatsoever after those kind surgeries and that it is a different part of the brain the call the precentral gyros i the precentral gyros is a part of the brain that i is intimately associated with e motor quarter the motor qartextss the part of the brain has a map of your entire body that has a part that corresponds your feet has a part that corresponds t your hands but then there is another part that comes out more laterally on the side of the brain that corresponds to your lips your jaw your marines and we have seen that when patients have surgeries are injuries to that part of the brain it actually can really interrupt language it is not as simple as just moving the muscles of the vocal track but it is also important for formulating an expressing words that is broke us area that i think the field now recognizes not just because of our work but many other people that have studied this in stroke in beyond is that the idea that that is the the basis of speaking in broke area is fundamentally wrong right now and we have to figure out how to correct the text books that we cannot understand that though we can continue to to make progress now in terms of the other major area that we call wernikees ere in the posture temporolope that has held help a i think quite legitimately for some time that is an area that you have to be supercareful when you do surgery there that is an area were if you have a mistake there and you cause a stroke or you move too much of the tumor there you go too far beyond it then the person can be really really hurt the will have a condition that we call a fascia where they may now be able to understand words they may not be able too a remember the word that there that they are trying to say they they know what they are trying to say but they cannot remember the precise word that goes with object that they're trying think of they may even produce words that i describe afore words salad or very jargon in's they might say something tower and i that is not a real word but it sounds it could be and that is just because that part of the brain has some role not just an understanding what we here but also actually has a really inborn rule and sending the commands to different person bring to control what we say not long ago you and me and my good friend rick rebel were having a conversation about medicine in science and rick asked the question what percentage of what you learned in graduate and our medical school do you think is correct and you had a very interesting answer would you share it with us a i do not know i do not remember the exact but i i would say that am with regard to the brain in particular i would say about fifty per cent gets it right in accurate and is helpful but another fifty per cent is just the approximation and over simplification of what is going on the example that we talk about language just in example of that it is just a there are things that make it easier to learn and easier to teach an easier to even think about that is probably why we continue teach you in the way that we do but i think it is time goes on the complexity of of reality of how the brain works is am while first fault we are still trying to figure it out and second of all it is completing it is it is still in complete story early days to well get into some of the technical advances that are allowing some correction of the errors that the field has made and look no disrespect to the brain explorers that came before us and on the ones that come after us will correct us right that is the way the game as played but am what ism hearing is that there are certain truths that people accept and than there is a about half of the information that is still open for debate and may be even for complete revision one thing that i learned about language and the nor circuits underlying languages that it is heavily literalized that these structures broke as in vernekies and other structures in the brain responsible for speech and comprehension of speech sit mainly on one side of the brain but they do not have a mirror representation or another er equivalently on the opposite side o the brain n for those that have not am poked around in a lot of brains am certainly you at you have done far more of that than i have whet have done my fair share in none human species in tidbit in humans almost every structure almost every structure has a matching structure on the other side of the brain when we say the hippocampi as we really mean too hippocampi i one on each side of the brain but language i was taught is heavily lateraled that is that there is only one that raises two questions one is that true and if it is true then what is the equivalent real estate on the opposite side of the brain doing ye if it is not doing the same function that the one on the say the left side is performing well that is one of those things that is again mostly true not a hundred per cent and what i mean by that is that a it is complicated for people who are right handed ninety nine per cent of the time the language part of the brain is on on the left side and what is the equivalent brain area on the right side doing if it is not doing language well to think that is incredible as if you look at the right side and you look at it very carefully either under an more or yer should look at the brain under slides at a microscope it looks very very similar it is not identical but it looks very very similar all the girl which are the the bombs on the brain that have the different contours and the valleys i we call sol side those all look basically the same there is a mure an atomy on the left ain right side and it is not been clear what special actually about the left side to a to house language but what we do know this is what we use all the time in assessing figuring a this before surgery is if you are right handed ninety nine percent the time the language is going to be on the left side of the brain is handedness genetic in any way a in when i as threw up i a pen or pencil was gran was placed into my hand presume hear i started you see my my father was left handed and then where he grew up in south america they they forced him to to force himself to become right hands if she used to restrict the movement of his left hand he was forced to write a and then you have hook hook lefty e hook city e a i know this is a deep dive and we pray to ant to go in every deprivation of this but for somebody whose left handed naturally starts writing wit the left hand there is some genetic predisposition to being left handed absolutely no question about it handiness is is not entirely but strongly genetic a there is something about the ties all of this and what is candidness fork simple have to do with were the part of your bring that controls language well turns out that the parts that control the hand are very close there is that really are responsible for the vocal tract again part of the motor quarter i part of this brain area called the are central iris and there are some theories that because of their proximity a that these parts of he brain might develop together early in tutor and they might have a head start compares the right side and because they have a head start that things solidify there this is one theory of why this happens and people who are left handed it still turns out that the vast majority of people have language on the left side but it is not ninety nine person it is more levity person siffou're left handed i still more likely that the language part of your brain is going to be on the left side but there is going to be a greater proportion may be twenty thirty per sent where it is either in both hemispheres or on the right side and just to make this a little bit more interesting is that when people have strokes on the left side and if they are lucky enough to recover from those strokes sometimes that involves reorganization this term that we call plasticity earlier where the fairies around were the stroke take on that new function a way that they did not have before that can certainly happen in the left hemisphere but there are also instances where the right hemisphere can also start to take on the function of language where it wen it was once the left and then transfers to the right the thing that i i think about a lot is head that the machinery probably exists on both sides but we do not use them together all the time in fact we may strongly by us one side or the other just we use our two hands in very very different ways it is a little bit the same with the brain well it is because of what we do with the bring that actually is why we use the hands in different ways and the same thing goes for language which is again the substrates the organ the language organ the part of the brain the process it probably has very similar machinery on the left side is the right the right may have the capability to do it but in real every day use the brain specializes one of the sides in order for us to to use it functionally that is that is a theory you are by langue correct ye you speak english achiness ye for people that are by langue and that learn two or more long o by langurs to obviously but learn both languages er that is ay more languages from an early time an life do they use the same brain area to generate that language or perhaps they use the left side to speak english in the right side to speak gives do we know anything about by languilism in the brain i think we know a lot about by langualism the brain the answers are still out there the final answers on it and part of the answer is yes absolutely we use some parts of the brain ah very similarly we act to have a studying the labor now where we are looking at this where people go who speak one language or another or by langue i and we are looking at how the brain activity patterns occur whether here in one language viruses the other and what striking to see actually is how overlooking they really can be even though the person man have no idea of the language that there hearing the english part of the brain still processing that and may be trying to interpret it through an english lands for example the short answer is that with by linguist there are sheered circuitry there there is to shared machinery n the brain that allows us to process both but it is not identical it is the it is the same part of the brain but what it is doing with the signals can be very very different and what i mean by that precisely is not the instantaneous detecting of one sound to the next but the memory of the sequences of those particular sounds that give rise o things words and meaning that can be highly variable from one individual to the next and those nomads are very very sensitive to the sequences of the sounds even though the sounds themselves might have some overlap between languages fascinating gets we take about brain areas and a little bit about lateralization want to get back to the hands and somethings rein to emotion an on bit but maybe now we can go into those brain areas and start to ask the question what exactly is represented or mapped there and for people who perhaps are not familiar with brain mapping and representation and receptive feels perhaps the simplest analogy might be the visual system where i look at your face i know you i recognize you and certainly there are brain areas theater responsible for face recognition but the fact that i know that is your face and for those listening and looking into ed's face the fact i know that that is your face at all is because we are well aware that there are cells that represent edges and that represent dark and light and those all combine in what we call a hierorstructure they for build up from basic elements as simple as little dots but the lines and things that move at camera to give a coherent representation of the face when i think about language i think about words and just talking if i sit down to do a long podcast a i think about asking a question i do not even think about the words i want to say very much i men t have to think about them alow it one would hope but i do not think about individual syllables unless ism trying to accent something where is a word that i have a particular difficulty saying where i want a change the cases et camera what is represented in the in the neurons the nerve cells in these areas are they representing vowels consonance and how do things inflection i occasionallywill poke for it up speak but there is a i think a healthy e abnormal aversion of steak or somebody is asking a question for instance what is that that is an appropriate use of up speak i supposed to saying something that is not a question and putting a lilt at the end of the sentence then we call that speak which it does not fit with what the person is saying what in the world is contained in these brain areas what is represented a to me is is perhaps one of the most interesting questions and i know this land square in your wheel house sure let us get into this a drew because this is one of the most exciting stuff that is happening or i now is understanding how the brain processes these exact questions and you ask me floor what is diffetween speech and language a speech corresponds to am the communication signal it corresponds to me moving my mouth in my vocal tract to generate words and your hearing these is an auditory signal language is a something much broader it refers to what you are extracting from the words and ism saying we call that pragmatics and share you getting the gist of what ism saying there is another aspect of it that we call semantics do you understand the meaning of these words and on the sentences there is another part that we call syntax which refers to how the words are assembled in a grammatical form those are all really critical parts of language and speech is just one form of language eyes many other forms sign language ah reading those are all important modalities for reading our research really focuses on on this this a the recalling speech again the production of this audio signal which you cannot see but your microphones are picking up there are these vibrations in the air that are created by my vocal tract that are picked up by the microphone ah in the pin the case of this recording but also picked up by the sensors in your ear the very tiny vibrations your a ear are picking that up in translating that into electrical activity and what the ear does at the periphery is translates all sounds into different frequencies it is man thing to do is to take ah a speech signal or any other kind of sound and decomposing meaning separate that sound into different kind of signals and in the case of hearing what it is doing is separate it out into low middle high frequencies it a very very high resolution s doing it very quickly in its doing in a really fine way to separate all f those different sounds if you look at the periphery near the nerve that goes to your ear those nerve fibers some of them are tuned to low frequency some of em are tune to high frequencies some of them or into t mental frequencies and that is what your ear is doing its taking these words and splitting them up into different frequencies and for those the got there that are not familiar with thinking bout things in the call frequency space om base tones would be lower frequencies and high pitchstones would be higher frequencies just to make sure voices on the same page the sound of my voice the sound of your voice or any sound in the agreement is being broken down into these frequencies are they being broken down into very narrow channels of frequency or they am one avoiding knowing cloture here om or they are they being bend as fairly broad frequencies cause we know low medium at high but them for instance i can detect whether not somethings approaching me or or moving away from me depending on whether not it sweeps louder o or it words are away it is subtle but and of course its combine with what i see and my own movement but om how finally sliced is our perception of the auditory world oh extraordinarily precise i mean we take these mill o second cues the mill o second differences between the sound coming to one ear let see your tear verses your left to understand what direction that sound came from those are only mill second differences and that is how precise this works but on the other hand o it does a lot of computation on this it does a lot of analysis as you go up and a lot of our work is focus on the the part of the brain that we call the quarter the quarters the the outermost parbrain where we believe that sounds are actually converted into words and language there is is transformation where at the ear words are decompose and turned into these elemental frequency channels and then as it goes up through the auditory system it is the quarter there are some things to happen obis before gets the quarter but when it gets to quarter though something special going on which is that that part of the brain is looking for specific sounds and specifically what i mean by that is the sounds of you man language the ones that are the different consonance and vowels in a different language one of the ways that we have studied this is looking in patience who have epilepsy and and why to these cases where the more looks completely normal we have to put electrodes surgically on a part of the brain i the temporalope is a very very commonplace we have done a lot of our work looking at you the temporalope processes speak sounds because we are looking for to were the seizure start but then re also doing brain mapping for language and speech we can protect those ears we want identify the airs that we want a remove to cure some one seizures but we also want to figure out the areas at a important for speech and language to protect those that we can do as assured that is effective and safe and in our research and why it is become a really important addition to our knowledge is that we have elect notes directly recording from the human brain surface a logs acnowlodgy we work with know is recording on the mill on the order of millimeters an they can order they can record mill second time resolution of normal activity and what we see is extraordinary patterns of activity when people hear words and sentences if you look at that part of the brain that we call weenies ere in this part of the temporal lob this whole area lights up when you hear words or speech and it is not in a way that is a general libel warming up and it is generally find up but what you actually see is something much much more complicated which is a pattern of activity and what we have done in the last ten years is try to understand what is that pattern come from and if we were to look at each individual sight from that part of the brain what would we see what parts of words are being voted by electrical activity in those parts of my remember the cartel is using electrical activity to transmit information and do analysis and what were doings were eves dropping on this part of the brain as its processing speech to try to understand what each individual sight is doing and what are the sights doing or could you give us some examples what those sides are doing for instance are they sights that are specific for what we could say even listening for consonance or vowels or for a inflection or for emotionality what is in there of well wat what makes these what at makes these cells fire yah what gets them excited what gets them going is hearing speech in particular there are some of these really focalsites again just on the order of millimeter or at some level single naans that are tune to consonance some are tune to vows some are tune to particular features of consonance what i mean by that are different categories of a consonance there is a class of consonance that we call close if consonance this a lot bit of linguas sichargon but i in to make a point here with that is that certain classes of sounds when you make them it requires you to actually close your mouth temporarily now man be thinking about this supplosive plosive saying the word plosive does requires that exactly what s cool about that is that we actually have no idea was union in our mouth when we speak we really have no idea some people definitely have no idea well not just in terms of what you are saying some times o but actually how you are actually moving it the different parts of vocotract and have a feeling if we actually required understanding we would never be able to speak as it complex it is such a complex feet some people would say it is the most complex motor thing that we do as a species is is o speaking not the extreme feats of acrobatics or athleticism but one as o speaking you an especially when a one observes ye opera or on people who in freestyle wrappers in and of course is not just the lips it is the tongue and and you have mentioned to am other structures faring and lacings are the main on es that the he tells just just educates at as as superficial level what the bearing and lacings do differentially cause i think must be weren't going to be e our a it'll talk primarily about the marines here for a second chichis that if you think about one we are speaking a really what we are doings for shaping the breath even before you get to marines you got a start with the expiration we fill up our lungs and then we push the air out that is a normal part breathing and what is really amazing about speech an languages that we evolved to take advantage of that normal physiologic thing at a lapins and what the learn does is that when you are exhaling it brings the vocal folds together some people call them vocal chords they are not really cords the really vocal folds there two piece of teach you that come together an a muscle brings them together and then what happens is when the air comes through the vocal folds when they are together they vibrate ah it really high frequencies a hundred or two hundred hurts yours is probably about a hundred hurts as yours is two hundred hours s most male voices round a hundred look and then the average female voice around two hundred s and as have always had the same voice yes is s was us want or shame when i was folks my voice never changed i always had the same voice is is a discussion for another well it is a grave voice a a great barton voice but i know win your voice it is a low frequency voice and the reason why men and women generally have different a voice qualities is it has to do with the sighs of the marines in the shape of it o case in general men have a larger voice box or marines and the vibrating frequency the residence frequency of the vocal folds when the air comes through them is about a hundred hurts for men and about two hundred for women what happens is oke you are taking you take a breath breath hen and then as the error is coming out the vocal for is come together the air goes through that creates the sound of the voice that we call voicing and that is the energy of your voice it is not just your voice characteristic it is the energy of your voice it is coming from the marines there it is a noise and then it is the source of the voice and then what happens is that energy that sound goes up through the parts of the vocal track the marines into the oral cavity which is your mouth in your tongue in your lips and what those things are doing is that their shaping this the air in particular ways that create consonance and vows that is what i mean by shaping the breath it just starts with this exculpation you generate the voice in the drinks and then everything above the marines its moving around just the way my mouth is during right now to shape that air into particular patterns that you can hear its words fascinating and immediately makes me wonder about you more i primitive were non learned vocalizations crying or laughter babies will cry babies will so laughter are those sorts of a vocalizations produced by the languagareas vernickies or do they have their own unique neral structures yah interesting question we we call those vocalizations am a vocalization is basically where some one can create a sound a cry or a moan am that kind of sound and it also involves the exaltation of air it also involves some donation at the level lacings where the vocavolts come together to create that audible sound but it turns out that those are actually different areas people who have injuries in the speech and language ears oftentimes can still moaned they can still vocalize and it is a different part of the brain i would say an area that i even non human primates have that can be specialized for vocalization is a different form of communication than the words for example the intricacy of these circuits in the brain and their connections to the drinks and marines an is just it is almost overwhelming in terms of thinking about just how complicated it must be and yet some general features and principles are starting to emerge from your work and from the work of others if we think about that work and we think about rinsing vernecki's area if i were t record from neurons in verneckie's area at different locations would i find that there is any n systematic lay out for instance in terms tat u took about sound frequency we know that low frequencies are represented at one end of a structure and high frequencies at the other this is true actually release from my earlier training it within that within the year itself within the cocci the early work of on because an from cadaversright they i show figure this out from dead people which is incredible a fastening literature people should look up am and in the visual system we know that for instance visual position where things are map systematically nor in other words anurans that sit next to each other in the brain represent portions of visual space that are next to each other in the real world what is the organization of language in arms vernickies unbroken us for instance am i think of the calls a i owe you a as and of a coherent unit but do i find the anurans are next to the eager runs er next to the a wear the a the a i owe you is that van representation also lead out in order or is it consultant pepper is at random that is been one of the most important questions we have been training answer for the past decade there is a part of the brain that we call the primary auditory quarter in the primary auditory quarter is deep in the temporal lobe and if you looked at that part of the brain there is a map of different sound frequencies if you look at the front of that primary auditory quarter you will find low frequency sounds and then is you march backwards in that that quartet goes from low to medium tie frequencies its organizing this really night nice in orderly way and it turns out that does not just one there is mirrors of that am tone frequency map in the primary auditory quarter the a is that are really important for speech ah are on the side of that and we now think that speech can go straight to the speech quarter without having to go through the primary auditory quarter and it has its own pathway to get to the part of the brain on the processes speech and when we have looked at that question about is there a map the short answer is yes there is a map and it is ah but it is not structure a universally across all people in a way that we can clearly see right now it is a sultan emperor map of the different features and speech before we talked about these sounds that are called plosives you make a plosive when the mouth or something that walk howdy closes temporarily and when it opens that creates that fast plosive sound when you say am dad am or am the ball the bee in ball that kind of thing you will notice that your your lips i should close and then it is the release of that that creates that particular sounds those of the sounds that we call plus of those are banana pataca those are a certain class of consonants an we call a close sounds there is another class of sounds that we call fricatives in linguistics fricatives are created by turbulence an the the air stream has it comes out through the mouth an the in the way that we make that turbulence is getting the mouth in the lips to close almost until they are completely shut or putting the tongue to near the teeth almost get it completely shut but just have a narrow aperture that creates a turbulent in the air fly that we perceive as high frequency sounds those hat sounds she an a those kind of things those are if you look the frequencies are higher frequencies and those are created by specific movements that you constrict the air flow to create turbulence and we hear it as she a a if i say that exactly and as suppose to opposite where it'd say explosive y ism now of course ism emphasizing hernial this explains and a something in sales a mystery which as recently give been passing by the work of it of it physician scientists am tracked doctor chain a san what done a lot of work on am things that are contained in pesticides and foods that are changing harmony levels and she refers to valleys which is spelled pe it is both olive and a the it is combining the two and it is one of the most difficult words in the english language to pronounce am second only perhaps to the crept pronunciation of ophiology it is a commination of a of opposite and one of these the sounds and that is probably why it is difficult that is exactly right in fact am we have a turn for that that is called a consonant cluster sometimes syllables which just have one consonant but when we start stacking certain syllables an a sequence and there is rules that i should govern which consonance can be in particular sequence for a given language am that that makes a more complicated and certain languages have a lot more constant clusters then other for instance for instance russia for example has a lot of constant clusters english has lot of them there ore the languages a they've very very few a for example ahawian whine has an inventory of about twelve to fourteen different foliums fourteen different consonant and vows english on contrassess about forty a different consonants and vows languages have different memories they can overlap for sure but different languages use different sound elements combine and recombined those elements to give rise to different words and meanings can we say that there is a most complicated language out there or among the most couple would it be russia it'd stuffily high up there english is up there too actually ye german is were and in terms of learning multiple languages during development my understanding is that if one wants to become by languor try lingua best to learn those languages simultaneously during development ideally before age twelve if one hopes to not have an accent in speaking them later that corrector you one revises that la basically the earlier and the earlier is better ah the more intend it is and the more immerse of it is a the longer that you can be exposed to that is forimpornt a lot of people can get exposed for all and basically lose it even though it is concentering that pensive pure unless it is maintain it can be very easily lost then i think another aspect of it that is very interesting is am some the social requirements for it too it is pretty clear that you can only go far am just listening to these sounds from a taperecorting or something that there is something extra about real human in our actions the activates the brains sensitivity too different speech founds allows us to become specialize for them for a given language returning to the the what is raped what what the representations are in the brain ism starting to get a picture now based on these plosives than these sounds a and what i find interesting and logical about that is it maps to the motor structures in the actual pronunciation of the sounds not necessarily to the meaning of the individual words now of course it is related to the meaning of the individual words but it makes good sense to me why something as complexes language both to understand and to generate would map to something that is essentially motor in design because it you point out aged generate these sounds and i have to her them generated from others however there is reading and there is writing and writing is certainly motor reading invalvsime motor commands of the eyes and et camera where do reading and writing come into this picture are they in parallel with as we would say in their science or are they imbedded within the same structures are they am part part of the same series of computations ye a to address the first part is that we have got this map of these different parts of cousin once and vowels and when we look at how they lay out and this this part of the rendthet we call wornacursary we spend a lot of time really just dissecting this celli meter by perimeter the term the use is very apropos it is solemn pepper it is not random there is this kind of selectivity to these individuals speak sounds and one point i wont to make about it is this is that am an english for example there about forty different phonies phonies are just consonants a pals or individual speech segments but these articulatory features that you refer to for example the characteristic sounds that are generated by specific movements in the mouth you can more or less reduce that to about twelve different features these are specific movements of the tongue the jaw the lips the marines they are about twelve of these movements in just you said drew by themselves they have no meaning they are just movements but what is incredible about it is that you take these twelve movements and you put him in combinations and you stare putting them in sequent we is humans use those twelve set of features too generate all words and because we can generate nearly an infinite number of words with that code of just twelve features we have something that generates essentially all possible meaning be at what we do is humans we generate meanings om train communicate one idea to another which to me is extraordinary a parallel would be for example deadeye there is four basepeers in d'anade but with those force four basepeers in a specific sequent can generate an entire code for life in speeches the same way it is you have got these fundamental elements that by themselves have no meaning but when you put them together give rise to every possible meaning with regard to your second point about reading writing it is a fascinating question speech an language is part of who we are as humans that is a part of how we evolved and it is hard wire and i no molded by experience reading and writing are human invention it is something that was added on to the architecture of the brain and because reading writing are fairly recent and human evolution it is essentially too quick for anything till i have a dramatic change in lets say a new brain area or some kind of specialization instead what happens is that when ever any kind of behavior becomes ultra specialize a in any of us or any organism we woken sort of take some areas that are normally involved with vision for example in specialize it for the purpose of reading all of us have apart of our brain in the back of the temporal ope that interface with the spital visual quarter that we call a visual word former there is actually a part of the brain that is very sensitive to seeing words i either type dor mandarin there is a part of the brain that also sensitive to sing things faces ism these are things at are all condition on what is important to survive i reading and writing are invention and there are things that have mapped to functions of the brain are ready has and one of the really important things about reading writing is that when wed learn to read and write specially with the reading part it maps to the parted brain that we have been talking about which is the part that is processing speech sounds some of us kind of thing about these are two different things one is hearing sounds through your ears the other is reading we are actually seeing things through your eyes and then getting into languages well it turns out that the auditory speech quarter is the primal and primitive fundamental aery that is really import for speech in what happens with the reading is once it gets through that visual quarter it is going to try to map those reading signals to the part of the brain that is try make since of sounds the sounds of words what we call phenology now is is important it it is a lot of relevance to how we learn to write and in some kits with dyslexic diselexiis a neurological condition were i a child in some case an adult has trouble reading for example and in many of those cases it is because that mapping between how we see the words to the way that the brain processes the sounds is something different it is a little bit different that people who can read really well when you are reading a lot of times yare actually activating the part of the brain that is processing the words a you hear what is the current treatment for dyslexia give have heard that it say defined in some of the motion process in systems of the visual system you now people r their eyes are jumping as apposed to word when you're reading a cross or i suppose to chines by you presume people re always reading english or i suppose if it is we brother going from the opposite side of the page what can be done for dislexye and do any of the modern treatments for dislikes yet involve cane changing things from the speech side i supposed just the pout's pat reading side given that speech and reading a interconnected yet absolutely again i think in the beginning people might have thought this was purely a visual abstraction or something really just about the visual system but there is been more recognition that it could be both or could be either depending on the particular instance ism it is very clear that there are many kits with likes a where the problem is a problem of phonological awareness ism it can be very hard to detect because it may understand the words at you're saying but because the brain is good at pattern recognition sometimes even if the individual resounds are not crystal clear it can compensate that that you can have an individual who can hear the words but not be able to essentially i hear them when there reading those same words and what can happen with that is that you can have this disconnection between on what they're seen and what they need in order to her it's words and process it is language and skilled readers i usually need that rout first they have got a map the vision to the sound in order get that sort of foundation but then over time the reading has its direct connection to the language parts of the brain and we do not necessarily always needs to map to sounds you can basically develop a parallel rout and we as readers actually use both all the time for example if it is a new word that you have never seen before sometimes you try to pronounce it in your mind to n try to hear what that word is even though you are not actually saying your trees generate with those sounds might might be and that is the part where we are kind of i relying on how we learn to read in the first place which is mapping those word images to the sounds at go along with them but another times if you are really proficient reader you are just seeing the words and you can map them directly to meaning without having to go through that i go through that process ism a big fan of listening to audio books and of course i also listen to podcast quite a lot but i also a strong believer based on the research that have seen that reading books physical books could be unkind ogle i suppose but reading a physical book it is useful for being able to articulate well and structure sentences and build what are essentially paragraphs which is what have price to do when i do solo episode to the podcast have noticed over the years as text messaging has become more popular and there is a essentially in erosion of punctuation or the need to have complete sentences and now that sort of transfer to male as well it is become exact the rolled to say you fragment it sentence is animal it it seems likely that it is darting impact the way that people speak is well and i do not think this has anything to do with intelligence or education level but are you aware of any evidence the at how we read and what we read and whether or not we consume information purely through reading or mainly through auditory sources does it change the way that we speak because after all vernickies an broke as area and the other auditory in speech productionary is art heavily intermashed and t would make perfect sense to me that what we her and the patterns of sound there being communicated to us would also change the way that we speak ye that is a really fascinating point i there is this idea that there is this proper way to speak that there is the right way for example i what are the appropriate for example in school i they're oftentimes told you should say this not say that and every language gonna has that it turns out that that is really unnatural languages and speech in particular change over time it evolves i in iconic it can happen very quickly the things that we call dialects for example are just different ways of speaking in some one can just being one environment and change from one dialect to other or in some people at kind of is is really fixed and there is this idea that in school that though i told that there is is right way but in reality that is not true language change in speech changes completely normal in happens all the time and it can be really dramatic certain cultures and communities if they are isolated that can develop a whole new language a whole new said of of words for example new ways and dialects that our independent from people to the point were it is unintelligible even to to to others and a the basic idea is that sound change is part of the way at works and the brain is very sensitive to those kind of changes speaking of learning new languages ism assuming it is possible to learn new languages throughout the life's men direct ye have also heard these and of fantastical stories of somebody has a stroke and then suddenly spontaneously can speak french fluently were as prior to the stroke they could not is there any merit to those stories whatsoever i i find it very hard to believe that there was a complete mapperepresentation of a language in somebody is brain that they were completely unaware of and then because of damage to a brain area that capacity to speak that language was somehow unveiled it just seems too wild and unless it good to be true because nobody wants a stroke but it just seems outrageously implausible well their aspects of that that certainly are impossible i i do not know of any true case that have ever being or experience myself or even read about where for example there is an intern to the brain that a result in loss of a well essentially a gain a function meaning the art if just all of us sudnsort speaking another language for example of you hat a stroke and you never spoke french and then you had it and then all of a sun your speaking that i have never heard of never seen however there is a condition that is well acknowledge and i have seen one case of this called a foreign accent centrum which can am it is peculiar because there are people who have an intern to the part of the brain where it sounds the starting to speak this other language but they are not actually speaking the language just sounds it and this goes back to what were talking about earlier about these areas that are really inborn for speech control of the the vocal tract this are in the precentral chirps people have documented were i your patients have that strokes there and after that it sounds their speaking punish i supposed to english or it sounds they have the intonational properties of french or russia as compared to their original native language they are not learning all the resit the meaning and the grammar et camera but there adopting some the phonology and part of that is just because a it is not working the way it normally does there is something actually called a foreign accent centrum the people green have after a stroke interested curious a auditory memory when i was a kid i used to get into bed at night and it close my eyes and i would replay conversations that it'd heard during the day or people's voices i she can remember calling your house when we were young kids and because i do not speak any chines but it'd have to ask for you it'd say i think it was at si bolt i ye yean then some one whoever answer the phone would say i would go levin the is a chose which i believe means thank you right that is the total of the lines that i speak by the way but i will never forget he'll just never forget it i hope i suppose if i have a stroke or something o that sort that somepoint it'll forget in i will not know that ice forgotten it but in all seriousness i i remember that to this day i could not spell that out i would not know how certainly not in chines but am an even a transliteration i could not i could not do i using english a letters where a memories of sounds stored because within our days and across our lives we have a infinite number of auditory experiences just like we have an infinite number of visual experiences where they stored and n what is the structure of their storage what what am i calling upon besides of course the motor commands that are required to say what i just said in chines which i will not repeat again also i as yo at great the first time fellas not terribly wrong then i do not about o the second time where is that toward and how does that work and more importantly as i speak my native language english in my pulling from a memory bank because it does not feel it ism just telling you what i want to say ism do my best to communicate clearly and succinctly you shall not got the succinct part but where is the bank of information on my key word on my computer i have the letters and have certain elements of punctuation in the space what am i pulling from in my pulling from those plosives but if how can i do it quickly even for people that speak slowly it it appears no less fluid this to me is overwhelmingly impressive that the brain can do that how does it do that well first fa ism i have impress that thirty five here at y had to get hold of you so i am impress thirty five yours later that you can still remember that but only that that is fine ism still very impression am but it clearly it something important to you and am the short answer is that memory is very distributed it is almost the question that you ask me is am ill post cause you ask me where where it is not one specific admit is ictus really distributed it is not just one particular in fact have fairly certain that if we were to injure that part of the brain call the wornikeys aria you may still even have memories of that people can it have it injuries of brocuseryor certainly the precentral girls and be able to ism sing happy birthday for example when it is imbedded in malady or highly rehearse things counting despite not beagle to speak which is incredible right it is you can see a patient for example who cannot really put together sentence you ask somehow you feeling to the can you utter a word but then you ask some to count sometimes in the they'll get up to any number really and there are some things that are really built in to our mother memory and it is distributed it is not one particular part of the brain it is actually multiple a was where that memory is distribute and thank god that is the way it is because it is very rare in the kind of surgeries that i do where you go on your remover part of piece the brain that some one forgets these kind of long term memories or these long term motor skills that they have that is very very rare it is the number one question opinion will ask me a i goadnto be the same and i him i gong to remember ye my wife or i might have a ran me remember these thoughts of my birthday when i was ten years old and have never really seen that kind of severe and ye s unless it is a very very severe entry that involves almost the entire brain and thank to a lot of that information is really distributed across the entire bring speaking of storage of in ability to speak i you are ism doing some amazing work and have achieved some ism pretty incredible well deserved recognition for your work in bringing language out of paralyzed people essentially allowing people who are locked in to a paralyzed state or otherwise unable to articulate speech using brain machine interface essentially translating the curl activity of areas of the brain that would produce speech into hardware wires and and things of that sort artificial non biological tools in order to allow paralyzed people to communicate we will provide a link to some of the popular press cover to that work in the original papers but i if you would be kind as to tell us what those experiments look ism who these people are who are locked in and that you allow to communicate and then especially ism interesting to me o some of the directions that you are taking this now which is beyond just you do not people being able to think about what they want to say and words coming out on a screen or through a microphone but actually making the interactions between these people in the real world am more i a elaborate and more real if that seems mysterious to people ism an let any tell you what ism they are doing with us rather than ism put any more detail on it oh well thinks for asking about this has really been some of the exciting recent work from the lab for less decorator we have really been focusing on the basic science meaning trying to understand how the brain extracts and produces i speech sounds and works we have done a lot of work trying to figure out how these parts of the brain i control these individual elements that give rise tall works and and meanings and it was about six years ago were we realize we actually have a pretty good idea of how this code works we had identified all of these different elements that we could decode in epilepsy patient for example when other electorates on the brain this part of their surgeries we could decode all of the different consonance in valise of english that was about six years ago a natural question was this which is if we understand that electrical code can we use that to help some one who is paralyzed and cannot get those signals out of the brain to speak normally and that is in the setting of people who are paralyze there series of conditions am the include things brainstorms stroke the brainstorm is the part of the brain that connects the cerebral which is the topper does our thinking and out of the motor control speech language everything and the brainstorm is what connects that to the spinal sort in the nerves a go out to the face on bocaltract if you have a stroke there basically you could be thinking all the wild creative intelligent thoughts you haven't the mind in the srebrom but you cannot get them out into words or you cannot get them out to your hand to write them down that is a very severe former pyrolysis called brainstorms stroke there is another kind of conditions that we call narvegegenerative where the nerve cells ah die basically or atrophy in a condition called ah analyze and that is a very severe form of paralysis an it is extreme form people a mention lose all voluntary movement just even hacking would be a good example of some one with talk less lugarisises he is an example of some one who had ah a less but not a great example of what typical course of alas for reason's not clear the progression of disease largely stabilize o the point where he could twitch you knows as ache muscle or move is eyes let us say an most people it is very rapid ah am many people they die from it actually within a couple years off diagnosis yet he lived a long time in that he lived a long time and s land is ended overstate and river exactly and a but he was not breathing through a tube in his throat for example because people with severe less the muscles to their to their die from in their lungs a entity give out as well they get weakness earn than they cannot breathe any more that is another form of paralysis and in our field these are con lice the most devastating things that can happen ism not can really try to compare it what is worse havering brain to burr stroke it is all bad but this condition of what we call being locked in refers to this idea that you can have completely intact cognition and awareness but have no way to express that no voluntary movement nobility to speak and that is devastating because ah psychologically and socially you are completely isolated that is what we call location cento and it is devastating have peng that throat my career and it is really heartbreaking because a that the person is there but you cannot see they cannot communicate we have been studying this patterning of electrical activity for consonance in vocals and since he once we fever it out a lot of these cots for the individual fanatic elements we took a little bit of a detour or at least parted asserted focus on this very specific question for people who have these kind of paralyses could we intercept those signals from the brain the cerebral quarter as some one is trying to say those words and then can we intercept them and then have them taken out of the brain through wires to a computer that interpret those signals and translate them into words about three years ago we started a clinical trial is called he bravo trial it still under way and the first participant in the brave trial was a man who had been paralyzed for fifteen years when he had twenty when he was about twenty years old he came to united states o was actually working in sodomy area and he was in a car accident and e actually walked out the hospital day after that caraccident but the next day had a complication related to it where he had a very large stroke in the brainstorm and that turned out to be devastating he did not wake up from that stroke for about a week he was in a coma for about a week and when he woke up from that coma he realized that he could not speak or move his arm sprigs and as he told me or communicated to us that was absolutely devastating he wanted really to die at that time could he blink his eyes move his mouth in anyway he could blink his eyes he had some limited mouth moving but could not produce any intelligible beach was completely slurred and incomprehensible and he survived this injury a lot of people who have that kindstroke just on survive but he survived and i also realized that he is just an incredible person a force of nature in terms of his optimism in terms of his ability to make friends despite his condition the way he actually communicates because he has a little bit of residual neck movements is that he improvised and had his friends basically but a stick attached to his baseball cap because he could move his neck he would essentially type out letters on a keyboard screen to get out words in fact this is how he communicated was through devised that he would since he peck out letters one by one by moving his neck to control this stay attached to his baseball cap how many years did he use that method of communication until ere about fifteen years he had not really spoken for about fifteen years you ah it was a devastating injury but there something be said about am the human spirit and if there is anyone who embodies it it is poncho that is his nickname the first purchase been in our trial am he has that human spirit he persevered in fact thrive in his community basically in friends be able to communicating this very slow and inefficient way am maybe part of that spirit is why he volunteered to be the first person in this trial it was a clinical trial an experiment was a study this not an approved therapy by any means this was really something had not been done before and was we had a lot of ideas about it a but we did not know you in we had prove in a lot of this could be true in some people were normally speaking but to actually put into some one whose paralyze number one when we do not know the cote is the same number too is some one who is not been s being for fifteen years whether this signals are actually still there or not it was part of a clinical trial of something that or hospital and also the tier had to approve and looked at very carefully but given a lot the work that we had done there were some basis for for why this my work and am about two and half years ago we did a surgery where we implanted electrodes on to the parts of the brain that we have been talking about these areas that control the vocal try the areas that control the lacings the airs that control the lips in tongue and job movements when we normally speak these are agrees that presumably may be active that was our hope in his brain but he just could not get those out to a control his his mouth in normal way and he underwent a surgery a brainserter we put at electron or ray an we connected it to a port there was sculled to a screw to his skull the port act goes through his scalp and he is lived with his now for lost three years am it is a risk of infection these ports eventually have to become wireless in the future but we have figure out away to keep that port there where we can essentially connect him to a computer through that port he has an electrode a ray that is implanted over the part of the brain that is important for speech its connected to a port and then we connect a wire to that port that translates those a well fecal analogue you know brainwaves and converts him into digital signals and then a computer takes those visual signals from those individual sights from the speech quarter translates those into words can you describe for us the first time that poncho spoke through this engineer device ow what was that experience for you and at least from what he conveyed to you what was that experience for him this is somebody who was essentially locked in except for this rather crude pecking deviceall tho him thoroughly impressed bike how adapted we are adaptable poncho was not his friends engineering that device form was is really nothing short of of clever an ism because otherwise he would be truly locked it i but what was that moment i can only imagine that moment was incredible it was really incredible i to be able to see him try to get out of word that was for all practical purposes unintelligible but to be able to take the brain activity and to translate an to text on a screen that is what we did we took those brain waves we put them through i machine learning or artificial intelligence sugar them that can pick up these very very subtle patterns you cannot actually see them with your eye in in the brain activity and translate those into words and i remember seeing this happening for the first time it does not happen immediately this is something that took weeks to train the sugar them to interpret it correctly ism but what was incredible about it was to see how he reacted and ism he would be prompted to say give word ism outside for example and then he would think about it try to say it and finally those words would appear on the screen and what was really amazing about it was you could really tell that he got a kick out of that because he would start to giggle his his body would shaken away and his head would shaken away that he would star to giggle and that was cool to see but then i also realize that when he was giggly a kind of screwed up the next words to coming is that bug you have since i y fixed no we have not fixed that inn we have not fixed that it is easier just to tell him to stop giggling what was the first word that he said why think one of the first sentences that he put together was can you get my family outside and yeaning get them out of the room all these years you wanted day after his family no i think what he meant was can you get thing them in be yon man and the way this work was we trained this computer o recognize fifty words we started with a very small vocabulary i that is expanding as we speak i think that this is just a matter of time before these vocabulary become much much larger but t we started with the fifty set of words we created essentially all the possible sentences a you could generate from those fifty words why that was important was you can use those all those possible sentences to create a computational model con pure model of all the different word combinations to give different sentences i given those fifty words and then you can essentially do where we call auto correct it is the same kind of thing that we do when you are testing for example you get the right the wrong letter and there but the your font actually knows because that it is a contacts what to corrected because that decoding not a hundred per sent correct all the time e fact is far from that it is really helpful to have these other features autocratic the sun that we used for teeny now with testing that makes it correct and then updates it it is a combination of a lot of things it is the a i that is translating those brain activity patterns ah but it is also things that we have learned from speech and speech technologies that you put altogether and then all was sunken starts to work and om we were really excited because that was the first time that someone was paralyzed and could create words in sentences a that was just to voted from the brain active incredible and ism i know your very humble and but ism going t om arras you bi sing always knew you were destined for great things since a the early age of nine when we first became friends but i when i read that a the news coverage of of your work with poncho an the release of t this language from this locked nation it i it literally you know brought tears to my eyes because it is it is an interesting thing as as fellow euro scientists are we we explore the brain and we try and find mechanisms than we and compare those to what other people find and find truths and principles and build up from those but pretty rarely is there a case where that rout of exploration leads to something of clinical significance within one's own lifetime man that is the reality of science and oftentimes it is a very distributed process and but in this case i it is been it is been a magnificent thing to see you a move along this trajectory parsing these language and speech arias and then t also do the clinical work in parallel speaking of which these days we hear a lot about nursling i belong masks company a our surgeon that came up briefly through my at but i i cannot take any credit for what he knows or does which is a mama bugle is the nurse surgeon nursing there some other excellent our scientist there an engineers there we hear a lot about nursing because am while bring machine interface of the sort that you do in that other laboratories you has been going on for a long time am there is been some press a round nursling about the promise of what bring machine interface could do for instance early in our discussion you talked about how you now language is constrained by the sound waves and typically it is a few people communicating or one person with many people your podcast for instance or a speech but the idea is ben thrown out there that through the use of stimulating chips or through other brain machine devising that perhaps one could internalize fifty conversations in parallel fifty acts communication a ore that on the memory systems could be augmented to remember ten times as much information even twice as much information in a given period of time my understanding of what they are doing at nail length which is admittedly crude and from the outside few discussions with people there is that day to are going to pursue clinical goals first things trying to generate smooth movement in a parkansonian patient trying to a just movement patterns in some one with huntingtons disease for instance things of that sort before they embark on the more on si i explorations of fifty vexing communication or doubling memory capacity in these constancy oh i soft know they may be doing all of those things in parallel what are your thoughts about super capabilities of the brain or or you sup i do not even know what wore to use is supercharging the brain giving the brain functions for which we have never observed before in human history are we have our instinct in our firemen in are mersonex and the dinar an clear her to put in along that line side by side but there some their michael jordan and et camera but we have never heard of or seen somebody who can jump twenty feet in their or we have heard of people who have photographic memories but i do not know that we are aware of any human being in history who could memorize the entire library of congress or all the works within the vatic within an hour anyway you get the idea what re your thoughts about manipulating nail circuitry to achieve supra human or superhuman or superphysiological functions are we there shall even be thinking about that is it possible given that baron simply communicate through electrical activity an electrical activity can be engineered outside of the brain how do you think about it and here we do not even have to thin about naurlink in particular it is just but one example of companies and people in laboratories that are quite understand considering all this well it is a really interesting time rind now the science has been going on for decades the work that we have done wast feel that you call brain machine in our face is been going on for a while and a lot of the early work was just trying to restore things or movement or having people or among is control a computicersor for example on the screen that is been going on for vacates what is been really new is that industry is now involved in some some of this now becoming commercialized and were setting to see us now cross over to this field where it is no longer just research that we are dismount medical products that our designed to be surgicllane planted in some cases there is people doing this kind of work nonevasively as well oh they do not require a surgery the specific question that you are asking about is an air that we call augmentation can you build a device that essentially enhances some one's ability beyond supernormal supermemory super communications speeds beyond speech for example i guess superior precision athleticabilities i think that these are very serious kind of questions to be asking now because as you mention the pathway far as really to focus on these medical applications i personally do not think that we have thought enough actually about what these kind of sentries are on look and i do not think we have thought through all the ethical implications of what this means for argument augmentation in particular there is part of this that is not new at all humans throughout history have been doing things to augment a function coffee nicotine all kinds of things all kinds of medications that cross over from medical to consumer that is everywhere the pursuit of augmentation or performance are enhancement is really not a new thing the questions really as they relate to narrow technologies for example have to do with the invasive nature for example if these technologies require surgery for example to do something that is not for a medical application again there that is not exactly new territory either people do that routinely for cosmetic in procedures for physical appearance not nearly cognitive i do think that provided the technology continues to mercy the way that it does that it is going to be around the corner in it probable's not in always that are superobvious i do not think it is going to be can we easily memorize every fact in the world but in forms that are going to be much for incremental may be more subtle in many ways we already had that now for example you do not have to have a nor enervate invaded in your brain to get information the sentry access to all information in the world i just have to have your eye fought whether you could do it faster through a brain in her face i deafly one rule thou out but think about this that the systems that we have already to speak in to communicate have evolved over thousands o millions of years and they are supported by nor structures that have ban with of millions of groans there is no technology that exist right now that people are thinking about that are in commercial form corn light not even in research lobs that come anywhere close to what has been of love for those natural purposes i must send you saying to sides of this which is were already getting into this now this is not new territory this topic of augmentation both physical and cognitive we have already surpass that that is part of what humans do in general am but we are entering this area of in h hands cognition a these areas that i think the technologies in to be the great limiting step and how far can go we have not had the full conversations about number one is this what we actually want ah is this canto be good for society who gets aces to this technology these are all things that are an become real world problems certainly lot to consider in thinking about augmentation and another theme that have yet to ask you about but em extremely curious about which is facial expressions am before we talk about the relationship between the musculature of the face and language and the communication of emotion am it'd love for you to if you would i touch on a little bit of what you are doing with nations ponceau to move beyond a somebody whose locked in being able to type out words on a screen with their thoughts there is a rich array of information contain within the face and facial expression and while somebody anchor going from having to be complete locked in to being able to pack out letters on a keep would to being able to just think of those letters and having them spelled out that is a a tremendous set of leaps forward towards normal sea it is still foreign away different then poncho speaking with his mouth which i think am knowing some people who are restricted you are quadriplegic a lot of what they struggle with in the what is actually actually a height different sometimes because they are seated while other people are standing especially we do not often thing about this but always have to look up to communicate with peoples very different interface in the world am they manage quite well of course but am could he tells what you redoing in terms of merging the bring machine in her face with extraction of speech signals from people who are locked in ponceau with facial expressions sure ye well we describe before progress is being made am the proof of principle is out there that you can to coat speech that will continue o optimize and ism very confident t that is going improve very very quickly in the coming years to the point where it is not just a small vocabulary but a large vocabulary and a reasonable rates it a level that is can be really helpful very optimistic about that i think it is the right time to start really thinking about a broader vision of what communication really is for example aim here with you in person we could have done this virtually probably pretty easy to do that we could have recorded this really separate but there is something about being able to actually see your expressions and to understand i there r forms of communication another really important one is non verbal expressions at you are making a for example if you have a quizzical look on your face if ism saying something not clear that is a sign to me that i need to rephrase it or to say in different way or slow down for example or if there is something that really excites you i wanted continue to say more about it and and talk more in detail specially about i given things a facial expressions actually are really important part of the way we speaking there is two things a it is not just the expressions of how your feeling in perceiving what ism saying but it is also seeing my mouth move in your eyes actually see my mouth move in my jaw move in a particular way that actually allows you to hear those sounds better having both the visual information but also the sounds go into your brain is can improved intelligibriallily also make it more natural and me a memory for what is spoken perhaps here is a call for people not just listening to pot gasket watching them and listening to the on you to i suppose if if we were to to translate this to exactly real world exactly and the reason why were also very interested in this idea of not just having text on he screen but essentially a woefully computer animated face an avatar of the persons speech movements in there facial expressions it is going to be a more complete form of expression now you can imagine right now that might just be some one looking at a computer screen interpreting these signals but i think the way things are going the next a couple of years a lot more of our society interactions more than even now are can a moving to this digital virtual space and of course must we bore thinking about what that means for most consumers but it also has really important implications for people who are to payable right and whether how house they can a participate in that also we ere thinking really about for people punch an other people who are paralyze what other forms of specie eye can we do in order to help improve their able to communicate one is a sensual building out more holistic avatars no things i can essentially to code essentially their their expressions or the movements associated with their mouth in ja when they actually speak to improve that communication a you invasion at time not too long from now where instead of tweeting out something in text my avatar will else till type it out but my avatar will just say it it will be an image of my avatar saying whatever dis i happen to be tweeting it them that swell working on ye i do not think that that that is going happen and can happen soon and there is lot of progress and that in again we are just trying to enrich a the the feel of of communication expression a to make it more normal and we actually think that having that kin avatar is a way of getting feed back to people learning how to speak through a a speech narial prosthetic that is the device that we call suspect in a prosthetic that that is going to be the way that can help people learn how to do it the quickest not necessarily trying to say words in having it come on a screen but actually hap people embody feel its part of themselves or that they are directly controlling that that illustration or animation this idea of an avatar speaking out was we would otherwise right i is fascinating to me on histogram i i post videos i do not filter the but i know there is a look discussion ow is about people using filters to make their skin look different or the lighting look different a lot of filtering and also the use of caption that a century what you end up with is somewhere between an actual radio of what was spoken and an avatar version of it i mean that if the mismatch between what spoken and what is in the caption is to dramatic then it does not quite work but i watch these carefully when people use captions and m oftentimes there is a smoothing of what was said into the action it seems much more susinctan an accurate oftentimes that it is the reverse is also true where the caption is inaccurate and then it creates this cut of a jarring miss match in any case i think this this aspect in the clinical realm of using an avatar to allow people poncho to sundial be a face that communicates through spilling language from an avatar that looks them is fascinating in and am indeed important and i think how avatars emerge in a social spaces as can be really fascinating i get a lot of questions about stutter i think that for people who havastutter it is itself anxiety provoking is stutter related to anxiety if one has a stutter what can they do the stutter reflect am underlying near logic i phenomenon that might distinguish reaching one can o stutter in another m what can people stutter do if they to relieve their stutter yo great question stutter is e condition were the words cannot come out fluently you have all the ideas you have got the language in tact you remember we talked about this distinction between language and speech stuteringis a problem of speech right that ideas the meanings the grammerit is all there in people stutter but they cannot get the words out fluently that is a speech condition and ism particular it is condition that affects articulation specifically about controlling the production of words in this really coordinate kind of movements that have to happen in the vocal tract too produce fluent speech and am stuttering is a condition were am people have a predisposition to it there is an aspect of stuttering you are a stutterer or your not a stutterer right but people who stutter do not stutter all the time either you could be a stutter who stutters it is sometimes but not others and really the the mainline between stuttering anxiety is that anxiety can provoke it and make it worse that is certainly true but it is not necessarily cause by anxiety can e sentry trigger it or make it worse but it is not the cause of it person the cause of it is still really not clear but it does have to do with these kind of brain functions that we have been talking about earlier which is that in order to produce normal fluent speech we are not even conscious of what is going on in our mouths in our agarics we are not conscious an if we were wed not be able to speak because it is too complex it is too precise it is something that we have really a developed the abilities to do when we do naturally when it is part of our programming in part of what we learn inherently in name neon it is just three exposure stuttering is i is essentially a break down it is certain times in that machinery be able to work in a really coordinated way you can think about the operations of these areas that are controlling the vocal tract let us say speeches a symphony in order for to come out normally you have got to have not just one part the marines but the lips the jaw they cannot be doing their own thing they have to be very very precisely activated very very precisely controlled in a way to actin create words and in stuttering there is a break down of that u nation if somebody has a shudder is it better to address that early in life when there is still nauru plasticity at is very robust and if what is the typical route for treatment i have to megineis not rain surgery typically ism ism guessing their speech therapist that the people can talk to an and an they can help them work out where there getting stock in the relationship to anxiety yet exactly i mean part of it is about that anxiety but a lot of it really has to do with i therapy to sort of work through and think of trickspasically sometimes to create conditions where you can actually get the words to come out a lot of some forms of stuttering are really initiation problems ism just getting started itself is is very hard you want it start with initial bowl or consonant but it will not admit i and a lot of that therapy is really just focussing a how do you free the conditions for that to happen there is another aspect to it that i find very interesting is that ism the feed back essentially what we hear ourselves say for example i in every time that i say a word ism also hearing what ism saying that is what we call auditory feed back that turns out to be very important and sometimes when you change that you can actually change remount someone stutters for better for worse and it it is giving us a clue that the brain is not just focus on sending the commands out but it is also possibly interacting with the part that is hearing the sounds and there is something might be going on an that connection that that breaks down when stuttering occurs there are individuals that our stutters but they do not stutter all the time in those instances there something happening those particular moments where this very very to precise coronation needs to happen in the brain order get the words out fluently we talk alibi about caffeine and why you avoid it because your work requires such precision and calm and exactly to me it seems your running a lot of operations and and no pun intended in parallel when you're doing surgery not just thinking about where to direct the instruments but also thinking a chestplayer several steps down the line what fund happen what if if then type thinking o whatare some of the other practices and tools that you use to put yourself into state for optic of her surgery or for ism you do not thinking about scientific proms for that matter and we keep threatening you running together but i know you run correct your ye i is you find running to be an essential part of your ism state regulation absolutely ya for me i most exercise that i do i really do not do for physical recent it do i for mental recent i i can tell for example if i do not go on a run or a swim just after a day or two and it can have translation for example and the way i feel in the operating room or even the way interact with other people there is no question that those i now the mind body are deeply connected and for me personally be able to am have opportunity to disconnect for a while it turns out to be really really important now the operating room for me is another space ism con running or swimming where ism disconnected from the worst the world i do not bring myself on into the opening room ism ism disconnected from the external world for that time that ism in the surgery and all i am doing is just focusing now that does not mean that ism having complex thoughts or doing something very complicated sometimes it is that but it is not always that ism there are things that we do in surgery that a routine and wrote and are from muscle memory for example suturing skin o or as doing certain kinds of direction or drawing part of the bone for example these are all things have become very wrote after a time for me even be in the operating room act can sometimes o fill that purpose i really look forward to be in the operating room because that intense focus allows me this or disconnect from all the other things ism worrying about that ism that are happening on the outside world we all have those kind of things that happen and ism certainly no exception to that but strangely the operating room for me is a sanctuary i love being there i because we have some control over the environment am i know what is there i know the anatomy of the brain ism my motions are going through routines and for me that is not actually very different than going on a run and letting my likes am moving specific ways it is s just the same thing for for my hands you listen to music or audio looks when you run or you divorced from to acknowledge when you run well a music helps me just stay motivated in distracted from being out o breath and an other things and for me it is a way just to catch up with the world sometimes i do but i do notice that i do not run as well for example in the operating room it is a little different different surgeons have preferences ism more of of a the camp were i do not any distraction whatsoever id people to be able to hear the words that ism saying without having background noise ism i do not really think about roll sing on music or other things to try to put me in a state of mind i think just being there alone and just you do not try at try to treat it the way it is it is a sacred moment where some one's life is really directly under your hands i that enough kind of foresees me very quickly and h i that it really detaches me from a lot of things that are preoccupy me and for those couple of hours that we have a surgery we are just focus on one thing only fantastic i again i think of in the range of brain explorers the the negro surgeons those of your profession are to me the astronauts of nor science because they're really going to the farthest reach is possible and their testing and probing and really at the front edge of discovering from the species that we arguably care about the most which is a humans at you have to say i from the first time we became friends a thirty eight years ago somethings something that mum ism almost reluctant to say but i i only reveal it in part that i edgy and i became friends because but he and i share o love of birds and we had a club at our school of which there were only too member end i small club small club the was one honor remember and there were certain requirements for being in this club that we will not reveal we we took a pact of secrecy and we are going to obey that pact of secrecy but to be sitting here with you to day i for me is a absolute thrill i not just because we have been friends for that longer that we got reacquainted through the literally the halls of medicine and science but because i really do see what you are doing as really representing that from absolute cutting edge of of exploration and application i mean the story upon so is but one of your many patience that i has drive tremendous benefit from your work and and now as a chare of a department you i of course i work alongside i individuals who ware also doing incredible work in the spinal could et camera see on behalf of myself and and everyone messing i just really want to thank you for join yesterday to share this information we will certainly have you back because there is an entire list of other questions we did not have time to get to but also just for the work you do it is truly spectacular android thinks much you knife ism very humble basically by what you just said and i feel that it is really an extraordinary honor actually in privilege you not to be here with you and reconnect and talk about all these ideas ah it is probably not random that we in it up and similar spots and interest i think week its you starts with some deep interests and and ism kinonurting out on on topics and it is probably not a coincidence that that we have such deep interests in this quark now i just we rally lucky to be able to do what i do it is for everyday almost everyday ism be able to go to work and take carefolks and learn at the same time and e just close the look how do we apply the knowledge that we learn one day to some one who comes in next week it is it is really fun and ism we do not know everything where not even close to it but the journey to figure this out is it is it is really extraordinary i mean it is it is ism you said it is exploring new lands literally in the operating room when ism looking at the expose quarter trying to understand is it safe to walk down this part of the martial landscape or this other trail which one is going to be the one that is going to be safe fires the other that results an pyrolysis and insulated talk i while maybe i should not call for but it is very it is very important too addition to being really intellectually import for how we understand how the brain works and ye i feel just really li can be an that opportunity i we are lucky to have you being one of the people doing it thank you ever much thinks thank you for joining me today for my discussion with doctor eddy can if you

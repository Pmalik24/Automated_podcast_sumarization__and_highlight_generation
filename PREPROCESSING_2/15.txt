well we have a rule when it comes to media coverage of massshootings in the united states if the massshoting can somehow be linked to a right wing cause then we must question this entire conservative inform structure in the united states if somebody cantengentially be linked to a conservative show or to a conservative politician we have to question the very premises of conservatism itself because obviously every terrible iteration of right wing ideology is telescoped into some evil wite to premises shooter for example if however a masshooter is a left winger then it is probably gun or its depression of some sort or maybe it is mental illness this is the way the math works o we have the latest iteration of this particularly stupid narrative device to day the new york post talks about an attempted shooting at roll oscines packed button area megacurch on sundae the person who did the shooting previously end antis metic writings had recorded history of mental health issues and used a weapon with a free palestine sticker in the bra an attack not only that this person idea is a woman identified as a man this person called herself jeffrey was person did have a history of mental illness according to the authorities this person was put under an order for emotional detention which means that officers transported her to a medical facility in twenty sixteen because she was deemed danger to herself or others but then the person was let out i do not mention the name of massshooters on the show because mashers are typically looking for some sort of notoriety's this is a rule that i have it is maybe the one thing that i can do as a member of the media to try to decrease the amount of masshootings in the united states for example do not give all sorts of attention to the name of masseur make the master more famous but effectively the shooter entered liquor church just before a punish language service was due to begin at two am by the way this woman carried along her seven year old son and then open fire as hundreds of people were taking their pus too off duty officers working security at the church return fire and fatally shot this person the young boy to stand a gun shot wound to the had was caught in the cross fire first things first the button p d first had to determine what pronoun to call the shooter because this is haw stupid our society is now we have a assure who tries to kill hundreds people at a church and the first question is how can we treat this massshooters gender delusions with respect here is the button p d then ran an entire investigation to figure out exactly which pronouns to use she utilize both male and female names but through all of our investigation to this point talking with individuals interviews documents stop poles department reports she has been o identify this entire time as female she her and we a identifying her as gensemaramale hispanic female we we certainly must on take all proper care to ins sure the people attempt to mure other people are called by the genera pronouns they themselves selected but we do have a spate of shootings by people a trains i identified in the united states the state of shootings if it were any other demographic group in the united states particularly filer white young men than we would have all sorts of questions about the evils of young white men from the media butt if they are trains than the shootings just disappear off the front pages immediately the colorado springs it shouter identified as non binary as many cohesion points out that den hirsute identified to trains the ardent shoulder identified as trains and famously the naval shooter at a church school identified as trains now i think that it is worth while here to also point out that this particular shooter was a radical left winger who had a free palestine sticker on her got this particular church happen to be attend did by a largely pro israel audiences and it is also worth pointing out again how the narrative process t works for example when a few months back three muscle america university students were shot in sermon the entire media went bark suggesting that this must have been some form of right wing attack on muscle students this was state of his lamaphobia and this of courses because the media were trying to establish at the time a parallel between quoin what is lamaphobia in the united states and antisemitism in the united states which is radically spite and this culminated in the president of the united states issuing a statement from the white house in which he said gill and i were horrified to learn that three college student of palestinian descend two of how our america citizens were shot sturdy in burlington sermon we join america across the country in praying for their full recovery and we send our deepest endolencis t their families while we are waiting for more facts you know this there is absorb no place for violence or hate in america and then this of course turned into a trader story about as lamaphobia in the united states the reason why jobidon put out a statement on this particular shooting their lots a shootings in the united states every single day particularly in place chico but this one drove attention from e whorehouse because it backed a particular narrative now turns out that that narrative actually did not work because the shooter in this particular cases actually had expressed support for compass in the paste this person again had a history of mental illness and the person also because of that history of mental illness happened to support some pretty terrible people radically anti israel and t that story just nautically disappeared from the headlines the reason i point this out is because every time you see a shooting and the media declare whether the shooting is a national story or a local new story look for the narrative and tells you exactly where the media are on every single issue the media are pro trains and the media anti israel and because they are programs infant israel this story will be disappeared it never happened we will pretend that the ideological motivations of this person absolutely do not matter and the media will then revert to a mental illness check on the person now again mental illness i thin it is a plausible explanation for this person but the media couldn't have realize this person had a mental illness problem until this person actually participated in shooting second the media's narrative structure is undefeated narrative above fact every single time for a wonderful folks in the media wit is more on this in just one second first we are experiencing a lot of global stability as we plunge into primary season aware you protecting your

u crane and provides another fourteen billion dollars for israel war against commons and then ten billion dollars for supposed humanitarian aid for civilians in conflict zones including politicians in gaze this thing passed seventy to twenty seven a seventy to twenty nine in a vote in the senate last night with eighteen republicans voting along with the democrats in favor of passing this particular bill the re publicans verse plunder on that split almost down themiddl in terms of who voted for bill who voted against the bill and there are few reasons for this one is there is a much abadstuffon the bill there is no question even if you support ad to crane even if you sports ad to israel bunch bad crapinth bill the biggest piece of garbing in the bill is this ten billion dollars in humanitarian aid for politicians in gaze distributed by whom handed out to whom why should america tax pare dollars be sent to a place tat will be then run presumably by the u n r w a or by humans or by some other agency that acts on behalf of terrorists mattes one problem with the bill but there plenty other promise with the bill and one of the questions about the amount of you crane aid is what is the u crane aid four and this raises broader question about exactly what the goes of the united states are in u crane and what the united states is hoping to forestall for additional aid to u crane his a broader scaleform policy question first rule of foreign policy a first run of foreign policy foreign policy is about preventing the worst outcome very often using the second worst outcome foreign policy is a series of bad choices that you have to make and one the problems with doing foreign policy is that if you are successful in a foreign policy context then what you typically have done is you have fore stalled the counter the counter factual for example let us say that the united states instead of going isolationist after w old were one that remained relatively interventionists and had built up its military power and said to the german in gjapanese were not an allow you to get aggressive and world wore to it never happen we the critique would have then been why is the united states spending much money on its military when there is no war only the counterfactual allows you to understand what could have happened if not for particular intervention or particular action that's why fine sate is always twenty twenty in foreign policy because the reality is that whatever choice your making right now you have to try to imagine outside your box it is very easy to say in two thousand in two that the america military drawtown in the nineteen nineties and the perception of weakness by america enemies led to nine eleven and that is clearly true n the people make that argument at the time but the argument on the other side the time was why we spending much money on the military when the us s are has just fallen there is no actual reason for it when it comes to every foreign policy lobate we have to understand what exactly is the goal is the goal in crane to for examples grade the russia military which by the way is something i think is worth while beat i believe that the the russia military that been used for expansionist purposes and is working hand and glove with chines military and that both of them provide threats ranging from naval arena two to ground assaults in various places in eastern rope for example to place ti one e butt let us let us talk about what are the americangulls to grade the assign military would presume lily one two would be prevent the ruffians from taking over all of crane and then threatening in nations borders because crane is not act a give chunk of the land mass to erectly in the middle of eastern rope it work poland it for is hungary were a bunch of important states the taking of u crane would also provide impetus four russia presumably to try to attack one of the outlying states lithuania in the tactics because the ruffians actually dufyoulokat map hold they pieces of territory on the egulithlania call eolian grad which is to be known is originally germantaritory now as conigsburgs were a manual countless from the critically that could incentivize the ruffians to move into lithuania crane happens to be the bred basket of the world huge moon of grand is produced there crane also happens to provide quiescence in the black in way of the russia domination of the lackyuedop the bunch of get political and strategic and economic reasons that you do not want the ruffians taking over all of you crane if the two america goals are to grade the assign military specifically because the ruffians have been expansionist and to prevent them from taking over all of all of you crane those are america gulls that have largely been a cheese at this point maybe if the goal is to push russia out of don was and crime that is not going to happen and petty much everybody understands that is not going to happen to the big question for the u crane aid is is this aid being sent to u crane it is military aid which means honestly s begin trust america military spending we spend money by giving its crane crane than spend down america military contractors to build up all of the military credibility that we actually require it actually gets the machine working and you think the world is about to come a much more violent place which i do sucking not terrible thing the you have more money pouring into the systems that sort of grease the wheels of the america military concept in arms o being able to produce weaponry for use against further threats likes a china invading t i want but put all that aside if the if the money for you crane is designed to prevent the full take over of you crane then that is the about of money that we should be spending money crane that is what is in medic's interest if that money is being given to you crane in the bazar assumption that that will low for the full scale re conquest of don was and crime that is stupid and is not going to happen no one has made clear at this point exactly what the aid is for this a signal failing of the biding administration really is it is more on the suggest one second first let us face it your bank it so i not bank you us but i do know that it kennissoks that is why you need currents currents build card is the secured credicard the let us you use your own money to build your credit ait basically functions a debit card but rather than borrowing money you do not have and getting dinged wit the twenty five percent interest the every time you do you use your own money and improve your credit score as you do they are been times where we are really low on the creditcard years and years ago and it is deeply uncomfortable well you do not have to do that you might not think building credit is very important right now trust me it is when you go to by car or a house the first thing they do is asked fear credit score you need to start building your credit the best way to do that is with current current is more affordable accessible innovative banking system the help you better spend save in manager money they're no credit checks or credit histories required they're no annual or subscription fees if you set up direct deposit with currents you get paid up to two days faster and you qualified for

that is current dot come spell see you are or n he's to come slash below terms apply currents is financial ton bowleg company not a bank banking services provided by choice financial remember aft i see and crussorrbank member aft i see for full terms and conditions visit currents i come or call eight eight eight if have one eleven seventy two for more in formation there a couple of big battles that broken out one on the democraticside one on the republicanize the battle on the re publicanside is a almost tripe hart type battlethere is three positions on the republicanize with regard to you crane position umber one is the position that i take which is that effectively speaking it is in the interest of the united states to prevent a full scale russia take over of you crane but it is not in the interest of the united states to prolong the war only to grant the false assumption that you crane is going to take control of donbasand crime and s we should seek an all fragile also preserving you cranes independence against the ruffians that happens t be the henry listen your position have been take position since i believe aril of twenty twenty too two months into the war is my been my consistent position at no point for example have i suggested the you cranial invade russia territory at no point of i even suggested that there is a possibility the ucranians would take back crime or the donnas at no point if i suggested that thereoght to be america boots on the ground there should copy have not even suggested the should be inmerican no fliesone over you cranes the position that have taken is america he interests are promoted by preventing the ruffians from taking all of you crane but they already were in control of the donbassan crime and that's probably nocking reverse itself that is position number one position number too is the position that hoiden seems to be taken kind of which is that we should just in an open ended way grant aid to you crane for anything they want will let them decide the offal i think is an idiotic position why exactly should you crane decide the offramp an fact lauders lens the presidents of you cranes actually trapped he is trap because he cannot tell his own people who want back the donbassan crime that he is going to stop the war short after a full skill invasion of his country yeuactually does not have the ability to go back to his own parliament and whose own people and say give want an offal were and ism an a let them keep donbassam no let them u crime which means that it is action in the united states is interest if it could pagan i ben saying this are for almost two years of this point it is in the interest of the united states actually if they could go negotiate a separate peace with ladies gotten that guarantee the future security of you crane america security guarantees western security guarantee and also acknowledge that russia going to maintain control of the donnas region as well as crime and there is the bided in posit ion which is basally wok a blankcheck do what you want money push hard maybe's got the nonbasic back maybeoll get crimeabat and have always thought the as a stupid position because the america people do not have taste for that nor really should they cause hit really is not in medic's interest and then there is the third position and the third position has not ben clearly articulated but it has been heavily implied and that position seems to be that you crane ought too be fully ruled by russia that russia actually should win in reeve that russia should actually take over all f you crane and install a pupil dictator in you crane and it is unclear to me and a lot the form post that or the very least that the united states does not have any interest if russia takes over all o you crane theoretically ages he could say their for positions there is a full isolate isolationist position which as we should not care about anything that happens outside the borders of this country which again i think is consistent but i think short sighted because the reason we do foreign policy in this country is not because it is a fun thing to do on the side is because foreign policy has significant ramifications for america it has ramifications an arms of security at has ramifications ins from of economics and has ramifications ans arms of resources they're lots of ramifications to form policy but out say their for positions i suppose one full isolation ism should not care anything that goes on anywhere in the world bring everybody back home wall on all of our borders and that is it i do not think that is a a possible solution but that is one position position number too is that for some odd reason ladies gotten would be better running you crane than the current government of you crane and not only to we have no interest in stopping gotten we actually should effectively pull out of you crane with our money and allow you crane to fall in the interests of fostering a broader peace with ladies gotten position number three which is my own is we should stop ladmerapoons from taking all of you crane but we should acknowl edge the realities of the situation on the ground and we should acknowledge that don bass crime are not going to be taken out russia hands and position number four is the biding position which is sort of open ended poor money and hope the you crane can take back everything those of the four articulated positions and republicans seem to be split between these for positions when it comes to u crane and meanwhile jobidon has not even a simulated what the sixty billion dollars is four is the sixty billion dollars design for his ensued quoin's quit liberate the donbassin crime or is it designed for what is look for an offramp while we freeze the lines of conflict he is not made that clear and that is opened up a weird debate in which no one will actually state their position on you crane a my honest to god do not know the position of many members of the senate on u crane if not granting you crane the aid means that reive falls to pouted are you o say with that or is what you are saying maybwhat you sing is this we do not actshould think heed s on fall the pouted we want a grants enough aid to prevent that but were not con to prevent four looking aid that is essentially designed for he sanitarian purpose is or it is designed to short the economy of you crane or its designed to take the don bareback were to gerent can to any of that because no one is clarifying their positions that this entire thing is incredibly mud and the same thing by the way is happening on the democratic side of the isle because they do not know what their position is with regard to pouted and you cranes there is all sorts of confusion with regard to u crane mean on the israel side of this particular policy you have an isolation is right which is increasingly arguing that there is something bad and immoral about supporting a democratic ally of the united states in destroying a terrorist group the dis murdered twelve hundred citizens of their country and took two hundred hostages including one hundred who are still being holding captivity there is that isolation strike the believes that and much more i importantly there is a large block of the left that seriously sympathizes with actual palistinian terrorism and those folks our sort of voting on the same side when it comes to israel aid with regard to compass in other words form policies a mess right now the clear lines that used to exist with regard to sort of foreign policy positions are completely collapsing and when people make arguments you see my johns the speaker of the house he put out a statements on the passage of the crane aid in which he said house republicans were crystal clear from the very being of discussions and he called national security supplemental legislation must recognize that national security beginsthat are on boarder and then he makes the case that border has to be included in this particular act border was rest stripped out of that act because the senate could not come up with anything workable there republicans were willing to indoors for good reason republicans should not indorse what democrats want on the southern border and let us be realistic about this what is happening on the southern border is not a question of money in rally's not a question of funding it is a matter of the political will power to tie the hands of the executive branch in enforcing the southern boarder i say this as women who just went down of the southerner and produced to full documentary about the southern boarder and who spent time with the head of the boarder patrol union and who spoke in boar patrol officers you spoke the senators i promise you the propmen the bearer is no t lack of funds the problem at the border is lack of will that is a very different thing another words when mi johns says we cannot fun you crane or israel because of what is going on short that that is it is complete nonsequeter make the argument that the bill on you craned is bad on its own merits that it gives too much money to the wrong places or me the argument that the bill for israel ate is bad on its own merits sit gives ten billion dollars for example to the palisinians and gosh most of which will be sucked up by terrogroups make those arguments but what ism seeing is a lack of clarity with a the a wide variety of these issues in which it is unclear exactly what every one even wants and that is confusing to me that is confusing to me ill get's more on this in just one second first let us say you are a highly skills assassin that inherited man doorman best are steel from your late father butts all to say

republicans are making some claims about this this particular bill that i actually do not think hold water there is a claim that is being made about you crane bill that because thou crane bill includes funding for you ran that stretches into twenty twenty five that is somehow an impeachment procedure now listen i oppose both impeachments against dona trump they did not a legs high crime to misdemeanors and it is a love everything that trump did in is conversation it vlodmarsolensky asking kolinsky to investigate hunter by n in melisma in order to recognize that that did not rise to level of high crime and is demeanor that was an impeachable offense the claim right now that is being made is the because the funding to you crane extends into twenty twenty five an hit is just useful for purposes a fact checking that because of that that is the predicate to an impeachment push that basically the first impeachment of dona trump was rooted in dona trump saying to lodger's lens ism not going to give you the supplemental aid that has been allocated o your country in chill you in investigate brisk because you with held the aid impeachment went forward thus a new bill that allocates aid to you crane puts trump at risk of impeachment if you with holds the aid to you crane that does not follow the actual ration out for the impeachment to be fair was not just the trump was holding up the aids you grant if you would said you can is corrupt i do not think as a forge policy matter we should be giving that aid to a corrupt country om not doing it that would not be i reachable in anyway ship perform i gentling democrats oud a tried to impeach on that basis the argument that simply by locating aid in the future t wen trump could be pressenent that is can of the predicate for impeachment i i do not think that argument holds particularly lotrwoir i think that a gait there a good arguments against the bill i do not think that happens to be one of them o ka all of this meshes with again this broader foreign policy debate inside the republican party right now and that was brought to the for a lot of this by the interview the tucker did with ladmarpoutent tucker carbon of course when over to mascot when he interviewed ladder pouted we covered that pretty extensively on the show we went through the interview again i thought the tucker to a fine chop and asking questions that a low gladiate patent to talk and the question with any interview for of what is the goal of the interview tucker asked a a series of questions the were not desire to be confrontational that were not designed to to be aggressive against lander and that is totally fine there allowed to do an interview that way when the goal is to alow the dictator to speak for himself said everybody can see what he says an what he thinks and even moments where it looked tucker was trying to elastic a particular response punt an't go for it ain to be perfectly friend with i think that potent be a massive opportunity i think that if pouted had come out and made the case that have seen many people on the right make which is you crane is sort of a left liberal country and that when you fight for the you crane flag your actual fighting for the eld you be he flag or that the entire to locked that is been happening in you crane is the result of america foreign policy elude establishment types i it that would have ben the argument that that pouted could have made that i think would have drawnwore balls instead he went into his actual to ration ow which was this sort of long historic explanation of why you crane ought not exists and why he ought to take the whole thing i will i mean the argument ha he makes needs conclusively to the conclusion that he real that he really really believes that rush up should be the ruler of you crane period full stop and that that was the case that he was making he try to back off of that when he say all maybe there will be an offal but then he refused to suggests or of in actual realistic mechanism for an offer and listen ism somebody who is warm to an offal if you would present that one right to the united sate hour jump on it right now o ka butt that is the interview the tucker did with with pouted but it it elicited questions about what tuckers believes are with regard to grammar potent because again this foreign policy debate that happening inside the right is really kind of fascinating right now and i think it is worthy of elucidation and i think again tucker's a very articular person and he articulates a point to view on form policy with which i heartily disagree have invited tucker on the show to discuss it hopefully he will take me up on that would would love to have a conversation with him about that to clarify positions i think be good for the movement wallet tom iron this in just once second first if you have not had black rifle coffee yet now is thebes time to tried for yourself ism saying

in any case tucker was at the world government summit injury with an egyptian journalist named mod elfin adit a anta and one of the clips that he that he stated during this interview kannawen vino and it wen by roll because it is a vocative it is aft not even remotely the most controversial thing that tucker said now get tucker's interview of pouted it'll say again have no propmatucker's inruthpootoni think anybody should beagle to talk to any dictator at any time and ask any questions they want and i did not find tucker's questions to be particularly bad i thought that that some of tuckers questions prertigoate the end about avengersquitch were were quite good e but tucker's conclusions are ones that have real implications for the republican party because again what ism seeing in this debate over the u cranebill ism not as interested in the you crane aid bill itself as the foreign policy debate over what that means is the re publican party moving in direction in which it effectively says that the united states should not have form policy and should be totally isolationist or is the republican foreign policy establishment moving in direction that says that people ladder pouted ought to have more power because the united states is actually a bad force in the world which is even stronger argument and almost horseshoe theories with with burn sanders there is a part of the libertarian right that horse shoot theories all the way around gets not chomps gown the left is that what what is being articulated on the right orbs its sort of a foreign policy realism which is sort of where i sit opposing some wars for example in tibia suggesting foreign aid to some countries that are america allies and or achieve america interests and then of course there is sort of the the old er school mid two thousands need composition which is that the united states should be involved in a at variety of wars whether or not it is in america interest canal will eonian perspective on foreign policy in which america has to preserve morality in the world at the cost of blood an treasure wether or not is in direct america interest those are those of the open lines o debate and i think tucker's interview in duty sort of brought these to the for is again he is being interview by an egyptian journalist name mod e l can add and here is the clipping when viral it is him talking about photon and mascot itself en in capable person could not do that he is very cpeoplele on many if men that what was radicalizing very shocking and very disturbing for me with the city of mascot were hat never been the biggest city in rope thirteen million people and it is much nicer that any city in my country i had no idea my father as been all of time there and the cities when you work for the was government an barely had electricity and now it is much cleaner and she fer and prettier aesthetically it is architecture it is food it is service then any country in city the united states the having this is nomideological how did that happen how did that happened it is certain point i do not think the average person cares is most about abstractions as about the concrete reality of his life and if you cannot use your subway for example as many people are afraid to in your citytets is too dangerous you have not sort of wonder is not that the ultimate measure of leadership the alien measure of leadership in other words is that mascot's clean while the a city is dirty get well there a few things it play here one i totally agree with tucker when he says that they're many cities abroad that are better run than america cities there is no question that is the cate i been the many more beautiful cities than any cities that have seen in the united states i hare'some early beautiful cities in the united states they'll have pretty seems underbellies i bin that there can a smaller cities that i thin are what beautiful charleston south caroling they're bigger cities that have e areas that are beautiful boson but some other areas there really really notice i spent most o my life in big america cities lot angels which turn from a fairly nice place live into a very bad place slips and when tucker says that for example law an order matters in major america cities that of course is for for true but when he uses that as he standing for the russia model of governments that when tsar s have some questions and maybe did not mean that i do not know but it seems when he is saying that it radicalized him why would mascot radicalize you exactly a tucker's always been a down or guide tucker's always wanted for example broken windows theory applied in places new york or washington do c n tucker's over pro grime or something he is never liberal on these issues but what exactly radicalized him to dit did radicalize him to a different idea about how government works wen he says abstractions are less important than how you lived life on the ground abstractions our kind of i portent depending on what abstractionsyou are talking about if those abstractions are for example liberty in the america model verses say the russia model where liberty really does not exist and this is where the other clips from tucker from this interview i then are more evocative of maybe what tucker means then then this clip right here by the way it should be noted at this point mascot have never been there it'll take tuckers word fort and the word many other people that it is a beautiful city we should also points out at this point that the go people capital in russia is twelve thousand dollars per year only seventy seven per cents of the russia population even has indoor plumbing all the wealth get sucked in to mascot wherein is widely distributed among people who are friends of mouton and friends of the friends of bottom the mmoscow metro area has an in come twice that of the general russia economy russia continues to have a stagnating economy than in elation rate of six point three per cent in this year five point to eight per dentin twenty twenty three and almost fourteen percent in twenty twenty two when we talk about on of the glories o mascot we shoals recognize that lots i pastorships had really i cities berlin under under hitter as a beautiful place dressed under hitter is a beautiful place from under musolana is a beautiful place and acres a beautiful city the there is nothing beautiful cities can exist across the world in various location and under various systems of government there not actually the best marker of weather a government is properly run or whether the leader is good it his job that it that is not a sole indicator every single factor analysis fails an time ye say a i can tell that leader is good because because a beautiful city it there is there's a eighty five thousand other factors is to whether the leader is good he but again i think that what tucker is saying there just to take it on its states value statement is the least problematic or or interesting thing that that he said during this interview the mascot s beautiful in america cities ore not as beautiful and we should lean them up and not alographedian not alow pot an all the i agree with all that a it did me of the other things that he said that i think have brought implications for america for i policy for example tucker was asked by this egyptian journalist about gladmerputen and assassinating people and the egyptian journalists was well you now you could have asked him about why he kills people and censorship and all the rest and the here was tucker's answer you should can som ides for instant o you dedentok about freedom of speech in an russia i did not onto about anon the about assassinations about about the ditidictions on a a position in the coming election i did not talk about the things that every other america me out what talks ai he ice it is y s as mot oar cover and because i have spent my life talking o people who run countries in various countries and have not concluded the following that every leader kills people including my leader every leader kills people some on more than others leadership requires killing people sorry s why would want to be a leader i that press restriction is universal in the nite states i know because have lived it that is my for m use had a lot of job i and have done this first thirty four years and i know how words and i there is wore censorship in russia thin there is is n i states for there's a great killing i i faith o was this is where we star to get into the more interesting part of the tucker o saying here and when he says that he likes mascot are it find when he starts to say that the russia way of assassination and censorship is somewhat akin to have the united states runs things the answer there is now just on a factual basis that the answer there is no you now i now to tucker carbon does not only live in the united states quite safely criticizing the current presidents of the united states as a senile dotard he makes millions of dollars doing what happens to you in vladmerputen's russia if you criticize bladmerpouten as a senile dotard you kill yourself by shooting yourself twice in the back of the headed than being thrown off a building these are not comparable when tucker says that the that every one assassinates every one kills and reminiscent of of michael curly own justifying the movie when he talking to say and godfather one legal ka now who is being give the idea that the president of the united states has the some me the summary a ability to simply murder his opponents the way that gladinmer pouted does is not reality now i do not job neither i thin he's a terrible president i hope he is not president is soon is humanly possible not obviously without wishing any ill help on any one but let us be clear about this if your vision of the united states is that it is somehow comparable to the governments of a cleptocraft like gladinmer pouted that seems pretty wild to mean if that is the basis of foreign policy ism not shit how that is sustainable h the the the attempts to relativists the united states to russia under vladinmer pouted that is the part that ism finding bazar here and in what tucker is saying and that leads to a foreign policy that is quite dangerous for the future of the united states if the foreign policy of the united states is russia good russia no worse than united states therefore f russia takes you crane for example no problem a i do not understand how you uphold a powerful america in the world for the benefit end son citizens under under that rubric now gain that is not a defense of anything jobidon is doing but tucker comparing himself and his treatment the united states the treatment of russia journalist who does send from ladder portents is just it it is nonfactual it does not see to have a relation to factual reality e get to more on the in a second us get i thing that there are some very significant gabs in america form policy thinking and again this is wive in voted tucker on the shut he is or love to discuss this stuff with him and have love to clarify our thoughts on this what does he think a good america form policy looks well get him more of this in just a second first mark your calenders it is the epic return of back state almost a year away filming the pendragon cycle but german boring is back he is join but mat walshkantisones nickel mole's andrclavan and my john's to night at seven him eastern six am central as we go behind the scenes and be on the headlines there is a bought to cover and i can one is to minute watch the show live exclusively on daily wire plus to night at seven p m eastern six am central you are not on to one miss it of meanwhile okay we are going through the tucker interviewing to bags it has sort of his thoughts about what happen gladder pouted again they're too interesting things about the the inherit paten one is what patent had to say which you went through pretty inept the other day and the other is sort of what tucker's perspective is cause of quartz tucker has a huge following and it is incredibly talented at what he does again the clip that that has been on viral is is the one a bout him saying that mascot is wonderful place i find that less interesting and compelling then in his clip suggesting a sort of moral equivalence between ladder pouter's assassinations and what the united states studs or censorship in russia and censorship in the united states and that extends to tucker really giving the benefit of the doubt to vladmerpouten he starts talking about glad pouter's r passion a for invading you crane and i got a say i i do not believe that this is reflective of the facts on the ground america policymakers have convinced themselves that claimer patents can take over poland and it is not a defense the patent by do not mean to defend patent ism not offal parents and ism not a subject of prudence of an america however there is no evidence that patent has any interest in expanding his porters he is the largest country in the world and it is very hard to run they do not need natural resources there is nothing in poland he wants there is nothing you will gain by taking poland other than more trouble u that the concussions why did he move his forces in to easternicra and i watch this from a distant vanceinge to the united states and i watch the vice president the uninedstates comma arris go t the mini security confer just days report that in february of twenty twenty two and say any public form any press conference to kolinsky the president if the grant we wants you to join dato which is another way of saying to synonym for we plan to put n new clear weapons on russia being the sort who am fora locking frussingen the ta ever one and it just tells you how constipated and restricted and entered the us media landscape is that i was the only one who said that well re section the purpose of diplomacy is to reach a peacefulmutually wont hopes beneficial conclusion to a prices if you are showing up voluntarily the tunic security conference that san haszelensky why do not you allow us putt needle weapons on cassia's porter your causing for war because the thread line gates o verbal let us be clear that dato already cents to resign borders the basic takes are on pussy's borers in their members of dato in fact dato has expanded during this war to include places finland also on russia border as far as the argument that ladder patent does not have any designs on poland his entire disquisition on history to tucker suggests that he would be warm toward the division of poland because again if you look at polish history poland did not exist for solidly a hundred and fifty years as an independent nation from about the mid eighteenth century clothe way up ti the end of world war and it did not exist as an indepenination because he was under the preserve of the ruffians the the the land of poland was it was divided during that pone again the ruins were in charge of it and then after plan was reconstituted the mashed ribbon top pact of nineteen thirty nine between the ruffians and the natives split poland right down he middle in which the soviets basically had a piece agreement with the ruffians said he could gan half of poland to pretend that russia has no territorial ambitions toward poland is heard it is also very very weird considering the literally in nonmember not of nineteen thirty nine of last year of last year demit medvidev who is the former russia president and a queen ally in fact when he was the president now that brief period in time ere putter stepped over to being prime minister and medvedev was the shadow president this is why you will recall in twenty twelve brakes ma talking to medvedav and saying tell ladimir it'll have more f flexibility after the election because everyone knew the medvdav was just a cut out for gotten well in nonmember medvdav rote apes in eight thousand word article on russia polish relations saying most had a dangerous enemy in plan quote we will treat poland precisely as a historical enemy said medvdev in nonmember of last year if there is no hope for reconciliation wit the enemy russia should have only one and a very tough at it to regarding its fate history has more than once delivered a merciless verdict to the presumptuous poles no matter how ambitious the revanchist plans may be thar collapse could lead to the death of polish statehood in its entirety again that is that is me medvedevsa cut out for gotten he is an all gotten explicitly threatening the enter plan and if you spend time in poland what you will find is that every one in poland is deeply concerned with what is going on in crane because the polish people remember being invaded movable times they know polishistory in which poly was polish was divvied poland was divided up repeatedly poland was then occupied by the soviet union after world war too was not that was divided with the noses at he beginning of world war to it was then occupied by the movie union for the entirety of the rest of the cold war this bazar notion that russia has no territorial ambitions in poland again runs counter to what members of pouter's inner circle are saying right now and grant a level of of credible doubt to the ruffians that i do not actually understand tucker doing not just that when tucker suggests that dato should have invited claimer gotten in into thousand the reason that dato did not invite ladder gotten intonate into thousand or disbannato in the aftermath of the cold war is because russia has had a long history of territorial ambition in eastern rope the purpose of dato was sucker says two check russia ambitions once you invite russia into the group you have an internal conflict let say that russia invades you crane unless they both of those countries were members of dato now article five cannot be invoked because article five is only able to be invoked against in a grosser against dato not by dato against a member state against another member state if for example lithuania were to invade a estonia tomorrow you could not invoke article five realistically because both of those countries are members of dato the idea of russia trying to get into dato to thus thwart dato that is typical russia for policy that is exactly how russia has used its seat for example on the in security council they tried to use its seat on the run security council in order to thwart ado intervention in uguslavia during the uguslav war of nineteen ninety nine an fact that something that that proteins still gadabout the scan notion that claimer gotten is a kindly hearted gentleman who is not seeking territorial expansion who does not have ambitions towards eastern european neighbors who is not using threats of military force in order to convinced territorial neighbors to move toward him which is clearly what he is doing he has an a to invade sellers sellers is already at proxy stay the of the ruffians and presumably that is what would happen if he took over you crane in full it would not just be that rush rules you trainedirectly you would be the he installs dictator declares you crank qua n quit independent and then rules the proxy almost is part of the new soli it constellation o be state rule by proxy from mascot through an ally in not that the level of credibility that that tucker is granting to paten here what is that say about what his view of america form policy is i i really am not sure a gan i can calling for clarification because tucker's really importantbois and i love to know what he thinks on all these things then tucker was asked during this interview about america policy with regard to is real and gaze and this part thenar es rather stunning he suggests that america roll with regard to israel and gaze should be to force israel to stob it is killing of commons members and is attempts to defend it is on borders here was and and he intact he goes further he suggested america is evil for not doing that here was tucker in jury sir thou heaven explanation to this moment since the gas a events took place to now nobody came out and said how on its the nite take of america is we going the the stupids of e fire how a country would be to not to continue ward ha how somebody is a gas stopping away the united states is for this moment is the most powerful country in the history of the world if you were to frame this in terms for all familiar with which a the most basic terms the terms of the family the i fate to be that would be the father and the fathers sacred obligation is to protect his family and to restore peace within is wall if i come y fort aposmorsangor is o first wall for tucker whose posited that the united states really has no interest in things that goon outside of its borders in large scale to be suggesting a familial analogy here is already very strange it at the very least it strange the idea of america is world father is extremely imperialist that that america is basically out to dominate every am he sounds will eonian almost that it is the job of america to impose its will wherever humanly to a man thing that is o proposition that the tucker dis agrees with strange to use an analogy where america is the father in its job as america is to restore peace everywhere on the globe first oral to star wit that that is weird but the analogy continues if i come my portrait if i come home from work and to mi kids a fighting whats the first thing i do even before i asset i the fighting before i gather the facts and now wit fact that a o the fight to fight yes if i come on ti have to con fighting i thin to cow it the cravat of em i evil because i violated the most basic duty of fatherhood which to bring piece because i have the power on the o only one who can bring peace and if you see a nation with ostium power a betting war for its own sake you have a leadership that has no moral authority that is illegitimate and i and ism very distract and concern that we are entering an are water this blossom force for good is instead being used for evilogay he says america is effectively evil for not promoting a cease for living come i a terrine group in control of the gazes strip using this familial analogy again there thousand proms with this familial analogy just on the face of it number one comas is not part of the family of nations ay even if you were to accept tucker's analogy that america somehow great father in the sky that rules america form pot that rules form policy all over the globe and has a role in ending every war which i knowtuckar dis not agree with if even if you accept that analogy the next question is are these children both yours because ism pretty much clear on the idea that israel is an america ally and incredibly pro america democracy in the region that provides pretty significant intelligence support to the united states and that comas is a terrorist group those are not if you are to carry this analogy realistically it would be the father of one country meaning the father and than any associated child would be presumably in america ally in this in this particular analogy and then you would have a foreign child coming in and murdering twelve hundred of the citizens of the of your child beyond that let us just take his analogy strap if you were the father and you walked into your home and ism father of for and one of your children had stabs the other child in the eyeball which is what happened on october seventh your first move would presumably not be to sit every one down and find out how this had started by stopping the conflict some shot would get real because you would be the enforcement mechanism against that sort of thing you as the father are the in fatso in other words hued be calling for interventionism now gain the entire analogy dos mechanisense israel is an independent country commons is an independent polity the united states has its own interest does interest on don't aline always with either group that is that is being discussed at this point but the notion that america is evil for facilitating seals care on its own borders to destroy terrorscroup the just murdered twelve hundred of i citizens is pretty and that is pretty stunning stuff and it does line up with with a sort of broader tenor to tucker's view of america role in the world which is that america historically and currently has been apparently a fairly negative force in the world i say that not just because of what he is saying about what is happening in gaze or america support for you crane or any of that he did not interview with mussels brand that came out fairly recently in which he was talking about world were to and what he suggested is that america was bad during world war to because america had engaged in what he called collective punishment now let us be clear about what america did during world war to in for example the firebombing of dressed in which was in fact manufacturing center or the firebombing of too which was military center or in the bombing of heroshma and agasaki at the end of world war too america was attempting to win a war and forestalling america casual tees there in if you are america first and you wish for america to win wars in which it is engaged without getting a lot of america killed sometimes you have to do really really ugly things i think most america understand that and historicallyofe understood that particularly the grandchildren of the people who did not die invading the mainland of japan because of the dropping of the atomic bombs for example military estimate suggested that a milia america could die in the invasion of japan if that been a an ambitious assault as opposed to dropping of of atonic weaponry over japan in august give a forty five but here was tucker talking about america evil during world war to collective punishment is completely except it as legitimate other all part the same bloodline that is incomprehensible to the christian mind because bloodline is a elephant neither junior green men the whole point of christiania is it does not matter who your parents were or what should wanna is you have a direct relationship with god in if you are on board with that then your christian if you are not your not but there is there is no sense there is no templet for collective punishment in christiania it is it is it is repulsive to christian it is repulsive and in my fruit should be and it always was in the west and i do think there are wore crimes tat the united states committed during the secondary war the firebombing of too famously dressed in am there were collective punishment and and i would also say by the way the atomic bombs on heroshama nagasaki that was that is collected punishment i oke and i think that rotted the soul of the west yes i think that is immoral that it did two things one you carry the burden of sin that scale that you just do you can help it and too that level of power in the hands of human beings convinced him that they were god yes is curious because you old her a comparable argument offed for slavery for example that theysabut an is born by america culch and yet have never had any one advance around the act of herashema a nagasaki i want it to o dropped atomic weapons on civilian populations ism not indorsing imperial japan yes and it was an impure power in the worst cense horrible horrible horrible government however you cannot annihilate a civilian population and call yourself the good guy i do not care i love america i will defend america almost under any circumstances you cannot defend that and and the right and the let in everybody in our country that no one revisits that was only eighty years ago we dropped atomic weapons on a civilian pop pulsation i know that there munitions plants there but you just vaporized tens or thousands peoplewho hath nothing women children the elderly the nothing to do with us yes then on now f you fill good about latino pemistip unless you can on the god with a set of epical and moral you is alfulgamize absolutely o case let us be can comma be cleared bout something the west has then spent every moment trying to develop weaponry sophisticated that they can target specific military members even as they imbed among civilian populations which is what is real is doing for example right now in the gosistrip or what the united states did when it fought sis or what the united states did when was fighting in a rock or a gangsta but the baseline notion that collective punishment is equivalent to war collective punishment is i know who the bad guises are and i do not care who the bad guys are i want to punish all of you out of malice and pressure that is the goal of collective punishment collective punishment is not your war with a country that country is threatening you the only way to win the war and to make sure that your interests are maintained is to take certain military action that will have collateral damage collateral damage is not the same thing as collective punishment but tutor s attacker seems to equate these two things collateral damage and collective punishment as though the intent of the of the dropping of these boys does not matter what soever and that for close is the possibility of whining war world were to again war has gotten a lotmarmihticulus since then which is why casualty numbers in war have dropped significantly is also i for example the united states despite having a nuclear monopoly in the affromauth of world war to if that ad truly corrupted the america sold to the except russia that that that tucker suggests here if tat is truly corrupted the america national sold that way from nineteen forty five until nineteen forty none the united states had a nuclear monopoly no one else had atom we could have literally bombed mascot into rubble would have dropped one new and we could have finished the cold war at he beginning of the cold war but we did not because we cared about collateral damage because we did not want collective punishment yow this sort of generalized view of foreign policy which essentially suggest that everything that is bad in the world is a is in a responses it is blow back to america interventionism in the world because america has historically and currently foster bad things in the world suggests a revanchist foreign policy in which the united states basically under cuts all of its interests in the world in the interests of of what now again maybe that collapses backing that original isolationist argument that the u us has no form policy w do not neediformn policy erect of wall everything good maybe that is the idea of i think that is short sighted i do not thing that that is going to i do nothing that is going to be realistic in a world in which values are filled by forces nefarious that do not america and do not wish for the prosperity of america citizens at least that is foreign policy but this is w i clarification on these issues i think would be a good thing there is lot of vague talk floating around about foreign policy and for the third time i would lug to sit down tucker and talk about these things to actually establish what he thinks a good and moral america foreign policy should look already is the rest of

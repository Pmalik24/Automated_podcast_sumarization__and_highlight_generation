let us talk about how all this happen it happen because we in the west do not understand our enemies and they know that and they exploit path into thousand for president gorge shtallby bush gave an address at the united nations in which he said one of the most naive things any president has ever said he said thirds a direct quote when it comes to the desire for liberty and justice there is no clash of civilizations people everywhere a capable of freedom and worthy of freedom the desire for freedom it resides in every human heart direct quote from gorge day bushy thousand for that was idiocy then and it is idiocy now it is simply not true people have many different priorities for lot of people their priority is not freedom western notions of freedom it is adherence to fundamentalist interpretation of organic law for many their priority is not economic development it is belief in the murder of news across the world but this peculiar western belief system that everyone wants freedom has led the west down two separate and equally stupid paths path number one which we saw over the course of e last twenty five years was nation building that is what happened in afghanistan and rock the west fooled itself into believing that tribal peoples with different priorities really really wanted i phones and sexual liberation and that if we a feed those things theywofld welcome us with open arms instead of pursuing a realistic form policy designed to protect america interests we launched off into you a utopian world of our own making and we failed yet we continue to pursue that path to day we continue to act as though for example it is israel job to build up the inform structure and goo provide them water and power even whilecommoss murders babies in their cribs and put it is own civilians in harm's way that is ridiculous an it is going to file path number two was the path of wilful ignorance he see if we all have the same priorities we can negotiate with any one in everyone in fact every one is reasonable everyone wants the same thing even if things get a little at a hand from time to time even if a couple we s a year rock as fly from gaze into tell of eve it just the frustration of reasonable people with reasonable priorities and just all a social of violence this path leads to failure and massdath it lulls the west including israel into a false sense of security people who have different priorities monsters camass take in manage godown a show you a tacit is been release on our tea which is the russia propaganda channel it is an interview with senior comose official ogle broke just happen over the course the last forty eight hours he explains everything that just happens he explains what happened in this mass terrotack the worst terrotacins nine eleven in the west in intelligence failure that is wayworn than nine eleven by the way he explains everything we need to go through in details you can see just what a lie we all fell for many america fell for that everybody has the same priorities and why that big lie is going to get more innocent children women and men murdered raped and burned here is the tape again this is a senior cuss official on or tea speaking in arabia talking about exactly how comose perpetrated this massacre were an a stop and started because we mean to explain exactly what he is saying in detail he is just saying all the quit parts out lout magma sural comforts then fill won to on the pastcople of years he says camass has adopted a rational approach tit did not going to any war and did not join the aslonicehodnits resent battle but all of this was camass strategy in preparing for this attack of course we made them think that comes was busy governing an gaze that it want to focus on the two pone five million palicinians in gaze and has abandoned the resistance altogether all the while under the tables compass was preparing four this big attack posit there for a second o say let me point out right from the outset he is sane right from the outset it was a lie we never cared about the two point five million palsinians who are now hearing about living in gaze cause this is this is the game they play on you believing that they care when israel strikes of comes targets and hit is the civilians the commas is deliberately putting in the way then it is israel'sfall the is after all what will kind of human beings would not care of their own babies are getting killed and the enters compass as far as the notion that comas was ever a reasonable actor israel lull itself into a sense of complacency about this well sure they watch a few rockets everysoff and out mostly just approve to their own people that their still a terrors croup but in reality they want they want built the normal governing power traction want be a normal governing power that is a lie it is a lie every bit of money that flowed into gaze over the course of last twenty years was used by a compass four purposes of murdering jugs all that money was being used by class for purposes of murdering news is continued the tape o do not a the be imam is was weverinat to now who take these rays were attack to tell of eve we bomtelleve on the first day the attack doe he want take them to the galley the northern front with lebanon has opened to day the galley is no longer safe for the finest enemy we can on the galley from inside occupy palestine thou in order to keep the attack secret and successful he says the different factions in our allies did not know the zero hour but after half an hour all the palcinian resistance factions we are contacted as for our allies in husband and arena can posit there for a second they have state sponsorship the turns he says were also notified they state sponsorship and state sing from mara from cabala as soon as it was going they they let all the people up the turns ran cabala those are all parties that have the same exact world priority as compass who do not care about the own citizens and me just look t what is going on in iron literally everyday of the week look at how lebanon which was once considered a rose in the middle least has devolved it to complete cars and tyranny he continues yea meeting was held with them three hours later at nine am we have they did anyone contact us t even the russia sent a message an inquired he says and they were updated about the situation about the goals of the war soon the ruffians were brought into the loop it was all plans in other words the most important part of what the senior commas official is saying is the very first part they do not give a good damn about the people in gaze they do not care it was a all a lie they do not care in fact they say they do not give any is about their own people they do not they do not care in fact they high aspiration is death now ism noting that they save that they say the the say out held and they assume that you are sophisticated that better than they do what they are thinking in saying they say it right to your face they say directly to your face and then of now now it cannot be it just cannot be must be these railifault somehow here is again senior commas official all banana yesterday on our tea saying exactly the priorities exactly what the priorities are to i the es rallies are known to love life he says we on the other hand sacrifice ourselves we consider our dead to be martyrs the thing any palisinian desires the most is to be martyred for the sake of all defending his land we have bee preparing for this for two years o say that is enough that is the thing o they right there he just says it and this has been the line why the way this the line in all of the radical is lying for meatless world this line for p it is line for line oh had it is line for commas it is line for is ball it is lie for a ran they love life we love death is their line that is their line when you say why why do not they care about their kids maybe the way they care about their kids that when their kids die they think that their martyrs they thing they have done something good apparently we do not care about our people is ay way of saying we t we care about their souls you say it is it is a different kind of logic as robot mall might say it is a different kind of thought debut in traditional western thought the way care buyer kind not by killing them and the way they care by you citizens is not by putting them directly in the line of a of an air strike that you can sit under ground waiting to kill news but they do not think we do that is the whole points and they know that you will not believe them they know you will not believe that they can say directly to their own people they can say it clearly an tie over and over and you still will not believe them that is how stupid they think you are and by the way that is how stupid d west is theist's is stupid that we believe that in the end this can be negotiated with that in the end whatever human rights atrocities happen in gaze as the direct result of commas doing what it is doing right now and it is a human rights atrocity to put your headquarters under a hospital it's a human rights atrocity to plant youweapons underneath mosques it is a human right atrocity to put weapon re in schools in winter gardens which is something hemostat but they know that yo will not believethe'redoing it you will not believe that because it will boggle your mine but you wilt believe that the news breathe babies that is what they're counting on that you will not believe that the news are the baggie even after the news get slaughter in their beds you will believe that if only the news hat just given a little more only a little now this does betray something else about the west an late new hatred that exists across he less because let us be real about this none of this conversation was happening after nine eleven hone a lot of conversation the united states about well when we go in and we boy from thirty thousand feet and we kill load of civilians the real question is the human i gites are we being careful enough should it be a short term short try after you kill three thousand america what happens we flatten you that is what happens but when israel has it is borders permeated by terrors who murder we've thirteen hundred news murder thirteen hundred news in a wives pet us all lasting ours on end when that happens that is well those news man that they they really they really got blame more careful those jaws by by cant they just more calf only ha given a little bat harder there there is something going on that is simply beyond western ignorance and it gets in to a we i something much deeper and darker and by the way everyone bought it everyone on left ta he's bought it and people who said that it was not true those people we are marginalized people said want no come s it is true the pausing authority to they care significantly more about killing jaws than the care about the well being of the own citizens everybody in the less when no that cannot be true that cannot be try cure for example is robot valley to robot valley was until we last five minutes the biding negotiator with the on robot valley it is radical that in two thousand eight berocabona selected him is foreign policy adviser to his campaign and youth to be thrown off of the campaign in two thousand eight be cause who's holding secret conversations with commons the is backing two thousand eight s to by eminstrition brought robot valley back in to hold conversations with the on and then as it turns out robot valley very well may have been effectively a spy for the aroneans here is robot valley cooped by the perspective that everyone is reason while every one is rational that all on the seaside here is robot valley describing come of and has ball just a just a few years ago it is a mistake to only think of them in terms of the terms violence the mansion their social political movements probably the most voted movements in their respective societies how of not a majority among palistonians by any means but very deeply rooted it is been million know its it was born in the first the palisonan to father an in the nineteen eighties it has deep royalty it is it has a charity organization of social branch it is not something you can defeat me m her either and people need to understand that the much misinformation about the i i i speak to them i a i college speak to them now we may disagree with them but they have their own rationality that is one thing to understand these a not none of them are crazies they may do things that we considered to belong to difference calm o rationality but within they will not sister it is often very logical ins some very logical you see they they do social work that is come ass side legitimate people that we can have conversations with this has been the governing philosophy of the west in many parts of the right as well as the west for it the last several decades when it comes to the midst and who's all lie it as clearly lie and it is at self flattering li because it gives you the offal everybody wants a solution to every problem ti get it also want solutions to every problem not every problem has a good and easy solution particularly not a goodman easy solution that involves you sitting down at table in writing some words intending a piece of paper it is not a shock therefore their robber valley who is placed on leave earlier this year for a legally miss hanging classing material it turns out that his probably in bed withe aronians according to the york post the bide administrations former special convoy torn should face extensive scrutiny for his permissive stands toward the tavern regime after it either a comas cabala an carrying out derris attacks against israel critic sat on money represent a deal saw of californium told the york post robber valley deserves extensive scrutiny yesterday to day and tomorrow after the walstreturnal reported their on was implicitly involved by the landmass again saying that on was involved in all this visas said valley and others crated incredibly permissive environment for homes for on to do all these things that is gibbon the ronhav former special advisor honor at the state department the rondo's serves under secretary o stay might pomelo under trump said valley and his negotiating team quit purposefully funnel billions of dollars to iron through lack of sanctions in foremen and provision of sanctions relief that is given them somewhere between fifty and eighty billion dollars over the last two and a half years alone a senior house republican aid told the new ark post the cash influx bothering even more generous pout of one point seven billion dollars that the aroma administration made to iron into thousand sixteen and this all driven again by that myth by that myth that they all think we do we do not understand our enemies and we assume that they actually care about their own people but they do not care about their own people and again this is pervaded the entire left audit butler feminist theorist who fortune would be dead if she lived in commassustan if she like then the gosastrip audit butler men tossed off a building decades ago here is audit butler defending comas i think yes understanding mama sociaomens thetrestis extremeortn that dos again critical certain a actions men it does not in tomengions i does not stop those of us who are interesting politics for raising the question whether their other options besides oo again a cacriticalpor engagement an a certainly thin it should be entire into the conversation we there it is audit butler standing for compass and cusballar who would certainly murderer if she were living in their territory now the reason tat is all ravin is because all of the narrative in the current middle situation is going to shift very quickly and s gumshoe very quickly because people go back to their political priors their political priors very often are just bring ended toward the hands off do not care cycle a violent why who am i to take sides i do not know anything that that boo and people have the blinder strict from their iyesfrge stockmen and the logo right back to priors because this is what people do since biblical times when god literally spoke to the israelites and then five seconds later the a building a golden calf this how peoplelare for just a moment in time clarity strikes them and then the clarity goes awannigll right back to what they we doing five seconds ago and the way that that is going to take place is your going to see a bunch of people who express tremendous sympathy for the now thirteen hundred dead news in israel they are going to a express sympathy for the parents of the burned babies there can express sympathy for the husbands of the rape wives in the kidnap they are ere on express sympathy for that and then the entire narrative is going to shift because israel is going to do what it has to do in order to stop commas from ever being threat to it citizenry again as any normal nation would yours turn sin on sotromedia all of the all of the narrative is now shifted toward what is happening in gaze it is terrible at happening in gaze now the only way to make that shift is if you assume the wit is happening in gaze is now israel fault as supposed to it is compasses fault now here is how to think about this morally if i burn down your house and murder your children and then i go back to my house and i hide behind my child and the police show up to arrest me or to shoot me and i hide behind my child it is my responsibility that i am hiding behind my child that would be my fault right i would be the evil actor in the scenario and you would not call off the attempt to arrest or shoot me if it'd burn down your house and murdered your child you would not no person would it is insane to suggest otherwise but the world is immediately going to shift into that mod now here is the problem compass as the senior commasoficial says they have spent he last two an a half years building up for precisely the scenario an big question easy question if cuss ad not ben building for the scenario howrockets still to day five days after these attacks been fired in israel what is that me it means they have an extensive terrane or underground they build is extraordinary tunnel network using every bit of cement they could find over the less twenty years that was supposed to be used for building inform structure but a gain they are about people living in gaze ans they took all of that and they built a bunch of tunnel systems they are living down there withtheir air conditioning in the generators and meanwhile on the surface they telling people not to leave the populated areas that israel is going to have to clear and bond as to prevent this thing from turning into urban warfare that is their gold israel is doing what it has to do what israel is doing militarily speaking is they are clearing the ground they are blowing up all these buildings and they are essentially turning into flat ground and then there can have to go in to the ground invasion and the can have to smoke would compass terrace whore hiding under ground in these tunnels that is what is going on right now and the world is going to instead decide that because commas is literally telling civilians not to leave the areas that they get killed that israel is supposed to call off its attack and leave commas place leave compass in power which by the way is an impossibility it is the an impossibility on every score the reason its impossibility is to fold one you simply for reasons of of justice and decency cannot let the peoplewho just murdered your children live you cannot do that and to the way that policy works in the madelease is that every demonstration of military weakness is an encouragement of further violence if commas is still ruling the gazes trip at the end of all of this the chances that hesballa is going to launch an invasion from the north at some point are extremely hide the first available opportunity because there will be a sens that israel is value able israel in vulnerability was its greatest asset and that invulnerability was punctured by a bunch of terrorist rushing through the border and killing babies that is that is what has just happen and israel has to restore that sense of invulnerability in pregnability and military stability that is what israel has to restore here on the found the draft to restore the situation at and then to a crater world of radical muscles who wish to murder every due in the bed they to restore the idea that if you cross us we will kill you right that that is what israel has to do here and the world is immediately shifting back into cycle of violencemode you can we it happening in real time and the are doing despite the fact that again every thing that is happening in the gossistrip is the fault of compass everything let me take a quick example right now israel has turned off the water in the power and they've announced the water and power in the gossip strip are going to remain off until come ass releases the hundred or hostages that thy are currently holding and already are starting to here rumblings from the a we've yet that isn't that collective punishment and the answer is well when comes has honey combed itself into these areas how exactly we yo expect israel to accomplish its gals it was not a ware that done after you murder everybody's everybody's children they have an obligation to provide you water and power is born of the weird impression the israel has a moral obligation grater then the governing body of the goose strip to the got and citizens to protect them israel using that responsibility by that by actively warning people out of these areas trying to push people out the areas one the reasons for turning off the water and power is because the only people right now in these areas who have water and power of people underground every one else does not have water and power to turn off the water and power presumably people will leave becausethy do not have water and they do not have power once they will leave those areas and everybody's underground in the tunnels who does have water an power because again they misdirected every piece of money every piece of matériel into building the terra tunnels those people were made that is the entire strategy but the world is of courses going to shift into to crying israel mode all their military tactical to all it is too terrible and its a moral equivalents it is the same thing of israel a temps to bomb commas headquarters and commashide's mind ta lied as if compass breaks into israel and then i once again burns entire families in their homes exactly the same thing ad that what come of is counting on easy in their counting on the idea that they are you and that you will look at what they are doing take no one no one would do that known would tell their own civilians to stay in harmsway israel has spent the last twenty years building boy shelters s that every time a rock et flies into israel is either shot down by iron dome or people go into he momshelters come ass use that as a tactic that is part of their tactic here is that israel cares enough about its on citizens that when the rockets star flying israel does not leave ts on citizens out there israel sounds the alarms everybody goes into the momshelter and that is when homos broke through the walls tat was the entire tactic what exactly happen what there is an unasked question that i think needs to be asker people o t israel is cutting off the water have a question why isn't got have water real question why's not got have water you may have noticed if you live in the united states or any other decent country that if you live in a furlong bilge on a hill somewhere you have water and have power in that weir and how does that happen and the answer is typically speaking it is not wildly expensive to provide water and power it actually is not certainly not for the mount of money that is been flowing into the gosh trip over the course of e last twenty years cares what actually happened with the water and power and gaze commas stole all the money and they let people have undrinkable water not only to they let people have in drinkable water they literally band their own citizens and two thousand fifteen from digging wells to get water because they do not give each about palistinian civilians they do not care they do not care again there is a there is an underground aquifer in the gas trip a comas did not manage the private wells the oklapher was then polluted by overtrumping and waste water contamination and again commas was shipped water pipes to rebuild its water inform structure and it stain for structure what exactly to they do according to t you can telegraph they literally took the pipes that were meets to move potable water in and out of populated areas in stage out an they use them to build rockets this is according this is a this a film from the commas military wing and active shows them taking pipe this shipped in in forward cutting it up and using it relating it to make rockets to firer at news and kill them that is what coastal that is even on discourse one the attempt to kill news obviously but two you care little about your own population thatyou will not give them water to drink will not give them water to drink and then it is israel responsibility you spend last twenty years having money shipped to you to to build water and power in for structure you take all that money use it on guns terror tunnels rockets and then you have the gall to suggest that israel the people you just murdered have a responsibility to provide to you the water in the power ism not need ism mean explainer on that one here is the video by the way from a comas of what they do with the water pipes their shipped into them as aid this according you a telegraph the e help build more than thirty miles water pipe lines for palastinians and then come ass boosted of their ability to fortune arsenal of home made rockets from water pipes they literally put out a video of them carving up the water pipes wherein commas head gear and then they and according to the you a telegraph bruises tosportofst a hundred million gurus into pipe line projects in territories control by compass over the last decade and the are idiots that commas itself put out of relating the water pipes into rockets to fire at news this not josh propaganda that is commas propaganda meanwhile the use still thinking of sending more aids to these people it is unbelievable it is unbelievable again lick it is not as though that any of this was a secret according to all monster which is a ut which they left wing organization they say that commas band water wells this back in two thousand twenty one quote palistinians living is rash bushel all writing know a wright won u palsinians living n the border areas of the gosestripp o lion wells to secure drinking water into irrigate their crops as comasron local mini capacities failed to assume their responsibility to supply water to these areas in an august twenty fifth statement the commasifiliated water an environmental quality authority announce to band against the digging of water wells in all gosh governments under the direct protect of fighting is severe decline in ground water levels and quality do to over exploitation of the aquelfor into which the wells are drilled the authority see its decision is based on the palistinian water was number three of two thousand too which prohibits on license to drilling a but there is a problem the authority called on all citizens who already drilled water wells to rectify their legal status in the next three months obtaining a licence but sands believe the band is designed only to obtain money in exchange for issuing license for drilling wells in the first place now bills sultan a resident of all gall border area in the northern gosestrip told emoter i living the area for seven years the hast are not connected to the water supply or stage network we mainly region drilling wells to obtain water he said the decisuand mean that people die of dehydration these are the by the way according to the deputy head of the palisinian water authority this is two thousand twenty one is theme its matin albania he told ammonites that her are ten thousand water wells in the gossip including three hundred wells for the municipalities twenty seven hundred wells for the agricultural sector and seven thousand private wells the citizens drilled without obtaining a proper percent what are the water sources in gosh quit there are three sources for water in gossip ninety two per cents of the water is secured from the oquepher six per cent is purchased from israel two per cent through sea water desalination another words they botched the entire water squalor process and they stole llmetarial and they used it for mil and now and now when there is a human its problem because there is no enough water there whose fated theseraelies of course of course meanwhile by blat you have notice a lot of talk about palcinian civilians and and the danger that they are in knows that israel which is why again they've be issuing day after day after day texts and radio radio messages and internet messages telling people to get out and be likely where they can go well you may notice if you have eyeballs and map that actually the gosestript has two borders it has a border in the north in t in the east which is with israel and then has a southern border at southern border is with a other arab mole country why what what a nice coincidence and another aeramosem country who must take in its brothers if they wish to preserve their lives her innocent civilians after all that country is called egypt that country is called egypt and due i noticed that due i notice that egypt was asked two provided corridor for civilians and you not to egypt said his said cannot were not providing a corridor that is what they said quote is the jerusalem post egypt has discussed plans with the united states and others to provide humanitarianade through its border with gosistrip but rejects any move to set up safe quarters for refugees fleeing the conclave you want to know why because they are afraid a those civilians are honeycombed with gloss terrace we will then endanger the stability of the egyptian regime why they might think that because let us see passed inion refugees put in danger the stability of the geranial regime which resulted in blacks sop member in the nineteen seventies in the expulsion of tens of thousands of pass insane from there they then completely reck the regime and lebanon turning again at stable christian roll country in to a disaster trashed they have completely taken over the gas trip and rocket it this would be the the piano followed by comas and gyp is od know we are not interested according according to the international community increasingly the way this works is that the people who are responsible for every aspect of arab muslin security in the gasps trip are the news who just got murdered by compass that is the logic here that is that be cut and why would not they be because after all are not we all the same types of people are not we all the same types of people have just to point out at this point once more no we are not no man who says we are not the commanders of compass here is compass commander macmudallsa her this is two thousand to explaining the goals of comes o this the the theehdation we were when we sued you about the army of jerusalem the battle of the promise of the hereafter we are not talking out liberating our land alone he says we believe in what our proper mahometsad w you old rough the ends of the world a near one another for my sake and i have seen it is master and western ans the a mining of my nation would reach of those ends they have been drawn near me a e the entire five hundred ten millions square bolometers of planed earth you will come orderly system where there is no in justice yum no oppression no treachery nosiness no treacherous christiania and know killings and crimes those being committed who against the palm insane and against the grabs in all arab country us in lebanon syria arrive and other countries are they being in clear ism just confused but there you sober valley says that they have their own system of logic they are just you meanwhile there they are screaming in your face that they are not you they do not give a crap about their own children they keep saying goes market that is true what you do its your population is tafketsyou do not stack your kids on top of the terror tunnels you do not hide your rockets inside hospitals that is exactly what they are doing you do not deprive those people of water and power on your own you you and the municipal authority this was your actual job for twenty years and then star a terror war that results in retaliation in which the water and power a not available to anyone except the fighters living underground the terrace living underground by the way just a just to show you how much compass cares about the civilians what exactly are they on what exactly are they worried about coven paschal the leader in founding member of compass gave a speech yesterday and he asked museums around the world for help what he ask for did he ask for a humanitarian corridor for example to law civilians out omasa no did he ask for any sort of real financial help for for example the refuges in gas of course not he called for four things quote to show anger especially next fridge the be this fridge in muslin countries and also among muslin diaspora around the world he call at the fridge of all ox flood and he will send this will send message of rage to lions and america which is why every synagogue in the region in america across the world is a taking up new security measures on fridge as well they should by the way that the the ridiculous propagandizing of all ox is i it is absurd the only people of freedom of worship on the temple amount are museums period and of story have been on the temple mount most mutual times ism not allowed to pray their openly jordan person's wife when we went up there was forced to hide her cross but donoragizes it it is really it is it is the it is initiation of t chances he says he asked for financial help from all museums around the world to help with their money he called it financial we hod he ask museums to give to whom who d e ask moles to the refuges to the to the fathers and mothers the babies being being killed in these instructs nope to the fighters of gaze in order to condensate them for the destruction to the terrorists he asked political pressure for muslin leaders an muslimnations to stop israel military invasion gas again no ask from them for he know some sort of resources for the millions of refuges or can be created by their terror war and the most important thing quit he asked all museums around the world to carry sgeehod by their souls to fight and be martyrs for all ox he wants museums to fight against the news starting with slims who live in the countries surrounding israel jordan heriot lebanon in egypt to go to the boys and fried to enter each by their own means a wants more borer in curious which will get civilians killed people will walk to the border is cannot let people cross those boys and people die and he wants that for the press because he knows that the lullaby stupid western press will then pretend that this a massacre on the part of these rallies as supposed to an attempted invasion bahamas he said this is the time for good to be applied on the ground rather than just in theory he ask the music hidden to going long caravans to spill their blood on the land of palestine he said fun are important but to day we are asking for your blood and souls the question as to what comes next is still very much in open one a ran obviously knew that commas was planning the attacks reunited states is claiming that iron didn't really know the the scale or the size of the attack dots the providing all f the resources the the single biggest under of camps jobidon again the bin administration has had on going negotiations with the government of on for years at this point they have had n the billions of dollars and assets its one reason for them to down play exactly what happened here meanwhile cusballat is the single biggest recipient of cranial for an aid the re give seven hundred million dollars a year from on it is missile stock pall runs to a hundred thousand or more and those rockets are significantly more accurate and and medley then then compass rockets ow all of this bodes very ill for the possibility of avoiding a regional war unless unless less makes clear this thing has to stay contained on the israilyside benjaminiting ow who as now formed a unity govern with any goes all the talk about all the divisions in is daily society the were been covering for last year and a half all o that stuff went away immediately i think one thingthat is really important to note here and again i have tons of friends in family on the ground in israel my wife's family particularly tons of them on the ground in israel am the unity in israel among the citizens has literally never been greater the response of his rallies to this is absolutely astonishing people are showing people are flying back in their packing el all flights back in if there abroad in order to rejoin the usually military service who have been called up many reserves have not been called up they have a hundred and fifty per cent reporting rate the literally more people are reporting the have been called up for duty civilians are showing up at military basis with food with with clothing with sleeping bags with whatever is necessary if the reservists dots have proper equipment people are are right now in pretty much every community every jewfish community across the world organizing shipments of that into israel the the social solitary in israel and he moral interns of unity has never been hire everybody is of course deeply disturbed by what happened everybody is in a state of morning but everybody else wo understands what has to be done over there another idiots that have merged from from israel of of the unity are truly making people who five seconds ago where at each others throats over things judicial reform all that gone by the wayside on mi favored that he of o video of a tell y restaurant tell es very left wing area of israel tell thee restaurants which are very secular another e not real big on the orthodox they have costumed their kitchens because the on to make sure that the orthodox actually eat food from their restaurant that that is what is happening muon benjaminites now who he is now suggested that the goal is to entirely while commas off the map which of course it must be for both strategic and girl political reasons you have to while comes off the map because you have to make sure the they cannot do anything remotely this again and also israel hast restore to turns because of the returns is not restored then this is only the beginning for the state of israel meanwhile as you can see all of the all the worst actors in the world are calling for n immediate seas fire of corse baking called for an immediate seas fire which is absurd that is not going to happen israel has not even begun at this point israel also to day had to boy the air port into masks and aleph they had to do that because there is a massive randan shipment of arms that was coming in the strikes targeted runways to the airport to prevent this randan flight from landing in aleph to ship more weapons over to hesballah an cranial than air flight those badland in syria turned back to teleran according to the jerusalem post the man air is usually used to transport weapons opera is and fun for the illogic revolutionary guard for and hesballah into the region the political response from the united states has been split it is virtually lar large swaths of it in in both parties are pro israel to this point the rhetoric from the by administration has been absolute correct and it should be considering that twenty two america were murdered in this terrace attack and there are currently many hostages who are america being held in the gosestript john curly the national security spokes person he reported on this yesterday i think we on my distal ourselves very distinct possibility that these numbers ill keeping are an that w we may a find out that and mama part of the hostage well the america obviously have a a rather large interest we as america have rather large interest in getting our hostages back and certainly on a u political level if an interest in one avoiding original war that will undoubtedly break of the it is going to happen or if there's the will be original of israel is not to strike moss there will be original war it is that simple because if they cannot struck him ass come ass with the claim victory cabala will get in if casbelog gets any israel have to restrike us ballad it is tell has to destruct us ballad syria and the rest of lebanon t will get in and if theyget in very large possibility around gets in the the dominate fact has to be stopped right now and the only o to stop that is by containing this war an allowing israel to wipe comose off the map that is the only way this happens right now the bi niminstration is is making the right sounds here a secretary void often yesterday talk about israel duty to defend itself at the son the we stnoltry a to misread story firing an yesterday including ken unistious it will be providing for or sing cginesector o that israel can protect it sit sense and cites it will pen toe tonsure that is has it it mes to keep itself an its liaison safe i any other country is you es right ta the fend it at a press a is has a duty to thefendi in ma to estate the e states for me my won to product power in to direct resort is to tackle crises in multiple fears this is why presumableave the united states had now moved two aircraft carriers into the mediterranean and joining is warning people do not get involved here is jobidon talking to ere on yesterdays an you better be careful no i scores ton inion in ow anyhow many times et the s gin is for and now already we resume iomiitasisens to ethereally eanspersinplyin ammunition in sept to banana now we will eascarriously these tomiatraty torandin for fretercaeri that region and made it clear be i clear to the radians be careful yow we i mean they they best be careful because again if this does broaden out the consequences are going to be disastrous for every one involved but mostly for thy arronean regime meanwhile of course the the response from people on the right has largely been correct rondisantis of all the candidates fancy half have of course have the strongest responsive i ronistans the rest pons ester he was actual in here was on is want is talking but what his tree needs to do in the goes strip i i wondered at a veteran what do you think that should look i think the reason why we have got into this point as because fur decades israel would respond to acts of terror but they would be very careful to do it in ways there were considered quote a proportional and that would not get them a international condemnation cause the minute they start doing anything they are always under the microscope i think in this situation we an america we has got a stand with them the gold should not be a to proportional response it should be the elimination of mamas and the terrorist superstructure that is grown up a in gaze and that will be something that will be more significant that would israel been willing to do in the past i think they are more than capable of doing it that of course is a exactly exactly right meanwhile president from who again was an excellent present fries from the must present in israel history for israel ism i the they just the narcissism of him is is obscures his actual political accomplishments is it i who did the graham cords the the god who gave israel ain't an needed in the middle of rocket wars with with mamas and yesterday he chose to binary attempting humiliate the corn price minister of israel benjamenton who because he was given issue in formation that after his loss in the whining when he lection that it is now rushed to takin gradually bided which work notes when the last we leaders actually con gradually baton in any case he redone from going after it an it is now w personally in the middle of war and talking about his ball is smart for attacking from the north which is weird since there is literally no other place that has below count attack from they are located in the north of israel that is the six suggesting the metical would be smart if the attacked a america from the south thank what else would they attack from there they're south of us and what what hearing up but it'll never forget it'll never forget that baby at yo let us down that was a very terrible thing i will say that and would i see as sometimes the intelligence you talk about the intelligence a you talk about some of the things that went wrong over the last week they have got as straight enough because the fighting potentially a very big force the fighting potentially a ran and when they have people saying the wrong things everything they say is being they tested by these people because they vicious in this mart and boy of the vicious cause nobody has everceened kind of sight that we have seen nobody's ever seen it but they cannot play game we were disappointed by that very disappointed but we did the job ourself that it was absolute precision magnificent beautiful job and then abbey tried to take credit forhelp psid that did make me feel to good but that is all right they got us strengthen themselves up what would end but a right men of and president true an nothing be gratitude for preside in true as as a new and as an america nothing mut gratitude for present hat with your president right now but the the the fact to the matter is that at that is that is bazar bizarstof in attacking the prime minister in a current time of war with ha unity government in israel by the way with much people disagree but they do agree on the survival of the jewfish state i is a is a very bazar move and meanwhile the left is doing what t left us they are they are moving predictably into anti israel territory burned standers who as i have said before is about his geishas a hanstandwich a he is a he continues to be one of the world's worst moral exemplars he put out of statements and right now the international community must folks on reducing humanitarian suffering and protecting innocent people on both sides of this conflict the targeting of civilians a war crime o matter who does it israel blanket denial of food water another necessities to goats e serious violation of international law and will do nothing but harmonic in civilians age just a point out her this burned standard standing for comas and suggesting that israel shouldn't be able to pursue any of hits one military end because comas has put its own civilians in harm's way burned sander says the united states is rightly offered solidarity an support to israel in responding to commands attack but we must insist on restraint from his really o force is attacking fossa and work to secure you an humanitarian access let us not forget that half of the two million people in got our children children instant people do not deserve to be punish for the acts of compass that is true h know be amazing if comas did not put them directly in the line of fire get who is responsible for the human rights to atrocity the person puts the child and line of fire because their terrorist or the person rats to kill the terrorist and accidentally h hit is the child to who who is responsible for that precisely a goring burned obviously the problem is israel meanwhile democrats still having problem condemning the squad for there consistently procomas stands representing can goodman i he a refuse to throw were shouted to leave under the bus the other day because of course why would he why would he am me she is a democrat elision she has a malison an flash is palistonan a but what you just said seems it is a pretty easy answer about the difference between palistonians and a mass and yet a som members in your concur a a choosing notes will look everyone comes to congress with their own lived experiences and provided to leave is palimony an america she has family in a the malison an territories and has a particular view a but she she is one person she does not represent the democratic party and what you are hearing from the leaders of the democratic party no one more emphatic than president biding yesterday who gave one of the most stirring and pro israel speeches than any president has ever given is that the democratic party stands firmly behind israel o a i also notice they're not willing to one to throw weshuted to leave enohanoma open terror supporters out of your caulis i notice that is hell clutching whiter doing the same sort of nonsense who recoin whiter of u rs is the governor of michigan and she put out a statements calling for peace and i in said literally nothing about what it actually happened to the news apparently should not me israel in her statement she's did not condemn compass orts terrorism in her statement instead she said we need peace in the region i and then she follow up with second post that said that her support for israel is steadfast she also failed to mention harass in that post and of course none of that is particularly surprising from some of the radical democrats in people who are who are operating at the behaved of radical illogic fundamentalists including people thin oar meanwhile left wing protestors across the nation a or it is a making i mean like they're just saying it all out the open an we a spoke to pretend that it is not happening one of the one of the rallies took place yesterday was you w students this university wash consol students who are apparently chancing glory to the matters yesterday that is that is the matters by the way would be the people who murdered news in their beds we now weweleerby any means necessary by any means pessary including the a complete extirpation of every new from the reckon meanwhile serena recall and america studies professor at male the fenitactics used by harass quote settlers are not civilians this is not hard that was in response to hi sinew's journalist saying civilians are civilians are civilians does not matterwhere settlers are nosviins now lemme point out here at this point that do even if you believe that were true which is utter complete li the news living in say aura deserves to be murdered because they are living afraid if even if you believe that why because you are sicko the news were murdered here were not living in the settlements the news were murdered here were living in the regive in the area surrounding the gossip border which is ben is really territory since nineteen forty seven forty eight that is you are evil you just one jaws to die you just one just to die that is all the academic wrote on study morning what my heart is in my throat prayers for palestine is real is a murderous genocidal seller state palstinians have the right to resist through arm struggle solidarity hashing free palestine knows in the middle of the attack as in the middle of the attack a this this again particular professor she is a historical anthropologist and a documentary filmmaker she is receives research running for not the fullbright and the loose foundations bout twenty thousand people have now find petition for yell to remove it tat professor that is not council culture is not council supporting all kids seems that supporting harass supporting actual genicitle terrogroups seems that might be in a worth while for those people to not have drop i eta koala i do not feel i anybody has the obligation to hire somebody a who supports it in open terrogroup and it call me weird i justest i do not thing that i'stheir obligation meanwhile the media already shifting into the anti israel position as they con genitally were predisposed to do the bad s has now said that they are going to refuse to call homes terrace terraces john siphon who is the world affairs tat ear who as routinely use the were terrace to describe people in his own twitter account he says baby s will not be using he word terrace to describe comas terrain quit terrorism is a loaded word which people use about an outfit they disapprove a morally it is simply not the baby sees job to tell people who support an who to condemn who are the good guys and who are the badges oh is that tat a really i really i seem the word terrace has a definition but ism noticing that you do not apply that definition to actual terrorist when the terrace are murdering yes i just notice this of course follows hard on the wide spread media questions about exactly what happens there there all these people on line who are up and and this is now kind of the new normal is in the athomathof every tragedy because of institutional distress their people are do we really know that jewfish babies were murdered you we know the jewfish babes were murdered but if you demand pictorial proof here it is get ready folks theirs your morning your bout we picture of a dead baby this a babywhois our bahamas that is it that is dead chile ism to be sure not beheaded but but still dead i noticed ism obviously opus the comas that the therocay now because because this baby has the head is still tacked the body but i did notice that this baby is dead thaw that what i notice and that was baby who is who is killed for the crime of living in a jewfish community and being wish if the was that picture of the the dead baby enoghfor if it was not enough for you i have azoth have another picture of a dead baby this one charred beyond all recognition burned ism yes that this is for all of you who needed pictorial representation of dead jewfish babies in order for you to understand the evilohomas this is for you meanwhile the press immediately shifting in to context the sophistic ah the homes freedman who is a one of the world's most a moral pathetic human beings homes freemen is just gross in first all to more on in his entire career consists of going to random countries and listening to tax drivers if ever automated sober became a thing in foreign countries homes fry wen automatically be out of a job because all he does just going talks here is a man runs a peseta stand what does he have to say about form policy and now i know exiled thomasr he hasn't entire piece titled israel has never needed to be smarter then in this moment and the entire piece is an apology of for what just happened he says have covered this conflict almost fifty years overseen his rallies and passing in to a lot of awful things to one another pasting in suicide bombers blowing up his really discos an busses it is really fighter jut getting neighbors an gaze that house commas fighters but also causing massive s villain casualties let me just notice right off the bat that the go ta moral tool those are not the same thing those are not the same thing if you hit i comas target then they put kids in the comas target that is not the shame but it is you not just people doing somebody did something as than oar might say but do not work the entire articles fat out really this about n it now who this about b is bout the we relies of course well this operation was surely planned by common leaders months ago i thing's emotional origin says homes freedman can be explained in part by a photograph that appeared in the frailly press on october third well i mean that does not make any sense they say they seem planning his for two years and you say that a photo that came out october third is what to was the photo a few is rally government ministers had gone to read say arabia for the first official visit ever and there is a photo the photo is taken by the team of israel communications minister homo cart who is attending a found postal conference in read and there are conducting a prayer service one of them to a picture of a collogue wearing a traditional just prayer shaw an mica while holding up a toriscroll with the read skyline in the window beyond that photo ignite a powerful and emotional rage in many palistinians says homes freedmen israel show not pursuit piece with the sauries cause it might piss off terrace is homes freedmanstake for them that picture is the full expression of the is rally priminister benjamin sitting whose supreme goal to prove to all naysayers indeed to rub their noses in the fact that he can make piece wit the arab states even salyarabia and not have to give the palcinians a single inch we heres the thing homes freedman is in the crowd o people would rather notice piece in the middle east and see conflicts continue long as he can be proved right in his bazar notion of the centrality of the frailly palsinian conflict he wants to be proving right more than he once people to live that that that is seriously homes freedman's position in all this and that is the position of many of the sophistic at in it takes a few dead news and bunch dead people in gaze to prove that hell he is o pay with that he is look at after all's baby's fault probably it is just it is absolutely pathetic on it is face it is pathetic a best response of the dag credit too a israel president is a curing now as bug hero he that he is anon political figure in israel t e president of israel more of ceremonial figure shoreline the queen of inland or something is the ability to green light the formation of a collision government that see much all he does and that he is giving a press conference about what happen and see an en went full signed startetogma ho israel engaging in collective punishment it is collective punishment because of course when when terrace honey come themselves in is killing population it is now the job of the people who were murdered to to give up in surrender probably you let the inhumanity of your opponent make you surrender and apparently by prostrated their feet a the pritisent present or hero was having none of that here he was yesterday going after liana and in in colorful and a much deserve the fashion but listening to you apsis in the the tun little confused because a line yo say the is e bi it run e for anis very careful to to t these opinion ti in the basis but at the same time tin to hold the people o go i fossil to to try too wat to the the dint o you a than mi we and yo kitchen an you living go a ti i an mi tan that i see on a her i ton be siren i emissive from that kitchen but my creation is this if i may since the people o goo the tinooso the tune to removing a e theta by implicationthats mates the the tibia to i inti but i am not say that teonamacof clear was the something about fear and sevelian aha but with all the respect with all the rest thin if you have it ani bankitchen and you an to shoot it a t me an i about to the fend my the yes no a iran a i ti riata er smite all the bakes are an miss a poekitchen on to my children a president hers is of course exactly right about but bathe way a member of the labor party i know scars to really really good guy in i dis agree about a at politically he is on the left in israel politics he is that he was he was a lever candidate okay understand that there is no gap in israel right now the gap disappeared all those fractures they came together immediately when thirteen hundred use are murdered as well they should and the entire world you are all hypocrites let me just say that if this happened in you country if it had if it happened in the united states if it happened in triton if it happen in france it open in germany if it happened in any of these other countries do you think theyofld be sitting there saying awellla we really have to be careful about turning off the water and the power for a few days we really have to that this is we we have to such restraint we have to show we have to show let me explain something in the united states after nine eleven we town too an countries two of them we occupied afghanistan for twenty years we occupied a rock for fifteen years shows in response to three thousand dead all israel wants here is the ability to wipe out the terrorists and then to leave do you think they want to be building in gaze city they tried to hand the gosesstrip over to the egyptians just as they tried to hand over palestinian areas of judge and maria to the gordanians and yo know those country said they said know we do not want that that this this bazar notion that israel has to be held with standard that no honorable nation would hold itself to is purely antessmatic that is the only rational for this is the only ration ow no one else on earth would be talking this it is absolutely absurd it is absurd in that the amount of attention and and for harsh pressure that is put on on israel not to not to take the action necessary to secure its own future you thing hat kind o pressure's been put on you crane in terms of the human rights do you that kind of pressure is put on help china items what china does it is it is it is abvolt it is absolumadness another fact that that that it only happens one place on earth and everybody knows it everybody knows it there is not a western nation that would be held to the standard everyone knows it and what is even more appalling is that is real most and israel abides by it that is the part that is absolutely appalling talking to is rales on the ground every single day and they are getting ready to go in on the ground by foot in an attempt to minimize civilian casualties israel does that is all the time have seen footage from the i a f showing them holding off on hitting particular teargas because there to many civilians around that been doing that for years they can to right now that they need to kill the baggies n if the rest of the world cannot take it well grow the got because the reality is the news and israel are notion go quietly the news and israel are not going to acqueess in their own mass murder no one should half to is the universal human message news should not half to as they western citizen sit there and be told that your government does not have the jury and the right to protect you from mass murder in your own kitchen and the fact the dis the the culmination of decades of absurd western nonsense there is been pipe apply predominantly t israel you see it applied to the united states toes supplied to the use little bit but predominantly israel because israel lives in the neighborhood ans that means o comes a blot more often with israel but this again all the people in the media who are are deeply concerned about the humanitarian crisis in gas as israel attempts to kill terrace and simultaneously tell civilians to get out all those same people who are wore chiding israel to day all the same people if somebody came into their home and murdered their children and raped their wives and drag them off to some hellhole somewhere how much do you think they would be concerned about the temporary stoppage of water and power absolutely ridiculous well folks there lot people asking how they can help is rally citizens right now help news on the ground christian ins museums all people who are unifying to fight compass or who have been victimize by commas or both well the international fellowship of christian and news on the ground right now the providing critical essentials food medicine and other emergency supplies for vulnerable news who need immediate help they need is indeed massive and urgent its great organization they need to help right endorse of human thing about giving this great way to help outs don't please go to i f c is out or give as generously as you can write it down as i f c is out or o can meanwhile in news that is closer to the united states republicans are still squabbling over who should be the house speakers there is an internal election last night inside the inside the republican party it a imputed represent of stove scales from liana against him jordan of oho can i both these guides and noble these guides jordan was in dosed by present en trump he narrowly lost one thirteen to ninety nine now the big grommet than matter there isn't the matter is cause they still do not have to attempting votes s there till not bringing this to the floor that was just feticide who they bring o the floor as the possible speaker but an order for any of that to happen all the re publicans behind the door have to as should get together and acquiesce that whoever they picked in that election they are now going to vote for even if you vote for ordinand the words blind closed does magic an o move out for behind the close or and you are going to vote for scales and apparently they do not have that at the moment again it is a very very narrow victory scales overlord there out to hold out jordan is doing his best to up to indoors skulls he he basically signalled yesterday that he was going to he was going to move forward the now he is not clearly come out far con welter journal and publicly thrown himself behind scales but even if he would that is no guarantee because again there is a mass of collective action problem inside the re publican party all i takes is four re publicans in order throw entire house into chasing more there is why this is stupid it s the button my earthy to put in stove scales was in nearly identical voting record with my earthy and who would pursue many of the sametack posies my earthy that is the oersted si i fail to see how this advanced the ball at all which is why i oppose in the first place at stupid if you've gong to make a political machiavellian manipulation to get red the speaker the house yo better dam well have a back up plan wereyou actually winsome concessions apparently homes massy is now estimating there at least twenty house re publicans will not vote for scales on the floor he says it'll been more difficult for scales to in a majority the was from my earthy in canary some while makers were frustrated wednesday by an internal vote earlier in the a blocking a proposal that would've required the winning candidates to secure two hundred seventeen votes rather than simply hove the most lots of any candidate alias if skulls had been lobbying against the rules change s again their idea was that the winning candidate would have to be able to get a majority and there like not we will hae an internal vote for no reason and then we will try to finger it out afterward that is gone great this is this zallcan go really really well machetes for his for his own sake whole this charge he said he will support either one of them you lie crane another one has said that he would support either jordan or skulls but do not worry there are there a few people who are saying ta they will not vote for screes among them the attention getting nancy mace i duntknow why nancy makes thinks that she needs to be on camera all the time lately but tom again when you have a narrow majority one of the things that you get to do is poster and pen for the cameras and nancy makes inexplicably joined the for s of people who provided for my party's out er she did on the ground the my earthy was to conservatantes a good luck getting her on board for stove scales the other day she decided o donrigize the largest humble public servants being humble public servants and nancy makes decided to wear a m a a white t shirt with the a o a white what what would you call this shirt say ins on a blabs it is effectively tube toped snorted tube uprights really tight in indicate she she is wearing it she is wearing a white tea shirt a fairly tight white tee shirt that says that is a giant red a on it do not work gives h their just humble public servants seeking to dour biding an the the seriousness of what happens in the world bucks exposed with the idiocy of our political class is really truly something to behold e truly is unlike all sides if serious things happening the world pending regional war in the middle east it continuing you crane war global economic slowdown if all these serious things happening and meanwhile in the united states we are running a three ring circus with multiple clowns of all parties it is it is its bewildering and insane and frustrating an here is nancy mace clowning around you are a scarlet a because she is just heater price you see i ism not sure who she committed adultery with ism but do she is just heater pain she explains ism working the scarlet latter after the week that i just ha last be been i wo man a heroin bitumen i from mi to en from mi by mi's here a let the rest of the word now the country know on the f o the pop i not on the i be talisman nip been to the i bin every tingle time e tater the csc e dance as i do not answer any bin the the at on uncanny one i wastitat i only answer to the people ism i am i what then why are you doing this that then she says after the vote for close that she is cannot for him jordan and she this is is a lady who apparently just once to be on signal lot here she was on sienna you endorse to en jordan i the coming you voted for gem ordo to day if the vote for speaker word to day with yo vote for sincsiles i would not i plan on that in from get gormand on the floor i mi been very topple about ten to the last in days i fir thrown can not in ten convince vote of someone who had ten end a nice to premed conference and compared himself to avid duke i and been doing an enormous to service to the voters that i represent in south caroling if i were to do that unit gat all o this slanderous nonsense the the notion that he compared himself to avid duke is second and talk from the midnineteen nineties thous a charge that young scoleese described as cat from as similar to duke during a personal conversation with fellow fellas you will run stephany grace grace apparently neither recorded republish the statement shoe trotted out many years latercon clue going from memory accordance to stepped boss who rites about this o the bistoury independent at as far as the the notion that he spoke at a wake so premises conference she was asked not is is mintage political a shows ass to speak for fifteen minutes about taxes at a conference with a name in themidled boliticalraye she stopped he spoke he left that that is the except of this it is all tension getting crap an honestly we we've a supersuper unserious political class a deeply unserious political class if serious promise in the world we knew better class of politishem you better class people and by the way if you are voter we n better class of voter level up everybody level up start electing people who actually have some semblance of brains the rest the so continues right now we are talking with ambassador any ton on he is the former you an ambassador for israel hand over to daily wire plus to watch

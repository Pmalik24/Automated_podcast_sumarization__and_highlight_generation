welcome to the superman latponcans cuss science science pay to s for ai man druhubermen and or professor of cardiology and oplymology at stamford school of medicine to day my guest is doctor odedrichovy doctor odedrahavy is a professor of neurobiology at televise university in israel his laboratory studies genetic inheritance now everybody is familiar with genetic inheritance as the idea that we inherit genes from our parents and indeed that is true many people are also probably now aware of the called epic genome that is ways in which our environments and experiences can change our genome and therefore the genes that we inherent or pass on to our children what is less known however and what is discussed to day is the evidence that we can actually pass on traits that relate to our experiences that is right there is evidence in worms in flies in mice end indeed in human beings that memories can indeed be passed from one generation to the next that turns out to be just the tip of the iceberg in terms of how our parents experiences and our experiences can be passed on from one generation to the next both in terms of modifying the biological circuits of the brain and body and the psychological consequences of those biological changes during to day's episode doctor rosary gives us a beautiful description of how genetics work even if you do not have a background in biology or science by the end of to day's episode you will understand the cores elements of genetics and the genetic passage of traits from one generation to the next in addition he makes it clear how certain experiences can indeed modify our genes such that they are past from our parents to us and even transgenerationally across musty generations that is one generation could experience something and their grand children would still have genetic modifications that reflect those prior experiences of their grand parents doctor rihovy takes us on and incredible journey explaining how our genes and different patterns of inheritance shape our experience of life and who we are before we begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zerocostic consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd the thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is element element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar now salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called neurons in fact in order for your neurons to function properly all three electrolytes need to be present in the properties and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to emphasis in cognitive and physical performance element contains a science bactolectrolike ratio of one thousand milligrams that one graham of sodium two under milligrams of potassium and sixty milligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if have been sweating lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is elements daccom slash supermen to claim free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element elements doom slash supermen and now for my discussion with doctor odd rosary ode thank you much for being here titanic my pleasure ye this podcast has an somewhat unusual origin because i am familiar with your work but we essentially met on twitter where you are known for many things but a lately especially you have been focussing not just on the discoveries in your laboratory another laboratories but also as are mean type humor that relates to the scientific process and will return to this obit later but first of all sting its wonderful that your active on social media in this positive stands around science that also includes humor but to day whale i mainly want to talk about is incredible questions that you probe in your lave which are highly unusual incredibly significant for each and all of our lives and very controversial and at times even a little bit dangerous or morbid a this is going to be a fun one for me and for the audience just to start off very basically get everyone up to speed u because people have different backgrounds i think most people have a general understanding what genes are what are ana is and on but maybe you could explain to people in very basic terms and it'll just preface all this by saying that think most people understand that if they have two blue eyed parents that there is a higher probability that they their offspring will have blue eyes than brown eyes similarly to brown eye parents higher probably that they have brown eyes rather than blueeyes and on but that most people generally understand and accept that if they spend part of their life let say studying architecture that if they have children that there is no real genetic reason we assume that their children would somehow be better at architecture because they contain the knowledge through the dean of their parents they might be exposed to it in the home call nature nurture s a nurture in that case but that they would not inherit knowledge or other traits and today ism hoping you can explain to us why i color but not knowledge is thought to be inherited and the huge landscape of interesting questions that this opens up including some evidence that contrary to what we might think a certain types of know ledge at the level of sells and systems can be inherited that was a very long wen it opening but to frame things up what is then what is area and how does inheritance really work dean are the this is the material that genetic instructions that is containing every one of our sees we have the set of genes containing the entire set is call the gene and this is present in every sale of our body the same set of instructions and genes are made of dean and the are all they also contain a and crimsons that the are containing crimson's commersons is the dean and the proteins that condensed that end because we have a use amount of than in every sell at you need to content to thru am thread honor honaspool right use amount end you have to content and we have the same xenon the same dean in every sell in our body can i just interrupt and it'll do that periodically just to make sure that people are being carried along i sometimes find tat even remarkable that a skin sell in a brain sell a noon for instance very different function but they all contain the full man of genes and the same manougenes now it is amaze it is amazing ant perhaps it is good to have an apology t to understand how it works this is hop this is not the commercial but this is the ilia book that you have in every sell in your body then instructions to make everything that you need in your house the chairs the the the kitchen the the pictures by never in but in every room you one something else in the kitchen you one thinks that fit the kitchen in in the toilet you one things that fit the toilet you only re and remove one particular page of instructions which is the instruction of how to b the chair and this you place in the key in the an the living room and in the toilet to put in a tourist the tana is the instruction to make the the degenon the is the instruction to make everything is the car book and in every see we we takes just the instructions for make one particular furniture and this is the along this is the artiste said and then the end you will you will build the chair the chair is the proving the the the areas there are instructions to make one particular portal based on the entire set of possibilities and and this is er this is true for one particular type of area which will not bi the stale of this conversation which is messenger hone this is the rated contains e information forsaking optics in fact this is just a small percent of a of the and the sell s we have a very big gene and less than two percent of ice conincoats for this messenger have however a lot of the the the genomic transcribed to make ornate does other things some of these arms we understand and a many of them we do not is a beautiful description in i gears not espouser alpacas on that to we fair game to to us the idea catalog has as the analogy for gean the specific instructions first specific pieces of furniture is the area and the furniture pieces being approatiinstat a their mentally made from our using messengerare an it thank you for that despite the fact that the same genes are contained in all the cells of the body there is a difference between certain sell types right i will is it fair to say that there basically one very important exception which is sematic cells verses germsells and would you mind sharing with us with that distinction is so yes every sell every sell type is different because it expresses it brings into action different genes from the entire collection and assume then i tented and is we have we have resells in the legs we have sealed in the brain we have in that in the brain we have sell to the stop in f set to the cartoon in on and we can make and different the separation different e distinctions but we can make one very important distinction between the somatic sells and the germs the germs said thou supposed to be the only sells that contributes to the next narration that out of which the section nation will be made ice of us is made just from a combination of the superman inner this a two types of germsels and than the fuse and you make you youyou get one fertilized egg and out of this one sell all the rest of the body will develop and what happens in the momma which is which are all the said that are not that the germs should stain the some should not be able to contribute to the section ice this is very important and is to be one of the main bellies for the inheritance acquire rats e inhabitants of merely and on because for example the example that you gave in with the learning architecture if i learn about architecture the information is in voted in my brain and since my gran sell cant cancer in formation to the sperm an the egg cause the information supposed to reside in synaptic connection between diffenoilont in particular circus that a developed and what what would what happens the brent should not be able to transfer nexganation if an simpler a simpler example should go to the german you build up marcels that your is will will we have to work out on their own it wont the this short at not wont happened is something that we know intuitively and even if we do not have any back on in ability and this is connected to the fact that as we said tit the beginning every sell in the body has its own gene and the nectionration will only sort from the combination of the genome in the sperm and the egg even if you somehow i acquire the mutation or change n your dine in one of popticolo bran says it would not meadow because these mutation there is no way to transferase to the dine of the of the germs that that will contribute to the next nation despite that there is as you will tell us some evidence for inheritance of experience let us call it or a and here we have to be careful with the language right i just won a a put a big streets and underline in the highlight that the language around what we are about to talk about is both confusing and at the same time fairly simple and controversial right is little bit in the a in the field of longevity people sometime will say antiaging some people say longevity the antiaging folks feel that longevity is more about longevity clinics they do not that antiaging is related to some other kind of niche a clinic sometimes after proved or a government prove sometimes not and there lot of argument about the naming but it is all about living longer and living healthier in this field of acquiring traits or the passage of information to offspring what is the proper language to refer to what we are about to a discuss am there is this idea and it'll say it you do not have to that tit is pack to lama in tamarin evolution very controversial right a and may be not even controversial i think it is very offensive even to certain people this idea of inheritance of acquired traits the idea that one could change themselves through some activity use the example going to the him we could alee is the example somebody we becomes in durance runner than decides to have children within another insurance runner and has in mind the idea that because they did all this running and not just because they were by us towards running in the first place but because they of the distance they actually ran that their offspring somehow would be fabulous runners this lambrequin a concept is we believe wrong how do we talk about inheritance of acquired traits what is the proper language for us to frame this discussion we hates to be very careful i to and there many complications many a am begurits maybe could tell us while a marquis an evolution for those that do not know is am such a stained thing it is not polite for perhaps perhaps we start we just the just say that we can talk about the inheritance a quite traits confmicion of parental onset in hesitance of memory all of these things and we can also take about epegenetics and conger nation at a genetics and in to o nation to epegenetics are many terms that we need to to to make clear for for the audience the the reason that the a talks o contovella is very complicated and goes a long time even way be lama even the the reeks be talked about the inheritance a quite traits la mark is a sonata we the term but it is probably a mistake though everyone talks about including people wo stasis la mark work he published his book about a little more than two hundred years ago and he a he believed in thin inhabitants acquired trade absolutely but just any one else in his time everyone believed it it this is it seems obvious to them bey that was long before men deal and the roles of of a genetic inheritance and also men that was long before the the understanding the delays the healtheble mailer for this happened the long time ago every one believed in it including delving laving was perhaps mom lama and the amount really yes absolute right now er or getting into n an and and this is a in geisha in in the organ of the species it is in all of is right lama did not even really make the distinction between the generations he had many other reasons for being wrong but he connected the terms in helped faquir traces to evolution and this is some of the reason he that he was tell con tovessial even in his time t were other reasons for example he ejected current the chemistry and though that he can explain everything was on naris to telling fruits earthling friend water there is some people inner ne think they can discard with chemistry and explain everything ass or era when you herd and this was not only biologist was also the weather and es that was part of the reason but m la man solamag made many mistakes but it did have aka full tear of inhabitants which was a big a am step towards were we are to that to day he had important contributions nevertheless although he was mistake about the mechanism but he believed everyone else and drives the volution is the transmission of the traces that you acquire during your life over the the things that you do or don't you doit talked about use and this use of of certain organs that shape there our organ than eventually also the organs of the nextionrition he sounds a willie the a the first self help public figure right wo this idea you nones is heavily embedded into a lot of the a help and find space on the and teeter in in sereminon the internet which is that and it is ye ant the idea the were sold very early in life at this corn invite states and probably elsewhere which is that we can become anything that we want to become and that that will forever change the offspring either because of nature or nurture right and this is a very dangerous item as i explain a second and led to horrible things this is part of the reason that this is such at ta book it is not only self help thou your helping you of this help in yourself the problems with when you apple to others and this happened in a very very dramatic and horrible way an in in recent in the recent pass as i i tell him second la mark this what he believed and and he thought is what it is it this is how revolution progress procession and later an darling and showed that its really natural selection the selecting of them the people that o of the organisms that are already am that already contain the the the particular qualities out selected based on the wether they video not in particular interments and therefore the a evolution pogeys end they become more common and take one this very different two different exsleches the most common we this is a contrasted is that neck of the gels is is the classic example according to to la make the glass had to stretch their necks towards the streets to it when the creator when the trees were high and because of that the the they transmitted this traits long next to the children also had long new by the way the only mention this example i know handful of times is side really folks the and according to that i just that the agelathat would happen to be born with the long necks survive because it ate its genetic heritable material in knockabout genetics bat a are take over and the rest of the glass that have different heredeblematilas just die this natural selection kills as inhabitants for quirt there are many reasons why lamas e maninheltons are quite fate became such a return one of the biggest is what happened in the soviet union under stain there was the a scientist called thisemcle who thought that a mendellism and nomagenetics is a bourgeois science shouldn't be done and never did nomagenetics was either killed or sent to than liberia and and he thought that just i said waken not only weekend becomeyting the want but we can grow everything that we want in every field can taker frosted feel an to potato there and on and this led to massive starvation thrown agriculture in in in inn the soviet nan also wo insides for many mails and put the very dark cloud on the entire felt and only people in the eighties of something the the fix tarted to recoup fit for that a side for that which is a very dramatic thing there was also crazy stories a around and attempts to to prove the inhabitants or nitrate despite the radiation of many scientthat this is something that is very there all that normally does not haven't titties not to normal way that inhelptants work and i can a tell you about two such dramatic cases that will illustrate please in the in the beginning of the twenty century in vena there was the risalchar called pall came was a very famous and and also very color for figure who did experiments on many different types of animals he did experiments on told that called the midwife's told because the male and a carries the dheeggs and a there is a beautiful book about it from from a castle telling the story what happened them and he the there couple of types of of toads some of them live under water and some of them live intend and this gods are different in the shape and in their behavior and of course the capture capacity to live the underwater is one thing but also the the morphology an an appearance changes the the gods that live underwater develop this newpital red is black feds on their hands that allowed the males to grab on to the female without slipping formalin forbade and the one on can do not happen he claim that he can take the toads and train them to live on de water changing the temperature on all kinds of things very difficult animal to work with eventually according to camel they will acquire the capacity to live underwater and also change tho physiology in develop these new black nuptial pets of their head with this discovery he traveled the world became very famous ad a this was a just the beginning of the previous centrally and as the person who found the true for in felons forquire traces despite the controvalty and on and the n the beginning of the valuation of how it actually work with the abandon not with the any but with the am an natural selecandina can live and the and people din believing he was actually under a at of attacks but it seem convincing it the end what hammentis that they found that he injected ink to the toads to to to make them become black to have this nuptial pes o effect the results and am and could not stand up with and and the act accusations and and kill himself well in this book by castles just maybe it was it was the assisted to did tit who kilo them no no i who wejecttey to to sort of saving from because the the samples lost the coloring of something it it might be who knows what well in science whenever there is a a fraud accusation or controversy that it is not comment to see a passing of responsibility a a their recent cases their on going cases now or its he question who did what et camera i shall i two questions am a before the second story am ism struck by the idea that he was traveling and talking u'mguessing this is before power pointing keno but also before transparencies o which your actually were still in place when i was a i graduate student for those he do not know transparencies her basically am transpire a pieces of plastic papers the a that you put on to a projector and then you can write on them in dud a demonstrations but can show photographs anythings the an for house giving this talks and would he travel with the to he travelled with the seems i see and and basing this on this castle book which is on its n vercontovelsa it is more of a beautiful story than perhaps the truth but and and according to the story the had to stand one side of the lecture with his hands behind the back who i the would ex examining the seems and pass them around and but he cheated some one she he probably he probably my tat at least that that is the wat most people think ut this was not replicated i mean also i do not think any one try to replicate interning a erethism is just a point about application and actually another tragic example not but a few years ago a sack who is a as far as we knew was doing very accomplish work an am the growth of ratings great literally growing eyes in a dish i think every one believes that result but then there are some accusations about another result u that turned out to be fraudulent and suck i killed himself was s was a recent this was only but ma five ten years agar am it still happens ye ha i think it is rare butte does happen e spicily in is be hi sofa i would argue i love to know what your number is but i would argue that ninety nine per cent of scientists our speaking truth than our well meaning honest people i to talk air and a think that a even think when people are wrong it is most o become evil and trying t act the lac tat may be the really want to believe their results that all kinds of wait to be wrong in an even to a bend truth without no just a blatant fro but bat this is according to the story an example of very bad for which is ugly is rare because most sent as you said this also my opinion or just trying to to discover truth and to the best they cannot why else would you go into it because it is certainly not a profession to go into if you want to get re on the ma a its am holy not even the profession to go into if you want to get famous if you won to be famous you go to hollywood or am become a serial killer cause they will make options o please do not a but a pleas do not do either n a hollywood i suppose for some is fine but in any case am o case o cheer arounnineteen o seven nineteen o six the is is likely before the the hos get the the cotovesle boy out after the first word won of great am betters gone his toads with the am either ink or whatever capitol pads they have to go back to mating inland id to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens i lentic greens now called a one is a vitamin mineral robotic drink that covers all of your foundation on nutritional needs have been taking outlet green since two thousand and twelve some delighted that their sponsoring the podcast here's i sorry taking to lentic greens and the reason i still take out lentic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets me the probiodics that i need for got health i got is very important its populated by got my crobioda that communicate with the brain the mean system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly imp act our media and long term health and those probialics in tat ltegreens are promo and vital for macrobiotic health in addition at letegreens contains a number of adaptegens fitments and minerals that make sure that all my foundation of nutritional needs are met and it was car if you to try out lethe greens you can go to at letegreen stay come slash humoral and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix bat lethe greens while you are on the road and the car on the plain et camera and they will give you a year supply of villain the three a too again that is that letegreens take come slash humoral to get the five free travel packs and the year supply of vitamin de three a to yo so this is forget about that we have we also had that the lisanqu pissed an no that a very big thing and and then in the you as there was in the seventies and eighties preciser named jaconet i id very different experiments and he was also a character he work he worked on and he he was the joker top o than in the published many of his results in a and dona that he published that was called warms bride's casette and had many cartoons that her he started his own journal he a yes and but one way the poblishoonbut bey also publishing in in very respected e donas in pal but he was it was a psychologist america psychologist and he worked on a warm ad which i a flat warm which is called latria is very interesting s different and what will discuss to day different typoform and warms a are very comes of four out of five animals on his planets is a warm really yes n numeric its just come in the visuals we are the exception and test but but that talk about ha very different warm later this is a flat for be called planarian and it is remarkable in many ways was also a modern that many people worked on including the the fathers of of genetics at people o saloginnetics like moan they worked on in in the beginning but its very very out to study genetics in this warm because unlike us unlike what we explain beforeabouts how we all develop from superman new these warms most of the time the codes just my final there turned themselves apart they have a had and the tail and the part of the head wild just our itself apart on the tail growing new t that the head will grow in you tail the tail will grow in you have you can even cut them to two hundred pieces each piece will grow into a new warm while and and they have centralized brains with lobes everything an even is degenerate eyes he study these warms and he said that he can teach them certain things associations by carrying all at for i do not remember exactly what he needs i think it was either lights or electricity with sheikdom which will show them wit with other thingsthat he could train them to learn and remember paticulathi i get you mig get shocked on one side o the tank exactly and then avoid that side of the tank yes and then ages the question is whether not they are they rid apartselves and their subsequent generations will know to avoid that side the tank without having ever been exposed to the shock right without ever been exposed to shock over they wether the the new generation the new head will be able to remember to learn faster that is another the subtlety that you might have and and this what i said e haven't he said he can teach hem certain things re move cut off their heads and new head with all the brain and will will grow and that it will contain the memory this was the start of the controls not the end only the beginning then hi said something even much wilder which is e can train them to learn certain things and then just chop them ut put them in a blender and fid them to other wants because they are cannibalistic they eat each other and that the memory will transfer through feeling this sounds such a germanic feel and that that and by the way this this open the it people did experiments that not only in planarian but in golly fish and certain broadens and this this memory drain transfer essays enchanting train and this is in the back when they they had the an idea that some memories could be bolaculos could have a molacolafon which is very appealing almost sent since fiction you can have memory in a to and the way we think about memo no money which is somethingthat ti thisabuted in neon circus and encoded in the strength of particular sign of seas ant soon but but the idea a you can take and memory in the deceit into a molocool and transfer it around is very veryinteresting this we it is attracted many people this ended up in a catastrophe there was an energy investigation could not no one can replicate anything it was a big mess although there were always scientist to said yes we can replicate is an this they we in the a ma conman stuff was different then people thought that they could not that that that are problems replicating by it was not necessarily but some people replicate by it was not necessary about replicating the whole thing but the question was this the memory the transfer i specific or is it an governor since litigation that transmittance i like ecu imagine ha we get transmitted as a hyper sensitivity to electricity a supposed the specific location that the electricity was introduced o or even more than that even just you knower highpensis piping and in general for your more vigilant in you learn anything's fast that also poi but his problem was not the accusation it was much worse that he was tailgated by the uniform i this tollways to sent letter with boys to many scientist for fifteen years and and his assistant against assistant i think exploded than this is how his line of research ended just recently a few years t go a pistol chew from boson an mike levin and there and his nostoc tauchomrat replicated some of malodors experiment with the cutting of the head but in the very you sink very fancy equipment and automate tracking they could say that they cannot replicate some of this his e his e his experiment really and they do not open packages in that la they have they have interesting stories you should have mike over the a a familiar with s wit the best of this work now i did not realize they had don thalexye they published it yet a few years ago at this very interesting but course that that do not know how it happens the mechanism is once ma call went a step further than this and what fascinating it is that this this rtspirments ere done in the seventeen eighties hi said it can not only transfer the memos fry chopped animals but he can take there the anima that that learnt and break it down into different fractions just the deny just the arena just that the fats the the proteins the sugars and he said that the traction that transmit the memory is the arena and this is very very interesting because it was a long time before everything that we know about a unity it'll soon go into myriad explain what wat we do and then you see that you can actually feed worms with out any an get and and have anythings happened this is everyone noises truly this why was appealing to to go back to that and unstudied by the way at the time it became pocolal knowledge everyone knew this experiments of the the the starlike episode about it from eighty for the the are comics books about the books about it this was very and people were eating ulna caught the thought that's rein in memory this was first complete nonsense but but this was it made a old of noise in tsars she s part of the reason it was talksick until recently you could not touch because it i it was considered solo signs likes since e came not this was the something you very tiny one a touch toy and and then we go back to to to this the studies about inheritance of memory in health's of acquire trade in other organisms and in memelsin in in invent and a side from the dark cloud the this an episodes left the were all also theoretical problems why or of why this cannot happen serial that have to be breached for this to habit and you and you can talk about many different types of burials a and and and you can also envoy down to two main berlins first feria we mentioned it this is the separation of the soma from the german by the somatic sells they cant change in response to experience the sperm and the egg the called germsells cannot the was the idea oh their i lated on what happened in the som the man who wo first thought about this serial is called wireman sorgos wise mends wot in the nineteenth century it is called to day the wise man bear suppression of the som from the german only the gremlins transmitting meticton nextionration and this is also called the second law biology this is very very fundamentals natural selection is the first one titis an second because it important to how we work to how our baby's work wise men by by the way thought that if you will have direct influence of the environment on the germsels than perhaps is could transfer to the nextionration it he was as strict as his martial suggest but the but this not out most people remembered but e thought that this is unnecessary it it is possible that natural selection can expand everything and he compared to to a as e a boat which is in the ocean it is sailing and it has a sail open so we do not have to assume that it has an engine the wind is blowing don't have to a smother thing the natural selection might be enough this barrier is still send in but not entirely it is rich in some organic we will go into that into second the other barrier is the the now we have to to expo understand other bill we have to talk about epigenesis we have to define epigenesis and what it is and epigenesis is another tern which people misuse horribly and about everything that is apigenetics even people from the feet that that the the then the word itself that the term was defined in the fortis by a wedding onion for notwellington and he talked about the intersection between genes and that and and the product that act that in in the end bring about the cenotaph of the consequence and how genes influence development later people discovered mechanisms that are that that a change the action of genes that fan mechanisms and early talking about the as epigonatics for example the then is built out of four basic elements is o the then the there eighty gillies r and that can be mot chemically modified in addition to just the information that you have in the sequence of the tana you also have this h information in the modification of the basis the most common modification tits been stall modern others is modification of the later sea of cytosine mutilation tradition of a metal group to the very and and and this can be a replicated s after the the the thin a the sells divided and a replicate genetic steal in certain cases also this chemical modifications can be added on and replicate and be preserved for those wo are a as familiar with thinking about genes a engine structure an pigeon as could we think on these himation fore a cleat basissegiaty am but could we imagine that a three things matellation a for taking the primary colors and adding a changing one of them a little bet changing that the hew just slightly which then opens up an enormous number of new options of colored i in tahini just more combinations more ways more ifomition there are the modifications of dean and also there the modifications of the forties which condensed the deny that are called pistons they also modified by many different chemicals again mutilation is very common and modification a ventilation even serotonin the selotonilation of o pistons craton this is a newspaper from nature from a few years can change dean that the not the deinitself but the potion that condenses essentially how am in the analogy use before of a of how the thread is wrapped around the spool special yes and and this determines that the the the gree of con sensation of the dean whether the gene is now more or less excessive at and therefore can perhaps be expressed more or less this is this is one way to effect that the gin expression and and bring about e function of the get a many addition fence not the only one thence people when this was when all of these was starting to be lucid an people talked about epigenesis they started taking about these modifications forgot the origin of the phonation and when people said epigenesis they talk about mutilation and thinking and am again to just frame the subset we can imagine two identical twins call on as exotic twins am we in go a step further and say that the monochorionic and they were in the same posantol a was twins can be raise in separate salty different early environments would say those two twins are raise separately one experiences certain things on the other other things they different foods et camera and there is the possibility through apigienary mechanisms that through matellation fascination am seratonean production et camera that the expression of certain gives in one of the twins could be amplified relative to the other i a ye we know that even i totally identical twins genetically the identical but the they look different and the are this if we we experienced we all experiences and this is this can happen the cause of these epigeneticchanges i or e can happen because another mechanisms because genes response to the environments genes do not exist in a vacuum there are a engines are need to be activated by conscription factories an the the whole the the to the lot of machinery that is responsible for making gene's function we are a combination of our genetic material and the endowment when people talk about epigenesis and talks that talk just about the modification there also not exactly right my dephoenition of epigennetics is inheritance with o cars other cops sell de vision o mites thingy also for dish cot us now accostienerations not because of changes to the dean secrets by but through other means i think this is the the the e most e roast that the phenicion that that allows you to understand what you talking about and then again and and then and then the question is if this happens then what are the molecouset actually transmit information acoscinations ale they that the chemical modifications to the dean o to the contains that condense dean his the other mode ado agents the transmitter information and which modecotscion it and i actually think that the most interesting plains to day a alanemolecus but before i go into that i just one say that when we talk about the ballads to apigonatic inheritance of the bellies to inheritance of acquire trade in addition to the separation of the summer from the german we discuss the other main bell its called epigeneticarypogomin which is that we acquired are the ourselves that the the genetic lateraling in ourselves acquires all kinds of changes this chemical changes modification with discuss but these modifications are largely erased in the transition between generations in the german in the in the the he superman the egg and most o in the erlyamprio most of them the modifications are removed we can start the blank slave base on the genetic instruction and this is costal otherwise according to the theory is not clear that actually true because in some organisms dos really happen we will just we will not develop according to the in species typical genetic instructions to preserve this we we raise the mate the the all the modification western on you and this is inimemas and inhuman this is loudly to most of themnifications on the in the sperm an in the a removes tom about ninety percentile somebody man which could be invest to the idea finershan correctly is that there some advantage to wiping the slate clean and returning to the original the a plan in in the connects of the ice of furniture analogy on the instruction book is the one tat tissue to everybody o care every cell right only certain instructions are used for certain cells say a skin caller an or honor of the vircellor on any other cell for that matter through the course of the life span of the organism the specific instructions are adjusted somewhat o case maybe a like o furniture i sometimes u they send you seven at eight of particular screws where they send you the proper number but you put them in the wrong place and it for changes the way that the thing works a little bet once that assuming furniture could r produce a but hearing the analogy the furniture as as the cellar or the organ in the makes with another organism that needs to be replicated and the ideas to take the instruction but go through an a race all the penal pencil marks race all those additional lo modifications that the the owner use were introduced to it and return to the original instruction i because if you want the bring back the instruction boo curate to have all the potential to recall the furniture you now months to be restricted to the money that you made n the particular room it is essentially the opposite of acquired traits an caraterissix based on your a but we say in algin a get speak lineage base experience away your parents experience write in some ways we want to eliminate all that and go back to just the genes they provided yes but it is more compliant more compliment that because we have some very striking examples even cnemis worse some of them of the marks are maintain for example classic examples imprint imprinting is a very interesting phenomena and the the way they works that we you you inherit an a copy for every common from you made and yo fade and then you have in every cell of your body two copies if you are human an of everycoms and then every genius represented twice these are called alias the different versions of then then the though es that once you and the in the nectioneration the two copies that you inherited a are equal it does not mete whether you e inquire inquired and from yo made or from yo fader rife there are some situations were indies met there's there's the limited number of genes the in pro a called inprintences we it does mete wether you inherited from your made o yo father and and this is happening through opinion that the conheritancs from not because of changes to the veanisequence wit because of maintain maintenance of this a coma chemical modifications across to and as i recall from the beautiful work of gathering dutch have that especially in the brain there is evidence that some cells contain the complete venom from mam or the complete senior from that and it can also switch during your life for her works show that a early on in in in your life it is different whether you express that the maternal patella cope than manor e more and math parents and children take note for those were either saying o o the child is more you or more me that can change across the life men and if your thinking about your parental lineage and wondering whether not you potency inherited some sort of trait am from mother or from father it can be of course both or can be just one or just the other which i think most parents tend to see and describe in their children from time to time that is just the father that is just my frendsrattent but it is important to know that in this situation they've environment played no world this was just whether it pas to the mother or the father snot that the something that happened to the meadow of the father affected this is slightly the question is now can they environment change the helitbanty it is very important to understand that there is a difference between next an nature and this is very confuse and people are re its killer sutler or portable people tell me i am growing horses for many years and i just know that this horse has a particular a character it is very different from from the other house and this is epigenesis inherit no it could be just genetically determent yes this horse inherited a different set of genetic instruction it is differed does not have to be about a pigenitics epigonetic inheritance a a means that the environment of the parents somehow changed the the the children and there a there are these two main burials that a feels that batternects that we have to think what type of molecool and how they can be laughed one possibility is that this really this limited number of comical modifications that vive and which is about ten per centals the could be very interesting not a small number not a small number but perhaps perhaps this is one one possibility the other possibility that the are other mechanism the the situation now in aments is that is just really unclear what transmit if it can transmit on which coequal at we talk later about other organism where it it is a at more clear but in moments any memos in general there are many examples for a environments that change the children whether they the you need to involve an epigenesis mechanism to explain this phenomena this unclear first wat because it is how to separate news nature from your and second because the am the mechanism as just not understood there are classic examples for in segments there were peers of famine starvation in different places in the world in the netherlands in china russia were people did use epidemiological study to study the next generation than the the children of women who were starved due and e pregnancy are different t if in in many ways they have a the different e birthwort a local sensitivity and also some horological change a higher changes of get some horologic an disease and this has been a shown a in very large studies is there ever a into use which starvation or hardship of some kind some challenge a sensory challenge a or survival was challenge led to adaptive traits yes there are in different organisms it could be as a result of a trades they could be a downside as well at for exampedor to exec i the coming to mine one of them is that i feu street man in i mirror or or rets i do not remember this work of saber mans investigate switzerland if you stress the male can do its in many different ways and i do not remember exactly how they did but you cat you can you can separate then from the models you can do shall defeats all kind of things then the next an erections a lest see e show less anxiety to the threshold for stasis hirer yes however i think they have memory the tests and and ado ye abolecroach may be in advantage for dealing with strait could be i do not have any direct evidence at there some there some simmering ideas that u know our ability to anchor our thoughts in the past present to our future seems very adaptive in certain contacts in other contacts that can keep us ruminating and not rite in a rat adapted present to our correct tan the example is that e an nit dicot in exposure this thing the work of e orliverando i from fumes is i am i from to mistaking in this are not my studies but they improve that the tolerant to exposure to situla brags in the next oration the interesting thing here that its very nonspecific you you treat them with nicotine but then in the next nation there ortolan an to victim but also to ado tin cousin coven or that for make sense to me because a the obvisin nicotine am activates the coonergic system that oponergic system at peneferin and et camera am and you can imagine that there's cross over because other drugs who cane in firemen mainly target the catacomb men said the dope men in nope and a fen in in in in this particular study if remember cacti they show that these happens i heritable effect even if you use an antagonism to blow the nicotine thereto well it something more about clearance of xenon bayotics and an hepatic functions that is transmitted in this very non specific what i love about all the examples you given to than and especially that one is and i hope that people a you just listening am smiling because biology is critic sometimes he know h the the obvious mechanism is rarely the the one that is actually a para and dam a people always ask or why is it us and i will say you do not the something i know for sure that i want consulted the design face and if any one claims they were than you deadly i wanted back away very fast and the and the could de show many trades many tret for for escape i stay in also o the many and many other pit stay effect it bear in in warmth we will go e go deep into that in e second but and show that when you starve than the next iterations an leave longer and this i think would be a trade of i other things m fertility the exoneration are for thick and first an an an less fir than petepticles of dead they leave long the could be so necessarily a soothing i do not draw you of course i cause this is magnificent what you are doing in and and a splaying out for us here but to recall there is a few years ago at actually ended very tragically you was an example i think it was down in santiego county there was a occult of sorts that were interested in am living forever and they a castrated the male self castrate themselves in the idea that somehow a maintaining some up prepubescent state or reverting to a judo prepubescent state would somehow extend on cavity the idea that am sexual behavior somehow limited life spend this has been an idea that's been thrown around in the cold more wacky on charity communities am they also shave their heads they also wore the same sneakers but then they also all committed suicide right as the hell bop comet came on town am but that is just but one example of many cults aim that sort of a that obviously was not life extension that was life truncation but am aimed hat kind of eternal life for some sort of a through colonic restriction that is right this this call also is very into the whole idea that by through colonic restriction we can live much longer which i may actually turn out to be true i think it still debated am hence all the debated by interview fasting et camera but also a it is known if you over eat you shorten life this is this is clear it is known that big bodied members of a species live for a shorter life than smaller embers of a great converses or a chiao for instance there is some let you sir of shards of truths in all of these things but i it seems to me that the real questions a what is the real mechanism and and why would something this exist right and why questions are very dangerous big you are hi right but but very interesting goes and and when it comes to ma abolecchanges and nutrition the numerous examens well you i the overdid or star and gets effects in the nextinorations many of them that sometimes the effects contrast depending on the the way you do this andagain the are none of we do not do any of that in memos but people show that starving or overfeeding the mothers all the fades changes the body's of the the next information and also theblucostolerant and an other and an also ta productive fixes and them and and the defect that the is an effect that there t that something transmit the is clear the question is how meticulous is it and whether you need not knew by youligenepigenetics to explain why do i mean by that if you effect the exoneration it does not necessarily has to go through the right or the per and involves the epigene you change the metabolism of the anymore as it developed and of is it will it a effected the when you for example a starves women the talk pregnant as happened doing the the the this famousans starvation study the the the bad is already into exposed directly to the internet it is not even inheritable effect the baby is itself that affected its a directessec the investing important than has many implication and it will be separate from the deegenetic should have to take it into account to on to stand what is going on does not require necessarily new biology and you you biology of inherits not only is the embryo affected the embryo whitely tutor already has geysers it is also the regenerations or is directly exposed and you do not get any new biology necessarily to explain it and it does not have has to involve in atepigenetics or exigent xi is clear to me that in the female feeders they total number avens that she was some day produce potentially i have fertilize by sperm exist but the males with ha sixcydays arm psycho an leas me the question to an female males a males as fetuses living's fuses innermost already shore producing sperm for its the primordial selves that give rise to sir is i am not the enexposo don wonder going to the details of exactly wench in member but but yes exposure of the of the mother also affect the eventually the the the the transmission of the father of genetic information for the sperms father and there also many examples of just resting the fades affecting the sperm and affecting the nextionration there if you go to the extugenas if you got generations down the road not to the kids but to the grand it then it is a real epigenatic effect because e because you you examine something that happens although the the nextionaty was was never exposed to the original challenge when we set about epigenesis inheritance in through the paternal lines through the wanders we talk about and two generations and when you go to the mother its regeneration to talk about to to when you need to and invoke some real epigenesis mechanism and there the evidence becomes much more scars invent there are exempts more of less convincing the find is i involving and improving a lot for example now to and many people use the the cutting ages to use ivies in it of mobilization or trance of empress to make so that you actually t the is the heritable information not the environment e o and that it goes through the germ line this is something that is being done out there are study geometer prepared idea for they take the deny from mom the sperm from than they take the deny from moment put it into a novel side of one or know not at all y u who just you just take the sperm and transfer it and fertilize t at the the the an anew a standard idea yes the under i weigela you can do it in many different ways but is i did that you separate that the the environment a the endowment of the father from the inhabitants on he old envoy of the father and a to to control and separate nature from me that the enlarge becomes the culturagese yes the filly is is improving people do experimented have a higher ends or more replicates and better controlled and there are some example for effects that transfer and it depends who you ask whether people believe it or not many genetics do not believe it and many people do elite and it depends on the community the strong resistance for many reasons some of them are are justified some less justify than are part of the scientific causes and how things work because it its its a new its challenging the dogma for this is very interesting on its on if you as psychologist many psychologies believe that this have able trow mind and thing ta population genetics less this really depends and i think that we are just at the appointing time will we do not really now whether it happens at to what extent and when it dig studies even if you think about normal just genetic studies where people trying to understand the genetic under opinion of a complex traces m any think that involves the brain pretty much we now know that you need to stay many many many people now this big xenon wide associations studio biogenetic a studies involve hundreds of thousand of people now one did an elements that is for oogenetic much rumor complicatebecause you need to also taking to account the environment an to if i know am not even sure we know how to design such an explemet is very very challenging the part of the resistance resistant to the idea is based on to for to theoretical grounds because of this baryes and because of the of the controversies on the other hand there is people really want to believe it people really want to believe it because it sorts of gives your life meaning if you can change you will be biology three changing of of your kids you changing your bigot solo psychologically i can understand why many people want is to heaven even shredding a the same as the rhinitis he wrote a very important book in forty faults this was before them the double he lies an the and i that it is call what is life this is actually a book that was drove many by physics to establish molecolobiology is very very important and he talks about the heritable rutilant also tons about evolution and is said unfortunately la calcium or inhabitants of a quietfatis untenable does not happen an i ye rights this very very said or unfortunate because unlike albinism or natural selection which is gloomy does it matter what you do tenectionation will be borne based on the instruction in the sperm and thee does not met you cannot influence of course you can give your is money an education but you cant by logical interested you can also am one thing a fascine by for a number of reasons is partner selection i mean in some ways we think o we we on i find some one who is deer kind that does seem to be by the way the primary feature least in a the date i tell us we davedbostsom apart casts om how women men that people or kind there is also resource potentialeres also beauty or i aesthetic attraction these an males and females et camera i mel male female female as the case may be but interns of re productions german a male female obviously were selecting for a number of traits but presumably subconsciously we are also selecting for a number of traits related to vigor and in the idea that if we were to have offspring with somebody that those traits would be selected for and we actually we a work on that inmates that it'll be happy to tell you about in h second after we be heal o the dating and a the date dealing in warmth we and and and were we understand the mechanism and and well going to that e in a second but the or in a few minutes after we we we diving to the warmth but the but yes the thou original am calculations of how population genetics work to simplify things in to do the mat wit mud be as it was random mating of course it does not work that complicatthings because we know and are this mesas per about potential capacity to somehow sense imuncompetability in things that which is i do not know ism not an expert on that but and the neither my but my understanding is that of course were familiar with the other traits we belike for a potential nurturing ability whether not some one is reliable predicts something about their nurturing ability in for offspring potentiaemin that you can draw lines between these things without any a direct evidence but but they seem logical right that somebody kind we might also stick around or be honest in these kind of things the at hey make sense but that one would be selecting for certain biological traits a man function or am some other form of robustness that were not aware of is i think of fascinating fascinating area of biology as this is were that the the the working meals spend however does also one addition of think to to mention which is that on top of am pemican to dislocations to the denim and am an reporting condense tat the inawhich are called pistons there also other mechanisms at might contacting formation including transmission betweengionrations of alary and there different types of agave not just the arnyth we mention before the messenger lagan which imposes for been formecio for making potion but so are ones the tregulatgian expression and this is and i think that in recent fears also in the mammalians feel a array as the morlicote was the potential to cosmetic formenchbetween information to sent state i think this is the cabinet and a lot more to understand can no bat one has a lot potential for doing that as we will explain son but we have to go to worms first thank you for that incredible over view of genetics and area and i epigenatics and was essentially a survey of this very interesting am and on the face of it e complex field but you simplified it a great deal for us in our transition to talk about worms i would to plants o flag in the a in the humoral lab podcast and say that what we are about to discuss is the first time that any one on this podcast has discussed called model organisms i may have mentioned a fly paper here there a study on honey bees and catheter and a flower preference at one point but typically that is done in passing and we quickly a rotate to humans i know that many if not most of our listeners are focussed on humans and human biology and health et camera but i cannot emphasize enough the importance of model organisms and the incredible degree to which they've informed us about human health especially when it comes to very basic functions and sells right any one could argue okay that and there is been some debate telemetry and mine to that really lead to the same tor of data on human locate there are the those cases certainly but model organisms are absolutely critical and have been and basically and for most of what we understand about human health before we am start to going to the description about worms per say could you just explain to the a general audience what a model organism is right they are not modelling they are not posing for photographs obviously am what what that means and what some of the general model organisms are and why you solaced were elate to work on a particular type of worm to study these fascinating topics that in there is zero question also take place in inhuman at some level it is it is a as a real pleasure and an onto represent the model organisms here am really happy just for that is is jobsworth it an because as yous modelorganisms i extremely important and we learn much about about biology through them that the modelorganisms mean that it is an it is an organism that many people work on does the community of people at work on people work suds many tafoganis but notaround everyorganisms o a huge community o reselselves that combat a combine fossas to crate all the the we says t the tools and t understanding that accumulates there as just a handsful of modeloganisms in the his in the short history of the field of bios not long we learned about every special violate through them including many important diseases a human diseases and these are a e call li bacteria age which is a virus of bacteria am flies warms they are called feeling ants namatotis is what we stud in the lab fish which are called tebofish the portico danio dealers ritual and and of course there also modeloganis tempi and mouse and am and also a plans important plans the most imstudyes money is the rob does an perhaps less nowadays but none human primates maniac monkeys marmoset squirrel monkey in these i i do not know exactly how to the phenicion is but managing modelogans the many of modeloganines day melting and there communities at font including us up around the flanalia that we mention before the flat worm that re generate is the great modern for studio the generations if we could developed new heads would be incredible and we can learn from this organic and the reason that we can learn a lot also about humans by studying this animals is that we all ever for the same ancestor we stalled we shared we share a lot of our am our functions with them and also lot of our genes feelegants and and they have the different modeloganisms have different at vantages that herb us they an they sometimes have some things that are much more apparent in them we can study for example learning in themoway was largely studied in the beginning in snail a plea when many of the discoveries were made because it has big not one that you can easily study and d an example ayes sails learn as they learn even the elegance the at this nematodes that we study learn and the a mut simple de e another important reason to sending them of course as the can you car actually experiment on them we cannot do this to humans the thing that we do to this animals am and we can change their genes tho all kinds of thinks tote and in some aboard interrupt in some cases think you're going to tells forinceance and seelegancs in particular they what the presence of particular selves types is stereotype that you can look at several different worms than you can they at the community of people that study elegance's literally numbered and named each neuron that two laboratories on opposite sides of the world and publish papers on the same nor on knowing that it is the same noon under lo different laboratories something that is extremely hard to do in any mammalian model a mouse or a certainly in humans and a as posed huge she ones that of give great ranges to studies of things reliant has seeling at this is the star now of of but but and and this wot what we study these are megaton small warms round warms that the just one million along you cannot see them with the naked i have to look undo the scope where i they live in in the natural world they tithe used to call them going them a tout but this not really true the them in many places but the most in in rotten fruits and lives and an you can find them in the ground as well but you can also find them and and are three living the not parasites but you can some time also find them in snails but but the best way to isolate is from rotten fruits i the idea the not parasites i only we will gets lose squeamish abutnushion herbicides we has o they are not presides there really fund to handed because small and easy just grow them on plates with ever and else i but tear this is what they eat in the lab you can to speak them with ta am with a smaller pick why pick move them around and change the the urgent and do many things o them but but they have many advantages for nolo sits and to studying in heathens as you mentioned they have always certain number of sets and the but seeling at them a to always has nine hundred fifty nine set in its bad that is it can't nine hundred and sixteen no a nine fifty a the nine fifty nine and out of which three hundred and two are morons always three hundred there is the use debate now overeater on whether it is three hundred two or three hundred i gamin either one a get into trouble lo we but people take this very very and hard i think it we hundred to but i less not get into because it'll get into grab when we can equilibrate all things here by you say three hundred two granted your far more informed than the small organism that i am forever will be it'll say three hundred and then were balance in terms or arms in politics in the we elegant its an its always the same and each anyone has a mane you said and we we not only does every noon has a name many of t of them we know what they do there is a am a few sells that our sensory morons that the a sens particular chemicals in served situation we know that the and chemical will be sent just by one noon thar the motonoyons and intone not of et we know how many doom coyotes there and cottony not and we know them all by the name not only that we know how they are connected to one another we have a met a connection since they eights a subway met tells us which no one talks with which ado noons and it is the same it was used to think to a people thought the it was exactly the same between genetically agandthe consorts now we know that o slip different as but by loud it is the same and we have a met of old method we can use to study the called connect the connect not only that the wars out transparent we can actually see the no ones fire using particular tut and we can activate genes and slogans using of to genetics i a was discussing on the pottos we can make the warmth go for or backward or lay a new by shining different wave of long of of life on them and we have very powerfulful a toots for manipulating them brain on top of that we have great understanding of the genetics of the one of of the gene this is seeling at is the first any me to have its sequel its venom sequels before you for that of forever material and m and we know that and each warmth producing each father houses about two hundred and fifty babies wench are almost genetically identical we cans and and we know what we get wat were we grow them the the vomit is very control of the we grounding in the plate we just bacteria we can easily separate tween nature and next and and one thing that i wonder about often is generation time even am the nicer not humans me have certain manages because their million species you you cannot do all the and raisin things you can do in we elegant and mice but one major issue with miles that the generation time is somewhat long in part mice they mad you get amounts a litter of mice twenty one days later might semyoce a that is only twenty one days or but if you are grades sour postoctrine o do a project i mean that can extend the time to do experiments out three or four years cowherd what you can do in seal your absolutely rattish is on f the major advantages the generation time in pelicans is free days freedoms you can do hundreds of warm generations in one piety is very important not only that ever warmth we will produce hundreds of ponies you will have the augeneticaly identical you have rate statistics for your experiment and the worms probably do not mind living on these agar plates in munching away on cold were am is the wood it is questionable whether not mice or at certainly a listen i i i a proposing of well controlled a over and as long as there's overside an animal research it is necessary for the develoman of treatments of diseases that that am hinder humans but it is always a lit bit of of a of a kind of a a cringing go kind of thing when you are dealing with with mammals that are living far outside their natural environment you i be lying if i did not say that it it gets to you after a while and if it does not get you can of a her wonder about your own psyche a bit i i also think that this is important but for me it is much easier to work on warmth an do not have to i no e feel bat about it yet they are happy at there happen t yo also a means if if or warm dies its can less painful to the human than i an other more sensitive than ma a the a i would argue yes i agree yes the the are many adventures for studying serin and in the warm we now have very bodies and clear cut proof that there is inhabitants of acquire trade much that i do not think that any one pretty much in the aplanatic feel argues against it well and in large part thanks to you and the work you have done could you tell us what was the first experiment that you did on seel against that confirmed for you that there is inheritance of acquired traits because of course i the best experiments and experimenters am always set out tit disprove their hypothesis and when the hypothesis survives despite all the control experiments and poking i proving in the attempts to contradict oneself then it is considered ta victory but it is one that you have to be we all have to be very cautious about enjoying because a of the tendency to want out our hypothesis to be true what was the first experiment where you were convinced that inheritance of acquired traits is real the first experiment i did was when i in my post she did with olivohopetin subversive colombia and we set to fast wether warms can podusprungenration a for long men wulipatination tit resistance to filses while this is a very pertinent hate which is relevant e and and warms these warms do not have dedicated in ounces we do they do not have desmids or beats they defend themselves for vises very efficiently using arena in fact when we started these experiments there was not any natural vile that was known to infect the elegant which is amaze convulses are very good as we all experience now in infection and the the arms a resistant to misses because of a alanymol could show anymollcuds that testy vises and these are called smolelanis now we need to discuss them for i explain my experiment in am two found and six two creatures that were studying elegant and to finland and called me lo gat the noble tries for showing that there is a mechanism the reroute gin that happens for smollalanies but they have shown it that if you in jet the warmth with any molecules with are which are doublesterindid they lead to the she to to they shut off the gins that course spent that that match sequence to this lend so sort of like taking the specific instructions for the coffee table from your idea a humbug and you in set a copy of that into the book and in doing you prevent the expression of a you serve a rase the original page perfect explanation perfectlyssonation and for for they found it doubles tendarane arnethe to two strands is what starts the response leading to the production of small garland monitors which are the one that actually find they messenger agave and leads to is destruction silence you do not get protincitiem for that they got the noble price after people found that this is conserved in many organisms including humans and now they are now drugs this was only in two found six that the noble prize paper was publish in ninety eight they are now drugs that use this mechanism also in you innocent n o just interjection say that not only is a a recent discovery and an incredibly important one but any firing cragmaler also really nice people be gigs have me very nice people an crimes and excellent am i thing is a greet server a when i s at the only time when bedewing person was at a meaning in her a black eye and i tho car well i guess his also ideas her something but turns but he a tan the kit german am scientists actually do things other than am a do the laboratory a noble price whining scientists tads o c a that you continue thankful along incredible scientism they were also am studies in many organisms on the mechanisms of how this happens it is called grenade till slap are note interferes in the expression of a get in the in the function of a gin and it was also call get silencing because this ares infolds the silencing o gene instead of that yin being expressed their silence and you do not manifesto function already in the paper the first paper that they published about this where they have shown the doublestendaranes watch leads to the silencing to the control they have shown too well important things one of them is that if you inject the warms with doubles andarane you do not only see the action in the sell that you inject that or in the tissue that you injected tut you set all over the worms body spreads it was not exactly clear what spreads but was clear that its spreads you see the silencing all over the body this includes also the germsonsso if you injected able stendarane just to somatic says even to the head you will get also the effect in the serves and in the next generation in the immediate coin in the sane generation the the is this was really clear poof that this is inherited however this is just one generation an this originals than later the shown something which will immediately remind you what i told you about with planarian that you can just take warms and fid them on bacteria that produce this doubles tendarana and that the daubison and the silencing did t e move for the sight of injuscient from the gat wit the bacterial eaten to the rest of the body and also to the nextenaration before we light when i mention the cannibalistic experiments of second with the planarian and now you see that it can happen and and this is not contovasa to this is being done mutiny every day by any selling ants biologist in the word this has been alien a millionaire not only that you can also feed planarian is other worms we arena just put it in shop liver and let them eat it and again is will silences throughout the body wild and this is what we do tiny we always when we want we use this technic to see what gins do if we want to see whether poticuloginis important for a certain behavior oo but a certain than something the way to study is is to neutralize the get activity and we do it by just introducing the worms with doubleton faraway that correspond in sequent that mention sequent thiamin this well lead to the silencing this activate the gins activity and then we and if then that that the effect stops we know this genius is involved in the n and we never wanted just examine one worm we feed the father with dabstandarone and then we examine all of its colder we can have the statistics over hundreds of worms or thousands of worms this is validated and not contovosa norland totally cousin is it fair to say that meconal's experiments am chop blending up these worms regrafhicimage pending up these worms and then a feeding them to other worms a planarian that those experiments can yes be explained by an double stranded a nay which and through our name eventually it has not been done yet we are working on it an miles now in clovers in with other less was it was not publish but ye as this this could be the explanation i m file and below i this experiments some other people ti this experiments when i started my work a wanted to see whether in atrial to artificial daublestandarana some natural trade can can also transmit costionations because of arena to the smorlones it because them injecting our a ire an in intrsordernfering a is that is or an in a putting worms in to environment with an abundance of inhibitory areas as an experiment is very different and worms experiencing something and then passing on that acquired that to their offspring and it is let's a world a part in my opinion it as ones in or manipulation the illustrates an underlying principle the other is something that infer o curs in passage of an of generations just naturally we going from the lest subdificient to the mortises and that the advantages just i modeloganisms that the moraltificial it is the visit is to exactly what you did just now i thou dos one fact o you can follow the result this has always the trad what i did was in allies let is to see the the the magic part of the magic for the worms resistance to vises is the capacity to transmit in formation in the form of alanemorcus in hibitoylane focus to the nextionrations and it has been shown before in elegance that the worms vas this filses be using this mechanism this smaller anas in fact this is probably the reason that the smaller an is involved in the first place too that rid of vile sens and aver an parasitic genomic elements and and this is a mechanism to fighter and what i i did is a very simple experiment i took worms and i infected them with the vows when you do this this also has been shown in the pass the worms destroy the vows we them on state this very clearly using ta a florescent vows when if the it if the vow supplicate successfully the worms as turns gran a green and if the arms is destroyed the worm stay black this very simple sell clear cat not this you do not examine the woman as squhether it feels good you just see the green binary respond yes si and we we took worms we infect them withe flowering vows they destroyed this also has been done in but then what with it is we new realize the machinery that make smaller anise in the the ascendents of the worms they can not make smallernas from the start on their own because they just do not have the genes that you need to to make the colones and then we ask when we will what we happen will will effect these worms with the vows will they be green or black they cannot make their own smaller is they cannot protect themselves on their own the only way for them to stay black for have them not having the vow supplicate as if the inherit ta smaller nets on the pe and this is exactly what happens all the worms proving although they do not have the get that is needed for making the smalertanas i black they sign the vows and this also continues folodition an generation they the parent worms affectively put something in to the lunatic instructions of the offspring that would afford them the but called an advantage in this case wet afford them an advantage if they were to be confronted with the same thing that apparent work tact and we know exactly what this advantage is that the inventive is are shall areas that match the viral xenon then just shop up that virus in the nextioneration and we can identify the smaller tanks in that the iipitoagonas in the dessentence although they do not have the machinery to make it just because in ha we can identify them by sequence i i a sinquittinguich is theanysequeting youactually get the exceesinuents of the alanine was and we can see that they correspond to the for and they have the inherit small anas only the bite tenants wo infected with them their specificity there the sinspecifi yen's not some just general a resilient passage fact i have to be careful in drawing in analogy that is not correct and i want acknowledge that what i am about say with certainty cannot be entirely correct but the the analogy that comes to mine in mama's is this idea that if one generation is stressed that their offspring may in some cases have a higher street threshold resilient distress i can imagine why that would be advantageous either parents have a hard life they have offspring and they want their children to have a higher threshold the strassbi a stresscan in habit reproduction et camera and though i say it they at the end of the day and at the end of life a evolution is about the offspring not about the parents and every species pretty much seems to want to make more of itself in protecting young one way or another either through nature or through nurture this is a nature base protection of young is it fair to say that in themamalin experiment with a passage or stress razilients that it could be are in a based that that would be for abs set some new threshold on lucacorticoid production here am speculating but and i want a highly in em speculate mi am speculating with a reason chichis i think for people that a hearing about this in worms you do not a beautiful a job of splaying out we a monlorganisms are really important but to think about how this may operated in our the passage of human generations i think it is a reasonable thing to entertain right and and if it is true that also ai in a memos now arrases in smaller anas or linden candidates for simply that couldmediates the condition of of es protection or also of harmful effects the cone between the nice perhaps are do it however in warms the ares have one more tried that we do not we do not know the equivalent memos et this is something very curia that we show in that public without paper in the felt paper which is the affect that i describes this transmission of resistance to filses through the areas doesn't only affect the nextionration it also of eat mufti pe addition an energy it gets past it get past and you a her at myself how does not it get dilutes why we wisest it diluted i because i mean every one produces two hun fifty babies you delete by than fifty and if something is diluted for forgenevations it is two hand fifty times to lifted of the formications is the dilution of four billions completely omopatic would never work the there is nothing left the secret of these worms is that they e have a machinery for umplyfind the smaller an i inevigenation this is called agave dependent alenapolinas its a complex which uses the arena to find and once it finds the messenger or an a just great many many many many smallerante they do not get diluted than the pass on position of generation and this is the the trick we later also identified genes the regulate for how long an effect would lest otherwise and if if in beginning we ask why it dos how does in it stop a the on iteration now we have to ask quite dosing it last forever and it does not typically we see that the responses last not only wit ovaritis but also without street for a generations free to five generation we found genes that function as the sort of a cook the times the duration of the inheritance what sorts of a genes arts we call the genes motecgenes motif i don't know how is your here but motels are very it means sweetheart in here but the action is modified fans on ration a religion attic in ad cine that there are different types of genes that and for some of them if you mutate if you the soup their function now a now the effect will transmit stably for hundreds of generation would never stop cause the rod is to stop the inhabitants from going from famous you don on a carry over something forever otherwise you it will no longer fit the endowment of the parents than you'll be propelled for the wrong thing this is imported there are what type of genes are they engine that we staid it is comet to it actually a gene tat and function in mutilation of the of the potion that condense dine this is and therefore but been the the genes tat effect also production of smaller lanate is there some mechanism that controls the deration of passage in a way that logical links up with the life span of the organism for instance i knew my grandparents met them i did not ever meet my great grandparents and i certainly did not meet my great great grandparents i could imagine the my great great grandparents or my great grandparents experience certain things that were past into their children and and perhaps into their children but it seems reasonable giving that humans live somewhere between zero and a a hundred years typically what now eightyyears that the typical if spent organs one that the if i were in a design the system and again i was not consult design face i would want an adapted a trait to be passed for two generations because given away that our given how longer species lives and certainly given away the world looks now as upon the eternal the previous censure the our the previous century de french tresses different adapt your different life environments and what i would want to pass on to my offspring i can easily edge pretty well i can place a good bed on the next hundred years may be the next two hundred but i do not have the foggy es clue what the world is can o look in three hundred years is is what ism say ma any sense whatsoever it makes a lot of sari and really it youwilling to to talk about two things in response o this first of all and yes you can imagine that the reason that the worms in hurts typically for i free to fivginations is that this is relevant to something that happen in their vans for exappin an we also show that when you stout the won it affects the nextenerations again for affugineration which itself as amazing i i just one a high that that a youcanmagin regenerations throw a genetic version of be careful ids but i may give you the dextral lunch pack in your gene the protects you against the possibility of starvation but it is also saying an were you to have kid straights they have at all yes i have to but just i have to just make a disclaim the we not don know that necessarily its adapted could also be damage as i said when you start them the nectionerations live longer but this could we attend of or a trad of or fatidic something the laps t also have also shown following our work that if you start the moms the nectionrations o also no resistance to housel starvation the sounds this not my outward but the sounds adapted but when whenever you token about at fetation you have to sit in the contacts of revolution that also this famous thing nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of revolution and is it is very hard to say without doing the labevolusion ex pediments we actually see who ins tho once that in her or the once don who takes over otherwise it is it is hard to talk about wet the it stative but when it comes to the donation of the response yes it could we cogramd to fit something for example if you taken about starvation worms transition between species of starvation an trance per were they have a lot of lots let say the fin an ape for wit you generation there will consumed theater and then the wills be stout for a while perhaps this is the number of generation that takes them to files and a o perhaps at the the responses also to high temperatures if you grow oms in high temperatures e coffins par are the a different they change how they mate what i i loathe to before telling a i the as e relates o hold exposure which many of liner and perhaps it is somehow collated with am o the cycle of the all but to tell you the truth i do not know as i said we we am we go from the artificial to the less artificial if those send manages symmetric arena is the most artificial starvation is motifs in more natural out that it is not starvation an real the tell con tens of the world in a real appel is is a plate widow without equal a boctilia it is not an appel on a the exposed to the elements withother worms with butter we are withal kinds of complications and it could be that we will see different durations of heritable effects the more natural we go wit just we much less controllable and hard to do wand again w when we token about humans part of the argument by people while the disbelievers it is not about say but you know the the critics say that this would not happen in humans is they say youknow the the worms generation times just free days the chances that the parents endowment will match the children in variate is very hi because the does not lot of time to for for the moment t change it play the can go her y far small thar many examples of epigenatic inheritance in clients if the big field were the very established a proof for inheritance of a quietly for for apigenaticn has a be more careful a pigeon at can in hastocratis more loaded then but in plans it also happens d that you also say the out senile organism they cannot run away the endowment is more content ideas i may be just a quit example that have heard before tell if ism wrong i very well may be a fences i a particular a species of plantar grows a a start may be slightly bended stock might be exposed to some environment were in order to capture enough am sunlight another other nutria's my see to grow in a court screw form the corkscrewform can be inherited several generations this is example that i do not know but perhaps i thing i that i s in the someone would to trust me the one thing we know about bout passing and you to with some one will tell us on has a pen please do we invite that a but this a long history of even attic inheritance studies in plants excellent studies were control showing that it happens also tell this is very clear it when it comes to human you would say maybe my needs will go off to live in a different continent and that will be on the computer of every day and everything will be different it makes less sense to repel them for the same hardships that i experience however this in my opinion this is this argument comes a lot it is not the best argument because it depends on the say oo how you loathings we experiment we we meet for example am not saying that this is inherited but in humans but we expends the same patience in the same vile is all the times of perhaps it is worth preparingful than i cannot not saying that the it happens but but it depends on that on the on the scale but what you describing makes perfect sense and i do want to acknowledge these critics whoever they may be i do have the advantage that i do not work in this exact field and i am a happy to stand am an tote to with those critics now and say that at least in terms of in inheritance of reactions or adaptive or male after traits to stress or to reward you thought bat nicotine before in a passage of response to drugs of different kinds not being specific to nicotine dissolve a more general am passage of of some sort of information related to a reactions to chemicals present in nextame but other other drugs i have long been irritated am ache little bit a tickled by the fact that people say oh we have this system for stress that was really designed to keep us a safe from lions and same or two tigers sure but the mark of the stress system is that it generalizes i mean if i get a troubling ten message or if i suddenly see a dark figure in that in the hallway when i go to the bathroom at night that i do not recognize both of those have the same generic response which is the deployment of a drank and of in both brain em body changes in the objects of the eyes quickening of the heart rat stress is by design generic and one could imagine that a passage of some sort of stress resilient a or a maladapted passage distress would be also somewhat generic and that is actually advantageous over all same thing with the reward system we know and we have essentially have one or two chemical systems of reward i mean there is the point system and there is the canavonoid system but in large part anticipation and reward is governed by the doorman circuits and anticipation reward of an ice cream cone for a kid is the same neral circuitry that is going to be purpose when they get to reproductive age and they are anticipating a creating children with their mate and assuming they want to do that the doponurgeious systems can be engaged ice cream sac am a distress to weather stress to famine the the biology of of these more modal systems and especially in the nervous system are i can have to be careful with the words by design are certainly generic and i do not see the need for for immense specificity i mean its not wore a what bovid just happen could you imagine that there is the passage of a a bovid nineteen specific resilient no i think what would probably be a pasilong would be some sort of if it does occur would be some sort of railings to viruses more generally and that would be advantageous i are and this if this open the question of waits the band we of in home specific be that it makes sense for it to be specific and in the case of sieligans the response can be very specific fruits incidents of armies which are just siren specific the dangegrelet the they the control one of piculelgi in other cases it could be a villi general response and and and and it is very interesting to think about it when we talk about inhabitants of memories which is the more interestingting we could in a can brain activity of say sort toneme at least in these words i said no i i said it is disclaim o would betimes in in memos we do not know times will tell in warms me we know lot can warms tons metoblan activity to to do they have the specificicbefore i say that i just say that we over the island an lot about he mean sons that shuttle the grenades between generations we know about genes that admitted just for that about one would be perfectly okay but just do not have the capacity to transfer the glandes to the nextionerations we know about genes that would make the responses longer or shorten we know about genes that prevent the transfer of alary between different issues about genes that make certain smolleranies we know a lot about hat and then the question arises we can we can finally ask can memory answer between generation i think that first what we need to define memos for that and the broadest the phoenicion would be any and change in your behavior because of what happened in the past or in your response because what happened in the pest because of your history the mow into think put of courses to talk about memos that are incaldet in the brain and the reason is that the brain is capable of holding much more specific and elaborate memories the i think that any tissues that transmit transfer er a a to transmit alanine to the nextinretion and affect anextionesit is interesting the gut hustled everything but the brain can since size in formation about devilment and about in tell that state and can also think had and the most provocative thing you can say is that you could plan how somehow the fate of your net of your detonation using your brain no after taken anythings in visa without talking to them right without talking it and in striction that again we yo back this instruction man yokels writing something invent instruction man you based on your own experience right and and can in and what is the band wit can we transfer sucks and and then i have to agree with you that i would imagine that what can trance them and i could be long is a a general something sensitivity we can mac the aknowlogy to a being inflamed or not wehiposensitive to patogians i hypervigin something's but it can also be something very specific we know we have to en to understand that the brain uses a different language then the language of inheritance the brain the way we knomanlly think about the brain is that it keeps information in sinus is in the connection between theffernomons when you learn something you make you make some connection stronger and some con another connections wicker and you wire the nervous system in a different way the information in the brain is seen edit it is in the connection on the other hand heritable information of any sort has to go through button neck of one sell the fertilized egg because we all stout from just one sell wit can not be in the connections because this sell does not have any connections with out selling there along it w vegetable infommection has to be more lequolalt as to be inside is one ai the question is can you or do you consulate the information the frelystactu information or sin sin upstairs in the portion between brains in the architecture of the brain can you somehow translated to delta be information to a molecelofor it an incredibly important and deep question it brings to mind something that was once told to me which as soon as i heard it was obvious but was very important formulating my understanding biology which is that a map is just the transformation of one set of points into another set of points right a map of of the world essentially is just you take the what is been drawn out in terms of the architecture in the the coast lines at camera and visions between states and you transfer that to an a tronomap for a piece of paper seems obvious a sort of a do why we tally math's but just a make sure that people understand what you're really talking about is but say the memory and i have a very distinct memory for a my childhood for number phononumber does not exist any more and i will not give it out because then some other person might get your with repeat it calls but in any case i remember it it solely useless information but it lives in my you quart ex for my hippocampus are somewhere as a series of connections between neurons at the locations as you call synapses would my grand children know that phone number there is no on the leanly no no right would my children know that unless there was some adopt if reason or some other reason for them to know and the upend this passage of of acquired traits a and what your saying is in order for that to happen there has to be a transformation of the curl circlet literally the wiring of neuron a b c d that relates o incarras the information that number in to the kind of newcliotied sequences that are contained in d ana or patterns and mathelation or orang more likely it is the transformation of one set of points in physical space to a translation of points in genetic space is am and then we have many prophets when first of all we do not know f a mechanism to translate between the two different languages the language of the brain and the language owe are not familiar with the mechanismsecond the mexieneration if it is not a worn if it the dammit would have a different bring if an if it if if if any it was genetically identical to the beret the the wiling of the brain and the u tecoulonly on circles will be different if i true for twins it would always be true because it depends because it is partly random any depends on the endowment even if you have the sand he the let say you somehow had the mechanism million mechanism to take the freely information d translated to the mated to the language of inherits you would then in the section nation have to translated again to the brain although it is different this sounds very unlike i am playing a tret on you now anal or uneasy train but but but but is is this is how it happened or if this was the quiet it could never happen in my opinion which means and i swiping a that there are certain memories that cannot transfer trangeneration an this complex and things that you learn about the invarmet that arbitrary fear if i none of our listens kids will remember this conversation no way this is impossible and that order lesion e rain is o nirarsion the we your pares it arteries rather but but but it cannot transmit because its its random and it this are connection that a arbitrary this seems to be a limitation what can tandem on the other hand perhaps for generating could pass some this this up things doubts however you can nevertheless imagine that somethings that are very specific some memories at revery specific could nevertheless transmit from the brain after learning to the next i give you an example you can teach worms even it a thou they have to sure an to normal you can teach them simple things about the world for example you can taken ado that they warms the arms have thousands of oudoantecepto and they can recognize many many many molecules they can smell them they can find food or avoid enemies you can take a fool that the warm s la and also that the warms and tell it to something bet starvation and then the worms will learn to dislike this ado we do not know that this learning involves necessarily changing in the strangest of sciences it is a possibility by it does not have to be the case it could be that just the la sept for this particular auto is being removed when they and this is how they a now they won't have themes ego they wont smell they will not that this is a possibility this type of thing you can pe has not that anyone has show that convincingly transmit to the nextioneration because all it would take is an any that with well console this particular reception this is a possible people have shown things that not in we elegance but people have shown things tike the sin feels they said that you learn certain thing and then just in nectioneration us a particular except wild be mutilated or would change and this would transmit the response and on the one hand it could be true on the other hand you need to understand they'll need to prove an this was not done convincingly enough yet how exactly does information transfer from the brain to the germselves and then in next o negation from the jumpsons back to the brain to we the laser i trap oseptonit to operate and this is a challenge this is the current states oof the feel that this is something that is to be proven but we didn't we elegance is we showed that certain e that the brain can communicate with the nextionerations using smaller anise and that this can change behave l and it does not require any translating between any language it is very simple why we have shown it that if you take warm and you change the production of smaller anise just in its brain in the next generations the will behavior will be different if i though you do not mess with our brains is the paper that we public in two fausandin a in nineteen unsaid we show that you just manipulate that conduction of indulge to s natural oranges in the warmsbrain that are always made to you change tor amount and this changes the capacity of the warms in the next generation to find foot to fin not only in one generation but three generations down the rod and the way did it works is that pertoping the production of this smaller anise in the brain affect in the end the expression of the gin in the german one gin is called sage to do not know how it works but we can do all kinds of contorts were we maypole activity of tegenincilities also affect behavior and this gin work in the games thin formation its to go from the brain to the jumpsisyt does not it to go beck from the jumps as to the brain to affect behavior and this depends we note disks are two apigenatic effect because goes on for multiple generations and also because it requires the machinery the pranksters lanate between generations if you do not have the porting that physically carries dawlanatet in generation does not happen tot it has to be are it has to be ani and i not we can actually we can also find allanite in the exoneration the change we sequent the actualalanase the change in regeneration you mention that you do not know what sage this achene sage does but its it reasonable to assume that it does something in the contacts with the nervous system or that is unclear is well it is possible it is possible but we have reasons to believe for experiments to to show although the could be alternative explanations that its functions fog the german now you may ask how can you affect behavior just by changing the games well it would have to change the germ sells in very specific ways because was a people probably recall the germ wine germsells a were the inheritable information is contained but you can imagine for instance on a busting the gain or s sensitivity rather on on some sort of a sensory foraging system right right and and that that the interesting thing is that it again can be quite unspecific it sounds will that you change themselves and its changes behave superman but if you think about it is trivial if you castrate the dog if behaves differently right sadly i did that my dog in i need a funny montastastron terpulater in a brought back get just as a as a she as an aside yes this is because the germsels affect the soma including the brain in many ways by the or sitting certain comics and also because the e others sell develop developed from that from the gem see some information could be transmitted over development or the course of development could be late because of changes the tower in de games and it for exempla member o one of the explanations and for how heritable in formation cons met is that the it just affects something very on in development i i i tout you that the tickets to warms inhelitents is that the have the capacity to omplifiedin smaller and is all the time this is what keeps it going prevents the delusion in memos we do not know of such an amplification that can you ask how can a little bit of are or something without complaining affectlanlantiogens and it could be that you just perturbed something in the very beginning when you just have a few sell o even i the in the placenta that develops inpeganthy and this later throws everything off and because of that you has you have many problems n metabolizes and an on and this is called that the is if the idea of the developpele developmental origin of heathen devil many of the of the function oo car early on in development see raise a number of incredibly fascinating aspects to this i i do have question about one particular aspect and feel free to pass on this for a future episode if its convicts too far off track but something you said it really captured my attention although i was listening to all of it which is that the germ cells in the case of males its can be superman in the case of females can be eggs something perhaps not coincidental about those cells an the environment that they live in is that yes they contain the genetic information passed off spring of course you explained how that works but also it is a sit it those cells live in a region that is rich with foreman that can be secreted and in fact a recreated and through called indican signalling communicate with other cells notjioust at the level receptors on their surface but also can enter the genome of those cells and modify those cells in other words it seems to me that the micro environment to the germ cells the testis and the ovaries or rich with information not just for the passage on next generations but also for all the as you set all the somatic cells of the body their telling the somatic cells of the body what to do in what to becoming the best example i can think about this we be puberty bath i mean i would argue that the that one of the greatest a rates of aging and and transitions we go through in life is from pubertium and a child becomes a very different person after puberty they look at the world differently they think about it differently the growth of it is much as about the growth of the hair on the jaw on the atoms apple and breasts and on it is a transformation of the somatic cells from the same micro environment that the dona containing a cells reside once you think about it this it becomes obvious that just by affecting the germs was you can affect the rest of the body and inf feyly dons theasperment to show it is very clearly for example for the just take warmth and prevents perm production it changes the capacity to smell these are experiment done by both which is obviously a drain function and in a castrated dog you are not just eliminating the the possibility of transferred of then information to subsequent a generations your also hemin o very tentation of t ya a without question my all dog costly change after castration and it was a wonderful dog but at some point evolved some healthishes the introduction of a small amount of testosterone every other day changed him fundamentally in that case for the better am back to aversion of himself that i had only observed earlier but also a different version the same dog an know he was not humping everything maybe the occasion only a particular people who have s names i will not mention but it was absolutely clear that the horizon was not just taking a system in amplifying it it was actually modifying the system anyway i just wanted am high that and an now am thank you for indulging me i let us am if you will but continue down this path of a that we were going on because i want to make sure that we absolutely get to this issue of transmission of information about sex choice of offspring the worms a he maphodates which means that they make both firm and and e but they are also made which are much more rare and they can choose to mate with the male or not and when they me with the mad its a use the sis because it is very costly energetically and they also risk predation and all kinds of troubles the male hurt them and reduce their linesmen when they make with him people gan a draw all sorts of analogy here by its inevitable be a here es and and most importantly for evolution when you made with another endue you i duty german hae cause the arms can just self felt talipes an pens it they exact them general to the next lesion ben when they mate they they lutitin he this is a big price to pay on the other had wen you made you they very fog maybe some commination of gin will be god and we know that in human summing you it is kin interesting that the bring circuits a associated am with with aversion and with approach are am fairly hard wired for number of things puddle of vomit almost everybody can mange his plate of copies if you copies you move towards it but there is one particular word in a the englishman pressings daily language that that ought to evoke disgust and that insist because incest is actually not just disgusting as a practice but it is dangerous critically right because of the in breeding creates a dilitarious metatii thee are studies or how people in israel see boots for example where they all grow together the children live together it used to be that don't e theytechother for this a their clastic thing i talk to some of whom the noble y to me that is not true but but yester thstadis that say but it makes them and in some country scanninavyan country or in a la plan and simmer populations are small they keep exquisite records a lineage in order to avoid in breeding fit u rant you absolutely at but the worms its the safe choice for them is to self made and and if they make with a male they take a is but they they very what what we found is that if you take the hemaphodat the the we can call it the the female for just one second and you press it with high temperatures then the next generations of worth for free generations made much more with made and they do it because the the female start secreting a person that attracts the mads ah o very critic a mechanism it is not that she somehow changes and then go seeking males no it draws males they draws me when we know how it works we think we know how it wars but happens is that the press their high temperatures compromise the production of seem in the hemaphodat the harmatho that do not they make spermenough to make detonations but the sperm be cause of defective smaller and inherited to the anis are not inherited octet the per is not made optic many they make less spy and when they do not make a lot of seem they feel that they do not sell feel valise correctly they call the males by secreting the persons that it would provide it is on seem and they can continue to make tabes we know this also form expert you just take er maphotat and you kill it sperm thosicistia photon and the males come it is a need these seal exactly incredible and i hope people can appreciates their hearing us that none of this we assume o i do not ow have ta speak worm none of this we assume is a conscious decision in these animals i much he human mating behavior which to us always seem conscious but is being governed by both conscious and subconscious decision making none of this is a active decision to secret the hormone to drawing moremales it is simply a biasing of probabilities right the hormone is now secreted in in greater quantities or more greater frequency the males their for approach more its just increasing probability of interactions at at right rat but heavens natural anomaly if you do not step the the assesses is that the warm start secreting the pheromone only when they or is also no people will when they run when tar running out of a their own fertile exactly because they only make the seem at the particular kine and then they run out of spell seem they can sell sell the life they have to call the males if the want continue to maxwell this the sort of the a plastic surgery approach o cay all take the heat for that one but but it is true i think as as certain people age to a certain point and they feel that their fertility is waning if they want offspring they need to take any number of different approaches they can get a her which i moat a female but we could also do the reverse righting we e am a sperm downer right or but if they want to attract the life long made or parent with somebody oftentimes they will am do things to a just there a attractiveness in any number of different way psychological attractiveness or physical attractiveness ism not afraid to bring this up because i think that the parallels are very important because i do think that every species and individuals within a species of course decides whether not they want ta re produce or not but has an in parent understanding conscious or subconscious about where they reside in the art of their life spend i do believe that not just based on experience am some people are very attune to the the a passage of time being very fast others very slow i think that knowing how long your parents and their parents lived makes a big difference i have friends who am fathers in particular died fairly young and all these give base o got margin had kits really young so here the lackey for me i do not have to get into psychology of the worms the explanation is just an instinct when the ranolph of sperm they sosicutin the elements and a treat the mate there are states also in newsman about older fathers the children of older fathers have more the hirichance of have of becoming tiki there that ready enough they sad however in this case it is not clear that the season to ti tests something epigenesis would be just because of teanabemants because e accumulate yo hassle nowadays there a we have an upset on fertility coming up both man and female fertility and theirs a a there actually dean fragmentation kits first at home deny fragmentation kits or spermanelses you send us turn back in e don india people pi petting o a seemed at home won be an odd picture let us not go there that the a but there are a clinics that do this for for phenomenal charge but the am but it is i did want i ask about autism and human disease in particular am another thing that you hear sometimes and here i want acknowledge autism is on a spectrum some people get upset if you call it a disorder there are some adapt of autistic traits and e camera but one thing that am often comes up is this idea that to people who are more of the kind of engineering a hard science if you will of tintype mat and have children higher probability of the offspring being on the spectrum am some people would argue a but that is already selecting for people that might have already been partially on the spectrum may be it is a gene copy issue ism not asking you the comment on autism in particular but when you hear things that that a the children of older fathers am one from older fathers ten the higher probability of autism what is that u at the level of intuition does that strike you as an emptygunetic phenomenon as a nature nurture a mishmash or the possibly that is are in a passage a or anything does anything sort of a trigger the whiskers a you or our u pity sense in that case i would go with the moposemonious explanation which is it just lest fidelity o ego ten in lest then maintenance and some damage that passes on y does not have to be an empugenatic this but the spurner generated at once every sixty days the damage must be at the level of the germ cells not having the proper machinery i might a wonder something or the dene repels the in else passing that would be defective o would the work less well in of the people leading to the constant potato of jumps as we mormiticient the say the possibly do we know exactly what the dona repair machinery is yes there many types of veaneripe the those on the us other copies of the delete to e a to corrects there the one just recognize old kind of legions on the dene and in remove a it its the very elaborate in complicated system and is it a system that is now tractable that can be a modified through myrmecology or through anything that so none about drugs that correct h that import maybe they exist and i am not o were that it is very well understood and the many people have study the a one thing that am came across in the a exploration of the fertility work is that what am about to describe is not legal in the us it is illegal but is legal in the ache and in other countries as this notion of three parent a i an were it does seem that some of the eggs that persist in older females a do not a even if fertilize do not produce healthy embryos they have chromosomal abnormalities a replications in an delusions that are problematic for the development of the embryo such as rising me twenty one the e down centrum in part or in large part because of deposits in the mite control gene what they now do as they take the because the might condroginomer resides mainly in the cytoplasm they will take the can egg from the the mother the sperm from the father but they will take the nucleus from the mother and put that in to acidoplasm of a younger woman whose might a control dean is healthy then use the sperm to fertilize that egg and i a and that is why it is called three parent via then implant that into the mother and this has been done several times for in cases of mite conceal damage or a or a mutations in the in the mother it works the question is whether or not those offspring will grow up to be healthy this of course is not just a pure divergence it raises a bigger question that i have for you which is in terms of the work in either sealegans or in other model organism but in particular in sielegans where do you see this going next and if you would indulge us i would love you to tell us a little bit about the admittedly unpublished work that you are doing on temperature a exposure and environment i mean how mailable is the system because to me it just seems incredibly valuable and yet a lot of is still cloaked off to us they're still a ton to learn coming that we will discover situla things in inhuman which we do not know that this is the case but let the we we find i think the many things you can do before you changes for example a you can you could also change it chant change and apparent inheritance by and having the the parent exercise somethings this have been done for example and we'll experiments in in rodents were is show that the overfeeding the the the plants cats problems for the next operations for the for the children however if you let the the the rod and exercise then it corrects the gelatin a this is one possibility and you can also manipulated at the at the sols you can change if it is areas that say you could in the future perhaps if we understand ow it works actually change the composition of the helix of alagonae by eating or name turtle the worms a rornasand we know a the adonis in which would be difficult because it is not i know but but you could if you do isles u when it of mobilization you can perhaps change the composition of the agonies in the the stuff that you into dose but away be fore that what you could do perhaps even in the not far future is use is for diagnostics then base the diagnostics for a every couple at once to have a kid you can israel this is done for for most couples you can look at the thenar and look for genetic this is but no one look is looking at the area the moment if we understand how it works better we will have another level whole new world to look at and perhaps there will be some agonies that collate wit disease that tat the will say o cay you knot have at the the beauty is that this unlike the inlay it is plastic with the nay this your dear nay perhaps we can choose another email but here you can say perhaps o again the future this siscienc fiction does not happen now if we understand is in its true we can say maybyou should run on the tread me the little bides will change the poor fallow of yo agonies and then we will use it for give years this seems mow because just it correlates with healthy ponies o valances this is a level that no one looks at now and holdgreat potential again with a disclaimer that we no know how it works in humans at all yet yet of course is wrote wat we quite interesting ya superinteresting me in incredibly promising long no lines of things that one can do in the short term and your experiments on we elegance a lovfou it chare with us what your observing about cold exposure and how that infant subsequent generations of see elegance and i any few would indulge us with the story of this discovery some of the earlier stories you told us it is a a surprising and fascinating one i gladly tell you about this is noted a store about dungeon lesionnetit it i stor about memory within one generation a excuse me i will in one generation and again as you said the stole of how it happens it its its its totally by excellent e funny story and i ism bring it this up because i now data lunch after the use fen of your posts really be happy that t that i is was her work this is her work and this is unpublished work if is even i within even finishes were working an one on for that is polish will feature the paper case i of the step sorifessol fret what happened is that when you we talk about tanginerational memories and i said that in warms the are very long tongineration an memories if with a generation time for selling units us three days some demons last many generations way beyond the the life seen of them of the one the linesmen of the worm is three weeks genre you have a nutunlation ovary three days but every warm lives for free i but there was a lot of nice to shows that unlike heritable memoiwch can be very long the memories that the warms acquire doing the life time is very short lived if you teach something after two hours it forgets for example you can teach the worm you can take an odor that it likes and pall it with starvation and then it wild dislike the do and then there is a simpathet just put it in a plate you put the the order in one side and contralto another laden you see whether is prefers is odoonot and it stops preferring it a there is felteals or to of resat totals of risks on on this showing that the worms forget a to two hours there son i went to study she elegance is that i wanted ondersthan memo to because such is simple nemesis semis i maybe have the contentious to action in than it worth but this is likely this appoint because the forget of to to us o what is it exec my idea was and i tried to convince students to do it for ten years is to take the worms teach them this association to dislike theory that they lately and then just put the worms in minds eighteens freeze them frees them completely them and see whet that they still the member a to they outhit the unsold express and an ideal want to do it because i o clip reservation of somepingn this i wanted to do it because as better than me mantra is about memory say that you need electric selectivity to maintain the me ne to reverberate it in the brengurin dreams or replay of the thin or whatever and if the memories will never the less be kept even though the worms were stand in minds eighty it would mean that it was kept in the absence of of electricity begloselves no electricity in minosate debris this was the idea i asked many students no one wanted to do it because of wit is not easy and also sat a little craze well and when the pig the princebone us getter alive has a pad experiment no one ones the tattoo ais universal the i i and then don agree to do it don a lunch i was very happy only late to find out that she ignored me completely and did the different experiment the expect that that a did in in instead is to just take the arms teach them as location and place theories she wanted to see how the kinetics of memory ans forgetting change in low temperature because maybe whatever memory is the break down of the memory is affected by the temperature a very simple the idea we nothing the experiment the differ experiment here be ta cool experiment very cover and what she found is that when you place the worms on eyes after the teaching they just do not forget if then even ten times longer than control ones at that point after twenty four hours if no one ones forget of the two hours after twenty four the wins would become six normally we do show to elements but for two hours the ones enrobes this is cool but it was only the begin because the bowing explanation is just what i just said that everything slows down in low temperatures the region of memory and gan we do not know what it is but whatever it is happens slower in low times rest but this is not the case it is not merely the physical its the response is the changing of the intend state of the worms which affect the memorykinatics how do we notice this beautiful work of the last one is on called tolerant in we elegant senators if you take the worms and you place them on ices she did but longer for forty eight ours they all die however if you take the arms ugly made them to lower temperatures for a few hours five hours amino and then place them on eyes they all life they become called tolonent and people who study is show this involves changes in living metabolism and anythings than took the arms ugly made t them to slightly lower temperatures made them called resistant and then tout them the association and place themonice and only forgot immediately with mean that when they changer intend state to become called stolen they no longer extend memorisoniht which mind is not only the temperature because he temperatures it anyway low now the nonmoral took this at the starling point to under send one which genes change when the worms i becoming call tower and onion of eyes and we found genes that when you mutate them the work just remember longer always even when their off eyes considers the genes that normally change wen the tried on the eyes and these genes ill express just in one pail of coyotes just two out of the three hundred two there is we said three hundred tune and we can manipulates the activities of these genes in this no ones to extend memory and then the punch line of everything that happen is that we found out that this this noon where this gene's function is one pair of noon is the only known in selects chichis sensitive to lithium and lissome sir drug that is being given to by polo this older patient for that hates though it is not entirely clear how it work its rely very interesting is also into think as an episode of course in your contrast about is more the about this than mere lot but is so antigen because i justineton re the i the big bank yet it works on our brains in such a fundamental way and wanted to see whether it works onto son de want tecosnisnolon was tied to this memo extend nothing that we found data grade warms onlitou remove them from lit to them to association and found out the the learn an lotto the they remember lotlonge an pontoons not only that if you first make the warms coltolen and then lit does not work in them lithium switches this forget for new mechanism onenov unit it all in it all connected to coltolen amazing and amazing for a number of reasons and at risk of being long winded in my response a is when to highlight something a that i think will be of relevance most people which is when a at some point we did a few episodes on memory and i aligned a a review that was written by the great names mama one of the great mammalian memory researchers who to worked a lot on humans and mice and i was a shocked upon intended and a amused to learn that in medieval times if people wanted children to remember lessons they can be religious lessons or school doctrine or whatever it was mathematic that they would take children teach them and then throw them into cold water to introduce a a memory in stilling event and we now know that the memory in stilling event is the release of a adrenalin in the body which makes perfect sense if you think about dramatic events but it also this whole general mechanism also applies to learning of other types of information and if i understand correctly about the roll of lithium in the roll of cold in experiments that you just described there is some general state sweat some internal states which that says what happened in the minutes or hours proceeding this was important it acts o sort a highlighter pen in in the book of experiences tam and ism absolutely curious to know whether or not this is an are in a dependent mechanism in some way this do o literally the high lighter in the kid instruction book the we do not this we do not know and as i said titis not even a finished work as not preview the just t the state that i told about but a but it it is very exciting for for me to to go into this newfelan in a wantitala be happy to who thought more about it the and think about the implications on the connection sot the things om o more about the mechanism a well thank you for a sharing it with us despite the fact that it is not finish we am people now know that it is also not finish i love a good cliffhanger well we we await the full the full conclusion and interpretation of these results to day you taken us on an amazing journey through the venom a in a a short interfering are is a a ton of history of prior experiments some of which ended tragically many of which unfortunately did not and they were true triumphs and am in particular the w r in your laboratory which is just incredible and also this introduction of model organism and i only mentioned a short handful of the things that i you have caught us about to day for one extend thanks for the incredible teaching i also one to say thank you for am something equally important which is i that absolutely came through but is what initially am brought me to explore you in your work more although i had certainly heard of you which is that your spirit an kind of approach to biology am is an is an extremely unique and intoxicating one it is i even it i venture to call it seductive it is sailor know there is at i i do believe that whether not its music or poetry or science or a mathematics that am the spirit behind something dictates the amount of intelligence and and precision with which that thing is is carried out and am it absolutely comes through if i making i feel on the spot about this it's succeed thing but i i know that the listeners can can a feel it it is it is a felt thing thank you there there are am many scientists out there a fewer with this penis type and even fewer that am youknow i think that can communicate with such a articulate precision thank you making you it is been a real pleasure flesh was on my thankselo well we will do it again and we will learn about all the incredible things you are doing trying to transform science as it were at the level of publishing at the level of social media ecus here's a whole other discussion there meanwhile we will corse point people in the direction of you and ism to learn more about your work and am i look forward to hearing the conclusion of anas studies thankselos to bema real plus thank you for joining me to day for my discussion with doctor odd rocky about genetics inheritance the epigene and

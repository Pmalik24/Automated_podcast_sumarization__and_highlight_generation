welcome to the superman lanconcas a science sciencepace to for i mandruhuberman and om a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine my guest to day is doctor shown hackie doctor shown hackie is a medical doctor that is he treats patience as well as a p it meaning he runs a laboratory he is the chief of the division of pain medicine and a professor of both enasteseology and neurology at stamford university school of medicine to day we discuss what is pain most of us are familiar with the notion of pain from having a physical injury or some sort of chronic pain or a headache to day doctor hackie makes clear what the origins of pain are both in the nervous system and outside the nervous system that is the interactions between the brain and the body that give rise to the thing that we call pain indeed we discuss the critical link between physical pain and emotional pain and how altering one's perception of emotional or physical pain can often change the other we so discuss some of the changes in the nervous system that occur when we experience pain and how that can give rise to chronic pain we also of course cover different methods to reduce pain safely and those methods include behavioral tools psychological tools nutrition supplementation and of course prescription drugs we discuss the intimate relationship between temperature that is heat and cold and pain and pain relief if your interested in the use of heat or cold to modulate pain that conversation ought to be of interest as well we also touch on some highly controversial topics such as opioid opioid are a substance that your body naturally makes but of course many people are familiar with exogeniusts opioid that is ovoids that are available as drugs and the called opioid crisis doctor hackie makes very clear which specific clinical circumstances warrant the use of emotion is opioid with of course a warning about their potent addicted potential and we get into a bit of discussion about we the opioid crisis and the use of opioid drugs to control pain is and is going before we begin i emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my destroy effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i the thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is aero press aero press is similar to a french press for making toy but is in fact a much better way to make coffee the aeropress was developed by allay adder this an engineer at starwort i knew of fallen because i used to see i in my hometown of palowalto test flying the called army frisky he was sort of famous surround my town as this brilliant engineer that would create these unusual products when i heard about the are press i got it i tried it and i absolutely loved it because it does indeed create the best tasting cup of coffee or loose sleep t with aeropress you can brew an incredible tasting coffeeour the and clean up the whole process in less than two minutes the key thing to know about the aero press is that it is not just some trivial variation on the french press that shorten brewing time that the aeropress uses really changes the flavor of your cup of coffee or t it makes it exceptionally smooth if you would to try aero press you can go to aero press dot come slash superman that is e e r o p r e s s doc come slash superman to get twenty per cent off any progress coffee maker aero press ships anywhere in the u sea canada and over sixty other countries around the world again that is aero press dot come slash superman to get twenty per cent off to day's episode is also brought to us by levels levels is a program that lets you see how different foods activities impacts your blood glucose levels using a continuous glucose monitor one of the most important factors impacting your energy levels as well as your immediate and long turn health are your blood glucose levels sometimes refer to as your blood sugar levels to maintain mental and physical energy and focus you want your blood glucose levels to be relatively stable throughout the day levels makes it extremely easy to determine how specific foods and food comminations meal timing exercise and sleep work alone and commination to impact your blood glucose levels i start to using levels about two years ago and find it to be immensely beneficial it is help me better arrange what i eat when i eat when to exercise and my sleep patterns if your interested in learning more about levels and trying a c g m yourself go to levels dot link slash superman levels his launch a new c gum censer that is smaller and has even better tracking than the previous versions right now they are also offering an additional two free months of membership again that is levels dot link ell n k slash superman to day's episode is also brought to us by better help better help offers professional therapy with a license therapist carried out on line have been going to therapy for well over thirty years initially i did not have a choice it was a condition of being allowed to stay in school but pretty soon i realize that therapy is extremely valuable in fact i consider doing regular therapy just as important as getting regular exercise incline cardiovascular exercise and resistance training which of course i also do every week the reason i know therapy is valuable is that if you can find a therapists with whom you can develop a really good report you not only get terrific support for some of the challenges in your life but you also can derive tremendous insights from that therapy invites that can allow you to better not just your emotional life in your relationship life but of course also the relationship to yourself and to your professional life to all sorts of career goals in fact i see therapy is one of the key components for meshing together all aspects of one's life and being able to really direct one's focus and attention toward what really matters with better help they make it extremely easy to find a therapists that is ideal for your needs your life circumstances and that can match to your s gradual in a very convenient way if you would to try better help go to better help dock calm slash superman to get ten per sent off your first month again that is better help dock calm slash supermen and now for my discussion with doctor shown hackie doctor hackie welcome oh it is a pleasure to be here thank you this is a long time coming we are colleagues at stamford and ism familiar with your work but to day we are going to take a pretty broad and deep survey of this thing called pain it is all to start off very simply than ask what is pain pain is this complex and subjective experience that serves a crucial role for all of us to keep us away from injury or harm it is both a sensory and an emotional experience and i think that gets lost on people that includes o sememotional component to it and it is incredibly individual and we will get more into that homely as time goes by that your pain is different from my pain and is different from everybody ease's it takes an incredible to on society when it goes chronic when it becomes persistent to the tune of about a hundred million america and at last count about a half a trillion dollars a year and medical expense's of an astounding problem were facing in society and one that is only getting worse and ism hoping during the course of this discussion that we can kind of break down a little bit of the foundation of pain and kind of build it back up because unfortunately i in society there is a lot of misunderstanding about what pain is and i think i hopefully we can build that foundation and then layer on some some useful treatments and you shall options for people ism glad you pointed out this link between the sensory in the emotional experience every ones in a while it'll pull some thing or it'll have i you ligan kink my back or my back and fortunately for me it results pretty quickly but i notice that when ism experiencing that kind of pain that i become slightly more irritable perhaps much more irritable to panting on whom you ask and that everything becomes more challenging thinking is harder sleeping is harder concentrating on anything besides pent it is it is a ism it is as if something is nagging from the inside and that raises the the next question that i have which is its pain something that is in our brain in our body we are both it is clearly in our brain and can i take a moment to can a lay a little foundation for some of that to help clear up some of the mystery of pain we know that pain most pain all starts with some stimulus whether be that kinin your back or your shoulder from working out or turning the wrong way and what is going on there i in your body is not pain what is g going on is that a there are censors in our skin or softissue are deep tissues called no susceptors and these nosuscepters are censing elements and they send different types of stimuli they can sense temperature a heat cold they sense pressure they can sense p h changes due to for instance inflammation that may occur from a any something going on in your neck your shoulder those sense signals up her fire types and the two that we we refer to ore adult and sea fires one transmits very fast it is responsible that sharp jolt o pain that goes to your brain when we are step on a tack a put our hand on a hot stove and there is another fibrin call to sea fire which is much slower in responsible for that dull achy pain now these signals they go to the spinal cord li up and down r a from our head down to a or back and there their shaped their changed a little bit they then are sent up to the brain and it is whence they hit the brain and they converge with this magical mystery set of nerves in the brain that it becomes the experience of pain and if there is one key message it'd to get to the audience is that what goes on out here what goes on in your shoulder in your neck is not pain that is no subreption those are electrical signal's electric chemical impulses being transmitted and that is to be distinguished from what becomes the subjective experience of pain that you have and why it is critical is that or brain serves many functions of emotions cognition a memory action all of that shapes those signals coming in from our body to create your unique experience of pain that is different from everybody ease's and i think that is important to note because we are frequently left with this notion of this one to one concordance between the stimulus and the experience of pain repay depart that french a philosopher think seventeen century an was the one who first postulated this idea of this direct linkage between the body and or actions and the stimulus in the response and it is wrong and unfortunate even in medical care we have this biomedical model that still is perpetuating this idea of a one to one relationship and that is a critically important point to get across in large part because frequently is humans we tend to project on to others our own experiences of pain and when we see somebody who is got an injury or something else going on we immediately put that on them and that has also been a problem i with many people suffering and chronic pain which is often viewed is the invisible disease son you say we put that on them you mean when somebody reports being in pain we have a hard time understanding what there our experiencing because it is going to be very different in the way that we experience pain conversely of somebody is in pain they tend to assume that people our experiencing pain the way that they are is do i have that right you have a perfectly right and it actually if i can build on that gets worse because sometimes you have conditions fire miasma that maybe we will get into where outwardly visibly you do not see anything wrong we are used to thinking of pain as a fractured run a bone as a swollen ankle we see that and then we oke well you have got pain you got legitimate pain whereas this invisible disease of chronic pain frequently you do not have something outwardly that you are seen but we bring in our own history of pain and we put that on other people have a question that somewhat mechanistic but we will keep it accessible to anybody regardless of their background you mention the nocicepters are in the body and everywhere in the body and on the surface of the body be able to detect certain kinds of stimuli and then those signals are sent up into the brain and the brain creates the subjective experience at we call pain is there a dedicated said of areas in the brain that are something akin like a pain pathway and the reason asks is that for for vision for hearing for touch we probably all experience though somewhat differently your perception of read is probably we will different in my perception of read we do not know for sure habit experiment support that idea but there is a major difference between people experiencing the same thing differently according to a mysterience mechanism in the brain as supposed it a an are an the brain that we can look and garlic half la that is where pain is a represented that is where all these these in puts from the body are put together to create this thing that we call pain a is there an area of the the thalamus a structure in the middle of the brain that takes in coming sensory informationthat we could say oh that is the pain pathway is our part of our real cortex the outer shell of the the brain more less a beneath the skull but none the less on the outer portion of the human brain that we could say o that's where pain exists or is it a distributed phenomena yet that is a great question and because we would all love at there was a pain center in the brain that we could just go knock out but it is not that simple and in part because pain is such a conserved phenomenon it it is there it is wonderful because it is terrible unless it goes wrong but when you knock out one pathway going to the brain there is others there that well carry that system forward and you will still experience pain and it is they are to keep us all alive now to get to your point no there is not one pain brain area it is thought to be more of a distributed network of different brain systems we at one point time called at the pain metrics which represented areas such as a the indoor quarter the singular quarter the amygdala a number these brain regions at all subserve different functions were moving away from that because it seems every year or we pick up another region of the brain that is contributing to this network that subserves some additional functions some new ones to layer to it that is said we have been able to identify some common signatures common brain networks that seem to represent the experience of pain and this is where the development of brain based big markers is common and this is some of the work that have done starting gash well over a dozen years ago and others have been a building on and what were finding is that there does seem to be this this conserved region head of a distributed regions that do represent the experience of pain when somebody takes a called pain killer let let us take a a typical over the counter pain killer a i be protein or see meniphan to a lessen pain of some kind where is that drug or drugs acting is it in the body iris it at the level of the brain we are both ye and this is where some of the challenges we get into it language because technically endseids nonsteroidal anting lavatory drugs ibex protein a person there actually not anal relics they are not technically pain killers an anal jean is the descriptor for a couldn't to pain killer either that would be more check an opioid would be would fit into that category the ends said are anting lavatory drugs there also there is another this is a technical term their anti hyper algesia drugs and one of the things that happens after in injury is that we get sensitization of the area that is injured and it is a beautiful thing because it sends a message to us to protect it ism what the ends heads do as they reduce some of that sensitization out in the periphery and then backed the spinal cordon in the brain but they do not actually for instance i was going say try this at home but probably not you can a in a normal situation hit your hand with the fork measure the amount of pain it'll go take and endsheid i be propman if you hit your hand with that same fork there will be no difference folks please do not do do not do that at home place we are a wit you are anywhere anywhere for that matter but you are describing pain and he local inflammation response and the hyper media the increasing pain in that general area as something very adaptive very important it raises the question what is the threshold for saying that somebody should treat their pain reduced their pain i mean any time have done a surgeries own animals which i do not do any more in the laboratory but we used to you would give them pain killers post operatively have had surgeries beforehand pain killers post operatively although i do not taking the money the way they make my brain feel in a but we of course know that if you increase the dose of any pain medication too much than that animal or a human can potentially injure themselves worse or not protect that injured area it raises a hall set of sort of medical ethical but also just purely by logical questions how do you set the threshold for yes blunt pain verses no allow the pain to be there is an adaptive way of protecting yourself and healing presume the inflammation is part of the healing process to and as you mention before pain is subjective and it is different between all of us i and how do we decide whether not it is a good or bad idea to blunt that pain i think the the the threshold is when its impacting your quality of life in your ability to take care of the activities of daily living engage with family friends go to work and that that serves kind of a your your threshold for whether to reasonable to to take a medication or not lot o controversy in the space right now used to be we all recommended just androids for any type of acute injury i do prom is a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs in the could we may be list off a few of those i mention i be profligacy to manikin sometimes referred to is you the classic advilletilan all went throughout name brains there but what are some others in a proven the proven is another one troll a cutarolac is another one the two over the counter and said the prototypical over the counter once or ibeprophan an arisen those the ones you can by over the counter without a prescription a nylon all actually has a slightly different mechanism of injury but still fits in that same general class it tends to be more centrally acting i be titan all our see o meniphan but take me t essentially you mean bran bank e thank and rend a is aspirin considered in ends that i do not you sudan was fit into that category of basically a cox a cycheloxygenas and visitor this is one of the the chemical mediators it gets release during injury and that chemical a substance has a tendency to wind up or amplify the nosusceptors that after an injury you note that you are more sensitive there after a sunburn you and of having more sensation that is what we refer to as peripheral sensitization because o is out in the periphery were winding up or amplifying the response a aspirin and had in general will reduce that inflammation their anti am hi pearl mesic and a pardon again the jargon terms that we use i weaver om e prolong as we go but but to your point you do not want to for instance let us imagine you have a fractured able you do not want to be reaching for a very potent opioid just that you can continue walking on a fractured ankle that you have not gotta valuated by a cognition and perhaps wasted that would not be sac those are rather extreme examples we get into those debates right and professional sports where they they send the person back out on the field with a broken bone having a given them a injection or something ism hoping that does not go on any more but a ism sure it goes on oh there is all sorts of other things i get contact all the time professional teams in athletes asking he they can get back an quicker nowadays the big thing or these a peptides that can certainly accelerate healing people travelling out of country get stemsell injections oh with o with a very few randomize control trials but i assure you that am cortsidon in the locker room mainly in the locker room their corticosteir own injections their pain killer injections cement it is it is not play at any expense but it is not far from that yet well when you are you are making millions of dollars a year and i i get the being back on the field but for the rest of us mere mortals ism i think that is where we would want to draw line get medical attention if you have got an acute injury going a little but deeper into mechanism because i think it is on a service well now and going forward you mention the en says and am this a beeswax cop is one is at is it in the family a prostaglin we talk about prostaglind ans because i think there are lot of people nowadays we hear about inflammation now you inflammations bad inflammations bad but one of the things that we talk about a lot on is podcast is the fact that o court is all is not bad inflammation is not bad these things serve a an important biological rolls the prostagland an seem to be one of the railways that are a mean system a response to a physical or chemical injury and and creates inflammation and that as you said that inflammation sensitizers in area makes it literally more sensitive and then we introduce these drugs that am to restored normal functioning and living could we establish what normal functioning is i man for instance if we make this really concrete could we say well if you can sleep fall sleep at night and stay asleep or perhaps go back sleep after you have woken up in mill the night than well you heal during sleep and take as little pain killers possible but enough that still lets you sleep well at night is that its sort of normal functioning because you are have a kink in my neck i do not want do much of anything i try but it is really frustrating what is it as a physician how and as a nation how do we determine normal function ye and you are getting in to the new once the complexity of this problem because we have been talking about end said the brew province a napperisins and as i said early always to just give these out all the time but then the research comes out and shows that by blocking inflammation by blocking that wee may be blocking the normal healing process and we have seen delays in fracture repair we have been seeing delays and tissue repair and now you have got on one hand a medication that may help with pain help you in pro function you have got on the other hand something you are taking that mad delay the process where do you draw the line as a physician my approach it is really basically what you said it is balancing the fact that if you are not sleeping at night you are not in a heal and you are not kin to be able to do what you need to do the next day and if taking an end said helps you sleep and helps you i engage with what you need to do take it at the lowest dotes that you can get away with have heard before that and sad should be taken no more than once every six hours peoplealternate different types of vend stand three hours that is usually to try and reduce fever and other situation where an adaptive response fever people go out of their way to block read prevent the rain from cooking but again opens up the same set of issues and ism wondering if somebody has some pain that makes be n o moving about frustrating in it is and it is difficult but they can sleep at night reasonably well may be not as well as they normally do would you are suggestion to that person if their goal is to heal as quickly as possible to just not take anything yet we have got a lot more data on the benefits of end said this class of medication reducing pain than we have data on showing the bad consequences of it and we are still needing more date on the whole healing message i think that a lot of the orthopedic surgeons out there prefer people not to be on end sees afterefor since a total hip replacement a total ne replace because i think that is pretty clear but that is not what we are talking about right now one of the other interesting things about end said we mention i be prefer n anapperson huge individual variability around those personally i be protein is not very effective for me person is for others it may be just exactly the opposite there is value in rotating them and finding out which works best for your particular situation you mention the timing of it i be protein is typically give no more than three times a day it is got a short half give person twice a day what is critical i need to give this message is in both situations make sure that you have food in your stomach make sure you are not taking it on an empty stomach make sure you are drinking plenty of fluids and if you have got any i g issues if you have got any bleeding his sues if you have got kidneasues if you have got hard issues talk to your dock talk to your cognition before you embark on this because these medications do have side effects and adverse consequence as invulnerable people what about aspirin have heard that astern can benefit hurt health i take a baby astern every day and if i have a pain that is just too intense for normal functioning as we are defending it then it'll increase that dose of aspen and i just assume astern is the healthiest and sad for me because well it is also good for her health and it is killing pain in those instances as supposed to taking anything else as my logic food and if it is feelfree to tell me now for for you your logic is perfect and that is where it gets to the individual person and for a lot of people that model would work as well baby aspirin eighty one telegrams a day acts as an anti platelet again it helps here even though we are getting controversy over the rule of baby astern if you dive into the current literature a even baby ask eve controversial even baby aspirin these days and now what they are doing with with the at is defining age ranges when they say baby aspirin sassaby astern now and i a we are learning a lot more about that i still take a baby aspernevery day i take a baby astern you get to the his dose o say four times as much up around three hundred twenty five telegrams or it is now an anting lavatory it is now acting more the i be prophet than an person ism different mechanism action at different doses i to take a brief moment and think one of our sponsors and that is a one a one is a vitamin mineral robotic drink that also contains adaptations i started taking a one away back in two thousand and twelve the reason i started taking it in the reason i still take it every day is that it insures that i meed all of my quotas for vitamins and minerals and it insures that i get enough robotic and robotic to support got health now god health is something that over the last ten years we realize is not just important for the health of our got but also for our mine system and for the production of nauru transmitters and aromodulators things dopamine and seratonent in other words god health is critical for proper brain functioning now of course i strive to consume healthy whole foods for the majority of my nutritionally take every single day but there are number of things in a one including specific micron nutria's that are hard to get from whole foods ore at least in sufficient quantities g one allows me to get the vitamins and minerals that i need politics robotics the adaptidgens and critical micrnutrians any time somebody asks me if they were to take just one supplement what that supplement should be i tell them a one because any one support many different systems within the body that are involved in mental health physical health and performance to try any one go to drink any one do calm slash superman and you will get a your supply o it em an d three k two and five free travel packs of ageyou one again that to drink any one do calm slash supermen i promise we will not go into every medication in such detail but but these are the most commonly used over the counter treatments for pain as far as i know a are there any a issues with people who drink coffin who then are taking these drugs are what are some of the a the interactions that these things can have as far as i know affine actually touches into the prostaglan in pathway does not yes and that is where you know coffin can use effectively for headaches for my grains and i it cannot help potentiate a the analgesic response i some people get a stomach irritation though with affine suggest a gan mind that you take an ended with a a lot of coffee i have some food in your stomach you brought up early or a seat of maniac or tile an all talon all does not have the same side effect or adverse event profile that the insets do talon all is safe on the stomach ism where you need to be careful about tile an all is not to exceed four thousand milligrams or four grams per day undivided doses to extra strength tile in all done four times a day for many people is safe some say two graham some say for grams the key here is around your liver you have got good liver function if you are not abusing alcohol that is a general rule of them that you can use for tile in all i but it is not an upset your stomach there are versions of the needs that we refer to is cop to inhibitors their very selective salacoxeb that is a less irritating on the stomach that is by prescription only though but you can think of it is working very much the same as the person an the i be prophet talk with your cognition to to try to tease those apart if you have problems in your stomach with the needs and the really effective for you you can be given other types of medications that help block or reduce the g i issues associated with the insets very useful information thank you yore were talking about chemical interventions to the pain process what about mechanical interventions i was taught in my basic your f science about i think its millrace and walls gat theory of pain do i have this right where we all have this instinctual response animals have it too right if they a you bump your knee or your tow that you grabinin can rub it and that that rubbing response is actually cant buying to the activation of a nerd pathway that does indeed reduce the pain through a legitimate curl inanition in tell me if the the stillcence eredirrectin than it'll let you elaborate on it but i think that is an opportunity for us also talk more generally or for you to educate us more generally on the the mechanistic interventions for pain am maybe message above or below the sit of pain maybe act puncture am again there will be chemical consequence of any mechanical intervention right as we know to that is the language of the nervous system electricity and chemicals but a suppose ta taking a drug you imagine using manual am stimulation or rubbing around it or or perhaps we can also nock about heat and cold we explore that space of it absolutely and first you are right i an your first part a pack a trick wall rondels back luminaries in the field the pain back in the sixties a defend the gate control theory of pain and one of the things to build on the story that we talked about with no susceptors going to the spinal signals going to the spinal cord heading up to the brain where the perception of pain occurs that is not where the story ends turns out there are pathways that come down from the brain down from the brain to the spinal cord that act in an inhibitory roll and we will build on those also from the periphery we have got also fires called touch fires these are the ones were they get activated with touch stroking they refer to is a bate of fires their fast conducting they head back to the spinal cord and they make some connections with those no susceptive fires with that grounding imagine what you said you are you hit your thumb with a hammer you i a you bang something on an extremity a what is the first thing you do when you hit your thumb with a hammer a some people rub it i yell some people swear and it turns out their studies that show that swearing works really swearing reduces pain better than a then using non explicative a yes loud vocalizations yes swearing works i do not know why but there is been it got some press when that paper came out and ye i do not ism not giving cart blanch where it saying everybody can go out and swear every time they are in pain we you they can but theyllhave to bear the consequences on any individual basis and are not we are we are absolving ourselves a n soil a rubbing a shaking is another one which basically is activating those touch fires it is what if i do that ye everybody o yet everybody does not running it under water which yen it does not matter whether in this case it is hotter cold water it is the running of the water under neath it and what is it doing we all think it is reducing the stimulus out here and it is not at in the prefer in the prefer what is magical about the think which is cool is your actually changing the signals in your spinal cord way back here in the neck this is the cheapest free version of what we refer to is narrow modulation that is ever been discovered am you are actually by doing that you are changing things the connections back in your spinal cord and it is reducing the no susceptive signals coming in here that is why we do it and it works it works dutifully that is why when a kid get's the booboo parents common rub it it works what about the kiss that kids someday ay wen a kiss you not ere a romantic partner will sometimes injure themselves i get the defense of the age of the relationship another will shay can you kiss it of course tan you kiss it then that they feel better as that purely psychological well of i think o an important point to to ground here when it comes to the experience of pain is it everything when we say psychological means narrow sciences for i no you no n no fray of me i i i i have to be careful with with the the wording that i use that is my but but it is it is accurate still it is psychological but it is narrow science based man thee really becoming one and the same but to answer your question yes by kissing it your activating touch fibers we can also agree that there is a positive emotional salience it is associated with that and that positive emotional salience is reducing pain to what interesting a wall in mellsack sometime later a there is the introduction of a devise to take advantage of this called the tens device and tends is an acronym transcutaneous electrical narrow stimulation and what the tens device is doing there is many versions of it now but there are those black electrodes you put over the area and they are hooked up to wires and when you turn it on it causes a buzzing sensation and tat buzzing sensation is activating those touch fibers the abate o fibers and it is causing that narrow modulation back in the spinal cord making it is cool stuff it is very cool and at and i love that you emphasize that when you were rubbing the prefer or shaking our hand the prefer again being the body surface away from the brain that the real mechanism of action is taking place back in the spinal cord because it really speaks to the the body wide an the the circuit wide the nervous system did nature of the thing that we call paint and it is it is happening out go to go out here in the prefer but it is been modulated in the neck level of the spinal cord approximately and then it is being interpreted at the level of the brain what explains different pain thresholds i could imagine it could be any ere all of the locations that we have been discussing yean it could be the contact as well right if you are a you not eve heard before and i wow know if this is true that if you have a lot of a drennlind epaneffern in your system that your threshold for pain goes waylay up there is probably a chemical basis for that maybe it is all am anecdote but a certainly people have different thresholds for pain i for instance you not have a high pain threshold but have notice i have a very quick pain response if i stub my toe it feels the most painful thing i could possibly experience but then it is gone very quickly it is a quick inflection and then down other people i know ah we have never on the experiment it'd see them stub their the in they ah and then your ten minutes later there still feeling the ache whose pain threshold as higher it is a it depends on ow you define painthreshold how do we to find pain threshold what determine pain threshold and i guess the six million dollar question are there different pain thresholds between men and women as it relates to the whole story about child birth being very painful in that women don't go have higher pain thresholds i just it a sent you about ten questions yet forgive me ye am what is pain threshold yet no it is it is a great place to start and may be i don't if you want a circle back around at some point to the heat and cold an es a mechanical for nomen on and your we me answer your get o your pain threshold pain threshold is a that stimulus intensity that results in the onset of the experience of pain the first onset of the experience of pain when you turn up the heat it is it is not when it is warm it is not when it is just hot it is when the heat becomes the perception of pain when it becomes painfully hot at that point in time the same works for cold you mentioned some of the distinction between your experiences of pain to a stimulus and your bodies and that is normal that first onset of pain again those are those fast fibers those adult fibers come right to your brain those are the protective ones that when we put our hand on a hot stove we immediately jerk it back we do not even have a conscious perception yet that we did that and then it is a moment later when the sea fires are getting up to the brain and the other adeltifibres are converging into conscious tries of brain that were a while that stove is really hot and the sea fires and particular are converging on more emotional regions an the brain that are conveying an unpleasantness to that experience you do not it you and you do not want it to happen again which is why it incomes memories you only had to do that once is a child now getting into the the pain threshold you asked one of the other questions is do men and women have different pain on thresholds o the answer the short answers yes this has been established and i want to be careful here was saying a couple things one is in general a men have a higher pain thresholds to things heat stimulus than women and what people have to also though understand a scientists we make a big deal out of small differences right what we do as we take a group of people in this case men and women and we apply the same a thermal stimulus to them and we draw averages the average man has this stimulus the average woman has this stimulus and we say well women have a little but more sensitivity to that heat stimulus and we then go into the press and we say on men are tougher than women that is a terrible statement re because the tough part is a subjective label stemming it it it gets to a whole bunch of different issues around the adaptive role of pain right i mean it i mean in one could argue that if your threshold for pain is lower that yours it serves them wore adaptive function i if the few ere injuries et camera man i get to get into the implications of what we mean by could not offer it does but it also misses i think the big point which is people are not averages what i mean by that is ism while the average for a woman may be somewhat less than a man if you look at the distribution of the curves they highly overlap meaning the individual variability within men and within women is much greater than the difference between men and women but there is plenty of women on that curve that have much greater heat a thresholds than men do but when you pool things you wend up with that difference unfortunately when things are picked up and you want a quick sound bide out of it that is what it gets to still down to not unlike height for that matter no lot of women that are taller than men that is exactly it but on average men are taller than women on average and i would say within this area of a pain threshold differences it is even closer it is even tighter it would be on making this up the equivalent i think the average hide of a woman is five three five four or the average hide of a man five nine five ten this is imagining the average height being five six for a woman and five eight for a man it is not a huge difference there is a lot of things that play into changes an pain thresholds how much and this is where the brain comes in because much of the no reception much of the signals that were i transfusing were transmitting in many of us it is very much the same it is when it gets to the brain now it shaped and it shaped by things such as i you are beliefs about that stimulus your expectations around it how much anxiety your having at the moment does increased anxiety increase one's perceived pain yes yet does i you are early life experiences with is if you had dramatic experiences in the past that alters brain circuits can i interject a question y if one was told just suck it up a lot or if one whimpered or cursed when they a hurt themselves if they were told i you do not be a lose do not be a whim do we know whether r not that increases or decreases the subjective feeling of pain later i could imagine it going either way i could imagine the hid that was told do not be a lose when they cried as a consequence of expressing pain or an experience of pain secretly feeling more pain because they are not able to express the emotionality round the pain but that if we just look from the outside we that wellie pretty tough adult right because they are not i crying out in pain young do we have any are there any experiments that have explored that i do not know you are getting and this is a good point getting into i a pediatric pain and if there is been experiments in that space i stay mainly in the adularia and my experience with raising a child is an and of one with one son don great thank i happen i know him very well he is a he is he is what you call it great example of highly successful reproduction say whether they say it is better to be lucky than good ah sir ism sure there was a lot involved do not do not discount it do not a do not discard any credit thank you thank you i my approach with been was not to say jut you a nearly suck it up but i would a you do not make light of it it'd mad have fun with it and ah i would kind o laugh and on way to go body and i would find he would often laugh i think a lot of it is accuse the taking off the parents again this is this is just my one of an parent is if they see you freaked out kids get a freak out to i but does there get to be a point where you are ignoring your child or your love ones painful issue it now you are getting into some maladapted of some bad space where they gets sending that person the wrong message and they may very well have problems later on i will tells just a we my brief anecdote when i was growing up i observed a total of zero children and friends who you will cried out in pain or complained of pain who we are told i that wasn't inappropriate response sometimes i might have heard parent say am i just suck it of or your rub it you will be o k that kind of thing but once and only once with some friends i will not tell you it what country they were from but they they live not far from em we are both hen and i grew up since we grope near one another and it'll never forget that the younger brother of a friend of mine ran over to the father he ad cut his thumb on the band saw and it was not particularly deep but he was crying in pain and the father rapped it picked up his chin and smacked him across the face an said do not ever do that again and what i think he was doing was compounding the the lesson about the saw yet but clearly had no regard for the pain that the that the injury probably cause o i have not followed up with that kid yum i think we can all agree that by to days standards that would be considered abusive parenting or perhaps one could say that was a on the far extreme of a response but it'll never forget that and i went home and i i told my mam and she said oh yet when i was growing up that was actually a more frequent response to kids hurting them themselves especially boys ye things have really changed in terms of how we react to children in pain but the reason i find this interesting is that ultimately what were talking about is how should we interpret our own pain ye can i can i make a commentary about that scenario and i want to bring in another narrow science concept that that dad may have been doing in inadvertently and that something called conditioned pain modulation there is another cool phenomenon and in pain that pain in habits pain what i mean by that is when you were this guy this kid but are yourself growing up to never walk up to your body si you know i my arm really hurts i injured it the other day and what ad what did your body do they would stomp on your foot and you would say why the had did you do that must have grown up at same from yean and they table now does not does not your arm feel better a me well he i does and yet i did grow up with those friends i tell this story to some people and i sometimes just get the wide eyes they did what yet we are not making recommending owns here when i making recommend but it is a real phenomenon it was described by we bars late seventy seventy eight or something that and roman models initially and what happens is that when you engage a no susceptive stimulus or a painful stimulus in a sight distal different from where the primary pain is it engage as a brain stem circuit that has descending pathways to the spinaccord and inhibits pain amazement pain inhibits pain it works it also is thought to have some contributions from higher brain centers we call this wholephinon the labors called the phenomena defuse noxious an history control or neck the human version of this is called conditioned pain modulation why i bring this up not only to help explain that father's actions somehow i do not think that he was thinking on my kids got a painfuline ah you now hand or finger he cut himself on it o slap off the side of the had he will feel better i do not think that is what was going through on to make him feel worse we did not go near the band saw without any more cautious let it probably did reduce the pain a little tat to some extent now where it is he is i maybe we will get into it later with chronic pain is in some chronic painful conditions the s p amen that redneck does not work fire miasma being one am pain inhibits pain ah is another narrow science concept related to pain that is rather cool well and ism sorry i missed your question no if you repeat no yo you're no in you answer the question and and a expanded on it in a it completely surprising and far more interesting way than i ever anticipated to thank you i ism betting that ninety eight per cent of people listening to this including myself have never heard that pain in habits pain incredible let us go back to heat and cold we briefly touched on heat but let us talk about the use of a count but therapeutic heat or therapeutic cold a cold pack for a a a you don't brush that really aches or maybe even a break or a sprain or heat you know the in the world of sport physio cold is now heavily debated localized cold is heavily debated a yo get people saying things i do not know if this is true that it creates a lodging of the of the fluids trying to head in and out of the injury o cold is not as good as heat heat allows for am the a inclusion and removal of waste products and there all sorts of just stories that people make up some of which might be true i do not know but what do we know about heat and cold as physiological stimuli in terms of their ability to ameliorate to help pain because of course if you get things hot enough for you get them cold enough you can create pain with heater cold but let us assume we are not getting to that level of heat or cold and one is in pain a when i was a kid we hat a hot water bottle that four times when we were sick we something but sometimes you of if i felt an ache on the side of but some hot water in t hot water bottle we on that thing want some cartons a defiling felt better sure sure well putting aside the contemporary controversies over the mechanisms you described which a i think very real and need to be sort out traditionally historically we tend o think of applying cold for the first forty eight hours or after an acute injury and then heat thereafter cold has some really cool effects cold a reduces inflammation reduces some of the release of those inflammatory chemicals we taught about prosaic land and side kinds historians am other coma kinds all these fancy terms for substances that densities the primary no succentor and it reduces the release of those and it reduces inflammation another cool thing often not appreciated is nerves do not fire is fast when they are cold and if you have got no susceptors that are firing and you put cold it is slowing the number of signals coming up and by definition it is reducing the the the ultimately the painter experiencing now heat heat has an obvious effect of increasing blood flow it is going to help ah relax muscles and get blood into those muscles and that is probably why you're putting that hot water bottle on ah and it just darn feels good and would what do i tell people in part i tell people use whichever works best for them ah i find there is huge individual variability and wether people heat or cold an within reason ah they are safe what do i mean within reason do not go putting an ice pack on an extremity for too hours you will get a frostbite you don't take care with that how cold should one make the point of their body that is in pain assuming of course that their nothing they give themselves frost bite meaning do you want to numb the area you will get past that point where it is a little bit painful and then the basically you are shutting down some marry pathways and you do not feel anything there it is numb and then you let the blood flow return when you remove the cold pack is that i mean it is a reasonable suggest coat ya well people i thing will appreciate that the a the specifics of that because ah you do not of course listeners this podcast often are instead in who body deliberate cold emerge in you now cold hours ice baths et camera most people experience those that somewhat painful as they get into them ye and then can experience some numbness when they get out is it possible to raise ones pain threshold through the regular exposure to pain and ways that are safe such as deliberate cold exposure assuming that one does not stay in too long it is not too cold ah and or through you do not time ut sports early or but just in general can we raise our pain threshold that life is less painful the short answer to your last question as yes ah the answer to you other question about a extreme cold and cold exposure which i know you have a lot of expertise s and you can teach me lot ominous stay in my wheel house a cause i ism not up on the literature in that space even in its intersection with pain am it is an intriguing concept ah i have to imagine that it make sense you would get some habituation ah with that repeated exposure i think one of the the questions it would come up with for instance the cold exposure and i do not know the answer to the putts ism sure maybe somebody out there does is is their crossmodality am changes and pain thresholds i mean if you expose yourself a lot to cold does it change your heat threshold i do not i would surprise be surprised if it did i would wore your thresher ethos are separate parallel pathways ye ye the a and as an aside i hate the cold but i do really well with the heat and does been ah found i think there is something genetic there ah i mentioned earlier around men and women and heat ah thresholds and i chose that specifically but each of these are different depending on the stimulus modality can you change ultimately your thresholds ye wear that involves is a lot of cognitive control it is a lot of cognitive training ah around that space and there is there is clearly approaches to that people have learned that there is different manipulations around that one experiment this wasn't intended least i do not believe they were measuring a heat thresholds ah ism college students soon and we we experiment a lot on students as as we all know we pay them well am and what they found is that when there studying use studying us when there was an attractive woman who was delivering the stimulus the thresholds were higher because the guide did not want a look a woos in front of this attractive young woman and that is been pretty well established the experiment or their gender ah plays a big roll in that as the reverse experiment also been to i do not i do not know i do not know just m but getting back to your point yes am i think through a number of a cognitive manipulations you can ultimately a over time change those thresholds another one area is exercises movement exercise clearly changes o those thresholds over time you ere probably building up am some increased and history tone through that process i to think at quick break and thank our son's are inside tracker inside tracker as a personalized nutrition platform the analyze s is data from your blood an liana to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health calls have long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long turn health can only be analyzed from a quality blood last i major problem with a lot of blood tests out there however is that you get information back about metabolic factors lipids and hormones and forth but you do not know what to do with that information with inside tractor they make it very easy because they have a personalized platform that allows you to see the levels of all those things metabolic factors lipids hormones et camera but it gives you specific directives hat you can follow that relate to nutrition behave oral modification supplements et camera that can help you bring those numbers into the ranges that are optimal for you if you would to try inside tractor you can go to inside tractor dot calm slash superman to get twenty percent off any of inside tractors plans again that is inside tractor dot calm slash supermen one thing fascinated by in the whole mindfulness space is this idea of whether or not under conditions of stress or in this case pain whether or not the most adaptive mind set assuming it is not a tissue damaging level of pain would be to think about something else distract oneself from the pain or conversely whether not one should quote q go into the pain for people who have chronic pain maybe it is in it a small are of the body that experiences chronic pain pain quite often ah a chronic pain or maybe it is whole body pain i do not think it really matters for the question ism asking and people are trying to develops some cognitive was of what we call as near a scientists you and i top down mechanisms for thing chapmen o distract myself from the pain ism in a focus on other things i really enjoy or rather ism going to we go into the pain meet the pain and realize signal somehow that it is not as bad it somehow there is a and again this becomes very opaque right we do not really know whoever talking about when we when we do these sorts of protocols but those sorts of things are out there in the mindfulness space and i think a i certainly take mindfulness seriously as as an intervention but what always bothers me about those sorts of interventions as ha lack the specificity in the grand clarity and there is no an a mechanistic logic to explain them and what would your thoughts on on meeting the pain verses distracting oneself from the pain let us break that down cause there is two concepts there as you alluded to and they are both effective and they both work differently one is attentional distraction where you are distracting yourself from the thing that is causing pain clearly works in a lot of people and that is why noted the strategies that we recommend for patients for people living with pain is to engage in distracting a activities read a book ism id go for a walk ism you spend time with friends and family in particular in the community and work to get your mind off of pain what we have learned is it that attentional distraction engages specific brain net works they tend to be some of the outer layer of bring net works and your referral quarter some in your singular quarter a in other regions which are clearly involved with distraction it is not necessarily that distraction has been a completely eliminate one's pain but it can reduce it a significantly and this is why the biggest problem with distraction from a time of the day is it night it is when people are trying to sleep staring the daytime you can read that book you can spend time with friends and family but people with chronic pain that have a twenty four seven you cannot distract yourself at night when you are trying to get into a relax state and fall asleep and that is why sleep is such a big issue for people with chronic pain attentional distraction it it works distraction works now what you said cumin the second piece you said kind of let us meet the pain if you will and there is different approaches to meeting the pain one approach that you invoked with mindfulness is addressing the pain from a non judge mental accepting manner ism aware of the pain is there i am not going to judge it ism not going to put a value on it is bad it is good or anything ism just gin a note its presence and that has been shown to work as well in fact actually when john habits in originally developed mindfulness stress reduction people low back pain plenty of studies have shown that it works have completed to some recent studies in email s are a as well and we are diving deeply into the data it is this non judgemental acceptance of you will of the pain sorry be as are theca were mindfulness based stress reduction email us are everybody should do end us are let me be have no financial relationship with any of this by the way but mindfulness basstress reduction has been shown a fact for anxiety for depression for pain just about everything i think they should put it into all the schools ah it is it is a great skill to learn no side of facts takes little bit are time to learn it and a it can be in some people effective and helpful for pain and that is the key that were on to keep coming back to is some of these things work for some of the people some of the time there is a third aspect of meeting the pain and that is more of a direct cognitive refraining about the meaning of the pain now you are coming at the pain and you have a an approach you are making effort on what you are thinking of the pain is that pain damaging threatening harmful or do you view it is yet it hurts but it is not harming me that is a critical critical aspect of pain management and that is serves as a foundation for something called cognitive behavioral therapy the the cool thing about a number of is is that there is actually different nor circuits engaged with these different approaches and am i think the key that we have to figure out this is were researches going is which approach works for which person under which circumstance interesting a it something you said about understanding the pain but not a over interpreting our catastrophising the pain seems important knowing the difference between being hurt or feeling hurt verses being injured as been something hat's been important to me i been involved in sports a where clearly pain was involved cam hurt but am my injured that is the first question have rolled an ankle ah it letting this hurts in my injured meaning in my going o be back ad it and an hour or to morrow verses ice broken bones and its you know great empathy for anybody that does tie when you are injured you feel a snap and you are out for a while in some cases a i think knowing the difference between being hurt and being injured is something that is of that key moment and for me it is always been experience as a moment of anxiety after feeling pain pushing a sort your ah i a ma my can have to take to was off or is this just pain i think for people to be able to recognize when pain is reporting an injury verses when pain is just reporting a temporary sensation is really important and perhaps also for psychological hurt verses psychological injury and that gets to some larger context themes these days of somebody says something it upsets us are we hurt are we injured right i think it gets very murky it is o how does one determined if they are hurt verses injured and then may we could even stretch into the psychological realm neither of us or psychologist but it sounds much of what you do represents the the bridge from the body into the mind and you be remiss if we did not talk about emotional pain as well yes what you just said your spot your spot on drew and tat one of the key messages the key mack's tips for pain management is to understand the distinction between hurt verses harm hurt it verses harm critical absolute critical lame allow me to illustrate with i patient i saw will not name names sometime ago guys in his fort's a master's level tennis player tennis is his life he is works i some executive somewhere but he lives for tennis comes hobbling in on crutches sit is down and he is got pain in his foot and he was told not to put pressure on his foot because he is got this injury no is can be worse and this has been going on now for months and he is now depressed cause he cannot play tennis teniasis his life disguise life is tennis i examine this guide and it turns out what he has as something called i moron's aroma and a moron's aroma is a fibrous thickening of tissue around the nerves that go to your those and it is gets to be his bundle tissue nerves and it is really painful ism it is very painful but it is not causing harm there is no harm there it is really painful explain this to the go and he looks at me would this lightbulb goes off he is you mean i can play tennis and a my gag you can go play all the tennis you want it just goes a hurt he got up he left the crutches and the example office and he walked away now that is an extreme example i do not want people please to think that that kind of thing occurs all the time it does not ism chronic pain conditions are often incredibly complicated and need much more than a forty five minute or sixty minute education session and back to the tennis sort he still had pain in his foot by the way but he could play but that gives that example of a dressing that fear and the anxiety are around that that issue and i think that is what we first have to learn is does that pain that we are experiencing represent something that is harming us that something that either need to seek a medical attention now or sometimes soon and whether does continued activity worse in the tissue injury or not in my world where ism carrying mostly for people with chronic pain we have moved beyond the tissue dealing by definition by one of the definitions for chronic pain is that the pain persists beyond the time of tissue healing in many of r sessions are times we are educating people hurt verses harm it is back pain we we evaluate this mine we make sure is the fine stable is there anythings sinister causing damage in most of the cases it is not and we help people understand that distinction critical critical for people and yet at the same time you do not want to just ignore something that is a real medical issue that is getting worse and needs medical attention and that is where the complexity of all this comes in did i answer your question if beautifully i think this distinction between hurt verses harmed is important for people to hear a perhaps you are willing to expand a little bit in terms of the psychological hurt verses harmed i man ism not asking you to comment on an social or generational shifts but we would be avoiding the obvious if we did not say that in the last ism really tend to fifteen years has been a pretty dramatic shift in terms of how society at large interprets emotional pain right people hearing things or seeing things and the idea that emotional pain could be related to physical pain or at least similar enough to it that people's emotional pain is valid right and if anything ism here to validate the fact that emotional pain is valid any other pain accept it is different because it becomes very hard to point to a specific an threshold reason that were t o lot to day but i think it is appropriate here threshold between hurt and harmed whereas if i tell you that my left foot hurts which it did a lot in high school and then you took an extra of my foot and highschool you would say your foot's broken cause it was broken a lot in high school and that is harmed i mean to continue to do what i was doing to break it in the first place i was harm clearly going to harm myself worse had to i to heal up but when it comes to psychological pain yo psychiatry has all these thresholds for normal functioning verses abnormal functioning or you sleeping well normal relationship and on and on we do not want to go there s it is not our place but how do you when you see patience how do you take in to account the level or the thresholds for their emotional pain because it is part of your job ism asking you this from the perspective of a somebody who treats pain how do you gage somebody is psychological pain is it by how intense lee they vocalized their pain or does it always go back to how well or poorly their life is being managed at the level of sleep nutrition relationships and forth you've great great set of questions s a lot in there let me first start off with something very simple i do not try to distinguish between this notion of psychological pain physical pain it is pain and of and of i think once i get into you get into this trying to distinguish as a psychological pain or psychogenic pain which was a terrible term or physical pain you end a putting value judgments on people and i do not think it serves as well when we are caring for the person in front of us if they are in pain ism addressing the pain the thing to note is at least in people t o come into our it standard ain management center an other pain centers is that remember pain is a sensory an emotional experience it is all rapped up and we want to treat the whole person sometimes we get we get easy we get easy ones and we just go do a nerve block and pain goes away and that is simple but usually it is much more complex we are were seeing the interaction a a an expression of pain that includes a significant amount of anxiety of depression you mention this term catastrophizing which we can break down if you would and that is probably one of the biggest predictors factors and ah and amplification of pain and worsening pain and pretreatment response is catastrophising ism i try to treat the whole person and not really parcel out all this i do it standard i you i built ta digital health system that captures measures a lot of data a round a patient's experience across physical psychological and social functioning and we use that data to target therapies to understand ism how much your depressive symptoms are anxiety anger anger big issue and pain huge in pain does it make it worse or better invariably it makes it worse yean you can break anger down in a couple different categories john burns and others has broken in in to anger adverse is anger out i enough that terms familiar with you ism anger out that is my father ism loud loud angry boisterous banging would quickly turn anything into an angry pirate anger out expressive yelling at the at the news yes yelling it somebody cuts you off and trap it usually yelling at the man ah it could he hate it is job ism anger in boiling simmering self contain seething that is anger and data seems to support anger in his is worse it is bad it is not assembly whether notes directed it some one external in both cases anger in an anger out can be directed someone external its a question of whether it is expressed outwardly or contained inside beautifully stated beautifully stated we cat anger depression anxiety i we kept sure fatigue sleep and t we try to do is again look a the whole person because they are not just to back if that is where there having pain ore not just a neck or a shoulder in your case it is impacting the whole person and we just got done talking earlier about how all these circuits interact with each other and sometimes we cannot just eliminate the no reception in the periphery sometimes we can reduce it but what we have to do is target everything and we have to try to target all these circuits up here and in many cases what we are doing is through education through pain psychology am through physical theropean realyreabilitative approaches on top of it and yes the medications we have now we touched base on a few earlier but we have over two hundred medications available for pain am very few of a meatier approved a we tend to steal from all the other fields you say but more than two hundred medications that can be yes prescribed for pain but as awfulabel treatments perfectly stated y there is only a few medications that are actually tier approve specifically for pain what we what we do is we borrow or steel from the psychiatrists some of their a their antidepressants ah which will frequently work very effectively for pain and work on those pain related circuits in the brain we a take from the neurologists some of the anti seizure medications because those medications m while reducing separately seizures for people who do not have seizures they work on i on channels am they work on other demodulators that also are involved in pain circuitry we can take from the cardiologists medications that work on the heart anti a rhythmiour hart rhythm drugs they are potent sodium channel blockers and the sodium channels as are responsible for the action potential that generates the nerve impulse signal and they are an or local anesthetic that you take and we we we take from everybody in our field in the medications getting back to to what you said just summarizing one i do not really distinguish a psychological verses physical pain and my world i i find it better just to treated as pain and look at the person holistically an go after all the components at once i find that is where we get the best results and it is typically bringing a lot of tools to bear speaking of tools to bear what rule if any does nutrition play in local worse whole body pain i critical and i think we are learning more and more and more about a the r one of good nutrition of healthy eating anting fumitory diets avoidance of foods that a triggers a and i incredibly under appreciated area you know have had my experiences with chronic pain am i developed an abdominal chronic pain problem a shortly after i turned fifty i was throwing a happy hour for our paint psychologists of all people wen to a medical restaurant i will not name which one got food poisoning that is what ism not naming it good medical food bad food poisoning and ever since that event i cannot eat anything in the onion family what ism familiar with onions but what else is an t union family i better you have research now pretty thoroughly considering what you are describing classic and what we refer to his for maps it is one of the for maps and i have now some issues with the others and am manifested by just severe severe up or nominal pain and a not many other symptoms but it put me on this journey where a severe abdominal pain did not know why could not sleep could not sleep went it'd go months without having a restful nights sleep i thought i was getting early all timers because i thought i was getting stupid and ism what actually benefited me was of all things the pandemic why cause what a we all do we isolated we started eating the same foods and i started noticing i was feeling better when i was eating certain foods my abdominal pain went away and it'd start doing as a scientist experiments and i finally was able to isolate and determine what the problem was now i have complete avoidance on that ism ism a little difficult to go out to a restaurant and have dinner but don't know onions noiniance and what ell shall its chimes scallions leaks anything in the onion family not album ism fine with garlic and by healthy eating by identifying something by triggers changed my life and return to a degree of normal see i think the key for people is if you have any kind of similar issues identify those triggers sometimes a isolation of foods or restrictions and using a journal and then as you learn from that slowly build foods back into your diet think it important for people to hear this and thanks for sharing your personal story round this because i think that nutrition well every physician seems to appreciate that called even nutrition matters defining what call nutria ton is is really difficult there is still have it even we could call them rancorous debates about this you of inverse is minor orders is this and but it sounds this is a case where it can become very individualized but i could imagine somebody going to their physician and that physician not being you and saying yet i notice that when i eat certain foods em in a lot of pain and the physician simply saying will do not eat those foods but unless that person is a train scientists not knowing how to go about doing the sorts of experiments that you did would be difficult impossibly ism sorry i know i interrupt you i just one of it's build on that if again one of the key things i simplified my story but the anything is as if i if i eat onions or anything an onion family it is pain for two weeks it is the thing is is if you get repeated exposures it never stops and it gets very very hard to figure out what it was it is not you eat something you get pain it goes away where we can all do that pattern recognition here you have to be able to think back what happened two weeks ago that may have influenced it it is not easy this may be a case for elimination diets which a a provide there done safely where people restrict the number of foods they eat to a very limited number of foods make sure they still get en tough calories and makrnutrians a the that they need prating fats in carbon hydrates or what it would have you but that by limiting the total number of foods of the eat is eat or ten basic things then you can build things in and then explore what triggers the pain or what removes the pain i do not really see any other way i am intrigued by the onion example even though it is it is a it is your case in particular we do not want extrapolate to broadly is there is something about onions that is triggering or particular nor a chemical or immune pathway o do we have any knowledge of why onions would create that kind of got pain this has been a journey have been on now for a few years to answer this i one of our i paddocks that we have come cling to linen to wind sent me a paper from i know seller nature that should that after i got infection it can change the genetic expression related to sensitizing you to food antigens i know i threw out a lot a jargon they're basically the short answer as you get in infection and you are got no longer responds properly to a normal food item and one explanation may be i got this infection is hat a medical restaurant lot of onions and i got sensitized through that infection now subsequently to onions i saw a a standard i alert just wanna afford whose awesome by the way and i after i had this i think figured out and i went in and unlike well i now doctor watforders or anything i can do for this and she laughed and he is know your doing everything it is all just avoidance and i thinking i was rather unique and special about this thing i said soever see this and she said oh i see us all the time every day i see this all the time and i like this isn't unusually si no i see this thing all the time and the sine meaning sensitive get iiiitet as certain to o certain to different these different food groups and this this thing that occurs later in life something an event that happens to somebody the triggers and i said will can that sounds a public health problem and she is that is what we are debating right now in the clergy community is whether this is representing more of a public health issue and is cause ism seeing i doctor afford i seeing increasing amounts of this as we go forward how interesting well am this is not a time to plug the philanthropic arm of or premium pad gasket ism very involved in science philanthropy that sounds an area to devotes see funding you to explore how foods are impacting the local and systemic pain response i i got in you ow ism running a large by marker studied a characterized people deeply and one of the things that i wanted to put in there as mycrobyum characterization now to be clear that is out of my wheel house but the beauty of being at standard and other major institutions as you can go make friends yet just in soninberg who is been a guest on this food gas is one of the world experts on the gutmycroby and we have a few others to her egos is a friendly my ism sure hill flavory we go we go make friends and people who understand the mycrobyum we collect the samples and that is where team science is magical and once again the idea looking at the whole person as long as we are talking about the gut am let us talk about pain inside the body because we talked about nocessceptors on the surface of the body and the pain that most people i immediately think of when you have a discussion about pain is yon pain on the surface are a broken bone or maybe hit pain or need pain or back pain but what about pain that resides deeper in the viscera i got pain a irritable bowel indium these things are ism learning a far more a common then am that i knew ism fortunate that am if have a stomach each er ahead ache mean something's wrong i rarely get those of it sometimes been go that younhough stomach of steal not because it is hard from the outside am but because i can eat pretty much anything although i pretty cleanly a lot of people rite to me and ask questions on social media about irritable ballsondrum and other forms of got pain and vier of pain pain that they feel is really deep within their system typically how is that sort of pain dealt with at a clinical level absolutely chiral pain is a different thing than what we have been describing a lot of which a somatic pain by the way it'll say is an aside i used to have a got of steel also i could oh no down anything any time anywhere and there was a lot of grief and loss associated with not being able to eat certain foods and a that is also something people have to come to grips with am but getting back toe visceral pain the thing about sematic pain that is another term now sematic meaning the soma the the the extremity that you are alluding to is the no susceptors there a very precisely localizes where the stimulus the painful stimulus is coming from when you hit your thumb with a hammer exactly were that pain occurred with the visceral pain what you have are very defuse what we refer to his receptive fields think about you last time you had a stomach ache it is not that you put your thumb right here he said i in hurts likeness the olestra whole stomach it is because those receptive fields are very large their broad they are not as well localized and part the reason for that type of broad receptive field is you are not trying to get away from localized danger when people get stomacates its often a very broad area when you get pelvic pain it is the same type of thing now there some fascinating stuff that occurs with visceral pain because the fibers that extend from the viscera meaning the the lungs the abdomen the pelvis they all head under the spinal cord to and it just happens that they make kind of indirect direct connections with the same level that represents the body let us think about pelvic pain for instance you frequently will find people that say had that have pelvic pain the will describe having lower back pain to and it is because of this visceral sematic convergence in the spinal court it is not that there something going on in their back it is at these signals that are being driven heavily from the pelvis are coming in in connecting with the same regions from the back and the convergence of that is now being perceived as pain in both and were we we are seeing that more or more in the research this viceroy sematic convergence people have pain in their pelvis and and also over their abdomen am classic one that ah we are aware of we see this in the levy the movies and unfortunately realize for heart attacks the visceral fibers that subserve the heart typically the verse through the fourth thoracic red ion well those converge i in the spinaccort in similar regions that subserve sensation under the arm a d sphere that is why people often say they have got pain with a heart attack radiating down into their arm the left arm tote left arm the heart is on the left side exactly i after people get abdominal surgery sometimes some blood can leak out and it will slip underneath the diagram the diaphragm is subserve by some of those neck regions three four and five of the service which happens to also cover your shoulder and you will get people after a nominal surgery this and my shoulders really hurting me doc and what we do is we first check to see know could something have happened during anas know during placemen just make sure there is nothing wrong but frequently it is due to irritation that is again one of the magical mysteries it fascinating about pain seems a good point to bring a reference pain i or is what you are describing an example of reference pain miner san of reference pain is that no what for instance i have got a slight bulgiest i think my lumbar three four disk or something i had a whole body scan recently just a i an exploration scan was i had the opportunity not not anything serious fortunately and there is a slightly bulged is there and every one's in a while if i do certain movements i in the him it'll get pain down in my right hip an sometimes going down my leg an sitting yo as sciatica cause i you some anything on the right back side case must be wallet induced sit static a back pocket while it into sciatica i but what i eventually realized is that well it is this divulge just happens that the nerves that emit from that that region i they branch out to butcher differing areas and you think the pain is in your leg but the the issue is some place else or i an occasionally indeed i feel the pain elsewhere my body is well it is or a a matching of regions for pain that seem unrelated is that a way to think about reference pain perfectly the the the examples also i referred to of a hard attack causing referred pain or also the pelvic region associated with back pain is a way of i referred pain i what your describing is the fact that pain does not have to start with an injury or a stimulus in the periphery you could damage untie nerves anywhere along the way and that will be perceived as pain we refer to that is narrow pathic pain that is another distinction you brought up a nicely good good seaway into there is thought to be am several different types or categories of pain we have been talking through much of this time about somatic pain then injury out here we talked about visceral pain and when you have damage to a puerperal nerve damage injury to a puerperal nerve or the central nervous system we refer our that is new pathic pain it frequently has different qualities different characteristics people will refer to it is shooting stabbing shock burning it can frequently when there is a damage to a nerve or damage to certain regions of the brain beingcredibly challenging to treat by the way the good news is with that a light discopulge is the vast majority of time the discs re absorb e i have to be careful to not it do too much a spinal affection sit up said stuff i thought that that would help ut that she does not strengthen the back it was actually a a symmetry between the abdominal muscles and the low backmuscles is provided i dead a lot of back extension type the training then that bulge more less says in i just have to be little cautious not too cautious fortunately as long were took about referenced pain somatic visceral and all the rest what about associative or reference pain wear it is psychological and i do not want to get too abstract here but more and more these days i hear from people who say i was in this job and the job socked or i was in this relationship in the relationship socked and i had terrible back pain really acute localized back pain or chronic headaches or my grains and then they go on vacation or they change their circumstances and lone behold therein goes away does that surprise you as an expert an pain note at all note at all mature at simple a simplistically referring to as there people are undergoing stress and we have we clearly know that the brain is not a passive recipient of information coming in from the body it is a today street the brain is causing down stream consequences in the body the brain a controls are sympathetic nervous system and part sympathetic nervous system the sympathetic being the fight and flight response it controls the tone of a cortoissal that is being released and we all know that and acute situations rapid increases of cordial and am nor adrenalin is keeps us away from the lions and tigers in the bears om i but in a chronic situation and a robot supulsky as at standard has built a career around chronic stress at least in part and very bad for us and these chronic stressor impact the andorra the tissue and it is real pain it does not mean that we need to go get back surgery it means at probably we need to identify the stressor that are contributing to that and address those and we will often fine then the senoras you outline that the pain gets better am some of those targets are interesting i there is a lot of memory associated with pain this is where early life events occur and those early life events in injuries nonsensitive us to future vulnerability i was in a car act bad carabiner when i was sixteen ah fortunate to walk away from it got bad whiplash if i get stressed a lot of my pain manifests in my neck for me as a pain back it is a signal to me that is go work out go for a walk in the forest ah and take some time away from the computer again that is a simplistic message and my experience does not translate into everybody else but ism just validating everything hat you you said let us consider the opposite senate which is positive emotions a you have done some very nice studies exploring how being in positive relationships being in love in fact an change our perception that is our experience of pain and probably does it real physiological levels as you mentioned earlier psychological is physiological invite verse it is hard to separate the two but fund you share with us a what you did in that study and what you found because i find it really interesting and it also points to the incredible power of love in how we experience life ye yet i think there is several cool things about that study that i love to share one is how it all came about a us narc science keeps often go to the society for narc science as an annual meeting and i was hanging out and a sharing the room with art air and who studies passionate love and he and his wife study passionate love and were having a glass or two of wine and maskanard if you ever a we we ever studied pain is i study love he's have you ever study we now i study paint is hen me ever study the intersection another glass of wine no let us do it we came back to standard and there was a young stock jerked younger who is now a professor at the universyalabama and i said jerked writhing on a fault flat in her face or began a this is going be a cool study and jerked took this on great job what we did is we advert iced on campus for couples in an early phase of a romantic relationship because there is a reason for choosing that in an early phase of a romantic relationship you are deeply focused on your beloved they are on your mind all the time you feel great when you are with them you feel terrible when you are not with them does not that just sound an addiction i means that yearning i do not know that is is can be a pleasant experience that but addictions for the people who are using the substance can find it in that early phase very pleasant but it it turns out that the early phase of a romantic relationship engages the same nail circuitry's as a diction interesting same reward circuitry all that we chose that and we said come to us in bring pictures of your beloved and bring pictures of an equally attractive acquaintance clothed this is not sex that were studying clear clothed and we cause them pain in the scanner and and and we paid them afterwards am we needed a control condition for this because thinking about your beloved is very intentionally demanding member we talked about attentional distraction earlier we gave people what is called a word generation task very simply a can you think about every sport that does not involve a ball frizzy hack a boxing oh that is intentionally demanding think about every vegetable that is not green n your bring the three had and were causing you pain it is an attentional distraction task we flash people pictures of their beloved cause paying flash people of their acquaintance causepain an an distraction o what a we find love works great love works great it was a wonderful anal mesic it is significantly reduced people's pain and it turned out the more in love you were the more pain relief you got when viewing the photo of the person you love yes win viewing the photo of the person you love now how did we know how much in love they were it turns out the psychologists have got scales for everything and one of them is a passionate love scale which ask how what percentage of the day are you preoccupied thinking about your beloved oh goodness you just sent people now off to give their partners the passionate love scale that drug out how much time they are spending thinking about them yet we we had standard student some of them thinking about their beloved eighty per cent of the day i wanted to use thus as a screening tool for our resident applicants because a why i want them focussing on patience not their beloved and that is by the way a joke that bad joke but but it probably i is t real world were not just to i about standard coming oh no when somebody is writing you a script or a prescription that is ore giving you advice a yet you may want to know if they are in it a new romantic relationship yet that the the other i thought the other a cool thing about this study was attention worked also but attention and love worked on different circuits attentional distraction they worked equally well attention again worked on some of these prefrontal regions these outer cortical areas love worked on more of what we classically think of as these reward was circuits the nuclei seccumbents on the amygdala a one of the the descending a brainsten regent called the substantial night chichis coming down from the brain through that area to the spinalcord to inhibit pain classic addiction pathway classic and the key again message for people is a different what we would think of his psychological approaches engaging different brain circuits to reduce pain it'll leave you with one last a side note that we did not publish on and that is a greed went back a year later and we a messed the students strength of their relationship coming was still on going and he found that there was a rather high correlation between the love induced anal media and brain activity and the caudate nucleus and in the answer with the strength of the relationship a year later it was we had a brain scan that was a predictor of future a strength of a relationship could you tell us the direction of those results if a new romantic partnership is a creating high levels of activity in these two brainareas you just mention then it is a very good predictor that the relationship will yes survive overtime well in this limited sample it meant that it it was going to be very strong a year later ism understand and we always have to put these caveats sh unpublished non pure reviewed it was a fun postal date analysis that ism not sure if anybodies of er run with those kind of things no but we can explore it in it in a playful way now and people can do with it what they will it does sort of speak to something important though a assuming that result would hold up if the same experiment were done and may many hundreds of thousands of people for speaks of the idea that the activation of these addiction circuits in the early phase of a passionate love relationship set in motion a certain number of things that create stability in that relationship which on the face of it a make sense but we have also all heard at the opposite way of well as well which is am fools rush in or that a things that start fast and fast or things that but here you talking about am the early phase of fashion serving the interesting role in terms of anorexia a alleviating pain but also predicting some stability of the relationship over time is kind of interesting it is fascinating to talk about i you i feel i have to put that chavioding that not generalizes but a fun thing to tame it and it is where i think cool scientific ideas can come from for future exploration that i think that is also what is pretty need am i find the am again the different circuits for different approaches to reducing pain fascinating again that gets to the question of as me earlier are one circuit and the answer is now what we have to do is figure out what is the best circuit for a particular person or set of circuits if you are willing it'd to talk about opioid first if you could educate us on indigenous opioid the opioid that we make inside of our body that we do not that meaning nobody takes as a drug and then how that in forms opioid that people take i mean clearly the called opioid crisis is a concern many people addicted t opioid people have died from taking too many opioid but presumably some people of benefit from these opioid drugs as well up to talk about that and then it'd to also talk about some of the am things that a adjacent to the prescription opioid things cradle which right now or peans for have called into question as to whether or not they will continue to be legally available over the counter first and foremost whatever the indigenous opioid how do they work and that i think we will set the stage for the rest yow we all have these and dozens and capelins and orphans that am act as pain killers they are a analgesics they are a natural substances and all of us that get expressed ah there is a certain indigenous tone to these that some have a done research on here again hero did research on this and stepped rule an others on showing that higher and dogeinousopoid levels may am lead to less emotional reactivity for instance am thank god we we know we have and dozens opioid sir we know we just could not handle it am what chemist of figured out is how to bring in an exogenous opioid and morphine was the prototypical one out from the h from the copy and since then medicinal chemist have built on variations of morphine and created other compounds some again variations on morphine some a purely synthetic the foxy codon could asccuestion because unfascinitg by the history of these things how did ere wen end or wended somebody look at the copy and then say ominous art eating copies r isolating things from copies and realize that the morphine thousands of years ago as copies have been use for very long long long time these things have been around am this is a this is old school work that is only been refined in more contemporary history and the whole topic of opioid is such an incredibly controversial area and i i feel i have to you have to understand the speaker might in this case me might no one's position on this am my usual montes i am not proopioid i am not antiopiod i am probation i have seen opioid positively transform people's lives help them get back to work spend time with friends and family relieve suffering particularly in situations a and of life but also in people with chronic pane and i have seen opioid destroy lives at a personal level i come from a family background deep deep in addiction i have lost close loved family members to addiction and ism respectful of that what have learned is to not get into this binary mode of thinking it is either this or it is this but to treat ovoids as a cognition as a tool to be used in certain circumstances in some people not typically as a front line or first line agent am typically much later down if they have failed other therapies you cannot approach the challenge of opioid ah without appreciating the deep complexity that were faced with particularly now in society with all of the the litigation on going and all the the money involved i it is a it is a highly want's topic what what what more would you to talk about opioid i think that most people hereabout the opioid crisis and just assume that they are quoting over prescribe that people are given opioid drugs as a front line treatment perhaps more than they should that the addictive component which i understand is very real that the potential friction is very real am as well as the potential for am cross interactions with other things alcohol am and perhaps even other elicit drugs the street drugs perhaps a people cannot fill their prescriptions a and tolerance to the opioid creating issues were people that and more of them there do i have a not close family member but a us distant family member who had his entire life it arranged beautifully is a practising lawyer with a beautiful wife and family had a back injury a was prescribed ox contain it it helped him initially but then it it set off some behavioral psychological pathways the had him seeking more forging prescriptions when the understood the law he was a lawyer i he eventually went to jail got out the same thing happened again he eventually ended up debt right and i think there are many examples of that that we hereabout in those a very salient and very disturbing very saddening i think that most people and clean myself here the opioid crisis and assume that what we really should be doing as seeking a better alternative but what ism hearing from you is that there are use cases where opioid make a great deal of sense and that they have really helped improve people's lives and that none of what i just describe or anything it as experience by those people in that quite the opposite do i have that right perfectly and and that is again where we we we need to treat these at an individual level on the case by case pass a and that one size does not fit all a yes opioid were over prescribed i think everybody agrees to that in this country am and we went through period of time with massive over prescribing anis a lot of new ants and reasons why in large part a physicians we get terrible education around pain and we do not had ta treat it in general coming out a medical school wo get about seven hours of education on pain a veterans get forty great if your taking i think your dogs name as castellan yet anfortuna he passed but he longsome pain mess for a short while but i found an alternative treatment that worked far better perfect which turned out to be by the way logos to stostrone he was castrated he was fixed on air hunger am and i it is interesting i have gone i have said publicly on very large skilled casts that i gave my dog logos to stostrone later in life and ameliorated a lot of his aches and pains at least from what i understood as he start moving better and feeling better and sleeping better and i expected the denary community come after me with pitch forts not one we did that and yet i heard from hundreds of veterinarians it said yes we wish that we could prescribe those sorts of things to people who castrate their man dogs later in life to ampliate their symptoms a that opened up to me a whole a world of understanding about some of the restrictions that get that that is face and turns to what they prescribe there is a whole discussion to be had about that will do a series on animal and health that health great the that is oilier healthy to you get the point now but when it comes to the opioid crisis and this discussion you i think it is become o laden with the idea that doctors are on the take they're getting paid to give opioid to nations and that is why they are doing that and id i do not believe that necessarily the case but i think that is what the public perception is that it is all financial here is the here is the thing i were their bad docks doing bad things yes ism ism going invoke a a good for o in teeth humphreas that's no ya specific terrific i psychologist who is in addiction medicine ah psychologist and public policy person and the way he breaks it down and lavs a subscribe to this is there is three types of physicians remember there is about a million physicians in this country bout a million i you have got physicians doing the right thing for the right reasons vast majority docs we need to leave them alone we need to support them we need to help them do their job and not put more obstructions in their way there is a much smaller group of docs doing the wrong thing for the right reasons what i mean by that is these are docks who did over prescribe opioid is in this case in this conte they i did buy in to the marketing messages that were put forward they did not have much education around alternatives entreating pain and they thought by handing out pills just pills ah in their very brief visits with patients remember primary parados is my heart goes out to them you water they get fourteen minutes or with the nation they gave them something that they thought would help they were doing the the wrong thing for the right reasons but they believe that they were helping they did not awe they were not get catching financial incentives was broken god's right those people we need to educate them we need to train them on proper pain management enjoy prescribing deeprescribing and then you have got the tiny little group at the top of this if you will pyramid these are a docs doing the wrong thing for the wrong reasons these are bad docks these are your pill mills these are people breaking the lot they need to go to jail and of i the thing is i is that little group at the top in the million sophysicions we have in this country it represent such a small representation but it got blown out by the media and everybody else particularly those docks doing the right thing for the right reasons got caught up in it an engender huge amount of fear huge amount of fear on the physician side and then what happened is the docs just started abandoning nations they cut their patients off i i had a young housewife to young kid s a dock cut her off from a little bit of ice in that she was taken intermittently for am ism some backing that had been well managed on this he was doing all the right things cut er off she turned to black tar heroine am californium great state of californium tried an experiment where they monster death certificates in our state for and the docs prescribing opioid for that and a they went off to the docs thinking that if they targeted the docs doing that it would lead to a reduce a reduction and olio deaths it led to a doubling i know counter intuitive because what happened is the docs abandoned the patient and we have to be aware of the negative consequence is of this now the current not trying to minimize the opioid crisis cause it is real but we also now need to put some contacts the paid crisis is being driven by the elicit sentinels tit is more if you have just look at the sexy sedate it is very clear that the sentinels coming an my a mexico china and others ah is what driving most of the deaths am kith am getting back to kith led a beautiful ah lance it standard commission on the north america opioid crisis and put together very rational plan i just finished serving as a senior adviser to the melcaboar to californium will we revised or prescribing guidelines here they were very draconian before hard limits made people fearful both patience and docks and we have shifted it back over to put the control back in the hands of the physician patient relationship a we are hoping it will make a difference you can see i i ism going on ta bit here there is there is just huge complexity in this space ah i understand youreging to do an episodunos on some time on it the future and i hope the audience has more opportunity to listen to this other questions i can answer for you that on that i really appreciate the thoroughness of your answer am i think that you set a picture in a contact that i certainly did not understand or appreciate a and it sounds one certainly not the only but one of the major issues is the creation and the propagation of a black market by doctors cutting off patience presumably out of fear am those patients then seeking not any but a elicit for black market routs to treating their pain which you can understand why they would do that i mean ism not justifying any one doing anything y legal but somebody is in pain and they had something that worked and now they do not they on to go looking for things that are similar to that thing and due you are telling us that sentinel in street drug spastically is what is killing people presumably i doubt it is vent an old prescribed by physicians or perhaps it is it is not no there used to be a bit a confusion around that because sentinel is a prescribed medication in a patch form and in torch the those use for end of life cancerpain but unfortunately some of the coming used by the red a in otherwise got that confused with the pelican it took a while to get a better handle on it but i think we know we do now yes most of it is being driven by the sentinels and we are just seeing this incredible epidemic wave of it it can be made cheaply brought across the borders reasonably easily a something we deftly need to to address we want to be careful about not conflating that crisis with the issue of pain which is an epidemic in its own right and for the segment of people who are using opioid responsibly and effectively for their pain a and that is where again that new ants comes in am are the patients who are also on opioid that have been ween down you can wen them down gently compassionately and they do better a the answers yes ah my partner beth is just finishing up a study on that and showing that with compassionate care a number these patients can be ween down who voluntarily want to come down and sometimes the find their pain actually improves and part of that improvement may be that opioid have degrees of side effects and by elimination of those side effects and the the other aspects there seeing improvement could you list off some of them were a commonly used opioid a morphine and it is a commercial livers a commercial deliberivatives m es contain which is a longlasting version of morphine ox condone which by itself is a short acting medication but when you encapsulated in a long acting version it becomes ox contain which was the trade name that produce a put forward a sentinel we mention comes in a patch form ah there are mixed agents li a tram it all which is a count of a week poi but also has some a wat called serotonin and oriproneferand a retaken ambition ah we have got devoted which is aversion o a trading for hydro morphine there is a slew there is id a more than twenty different opioid within that list of two hundred medications that we have methadone is another one a people usually think of methadon is a medication used to a treat addiction people go to method cleaned it is a long lasting opioid and the right person and certain circumstances that con be used effectively for chronic pain a by en large they all have the same or similar mechanisms of actions working on opioid receptors this is getting back to your original question to me about where these things work there are opioid receptors in the prefer there are rich sources of opioid receptors in the spinal cord in the dorsal a the a back part of the spinal cord and then there are many areas in the brain that are rich and opioid receptors it is it is all a naturally occurring area when we put in an opioid my mouth we are binding to those receptors and activating those nerd circuits in many cases when i say activating they have an inhibitory roll i mean that is one of the major parts is there any roll for benzine propenes in pain relief rarely if to i many of my colleagues would say show it just a hard know a an did it'd have to come up with an edge condition of somebody who has a generalized anxiety disorder poorly treated with antianxiolitics with chronic pain and the would not you find you treat their anxiety with a benzol at helps with their pain as well but these are a conditions a fine large know what about cradle i had a am a odd experience with cradle and have never taken it a the experience was the following i started learning about it hearing about it a from listeners on the podcast realized by doing a little bit of a research that it is available over the counter and that certain people to take it often every day it lordoses or even hidroses and that there was huge variation in terms of the amount of cradle in the various products and how much people were taking some people talking about trade as something ass if it were innocuous and we can ask whether not indeed it is innocuous and i put out a a treat i guess now that twitter is called ex i guess i put out and ex anyway does not matter and i and i said that my a first pass view of the literature on cradle the scientific literature is that you had a lot of property similar to opioid although different as well and that it seemed an have odd and maybe even problematic that it was widely available and i got bombarded with a i don't wat to call them cradle enthusiasts because what i soon discovered was that these people am were angry with me for a placing even a partial shadow on cream but what was interesting to me was that they were saying that in their case and ism assuming they were telling the truth that cream had helped them get off prescription opioid and that they heavily rely on cream in various the levels of dosage am in ways that they felt really help them and two things happen one have been put in the crossfire of the profit cream community not tit severe extent but perhaps the more important thing is and i one i thank that community ah in part for now it is inspired me to do a deep dive search on cream ism going to be interviewing one of the laboratories that is done a lot of the research on cream a later and a twenty twenty four but also it it is made me realize that there these compounds there available over the counter that many people feel passionately about because they really feel its helped them not saying it hasn't not saying it has not but then again have never taken it what is trade at ere perhaps what receptors does it tickle and what re your thoughts about cream and people using made and maybe on pronouncing it wrong have also heard crate home card i ism calling it trade ye a trade is this natural substance that does have as you said opiodergic a properties as well as others that is not fully understood it is been available were naturally for many many years brought in to the united states and have heard the same stories and i just want you to be prepared that anything i say about cream there is going to be some angry people after this and it is what it is am i have heard the same stories that you have heard about people taking trade an saying its helping then to stay off of a prescription opioid or elicidopioids and i get that i think in some way it is binding opioid receptors and reducing the a natural craving for these other substances and it makes perfect sense a method does that a pbuperonorphine which i did not mention before bet is a is an interesting opioid that a binds to these receptors and it reduces craving am were i have challenges is en ah just because something is natural does not mean that it is safe we are seeing and increase number of overdoses death's associated with cream am is it jolly substance can some cases it is but i think there is a lot we do not know jolly substance people then trade but also conga haul a benzols getting back to the beans am personally i think we need to put a lot of research into this agent and if it merits that i think it should be a a prescribe substance i think part of the challenge that we have is that we do not under stand the quality the purity the dose the people are taking of this thing ah similar typofstory with anabas by the way ah is ism hoping that we are going to get the research that we need to really understand what it is doing and whether it is safe and effective ism left with a lot of unknowns right now you mention anabas is anabas effective and by extension is c b d effective for managing pain yet there is another controversial one you will get a few comments about whatever i say in general listeners of this pods yes they tell us where there upset they'll also tell us where they agree i re go heres in ever to am satisfy everybody but just to some of this lands in in the realm of highly educated opinion am some of it is still as you point out speculations we do not really know what crate sources people are taking or anabas at camera but i i think you will find and my experience has been that ism people appreciate that we are having the conversation and we do read all the comments and those comments often as i mention in my earlier anecdote about that treat ism often direct us to explore things further and we can always have a a second discussion about this down the lines hat we invite all your comments and criticism anabas well here is what we know and carefully controlled laboratory situations anabas has been shown to reduce naturopathic pain that is that nerve related pain from people who have either nerve injury a diabetic neuropathy a post dramatic narrallege a terrible burning nerve pan condition it has been shown to reduce that in small samples from larger scale epidemiology studies and even larger clinic bay studies that have done we find it has not been particularly helpful on average compared toe people not on a anabas there is a lot we do not know about the causality of that and the direction of it but all to say that there are i many many questions it remain i i think the challenge that i personally have is that we are running huge population level experiments as we speak right now by you no providing unfetter id use of anabas and the bad news is is that we are probably gong to see some real untoward consequences of it were already are ism the good news is ism hoping that at a state level we will be able to use that data to really in form ah what is going on with anabas i mean some of the challenges or what i refer to crate a anabas is not anabas is not anabas your headless empire e to s d a show the dose yes all of that we do not know what you are getting it remains a schedule one drug by the d i i in some of my leadership rolls and others have called for scheduling of it as a schedule too why why not to purposely try to restrict use but by making it a schedule to drug you have now made it much easier to research i do not know if people understand how many barriers there are to scientist studying schedule one drugs could you explain schedule one verse schedule to thank you yet schedule its the scheduling of drugs is a categorization that describes their abuse liability and you have drugs p c p heroine a anabas which are schedule one which are defined is having high addiction potential and no a utility which has almost wild because when i think about p c p f and cyclist n i certainly do not want people run out in starttaking p c p but chemically and physiologically p c p is ever similar to creamy and u a rarely is ais discussant chedemine is now a widely used as a therapeutic presume my chedemine is not schedule too a maybe even schedule three yes ad i some of that the the stuff that is thrown into schedule one makes no sense it is historical it is all is it is decades and decades ago of history and clearly anabas should not be a schedule one handstand no question a by scheduling it tho you will have this recital benefit of being able to make it more easy to study and then you get the ani h an the f d an to this and we can start really getting answers to the questions which do i think it works at the end of the day do i think there is some variation of calabash t h c c b d ratios that will provide some benefit oh absolutely there is too many receptors in our brain that are involved with modulation of pain i just do not know what this are am friend of mind a mark walls a runs pain at u c can dingo has come up with a really nice recipe cocktail of ratios of t h c to c b d that he feels very strongly that he can help people ism using that as an active agent i know that in a colorado there is a strain of cannabis were the it is pure c b d not h c think they call it harlot's web and parents of children with intractable epilepsy will action move to the stay to colorado in order to get it because it seems to be effective for the treatment of certain forms of pediatric epilepsy though a shared with me with one of our colleagues rowan willies when o you last on the part guess these plantable compounds have have their place wither not crate perhaps right we that remaining open about that we are analysts the the tee see or the seemed or some commination thing it is really interesting i think it's laws we toying about plant compounds how do you view the fields that are what i word call somewhat adjacent to traditional medicine things acupuncture caerpractic physical therapy and forth as a pain physician a within the field of pain medicine or pain management i think about six broad categories of therapies that we provide for people with chronic pain one of these is the medications and there is a whole large group of categories of medications of two hundred or a available too nerve blocks a an procedures these range everything from trigerpoin injections to nerve blocks with local inaseticonstairrigt on up to mentally invade if procedures sponicord simulators a implantation of drug delivery pops three psychological and behavioral therapies pain psychology which has many forms now can be very effective for physical and occupational therapy approaches to chronic pain five this is what we we visually call complimentary alternative medicine approaches it is a little bit of an putative turn but i think of that is acupuncture neutrasuitacles these are the over the counter agents that have actually shown to haw benefit in pain that you can get over the counter and last and not least six what i call self empowerment are increasing your agency and here it is about education it is a to a learning skills it is abs being here on the human in a lab podcast learning about pain a it is it is that self empowerment and what we find is it this six categories all brought together typically have the best benefit for people living with chronic pan to a lot of people listening to us right now then go yet acupuncture i m this is a you thousands or tens of thousands of years practice that clearly is grounded in a lot of clinical data and clearly works and then other people will go omiginnes the time i acupuncture sticking needles in the body are they just pain treats pain as that what is about but am as you and i both know unless it is being performed a incorrectly acupuncture is not painful to receive does acupuncture help treat certain forms of pain is there any ye lipidic basis yes yes there is a do i understand what is going on with acupuncture having completed an caul and an i each funded acupuncture study i just saw that a published no a yet ism tat ism just been straight a we still do not know exactly how acupuncture is working a we do know that there is a nice study that showed a motivation of perfroladenacine receptors that have a puerperal analgesic effect we know that acupuncturist as compared to sham acupuncture engages differing brain regions it is interesting that many of the act points overlie serial nerves and by needling those nerves are we causing a central change were turning down the amplifier if you will in the brain maybe i where does this fit into my clinical use my usual statement is that if you can afford the wallet by ops give it a try although find a really good acupuncture's have oh yet yet have had acupuncture done i i wound say many times but several times and i will say this i one of the acupuncture's i went to put needles in my face and i ended up having to go to stamford term to get some of the angiomas that were blood vessel growth that was the consequence of there needle insertions and to the point where i will not if i go to acupuncture i do not put anything do not putty needles in my face cause it'll take an angioma my labor weaver i do not care and i it is not vanity but i did not the way that the needles were introducing angiomas to my face now that was probably because this acupunctrous was not doing things correctly not saying all acupuncture do that but here is the problem how do which acupuncture's are reliable versus not and for that matter how do which physician is reliable versus not may i work at an institution stamford where i can ask a lot of people and i still mi i senior administered will not this but when i get a recommendation from a dock at stamford i always call somebody you see us f and crosscheck and i do not tell them that ism cross checking and it'll do the reverse as well when i when i was at you see sanding i would check up with stamfords an most people do not have access to that kind of community i mean i can pick up the phone and contact somebody in preach any medical specialty and at multiple institutions but for most people they are waiting into the abyss of acupuncture's of physicians i mean how are people'spliss to navigate this you found a perfect way to do it many of us do the same thing and for those who do not have access to high quality experts you can use variations of that you are right with acupuncture most the ones have been associated with e use in the clinic or outside or all have been high quality the recommendation would be to try to get a a refer or recommendation from somebody who refers to that acupuncture's docks want to have relationships with people with other clinicians that do a really good job we do not want to be referring to somebody who bad cause it reflects badly on us it is really doing what in a way what you were doing try to connect with your primary care doctor others and get some recommendation am for who is high quality i with regard to clinicians pain physicians for instance that is tough there is five to ten thousand of us that subspecialty trained out there if your pain is really complicated a complex pain problem you are probably better off with a torture refer center that can provide comprehensive services we are possible is there a is there a centralized website where people can say o a live in the state of i war i a mayor a lot of our listeners ore over sees or where people can find out the the of the readings based on patient experience although that can be complicated i confess sure the one star at of five star raiding a ergo bit more kalian there been studies on this people tend if you see a negative review those tendograb your attention even if there fewer of them than the many thousands of positive revise but i mean patient should be able to get the information that they want about previous patients experience right ye i got to tell you the a the patient ratings i it is a highly manipulated situation i how well you can pay companies to help jack up your ratings i say that is it is rather was i see it in the community on on deflation of rate mi yes inflation of raisings and then you inflated and it overcomes any of the negative was i we have not of taken an approach ah on this and maybe that is naive of us ism young we see twenty five thousand patient visits a year and only a tiny percentage of them put some rating and it is probably the extremes undoubtedly but we do not manage it i know that in many community settings that they do i did not answer your question is there a reliable source a quality i still think at the end it is on o be a relationships and word of mouth and refer i do the same thing you do i to see how a water the florist i ask my primary paradox at san for who is the best who is the person that knows the most about food related issues will some really untrepernurial guys gallery group of guys gals will put together a website and a or something that really addresses this problem head on wat is i think o a very few things more useful then a truly independent way of understanding pair patient experience and finding the best person for a particular problem and i think a i can help with us but i think a i and human interface anyway somebody out there should do it am i curious about car practice for a lot of people gan a not car plasterers let us not talk but the people specifically but care practice a lot of people put acupuncture and car practice am adjacent to one another but my understanding is that insurance often will cover acupuncture but not car practice work a maybe i got that backwards or maybe em just all out wrong but with car practice work you are talking about often the attempt to relieve a compression of nerves certainly nerves are being manipulated if any part of the body as being manipulated get's manipulates kind of a word that imply something a sinister is happening has been am adjusted am what re your thoughts about carpracters assuming the carpractor is well trained and responsible can it help pain can it help backpack neckpain whole body pain y first wall a accupuncturous and carpractic or to entirely different profession russjust a just one clear for people and they some times get lumped into a similar category a pain treatments and that may beware a you now that comes from a just closing out on the acupuncture again a just to sunrise yes in some patience and some circumstances have found acupuncture to be useful and it is worth the try see mess a center ifomedicar ah is now paying for acupuncture for people over the age of sixty five a medicare f for medical patients that something recent and a we were happy to see that i believe that was for back pain that should be fact checked ah but cover practice mixed data ah well controlled studies some of shut some have shown that it can be helpful for low back pain a some have shown it is not it is it is truly not clear a the type of carpractic that involves a the does not involve kind of can of the the fast high velocity manipulation is a physician i have some concerns about that particular around the neck alive taking care of patients that have had vertebral artery directions from ism that rapid wrenching what is a liberty very dissection one of the the the main arteries that goes a from the body to the brain in the back portion of it is called the vertebral artery and ah when you do these high velocity manipulations ah there is a risk it'll be it small of having a direction or an emails thrown off and have had lake a stroke it is that it is a s a stroke am but there is a lot of approaches that can be done that ah in some patients have shown some shown some benefit i think the key with a number of these therapies and i soft want to single lad act acupuncture or cower practice if you go to them ask yourself an mi getting durable benefit meaning everybody feels good after a message right but couple few hours later it is count o worn off s a nice experience in the moment for most people if you are finding that for a o puncture your practice or anything for that matter ask yourself is t really providing you durable benefit that is worth the effort a or is it just rapid it feels good in the moment we tend to use that and our clinical practice is a threshold and we to see things at last for a longer period of time and in many of these treatments whether it be acupuncture your practice we use those as an inroad into more of a functional rehabilitative approach a meaning when you get chronic pain you tend to a withdraw you tend to stop ex exercising you stop moving your muscles atrophy you become reconditioned because of the pain and we want to use these tools that we have been talking about is a way to get people engaged in activity to correct the underlying by a mechanical issues that may be present and they all need to be appropriately staged and that is where working with a good cognition can help with that yet certainly my case any time have had back pain even when it was very severe provided i was not harmed and i was just hurt a continuing to move and not becoming sedentary was absolutely the fastest run to recovery and a and in particular doing certain exercises that a that were particular to my my case a what if any is the role for physical therapist in the treatment of chronic pain absolutely crucial absolute crucial ah despite being a physician not a physical therapist have great appreciation respect for what the physical rehabilitative approaches do because at the end of the day we are trying to get people back to an improve quality of life and physical functioning man that an aught is often what people are most looking for control over their pain control over their life yes reduction and pain but more being able to do more things and there tying in with good physical therapist occupational therapists people who can do a goalsetting a absolutely critical all of the treatments that i provide typically are meant to help support an increase and physical rehabilitative approaches and when i do nerve blocks or procedures or given medication and if we an it reducing some pain we want a tie that and with more activity and what the physical therapist a great particularly those trained in chronic pain is knowing that difference between hurt and harm they can work with people to know whats safe for them to do to rehabilitate they can teach them a more about body ma panics and help improve endurance in strength they can work around pacing pacing is critical for people with chronic pain now this is not just exclusive to the physical therapist the psychologist do pacing i do pacing what is pain here is the problem with chronic pan one of the many problems it waxes and was and what happens as you go ought to have a good day you go out gangbusters and you go do everything that you have not been able to do for the last week because you have been in pain and then you pay the price and when you pay the price you are back in bed or you are on the couch and you are not moving and what happens is you go in to this roller coaster of activity and no activity at all and what happens is it an trains in our brain it is a classic negative reinforcement model this is classic psychology and then people become fearful of more movement and as a consequence they get more and more ism disuse a atrophy and then more disability the key what o you do about that the key is you set small goals baby steps if you can walk comfortably for a block right now great walk that block to morrow maybe walk a block plan extra fifty feet and they the next day another fifty feet no more no more if you have not a great day do not go do five blocks your training for a marathon you are training for the long win now what is going to happen along the way is it you arguing to have good days and you are going have bad days on the good days do not go out and exceeded set a threshold time it on your watch at a distance on the bad days recognize we all have bad days everybody has by and you may need some rest during those bad days but then the next day get up and restart where you were and that is a type of thing a physical therapists good pain psychologist good physician can help you with and tying that in by the way with these are the therapies my interesting have never heard of pacing but it makes total sense and i can see how people wit really hinder their own progress without that basic understanding which thanks you we now have and it is something that fully all these the republic modalities keep in mind man i do not know whether not the acupuncturists or talking to the a physical therapists are talking to the physician but i guess this is the reason for referrals right why somebody has a primary care dock than t than it and a radiates down to a the rest is that on in in an ideal you t apian world that is exactly it i mean outside a a comprehensive pain centers that have all of the stuff collocated you are dependent on a dock to play quarter back a and bring all those refers together it is credibly challenging for a a primary cordon to do that with the limited amount optime they're given to see a person a this is what we are trying to use technology to to help better with that integration and i i do think there is hope for the future will have better ways of managing that in handle it what is your view on non prescription compounds called supplements or future suitable for the treatment of pain fascinating topic this country's rather unique in having a a wide slew of over the counter agents that are actually am prescription in rope and another countries and there are over the counter agents that have been shown to be effective for a number of pain conditions for neropathic pain a seetalalcarnatine is one of them a seetalal carnations is thought to work on a myticondreal metabolism and and prove mytichondreal health an is been used i believe is a a anti aging may be even a cognitive enhancement agent a you need and it is been studied out of an australia study i think it was called tho kidney trials a actually and what they found it is one of the few over the counter agents that actually had disease modifying property's meaning they studied this in diabetic neuropathy the clinical en point was not pain reduction the clinical pinpoint was nerve conduction velocity changes and that is how we monitor nerve health is and a normal nerve they move nervalpulses move at a certain rate and when they are injured from diabetes they say it is much slower and you lose signal this actually improve nerve health you can by those at a vitamin shop a order them on line a alphalipoic acid is another one alphalipoic acid at least two mechanisms one is it is a free radical scavenger and second a that is been more recent is it is a t type calcium channel modulator and calcium generals or in our nerves and it ta turns those down and it can have some benefit for neuropathy pain om people have taken alphalipoic acid for a general sense of well being and it is generally well tolerated it can cause a little bit of stomach upset i will tell you i took this one myself for a while and this is oginjust an end of one what i found though is you have t type calcium channels in your heart an i do hit a high intend at interval training and i was finding i could not get my heart right over a hundred fifty i had i stopped it a that is not a adverse event that is just an annoyance but that is useful a video in see if you are going in for surgery and it is a may be a nerve related surgery the you are going to have they found victim in see prophylactically can reduce the likelihood of having certain nerve pain conditions after surgery fish oil of the omega threes have been found to be a beneficial around chronic pain i more recently the at to here is on smaller numbers creatine which i imagine you have probably talked about it at at some length but creatine has shown in small pilot studies some benefit in libra my alga and some other a types of conditions there are a number of these substances that are backed up beyond the a the anew data that wed joke about the anecdotal there is actually good randomize control trials and this is something that people can i easily take advantage of i just be mindful that just because it is natural just because it is over the counter does not quit with a hundred per cent safety meaning get educated about the side effects in the adverse events get educated about the drug drug inter actions the agent agent interactions and for instance there are these over the counter agent some of which am you want to be careful of and not taking when you are going into surgery because they can be a platelet inhibitors and they can cause you to bleed more is not item in we one such coma substance that that causes a excessive bleeding or or some people report that high levels of omega threes can increase the can reduce the viscosity of the blood meaning you bleed easier the the omega three's officihoils yes absolutely the vitamin see ism not familiar honestly with that is a blood thing agent maybe i ism a is informed there are more maybe ism just forgetting it but that is that is one i do not usually think of is a the blunt thenar some one will put in the show comments one way or the other i gat corrected i i but there is a number of these over the counter agents that are a there available the vast majority or innocuous that have mentioned that have mentioned there are worth meaning they they do not a cause harm at the at reasonable dose is a but they cannot have positive effects well a perfectly state ye w think you for sharing that list i think s you mention a many compounds that here only available pi prescription oversees are are indeed available over the counter in the you ask in this area untresutacles they a supplements is still anarrya that is actively debated if any on people's stance but it is refreshing to hear somebody whose ya a a formerly trained physician and a mnpscientist to a embraces many different approaches and in the treatment of pain along those lines a perhaps you be willing to talk about the psychological treatments that can be effective for pain again absolutely critical in the management of people with you a wide range of pain problems and recall what we talked about is you know this is no subreption these are the signals coming up to the brain once it hits the brain word dealing with everything that person is lived through and also is currently experiencing meaning their levels of anxiety depression how they cope with pain in the past how they cope with it now a early a life experiences is a paper that just came out in a mama a little in the last few days where they did a reanalysis of brain imaging studies on people with early adverse life events and what they found is abnormalities an emotional processing emotional functioning and people who have these a giving strong evidence that what happens you early in live impacts us is adults and stays with us it changes are wiring now this is where in part pain psychologists behavoraltherapist can come in they can help with the sum of the a maladaptive coping the the thought processes involved with pain they can help teach skills for the vast majority o pain psychology this is not your typical psychoanalytic lying on a couch in a talking about whatever this is about teaching people skills a incredibly helpful ah does it eliminate pain a few of the things that we do actually eliminate pain ere trying to do is chip away little bit with this medication a little bit with this percent somehow this procedure bit with psychology were trying to hit all of these pathways aggregate ah to make a real difference the pain psychologist use classically technique psychognative behavior therapy which involves often recognizing these unhelpful thoughts and patterns that we all get into around pain and even life to interrupting those thoughts to helping people again with gualsetting and pacing to teach people relaxation techniques through deep breathing a things bile feed back i in silicon valley where i practice the engineers love the bile feet back ism an engineer by formal trainings i get it but it is that closeup feed back because remember the the brain is controlling the periphery and control the sympathetic nervous system and when we are in pain our sympathetic nervous system gets rest up when the sympathetic nervous system gets rest up blood vessels constrict a heartwrate goes up or muscles get tense am and we need sometimes ways of learning how to calm down that sympathetic nervous system a cognac behavior a there mindfulness baseless reduction acceptance an commitment theropbeor some of the tools that they use my partner beth has developed a brief intervention called empowered relief yes ism bias am it works we have studied this and an an path funded study in its a way of getting eight weeks of con behavioral theropean two hours well not went to replace c b t but as an additional tool and you arguing to see is time goes by more and more these tools come out in the beauty of them is there going to be much easier to disseminate broadly to the public then for instance a pill and i cannot we cannot just go put in to fears or the was post office yet a strut sending up pills t everybody but we can develop treatments on line that a can teach people skills and really help is that the plan for this abbreviated but equally effective cognac behavioral therapy yes now you are getting into count of my bet's and my life mission and have spent the last twelve years dirt building a digital platform a health platform that we have integrated into clinics and capture high quality data covering all aspects of people's physical psychological social functioning and the reason for that is to address a critical need that we have on better quality date about people the data and the information that we have on people with pain and many health conditions is terrible and i created this platform to be able to capture high quality day to put it to use us i in the background for prediction and now beth has created the brief interventions which we are integrating and the notion is to make that widely available for free we are giving it all the way yes said this is a life mission we both have been bless to be at standard where we have everything but you go just thirty miles forty miles outside of the a area and you are in a health cared desert and i do not say that disparaging to any dock's working out there but it is different there is only a handful of large academic sanders and large practices in the country but you get outside those in those catchment areas people struggle with how to get good quality care you asked that question earlier how do you find good quality care and we are working to make that that available to everybody fantastic i was going to ask you as a final question what is your if you had one wish for the future of pain medicine and the treatment of pain what that would be am before you answer that am it'll just add an answer that you already gave which is it sounds the implementation of this a incredible set of tools and database that you have am collaborated with doctor darnel but darnel to a to develop is at least one of them now that that am that answer was given by me then you can it frees up a the opportunity for you to give another answer what is the if you had one wish for the feel the pain medicine a going forward what would that wish me yes a few years ago an i cold for the country the development of the national painstrategy and this was a sponsor by the animation health in human services and i comet this with doctor kinda porter from the unite we brought together eighty a national experts and pain research pain clinical care pain policy and people would lived experience with pain we put together a strategic plan for the country on how to enact o cultural transformation and change the way we assess a care for people with pain how we educate professionals how we communicate with the public my wish would be for full implementation of the national painstrategy it unfortunately a took back seat when it was released the same time with the sexy solid guide lines and the olio guide line sucked all the oxygen out of the room but the the strategic plan it was well thought out it is the one that we have for our country it is noncontroversial non partisan it is motherhood an apple pye an and it is if we just actually implement what we put forward it will make a huge difference in the lives of people a living with pain is there anything that people listening to this pod asking due to trying move the implementation of that initiative up it a their congress people to call i mean the cows that is how i learned engineer high school in high school a what little i attended and by the way go to school folks i had to catch up a lot but i do remember them saying that this was a democracy is a democracy and that am those phone calls in letters can often matter for what a gets sent up the flagpole and we ultimately gets approved an implement ad beautifully stated you are you are ably writing in fact the need us for the national painstrategy originally came bowed through a number of concerned citizens with pain doing that very thing and lobbying what became a by partisan you do not hear that much any more by partisan effort i to put fort a national pain care act they god put in to the affordable care act that called for the development of an institute a medicine report on pain the led to the national painstrategy all starting with concern people making those for calls and writing those letters that means calling your congressmen and congress women leaving messages i hear this works i mean i know people they doing this for other initiatives am and one call two calls does not make much of a difference but that if people are saying am this is important to them that people did not power eventually start taking action the the legislators they listen and and in part am again part of this life mission both to develop this platform have created a non profit ism called pain you essay and its main mission is to help advance the implementation of the national painstrategy and baked within that is this platform also to use high quality data to better in form the care of patience of people with pain and to deliver high quality i treatments cause we do know also that people listen to data and we need good quality data to influence o those messages but please yes make those calls write those letters it does work el she doctor make thank you much for everything that you are doing you took us on quite a tour am in terms of depth an breadth of the thing that we think of in it unfortunately in some cases experience as pain although we also learned its highly adaptive in some cases can protect us does indeed protect us thank you for taking us on that tour of the biology the psychology the various treatments the context in which all of this exists we touch into some somewhat controversial areas but i really appreciate the thoroughness an the new aunts and the sensitivity with which you touch in to all of those issues and a just one behalf of myself and everybody listening i really want to thank you you am contributed a great deal to day to the public education of what pain is what it is not and how to treat it thank you ever

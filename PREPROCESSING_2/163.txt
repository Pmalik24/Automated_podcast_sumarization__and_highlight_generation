to understand its pee ground popularity it spends a time down a season a count the guy ham here to talk about is named o vice teller he has a bunch of money suspended on politics just a few months ago he paid three million dollars for building in serasoto county nine fifty nine east venire avenue hes teeming up with mike flip and some others to use it for this hybrid offices down here one side of

make a buildings he dreams big which brings me to the other half of nine fifty nine east penis the party really want to tell you about the place for vicar his movement are inventing something new specifically the other half of this building is can be a medical clinic we the people health and well in this center we the people drawn in founding fathers cursive on the big glass tors a clinic this keepers to people who did not get the cove back one who do not trust the medical establishment and want a place to go where they can be treated by people who think thin do o wot con louis worker baton i bel pick shows me the exam rooms the carved out area for pediatrics he dolt examination aria the soft gray i trip room we can sit quietly and get liquid vote him ins pumped into your arms old building is ten thousand square feet this is roughly had it opens in september two to three nurses may be a primary cerdacter one pediatrician for shut at least to star i wanted to take a look at this building of vice because i captures much to me about this moment in america politics this half ivory pectin clinic half mike flip flagship podcast studio it is symbolic of a new momentum on the right where people took certain lessons from the pandemic mandates are bad vac seems are suspect the scientific community is out to get you the government telling you what to do in health care is dangerous and the building a movement from those principles nine fifty nine east venire is an early fort on that front here a behead for this political movement that is coming into the main stream called medical freedom also onogonist say this is uniquely florid but it is pretty florid shape what happens here solely get into vice story and the experience of some of these other people in serasoda to explain how this building came to be a h be victim a new political convert and he is newly flesh pick is not one of the new arrivals in season to county he is in his early fifties now he is been here thirty years he started with nothing and built a successful concrete business he was a big fox news watcher with a recent history of bringing new things into the world that he thinks should exist before he built this cleaned a few years ago feeling any and agitated about the state of the world with some money to burn he decided to buy some land a few miles away from his place in venire and as sat this what i mi do i am going to open up a camp run for kids so he base on the constitution would an emphasis on ta second moment what the kids are out there wit in a teacher don safety and then w ting to bring am out to the range and hit can be proficient o shooting and such and teach kids haw to teach kind how to shoot absolutely but it is a say cam to an a people just go out i a water slides at to all these at little o venture things they do we get as a belike would waters and fictions clings an e an were at my right over the gaiters it is her he absolutely he calls at the hollow because it is a swampy hollow place and after the holloware concrete blocks he manufactures when i was out there it was a lost boy paradise these kind of wild gardens around bouncing hanging bridges that were stretching over the water between a few islands great trellises flowers bushes that eaters er where a who feel just yer it is lick a such a six a seven foot at a be after he built the hollow vice met milk fly which changed his life in these days they talker see each other every day vice helps fly get all his projects off the ground and helps fun some of them i would call make flip a father figure an vices life he does not disagree with that he grow ope without a dad and wind socket r islands when general fly showed up in cyrasoda tot to vice always refers to him ads general it organized vice ambient inks about trump with twines the media is ones about the second amendment into something much closer to flings world with you which amounts to a comprehensive one world's order conspiracy named at him and other trumproyalists flip didn't hag to push victory far victuals it canary sixth hen going to the capital building he says but he is totally unrepentant about it here still convinced the election was stole for trump o case the creation of this clinic at nine fifty nine east venire it all begins back in twenty twenty during the pandemic vice chafed against the lock downs in the masks and like for him he lives in florid were the governor into mantis issued an executive order pretty early on in the summer of twenty twenty one the told school districts to stop forcing kids to our masks in school the schoolboardin serasoda did not waning o the governor's order they wanted to keep kids in masks vice got two young children in that school districts at that point all the parents every one free you an they they made all these troops in were the every one's meeting all over a place just try a organize and do whatever an then you're someone just said to have a we all just meet at the hollow ten on as to can bring him all on is do this to this big meeting vice meets a very essential partner in this whole endeavor the other person the stories about one of the newly politicized moms of serasota county small but mighty tiny a parts bit blows pink nail polish with a bustling just the cutie meeting energy he is got a five and a seven yearly in school i did not want my children to be in mass they did not want it my son was breaking out and all these disgusting things and i have siriasis i was a started what if he is getting he is got sariasisin is coming out i was getting really upset as a the is not from the mask ye cannot his skin was drying out somehow o and he was not be in sanitary with it he is yet and then now i have a kindergartener coming and who definitely cannot wear a mask r and me he as flicking on across the room dropping him on the floor i saw absolutely no purpose in him wearing it dropping on the bathroom floor in the put it on his face and that is absolutely discussing how did o vice n bunch appearances tiny among them decided to organize a big mask waver signing out at the hollow ere doctors would give the notes to their kids would nasty or mass in school time is a former empty she was in a trailer thy installed out there taking vitals before they met with the doctors we started it early in the morning and cars just started coming n just pouring in and pouring in and pouring in and it is hot it is tricking hot and it is every one's waiting outside i would oke my head out and ism wholly frat there was i mean there was many people line to up i could not see the end of the line and it rapped all the way it was completely full of people to be clear the thing there all fighting against wearing masks in school the science shows masks are effective at slowing the spread of covet if you wear them this mask waver o even at the hollow was a turning point once vice saw how many of them there were he realized we could be doing a lot for here this a full fledge political movement that i can throw myself into tea meanwhile became this connector between these apostate doctors impatience who did not want to go to regular hospitals in let twenty twenty one an into the next year if you wanted a doctor who would see without a mask or would not push the vaccine she got give you names people talk to each other they say hey eonian hook me up with another doctor whomever som pol parallel medicals says som totally under ground medical system and then i did a lot of the vetting for these doctors because they were busy with patience and dealing with people who needed i her pectin and had covet getting ivermacton became a huge focus of this emerging parallel medical system e surprising amount of the emotion driving this movement has to do with over macron you probably remember ivermacton the horse drug people started taking huge doses to cure themselves of covet at one point but the science says ivermacan does not work for covet it is an amazing drug for other things parasites not cove no matter though doctors on you to were promoting things over macron and had door clorcuin is miracle cures quick cheap easy solves for covet you may remember that you to been twitter and casebook removed videos because it was not true when i got put on that short list of designated official mouse information that the get companies would actually do something about but when those ivermactand loving doctors get shut down they only got more famous within the medical freedom movement and set up shop on alternative mediate platforms rumble an telegram there created a whole alternate ego system of did case an podcast never all nosy ani main resin is bi to persecuted by o e la i no one else the be din ma dot there but are floor while my by asks read surgeon while serving the army doctor rose odor to i we shaking yes again to an mi e is but the basic conspiracy theory articulated on a lot of these shows is this bovid was a man made created virus master minded by ballgames in the world's health organization in order to control the world's population vaccines were pushed in ore to kill us locked downs reused in order to control us ma durra finer their in on it they want to kill off ivermacton because it is a cheap alternative to what they're selling the conspiracy has a name it is called the great resets and that is what flip will be covering on his show down the hall from the cleaned among other things genera let back u sir a what us this a citation campaign truly all about forebode who may be hear this for the first time what we are facing is we are facing a globalist take over o every freedom loving country in the world and there usually this activation to control us i like when i ads ikantinia straight up if they believe in the great reset they were both ism i come o cop to that exact thing all the stuff you said specifically maybe it was in silicates but yes there was a power grab and there was money to be made and if you think about that that does not mean that you're conspiracy theories that just means that there is greedy people in the world which we all know it does not mean that ism a bad person cause i believe our government is more corrupt than you do this is a patriotic movement it is there wast eructs ghoulish ship el sorely abut a totally against it it make sense to me the tibia was the person who threw herself into this project of building this alternative medical system and now running the weed the people clinic at nine fifty nine east venire she is deafly attic matters into your own hands type she feels doctors have not listened to her an the passed when she needed them i basically have a twenty one year old see and i have a nine and a seven i had thirteen this carriages in better yet that was e that was awful that was awful time n my life but o ya it says very at was awful obviously and a recertrycertry carry her i that is what i do as i dig gain you wanted to lake loved that figure that out i to solve everything tried at least have an understanding from myself nine miss carriages and tinea seemed to find a doctor who figured out something that might help and then she had two kids it narc the kids who years later would go on to flick masks on to the bathroom floor during covet i did not that it took me nine miss carriages before anyone carried the to fig out what the had was on with me what were chronicling here remember is the establishment of the headquarters of this new magnified medical freedom movement at nine fifty nine east venire avenue half pi was studio half medical cleanest and the next big moment in the story of the creation of this building happens that arguably the opposite of this place the main hospital in the area serasota memorial hospital not long after the maskbandate event at the hollow this started up a political organizing company to support what he calls freedom candidates america first candidates essentially trumpets she called at the hollow too out and threw a lot of money into it they supported a slate of schoolyard candidates who swept into office they also backed another group of candidates for local hospital she are sodamemorial hospital is governed by a publicly elected burn and they supported four candidates who were a lined with this medical freedom movement these candidates were basically untie everything the hospital was doing anti the seedy sea protocols they used anti the back scenes they administered upset that the hospital did not offer ivy macron another altered of medicines to petals who wanted it to treat covet they count wanted to tear the whole place down and they called for a big investigation into everything that had transpired during covet three of their preferred candidates one not enough to control the word enough to make some noise the public hospital has public meetings every onto and you can imagine how those had been going ye ye in feuar my of this year twenty twenty three the word was delivering the results of a three year review of the hospitals performance during the cove pandemic the report was glowing the hospitals cove nineteen death rate was about twenty five percent lower and state national averages hospital stays were shorter to which is a pretty great verdict for a place full of elderly people this in the hollow crew did not believe those results at all they start pushing for a completely independent investigation of the hospitals cove practices cornflake those forensic audits that people who thought the election was stolen wanted after twenty twenty demands to comb through every ballad every gear of the voting machines but this of course was way more personal cause there was all this grief and pain mixed in with the suspicion when we had people getting up there crying and say all we want to do as i want answers i want to sit down with the a i want to understand why my husband died why you would not let me come in there why you would not use ivermecton why did you give her reddasever when i told you not to give her rendasavire all of these things were coming up e there a e e my son was thirty nine years of age when he went into the hospital this one worn a saying up at the mike y sea e a ye er e ere e these ye e is is e er erases e all it is the doctors are making decisions for all of us visor er wears r yes r we they said his organs are failing he is thirty nine would you mean his organs are failing we asked for over melton i had my lawyer on the phone they refused all the nurses and doctors she goes on he know how hard you wore but the so we protocol it is killing people doctor many ordo ran the loved response at the hospital he was at that hearing but did not speak over melton came up in much of the testimony that i wanted to talk to him about that it was a standing for many things but it was also just a drug a relatively harmless drug my notches give them the ivermacton to to aver pectin i it to me to i simple it to word when they i properly done that the shall betta dot it no better than be people that that y o show no benefit of the pin o to been how we on to be after it after the property don't that he show that they no ben it it how e can to be don people are ya the think on the work but them got on to give it you i to were not in medicine given people be people on a big tat especially when it dis drag from even the proper medication that is we drives om nuts when people who have been lied to refuse from despair which can work and want over melton which does not which you make no fen to them henbit becomes the problem this is the enbridgibl divide between the medical professionals and the medical freedom people in this case to the act is it is bad medicine to not give ivermactn to the professionals it is bad medicine to give it there is not a middle ground to be had and doctor sordid is an infectious disease specialist and he is had many of these confrontations come versions this family members demanding alternative cove treatments over the past few years it was rough morning the hospitals bovid response he would coped with death threats against this family protestsoutside the icy you he would work a hundred hours a week was hard on his marriage his wife was these patients he you and you are still gan a work for them what cold of a person are you i thought what happened that the meeting might make him mad i mean i would a awaaate it more than that o that i by the time i knew what's the tatty of people wan i we mat at the i be a the people that beep em manipulation a was than manat the patient n the patient in the in the the had biting from the manipulators doctor goodies from peru from a place he says the traces were becoming a fisherman or a priest he tried something else of course but he still fishes hat's one of the things he loves about living in sarasoda something that surprised me doctor radio did take a serious look at ivermecton there were always studies showing it killed covet in a test tore problem was the doses it took were much too high to give to a human being he says when people know they are going to de people always ask for alternative treatments to all kinds of things for each i bee cancer the seen it a lot over thirty years and his attitude is if the treatment will not hurt you sure go get it elsewhere if an all turned if cleaned gives out i her melton he is whatever white is not going to do it at his hospital i pert to upon wit that the it people in the an the going to decide on the on what they on to do a i can do i give at i on what the tat meatmen at i know ice argument date of mane in a current date of knowing a help i in that the a tint go i li titian piano grid had taking a serious look at i vermecton but when he did look at the studies that were done in america with thousands of people it sowed that basically avermectin was a placebo it was no better than a sugar per can i answer this one air o it i would to see to study that he is referring to and i would to see who did it ism sure it was cherry pick because they knew this was coming up anyways his an serprobaly should not surprise any one has been living in america lately you have studies i eve studies if doctors have doctors that say the opposite it is not just him ride's a stand in for thousands of epidemiologist is it possible that you goes all you for all your best intentions the you guides are not properly a valuating scientific studies cause you are not doctors no ism not a doctor have take it ivremectin i know it works i do not need a doctor to tell me it works i know it works have seen other people take it who were sick really sick take it and it works if if if he has to stance that it still up to see then he is an idiot and he is part of what is wrong with what is going on here otiosely i not add that have never once said that i was the reviewer of all these clinical studies an these studies i have come out have personally spoken doctors who have been a valuating the studies and that is where ism getting my answers from the two sides on this ore divided and both embattled that the one thing they have been common is how misunderstood each side feels by the other at that board meeting it serasotomemorial hospital twas true for doctor sordid is true for tiny i do not think you would understand unless you are on this side of the opinion gateway how shitty they made us feel because of what to me its why am it i just do not i i do not believe in mandates it does not mean that ism a fast it does not meeting was i okay as nock in a work at serasoto memorial the hospital would never surrender the hospital was not in a change there were never even an offering apology s i knew that there was that we needed a place where a people could go and be seen by a doctor regardless let say another pandemic happens are you still are you comfortable going to see your doctor today no will you be in two years of another pandemic happens no we still need a place and that was the whole point with vac was i just more than anything told him we have got to get something we have to get something up we have to tat meeting ye that is when the medical center at nine fifty nine eastpenie avenue became a reality to lord is a great place to do this tiny side is winning in florid in september twenty twenty one to mantis hired this fact scene skeptical surgeon general to run lords response o the to pandemic some one who altered a reports findings to claim the bovid back scene had more adverse side effects than it actually has the tanto start a publicly questioning the back scenes saying they could be dangerous an publicly dividing seedy a protocols this any vaccine a agenda in florid arguably had consequences one study estimated thirty thousand extra deaths just in florid because people didn't get fascinated the cantos also created this bran who committee of physicians who would assess any federal health guidelines coming into the states doctor sordid at serasotomemorial hospital calls this group radical extremely right waking outside of meanstreme science the same day he announce that committee to tanto file to pe tuition with the flora supreme court to convene a grand jury the grand jury to look into things finer an adorn claimed about the vaccine which he says were criminally misleading doctor sordid was what is happening you no do the whole thing to me yo hell plated find end in that affect me because to see that coming for a or governor that a little be too much for me yet what do you mean too much for you ye i cant tiki a i o that it come it ye yo something that i never thought that i con happen in you canthi o now i may be we tannin not gore perhaps nor inching but not input in what sense ane tent the word would come people mud word getting the iodic of you an do not aspect any other any other point of yo and in puseagenda mantis his now complaining for president on his comic policies the way he sort an cut fought back the iron curtain of fouciism forbid the language he uses seems design to appeal to any one who believes that bovid was a virus connected to control us all from the very beginning we refuse to let this state is see in to some type of fancies is topic the is in i epact to our in triad we read jet the big magical security stay which a rods liberty harms livelihoods and decides our society we stop for freed a cross the word and the result is ban florid has to reedit falchasa freed has for vena an the san a state governor to see to to sign to set for medical freedom bills into law two months ago the press release reads permanent protections for floridians from the

and any doctors or nurses who choose to work there cantus watts them to keep practicing here and florid there have been a bunch of other medical freedom type bills introduced in state legislators around the country in the past year and you can see some republican legislators siting what is happening in florid as their inspiration some of these bills protect doctors who want o promote things

car from the faro i rest in inallieve at you old e life yet i would just be talking to him an asking him wherein wore questions what he thought about different things canon loved the class much that by the end of the surmestor she switched her major to english and added a minor in african america studies she wanted to dived deeper on black rivers from her state from florid for a second semester she signed up for a class on southern black literature the literature and cultures of the arrival south taught by a blackfemal professor named doctureleciar games and when canon met doctor gains on the first day of class she was upsets it she tout she was cold a sustain she just kind of are in class wit this i don't on huntrigans i remember noticing that she was wearing w i would that n an on best re asking a dress an others wearing a sneakers within the seekers got you i do not know it was my for a some having e the a black professor in college lit thin o professor in called than it was just it was tike i was able to look at her and thinks myself i to be that some ut that something to be within a few weeks of meeting doctor games canon decided she was going to become just her the come o professor of african america literature but right as she figured out what she wanted to do with her life ah be nine nine nine was introduced it was late february a few weeks in of the semester i think that i for a si an insanity on m and i read over it and i that myself for that cannot be true that in sane canon realized that a lot of the things that she loved most about genesis class might be effected by this bill the class was of course about literature but it a revolve discussions about the cultural and political contacts for each book for example at one point they read a novel about one families experience of hurricane catena and they talked about rolls o steric races and played in the governments response to it without without most sorts of discussions literature and cultures of the arrival south just was not literature and cultures of the arrival soul and she felt her entire field of study black literature specifically black literature that probe the true legacy of what it means to be black an america the thing she had just realized she wanted to make her life's work was on her fret like there was one day where they were discussing their is or watching god in class and canon just could not stop thinking about the bill i was just thinking about waif no one else ever a guess the even read the an class again what if no one gets the how as these kino discussions that behaving again canon wondered how seriously she should take the bill it was something i was wondering about too i four this bills just a drought surely a lot of his sweeping language targeting subjects that was going to come out right and even if it did not and the bill pass it is such an attack on free speech surely it would not hold using cork but pretty much every one of the professors who talked to me at fish said it the bill's very introduction had a chinning effect language in the bill was broad it was hard to pin down exactly what would be prohipiters professors told me that trying their colleagues were feeling pressure to change things about their work regardless of what happen with the for and doctor gain says that did not seem an accident some of the early versions of this legislation is ridiculous and out blandish and you realize it is written to chill it is written to put us or notice but even believing that it is hard to know what to do i the same week for bills introduced do tor games got word that she was going to be teaching of course she had not that before in the for major figures in america literature which is a really brought subject right i can theory you could teach any assortment of great america outhit and not to games was considering making the focus of the class the authors of the harm renaissance the author is that i would why i talk with students about are major america author is but there are black i can i just teach black marks and people who be fine with that am or you are they wanting women are they wanting darkener cranes wondered with high be nine in nine and all of the the school s around education of the state she could teach for historical racial contacts round in era maharlam renaissance and is continued relevant to day in a class where some students would just be there to fulfill a writing requirement sudden can of students from all different kinds of majors students you might not necessarily be trying to learn about black writers and who would be able to record her classes and reporter is there going o be a student my class taking it just to be kind reversal just to be difficult that kind of stuff you do not want to keep the fourefender your brain when you ware trying to in er act with students and learn with them i and engage the material but you have to think about it a little bit and then it creates a little bit of am can i can i fully trust this class room i can i fully trust on my students in march i heard about something that was adding to the sense of dread many people i talk to feeling you was a list that was gang passed around and on it were thirty four classes i for see most of the professors i take through about it did not know exactly what it meant to be on the list but we figure it was not a good thing at first it was not exactly clear who created verist but the sands administration the university the first class on the list is doctor goes and i looked four the list the were a programs and class as you would expect to see course is that talk about race and gender and ways that might concern republicans on an and to woke crusade i i made twenty ninety six black women in america or es why the thirty eight hundred theology of sex and gender be the were many classes missing that to gas is class that case an was in literature and cultures of the atrial south yet was not on there right which wat ti made no sense not that she was complaining that m exes me a legislators that is an evasive list of a the course of tat ruin to worry about thank you i complete list do not make any faster you also had a lot of classes that did not seem to felt i capital prospectors on dance master pieces of german literature if looking into it i fuck it out that the university made for list but the sands ad ministration and regretted all public universities send in a comprehensive list of anything on campus related to diversity and inclusion and critical race theory i could not get any one of the school to explain to me why this oddly random list of courses was what they decided to send in was it some macuvalian mine game was it in competence who knows but this is embodied list being classed around it had an effect it added to the web of self day fer that professors the iffy were feeling some of them were already changing their courses trying to make them hold up to scrutome i to to one professor removed work by prom candy from the syllabus and emphasize imperial studies about traffic stops and hiring discrimination instead to other professors to be under scannable step of changing the names of their courses basically a racing the giant targets they had on their backs a class called critical race theory will now be listed as the sociologists of race and if my city another class feminism and travel you can find out under the new name jerseys in woman's literature bosh courses are content wise basically the same as they were before we are already helcanering in a fact i bold critical rate they out of my help description on my faculty wed pate that is a to see the pouty one of tho to gas is colleagues an anis department she teaches classes about woman's literature and the subjects targeted in legislation is open to interpretation with no explanation of what the punishment would be that sh only could not figure out what she should be teaching tennis theory and gendistudies were baked into her courses she worried about losing her tenia and getting fired and was she spent an enormous amount of time this possimester trying to do what ever she could to protect herself i had started writing a new apical just bout a week ago and no look at the first take i was you a proud i wrote don the i wrote the introduction of i had written lot of notes that i finally tat out the computer wrote of the introduction at well guess waited references on a concept called the let been continuoman e second character what is the let been continual a e a resin continuing the concept here were talking remind theory oh the a word a terrible thing the leste continues er is a concept put forth by the lesbian and feminist come atrial rich and her theory es that be cut in a liturgical heroseces culture where women a silly responsible preparing for infancy every child every infante first love is his or her mother also that for women the initial is position in tangent love and a haderosectes colter forces a woman to realize herself and e another words if you horde republican who believes that radical liberal professors are turning sun's gay the article would be a red fag you see out how this witnelia i see no howyoure in it yer here every everything i not to do everything an get excited about and makes me feel a in secure at the at the same time its i this gone an make me her brave me the shall effect sere is a lie this is one of the people who wrote h b nine nine nine state representative alexin drama noble he been hearing about miss shielding effect from many critics of the will y his offensive when i asked about it at first about his intended very angry that people thought he in the bill er rats which he denies the lie he says a their that greeted h b nine nine nine was inflamed by democrats and the media was advise when i said that professors were feeding the need to change their courses he was cons good i even need to the whole purpose of the bills to if you can make an argument tilt e fact i denials and if you want a silly teacher conclusion without teens i exudation suctions an sea forgot me note for you he's the thing and drawn does not believe that systemic racism is inherent to the institutions of the united states to day even no a whole host of academic work says it is he says it is important that people learn about thisistemic racism of the past none about him crow for example but that is the past he says if there is an institution that is ragis right now he said to me it'll find it with you that want tell what is situla races i just a system it is inherently unequal and does pis proportionately effect black men and they a direct line between migrates of laceration and policing that is tire to possible implicit racial bus i think that is pretty that is pretty cut and dry a dot that r e question a quest there inn instances that give just old i that if you point what you in institution that istentually a races to day i will fight it with you i can that that is gran i hope you noticing the distinction an dead is making here he saying there are i say in instances of say black men being arrested because they bareback but that is not proof of institutional racism there is no evidence e cannot point me what what institution is races to day i am in i have but the we me one he cold to have other questions and i went to be a you i come on me well i do not know i would disagree o that and a big part of teaching also is us acknowledging whoever way of the scholarship is and if a way of the scholarship which it does says that a lot of our systems in this country are inherently unequal because initially the were not necessarily built to serve everybody ism i there is that that just kind of his what it is ne whether is no there no disagreement him crow last for a races ye therefore i evidences tested graces are however i then in is saying you day i our institution s or inherently races ye that is where you would disagree he dis is just is false i w red dis agree i do not fickutsfals i know it is not but ism no that thank you for showing that he did this a few times presented with the way the evidence he just say there is no evidence or he would mention a study that he would seen and this is what is making life of professor hard they do already present clear and fact base evidence then ran is telling them they cannot state what that evidence that up to if it is conclusion he and for a publican legislature do not agree with how do you navigate that as will not professor told me begot does get up reran be there is o he's discrepancies in health outcomes but i cannot tell you why that just not teaching i reached out for the sansadministration to ask them about agee in nine nine it did not directly with one of my questions instead the prefer care sent me links to a descant's press conference and a couple of other public statements about the bill and the message from those was pretty clear if you one o teach stuff about critical race theory or genderadeology we are not going to be funding it go somewhere else doctor gave said that professors had that message loud and clear students did to canon the sure she's following the news about the bill she came up and approach me at the end of my glass and she was just very upset she said what are you going to do about it what did she mean by that i think she meant are you going to or tail what you would have to say or what we are going to read or a teach are you going to roll over case wan said exactly meant something a little different i wanted to know how she was handling ex the can noted to know how i should handle it almost oh you were i needs ask her how she is hunting it i couldn't know how say i should be taking this how afraid i should be yer doctor games told case since she was not a change o hospital but she been feeling the pressure a few weeks ilia she decided to show a documentary in both of the posse she was teaching bat some master the documentary was cold in visible history middle fought is hidden roods and it was a documentary about the legacy of slavery around the on county whereto we was located the first doctor showed it to was old grad students and when the film was finished there was to stone silence in the room one mi graduate student said where the andiron one us to see that is in doctor games he just did something i could get you in trouble thought ta games was surprised this was just a fact mas documentary that had been made by a film make an residence a fish it is pretty pinching in the way it ties the on county jimcrow pass with its present half an hour later she screen the same documentary casein's class and they in the middle of the film when she noticed something i think the documentary was about had got to a point about lynching it is very heavy moment ism not kinda it was not yon that history is hard that painful in that history is right here inly in county itself and there is a moment where a student walked out of the class room while i was screening i literally kind of jumped in my seat is i was not sure why he was leaving doctor gave stopped panicking i was immediately thinking is he walking out because he is protesting what ism screening is he walking out because he is made very uncomfortable by this documentary about ism slavery inly on county or middle florid all these things are kind of racing through my head a i games was not show what would happen it if she had offended his kit also she wrote down some notes about whey exactly in the film he would walked out where and then sat that otanxiousle looking at the ate student to see if any one else as can a follow leaving and then that student came back a few minutes later he had just gone to the rest room and it's having this gash he was just using the rest room i take me the sure and he had mutually gone to the part room he said into the whole because are some newsy gone the doctor games was being rents where the want any she is beginning to doubt herself it is that double think the i have never had to do in a class room in my entire career y only aril as the bill was being debated in committee casein was finding it increasing me difficult to stay up the s she saw news about the bill's progress it had been a rough som ester i was trying my best in or it even though there was a kind of constant rattrap of stress wit everything happening and i sought about option out of college we i yet it ransom my head several timeeventhough i estate i no of for as i getting to class in my head several times o maybe i should just fa lout it it is canned li if some one is you er a beautiful present li ma give you a beautiful watch is a hay i might take this away any second and i it away ism to chain a mud would you accept the watch would you want aware on your rest that after it is gone you have to see the place where it was you ink the told tan where the watch we would you want to still except that watch but when it would feel kind of safer to night have it at all shout of the the master thinnish the cantos sign his being higher and package that final lord did not have some of the things the professors i spoke we found most alarming they drop the idea that no one could major or miner in gentle studio or heinous theory or critical race theory they drop the idea that unruly professors could have their ten of you'd at any time but the lord does say that in gentle education courses you cannot teach identity politics all that systemic rases a sexes are built into the institutions of the united states case a solver news about the bill passing and for about her future thennont don stop here she told me who knows what further restrictions to high education they might make next year i she wants to to round for that is a thing she is talking about a lot nowadays of a people in her life with her friends with her parents just what staying or leaving would mean especially is a black person in the south i was in that particular at face on when i went to my at a house i think i a it you of this state wet i do not think i should stay here whatsoever i do not feel safe and she c to that in then is me alike but we do not run from things that now i do t big what you digging about and law where black people were living in the south if we left every time we felt threaten no one would be here right now and ills kind of just as i dead when people are trying to scare you away you do not just go on with it you do not do them the safer of levin you stay any try to make things rat if you do leave it is because you found something then you definitely know is better you we for you not for them never of not casein stays and florid free grad school the one thing she knows for shore is that she still wants to be a professor dislike doctor games the new law did not change that it did have a chilling effect but what might looks right now among the professors i talk to is people feeling for may be changing their course names or removing things from their see these but mostly these educators are standing their ground and teaching the same things they were before bolt to games for instance that class about major america writers she decided to go ahead and teach only black woods from the horse renaissance dot to see your caput is moving ahead of er articreferencing the lest being continuing the faculty unions telling everyone do not change your glasses if they try to use ta law to stop you

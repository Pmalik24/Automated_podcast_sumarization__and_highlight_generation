first of all to start to show for those people are hippo mansion a just her for the number one hippopardis in america it'll get totally bit later in the show gave to do the news first jobidans cowardly oppeaseman oriented strategy in the middle east has now got an america officially killed it was only a matter of time until this happinaranian proxy forces have been attacking america all over the middle east from arc to syria and now to jordan according to the wallstry journal three u u service members were killed at least thirty four were injured an iron back militias drone strike on a base in northeast jordan according to u us officials now that his a bit of a difference in kin from attacks in a rock or attacks in syria those are both countries there not officially u us allies jordan is officially in america ally this would be an attack by an cranial proxy force into in america allied space on america the strike carried out by one way attack drop signals an escalating in fighting in the region the presidenand secretary defense hat did put out a statement suggesting retaliation president began statement was this quote to day america heart is heavy last night three you a service members were killed an many wounded during an unmanned aerial drop attack on our forces stage in northeast jordan near the syria border while we are still gathering the facts of the attack we knot was carried out by radical iron back militant groups operating in syria and rock and then there is the language about grieving for the fallen service members and how wonderful the soldiers are all of which i am shore is true also if you had not spent every day since october seventh trying to make nice with ran demonstrating that your true interest in the middle east has nothing to do it a medical interest but to do with your electoral interest this would not have happen here is the very simple mayhem at least if you do not punch terrorist directly in the mouth incredibly hard and incredibly often that get more aggressive with you and when you show your neck they attack jordan has been showing his neck largely since october seventh in fact long before that join has been showing american's back in the middle east since he decided that he was going to take the soothes off the terror watchlist since he decided that he was going to start appeasing the palcinian authority since he decided that he was going to reorient away from the a lions striven model the president trump had embrace the abrahamicord's model that really broughtlout a soon arab countries into the full ranging from said arabia and you a e and monaco to egypt and jordan he decide to move away from that to jobitan and instead he was going to seek the baracobama ask idiocy of what if we try to pursue a deal with iron and when you do that what you end up doing is appeasing the largest tear sponsor in the region and naturally as the does began to close around he middle east to iron ran started to buck against that and i started to use their terror proxies as a way of upending the burgeoning relationships in the middle east as a way of scuttling any possibility of the broadening of the abrahamicorts to directly include sadiorabia that is why october seventh happened essentially mamas was given in green light to attack israel by ran and the his ballad which is in cranial terragroup was given the green light to attack israel in the north than the whooshes were given the green light to tack shipping in the red sea and at every turn jobidon made clear that he was not going to hit them hard enough to make them stop and the reason is because jobidon is much more fearful of war with iron than ran is fearful apparently of war with the united states now no one wants war with iron no one is interested in war with on but if it comes down to it who do you think has more to fear iron for going war t the united states or the united states from going to war with on tho get that is not something that ism calling for i do not think it is a good i dead it only any one in the right mind thinks that that is a good idea no one want spend blood t non a spend tressure and that is exactly correct but containment can and should be pursued containment is a policy of deturincs that is applied in various regions surrounding iron you are not to go to war directly with heron to for example secure shipping in the red sea which is deeply necessary considering that container shipman have now cost twice what they used to and everybody is now rooting around the cape of good hope instead of going up through the red sea the a oil is getting more expensive because of all of this suggesting that israel be supplied the munitions that it requires an or to take out the baronial proxy compass and to detour the baronial proxy pueblo in the north or take it out that has nothing o d with america going directly to war when america get killed the proper response to that is to is to make sure the other side of the f around find out equation actually applies that does not mean you have to directly attack oronsan mean ere can have f twenty two flying over throw or anything that there ways the united states can apply force in the face of the death of america that actually establishes to turns and yofrenot got duthaysion have troops there it is that simple is that simple if you think that the united state should completely pull out of the region which is a whole other argument and also i think a specious argument concerning united states does have deep and abiding reasons to care about the middle east ranging from oil supply to shipping strategy to democracy there many reasons to care about the madly put even if you were to argue that the us should not have troops there at all if yours troops are there you have to protect them it is immoral and wrong not to protect them and jobidon has benin the business of trying to appease the people who have killed thousands of america since the day he took office he is been delusional state about run the same delusional state embraced by barakobama and at led to the lies averanian power throughout the middle east and dona trump contained it donate trump hampered the agrarians donate trump put in place om the strictest sanctions in world history he impoverished the cranial regime he boys them in with the abrahamicords and they knew it and what they also knew is that if they screwed around the united states under dona trump might punch them in the out that actually is a very good form policies o very effective for policy and jobidon just as he did with the border decided to destroy that for policy because it had a big gold trumps on it anything associate with trump had to be destroyed no mater how good the policy was yen hoiden inherited a for king border policy jobidon inherited a working middle east which is insane and he promptly decided to blow both of them a gets the boarder situation in a second

eight eat eight eight give one eleven seventy two four more information right now gabion is trying to walk this tight rope to quote quail protect america troops without creating the possibility of a broader conflict with the on now again the regality is that that is quite durable but jobidon is sol scared he it'll all fire scared fa continuing conflict in he simplicities an sleep all right into one because there are two ways the conflict happens one is we retaliate the ronitaliates in then we retaliate the on retaliates n than an escalates the other way is you do nothing and then on keeps pushing an the we have been watching for the last several months is a on keeps pushing wet's been a hundred and sixty plus attacks on america targets since october seven and gabion has effectively done nothing they shut down shipping in the read and jobitin hidabunch of camels in the ass that is not in actual policy when robin puts out a statements and that three america service members we lost for patriots in the high estcense there ultimate sacrifice will never be forgotten by our nation together we will keep the sacred obligation we bear to their families we will strive to be worthy of their honor and valor we will carry on their commits fight terrorist m and have no doubt we will haul all those responsible to accounts at a time and i a manner of our choosing does any one believe that the anyone believe that job is in a hold those people to account be cause far that has not ben his policy his policy has been to pressure our allies wet do the women he stepped on to the world stage as president of the united states he decided the he was going to destroy relations with the sorties forget about what's doing with israel what he did with the qualities at the very beginning of his ad ministration is despicable he decided that is a virtue signal to all his journalist friends he is going to cut off the south regime and the right before the midterms had to go on bended kneed to the south king and basically ask the de fact does how to kangmahom ad been salmon to lower oil prices to ice m bees was why would i do that you have been campaigning against me since the day you got into office jobidon's entirepolicy has been oriental against ore allies in the mideleast and in favor of trying to bring iron into the family of nations which again is the most specious and idiotic goal of any goal in the ideas period a meant that the number of attacks on america is going to continue prize here because again jobidon has basically done nothing his basely done nothing and as much as me saying this it is non a trumpsaying this which is correct sure o the statements the dona trump put out on truth social quote the drone attack on yours military installation in jordan telling three america service members and wounding many more marks a horrible day for america me most profound sympathies go t the families of the brave service members we have last i ask all america to join me in praying for those we a been wounded this brazen attack on the united states is get another terrific and tragic consequence of robin's weakness and surrender sis correct says three years ago iron was weak broke and totally under control thanks to my maximum pressure policy the baronial regime could barely scrape two dollars the other to fun their terrorist proxies then jobidon came in and give on billions of dollars with the which the regime has used its to spread bloodshed in carnage throughout them at least this attack would never one happen if i was president not even a chance just the baronial back comes attack on israel would've have happen the warn you can woe never one happened and wed right now have peace throughout the world instead we are on the brink of world wore three this terrible day is yet more proof that we need not a me to return to piece through strength they'll be no more chaos no more destruction no more loss of precious america lies our country cannot survive with jobidon its commander in chief know peace through strength for all this isolation is than republican party peace through strength is not the many isolationist are talking about many isolationists are just let us with draw within our on borders let us pretend that foreign threats not actually exist let us pretend that if russia takes over you can whole sale and takes over a huge supply of wheat to the world for example and then threatens dados borders that has known back on america let us pretend the if we shut down the red sea and shipping cannot come through there than china will not take advantage in go after titan o shut down the straits of titan and all the recite and i think t the is a very short sided policy but most of all whats tonal trumps calling out is the cowardice and vacillation of the bide administration which is totally correct which is why republicans today are really pushing hard four the president of the united states to do his job jobidon's job is not to assure equity in all public policy jobidon's job is to protect america interest particularly abroad because the president is given outsized impact when comes to foreign policy the president has the ability under article too the president has the ability to really shape american's form policies in ways that he does not america domestic policy and the fact that he has used that to make the world significantly more chaotic place for con legation is on the horizon in nearly every direction you look that is on jobidon enter o tom cotton excellence an ore from arkansaw he put out a statement ain jobidon embolden a on for years by tolerating attacks on our troops bribing the patrols with billions of dollars and appeasing them to no end he left our troops as sitting docks and now three are dead and dozens wounded sadly as have predicted would happen for months ism behalf of arkinsons i deeply extend a my condolences tot e family our brave and fallen warriors may god comfort them as who welcomes they are loved ones in to his embrace at may god quickly and completely heel their wounded comrades sewer crus of tacos also blasted badingsaid then for making quote a dame one decision and not just to appease the iron in receive but de to enable the it toilets to a tack america andamerican interest across the maddest this is correct by the way now what exactly shun camera could do ism a practical level that is the real question an because no one is interested in a full scale wars i say now a on should be more scared than we should and the reason i say that is is that is how to torrents works folks no cause i want to go to warthog on he said or the fifth time in the show no one wants to go to warthog on when it comes too deterrents the whole idea of deterrents is you the bad god you have to fear me more than i fear you otherwise the turn is not established if i fear you more then that you can attack me with impunity you have to believe that if you have around there will be a find out on the other end of that actuation now what bidansteam is doing is basically this the same thing that the barocabomy is to do brocabom every time he's to talk about the cranial newcleordeal which was a sham and a way of presenting the agrarians with a pathway too a nuclear weapon with a bunch of money was i one of the worse teals in america history every time

o those pop aware a or ex to went say what here not ain tough enough i it is octants there not ain't tough enough i iron i would also ask wen the they want a roger comic you was on folsecale war i and that is the goo yo a our then and went n a go tat a cat the greater escalation tat the crash much proper collect what tin the mean o because they might escalate oh you they might slake lies did youknow the on my desk get now i might note to you at this point chevron has already had it is proxy commons killed twelve hundred israelies and take two hundred and forty of them captive and now they refuse to surrender i might note also the kibble has ben firing rockets into israel on the northern boarder consistently for four months at this point i might note that again the toothy pirates have been literally capturing shipping in the red sea and o shut down shipping through that strait i might note that ran proxies now killed three america exactly wot look if they slake wot escalation look to you seriously when at us collitionlook are we talking relic full scale eonian revolutionary guard quadric ages going up against america military times what are we talking about here and the answer is they soft know because this is all about robins reeled effort that is all it is about jobidon has basically said to the aronians guys as long as you do not go to full smile war as long as you not go to fullskall war ye can do it every want what every want just kep it relative that you kill america keep it relatively low level and it'll keep it relatively low level and everything will be fine until i get my reelect and adonis thinking orca thesis a great time to push because jobidincan he ain't can do anything your mint e t do anything he is only a shut down the shipping in the red sea he is on to let us attack a medical allies sadiarabia and israel and now jordan with impunity and he sign to do all of that because he is afraid that if this thing go hot in any way she per form it will hurt his reelect efforts now's go time for the aronians thereof ma jobiniand they see a mark man and they should see a mark because the acting a mark now what could the united states do in a situation this now get you are after attack tavern on a to attack iron directly their bunch of things you can do one things could you could ship every piece of eonian military weapon re in the red sea you chip toucan destroy all of it now i say that that towns crazy except for the fact that the united takes actually do that nineteenaihty eight in nineteen eighty eight there is an operations call operation praying mantis it happened after e a you es worship was mind and the america retaliated this of course was under road randan the america retaliated by taking down one frigate one on boat three speed boats another frigate crippled two platforms destroyed one fighter damage bunch says basically found every military asset that iron had in the in the person gulf in in baronial territorial waters an just sank all of them can while you cannot bother america shipping any more it turns out it turns out the y cannot bother america ships besots done all of your under water now i actually led to iron basically ending the aronorock war an had a major in packed on the end of the aronarock war because iron is oh i see we probably shouldn't of round and find out the oh could easily do that to pretend that aronians military cap abilities in the in the water ways around the person gulf are somehow a deep threat to america is absurd they are not america military force to take all of tam out tomorrow we did it before the there much other things we could do the united states military facilitated the ouster of sis in under a month are telling you the unit the united states could not use our aerial bombard went power for example that in putting troops on the ground and just whole sailed destroy cranial tea proxy positions in say a rock or serial certainly the united states could do that we'd be he purpose of that to get them to stop because if they find out than next time they do at there in f thirty five on their doorstep somehow things look a little but different none of this requires going directly to worth on and guess what iron is not going to ward directly with the united states there is a reason they are using proxies if the if iron wanted to go war withtheunited states they would not be using proxies they would be using the urge sea theyeould be directly attacking america forces they are not they are using all of their terra proxies because they understand that if they actually triggered a war withe united states the mules would not have heads attached to their bodies to morrow morning they'll been little bitty pieces all around heron if they actually declared war on the united states not doing that instead they using proxies what is oka we enough to dethrone temallas an iron that is up to the cranial people to do that but the united states certainly dos enough to stand for america soldiers being gild and to pretend that real that that the turns cannot be reestablishes to ignore the intiridy of the trump administration when that is exactly what the trump administration established mean right now things are getting much force in the midliast because of america cowardice because robin is the coward when it comes to miles and he believes that is left wing will abandon him if the actually defends the interest of the united states they shay we will got to the borderer second because the same sort of thing but things are getting worse in yeomen for example why but one of the reasons is because one the first things join did when he took office is he said to the sorties you need to stop your operations against the hobbies in common there is too much civilian casualties there is too much carnaturs to its too much a prompt yet to leave the hooves in control about half of yemmonsterritory what turns out things are going worse there quote is from the washington post nearly a delative civil war in the arabia penensil a country that driven millions of people from their homes deep in poverty and spread starvation now a new conflict who the fighters are firing missiles on america shipping an america birds forces are striking back is destructing tentative efforts at peace well it turns out that you cannot make peace with people whir tacking shipping in the red sea what do they think is going to happen and if they think what is can happen is good what dies that say about western strength by the speaking of which pronating groups are having more attacks on your forces in rock or coring tote asap fronts press aronalid armed groups about on fridge to keep up attacks on yours lek coalition forces in a rock washington has forces in rock is part of the international coalition against sis the borstal situation is pushed rocks prime ministers to call for the coalition to leave why because the coalition and arch is reliant on iron and the greatest sent of the arc war was not the actual roc war itself the greatest cent of the arc wars that it turned it into in cranial proxy state the destruction of the rocky military in the handing of of the state over to basically sh a militia groups sponsor baron was a terrible terrible decision borg a re view the history here but the bottom line is the iron long groups our saying they are going to escalate their attar thy'renot lowering their attar the escalating the it is more on this in just one second first are you struggling with back taxes or unfired returns this year the press is escalating collections they have added twenty thousand new agents o joy in these challenging times hour best offense is to use tax network you essay along with hiring thousands of new agents

everywhere they're escalating with regard to pakistan yesterday according to riders unidentified gunmen killed nine packastanding workers and arrest of southeastern for area of on on sturdy the went an murdered a bunch of paxastandies iron is using the ant everywhere because they sent weakness they since weakness because the united states is acting weak they put out a trial balloon over the weak end for example they might consider slowing weapons to israel put pressure on priminister boatman it ton ow who to skill back tho war in gaze it's going t yours officials talking to anbysenews the white house later rejected the report the suggestion is that leverage had t be placed on israel to stop them from what to stop them from what destroying compass going north an destroying cabala it is not only that the united states refuses to directly engage with these groups which try got in the united tateshould only engage with groups that have attack the united states or united states troops but it's not just that that telling america allies they cannot engage from soutyourabia wit the soothes to israel compass no talk about thoron sees weakness this is why this is why and it is because the left flank of jobidon's party does not the west they do not the west they believe that western powers are evil they truly do they believe that the united states is influence in the iddeleast is pernicious they believe that israel is a pernicious horse in the implies they believe that any millions with america in the silliest turns the alpine country bad that is what they actually think here for ex samples mason be my over the week comparing support for israel to supporting russia in his war against you crane which is totally insane israel abandoned the gasastrip into thousand five come of then took it over and use it as a staging ground for literally thousands of roc attacks over the intervening eighteen years and then proceeded to murder twelve hundred is rallies by rushing over the border and murdering children in the cribs where they slept and the morons ad amassed be we are comparing israel trying to protect its on population to russia invading a sovereign country just totally nuts to people who had been alone by this than isle you talk to about he an i about the exsnachalils bees ordered by it came to you created what about to p an galistid this is that usual an i heeded ocean is all there import o faggot it stay aliens an gas are a protected group which is really import because ta latte an i is the over theater that talistinyans are a group at all again the the mason b ss suggesting this is russia or it just ittelenset a that wing of the party is who joining is trying to appears he is not just trying to appease the banians he is trying to appease that wing of the party we have common interest in many cases with the banians can mean none of the should be surprising because joining staffed up with people or sympathetic to the wrong sides in the middle east for example one of the first people that joining actually appointed to his administration was a former palestinian u an our w a official he appoint ted him director of anas intelligence this guy's name is yer it'll be tar and he was on president an barocoboma's national security council as director for his railing and palestinian affairs which is totally in san the first place and in the intervening time he works with u an relief and works agency we what exactly does that tell you it should tell you something because it turns out that do to an our w way is a mamas front group this guy now works at a high level inside the bine administration how we know that u an our w way is a compass front group according to a bran new wallstree journal report around ten per cent of the u an our w as twelve thousand staff an gas have links to comes fully ten per cent of the staff of the an our w ay have direct ties to common by the way the organization is amortizes than that those just

meanwhile speaking of trump er policies that were don away with just because you are biding hated dona trump and because the democratic party decided that everything trump touched had to be destroyed whether was good or whether was bad the borer continues to be in absolute bleep so and the chief policy at the border are entirely executive branch shriven no additional legislation is needed to secure the america border it is in fact a duty of the federal government to arrest people who cross america southern border and to send them home if they do not fulfill the requirements for asylum jobidon has changed the interpretation of the rules he changed two specific things one he suggested that he would get rid of day on remain a mexico remain a mexico was the policy whereby donate trump he an agreement with the country a mexico that if you came to the border and said that you wanted asylum we ta oke you can have a cordate here is a stamp come back in two months when it mayor courttatan in the meantime we need you to wait in war e you edit you ye cannot wait here out await down there and turns out their on people did not show up at the border any more why because they knew that the entire game was to get into the united states and disappear into the interior and that if you extra had to wait in war e you aren't getting into the united states you would so up for your asylum hearing you have no proof that you needed asylum and then you would get kicked out anyway why make the long walk all thewy up to the america border sea drug smuggler and then be let off at the border to be rejected sent back to mexico come back for court take get rejected back home why do that just stay home that was a good policy jobiden't it away with it day one the other policy that jobidon change those huge is that join decided that the wait to a indicate asylum was that if you claimed asylum we would simply catching release you you not hold you intention were not even threaten to hold you intention you would show up we oud detain you for forty eight seventy to hours and then we release you to the interior as have said he should check out the documentary that we just put out this bran new great piece of contents over at daily wire plus first episode of divided states of biding we went down to america southern border in prison we saw all of this inaction the bearer is wide open because jobidin decided that he was going to staff nearly all border patrol on bussing and ad ministrative duty their job is to go to various tries of the border pick up a leglimigrant bring them to the detention center maybe mill la couple miles away process them release them meanwhile the boarder is left wide open for drug smugglers and criminals to get through which wiring the hero numbers theyouare seeing right now and this is also by the state of texts is doubling down a coring to she get news the unprecedented stand off between the state of texts and he federal government at the southern border continues on money the seprimcourt said that the federal government had the authority to remove razor wire texts had installed at the southern border another home lend security said texts had until fridge to give federal authorities amass to eagle pass governor abbot for his part said that he would increase state patrol of the boarder and he added more various and more razor wire here in fact is some tape of more razor wire going up at the boarder it is now an actual wall that is being ad hock in in eagle park over at the border an is happening an eagle pass see here they are to ping up some razor wire they have got to shipping containers it is all because jobiton has decided to leave the border wide open it is that simple but jobidon is trying to shift this off join is trying to shift this off what is you trying to do he is trying to suggestingmes more legislation he needs more power if you give him more power than heller force the born again the laws are on the books it isn't a question as to whether owned more laws your any many more resources when we spoke with abandon judo hots the head oftheborder patrol union when we spoke with him he said this not question of resources this a question of misallocation of resources you have enough board patrol agents a ready they are being told actively not to do their job i talk some border patrol agents down at the border on background and therefore telling me moral has never been lower that they have been forced basically into this administrative duty job buy the by administration there not en allowed to do their job any more the is because of jobidon job can finish that to morrow literally to morrow he could do it you do it to day for that matter if he does not call lid by one p m but now jobidnis suggesting that we acting been more legislation need it right now and hest be soft legislation these be the kind of legislation that increases the number of administrative law judges we can process more people and let them into the interior faster that is the real see the real he is the let people in faster not to limit the flow but to increase the flow according to the associate press president began on fridge pressed congress to embrace it by partisan sent deal to pare border in forcemeat measures with you crane aid how speaker might johns suggested the compromise on border and emigration policy could be de way in his chamber bison is trying to shift this off by are tending affectively speaking that what he is doing right now is it giving a he is trying come to a compromise he is trying comake real now again he does not en to make a deal close the boarder he dos not and right now that compromise what we sit we seen no actual material from what tho compromise looks the leagues suggest that the democrats only want to have sort of an automatic border closing at five thousand bordering counters to day five thousand border in counters to day now last it checked five thousand is a lot of bordering counters in fact if you had five thousand born counters to day on average o be tongue but almost two million people won went right million people entering the country ever you that's a lot of people it is reduction for where we are now by not by much we would two point four million minimum last year republicans being the hard hearted people they are they were apparently thinking about eight three thousand border limit which would still be almost one point one million people a year which is still too much how about zero about zero he about you common and you show actual evidence you require asylum and then we will consider whether to let you in how about you show up e find in actual set of jobs kills that enriches the united states and makes america stronger and then maybe we let you in about you do not get to come here and then just throw up your hands clemasylum be released into the interior ho about that but again there is always a couple of republicans wo are willing to provide cover for this sort of stuff enter jams landlord white i typically center landlord does a good job no aroma but he is now accusing republicans of tanking the deal now if you really wants republicans decide with him on thus we need to see the deal i cannot en worse a deal until i have seen it and form what have heard leave is not a good deal not by any strutting imagination here center landlord there well it stealing not in to later buts people land it is focasonex on during people around on it it is interesting re publicans four months ago would not give funding for you crane for israel and for a other border because we demanded changes in policy we actually lock terms together and aid were not in to giveyou money for this we want a change in law and now it is interesting i you months later when are filling it to the another o just getting actually do not want a change in law because the press inti elect on her we all haven oath to the constitution and we haver a commitment to say we are going to do whatever we can to be able secure the border of are not mean let us you the deal and if that is the case then it'll sum for it but if that is not the case then jobidins just close the border now and again this the way democratizing in a tryimgplated also lying for t is helping out democrats here democrats are claiming that jobidon requires additional legal authority to do what he is doing and that is the reason why they are not compromising with regard to legislation that is the reason why the not just caving to re publicans they needs some sort of compromise that if that is grand republicans are standing in the way o the compromise republicans meanwhile i date just surrender just surrender you could do it to morrow yourself with executive authority o neededditional last do this ore you could actually jo pass each a too he is not doing either of those things and just one second we will get to democrats trying to make this case first america currently experiencing in precedent invasion as we have said with millions legal emigrants flooding over our border the drunkard tells are doing the invading they are doing it under the by demonstration's watch as means are shouldering the fight against the search here is on his governor remains really silent because join continues to pursue this nonsense i traveled two america southern borders when cover the shocking truth and the real depths of this crisis it is shocking it is criminal it is our duty at the dailywaye to share that truth take a look an invasion on the southern border america is currently experiencing an invasion r we e new is back is in to can a scan i rat theory it is their febrific gang if relation and all the oh people ten core border e we waving their hand on the a or candor thank hank er and o we in e no longer the border the to for e won o to a number one than in america o hands in r crap to across of the border and if jobidon remains in office it is only going to get worse ism bent hero and this divided states o widen invasion on the southern border much now on daily wire play as hat your southern word it is wide open jobitan has crafted this posy he has created it join me on the ground it's i bring you the real world consequence is one most destructive presidenci'sin america history watch invasion on the southern border streaming right now over a daily wireplos of cam meanwhile as we say democrats are trying to shift the border conversation into why an't republicans just compromise why will not republicans come to an agreement hes pavan customs stick he is running a shadow presidential campaign he is easily sticking around just in case jobidon should fall off a bridge or something train o collapse which he could do theoretically here is the governor of californium who been a horrible governor here is the governor talking about how the is really republicans called the border we have had six million a apprehensions of the border what ultimately should happen tall us people and the the people do not qualify for a sworn r totally came in a legally ism in sure there bee the importations as what republicans are coin for the the mass round ups in the port but but what what wither give to do with the cards that a out you to dead i the reality on the ground and you have to have a comprehend of conversation around this across the specter of the push the pull and that is ground tat fundamental a she emigration reform it is not just border security the present put out a comprehend strategy pathway to citizen along the wines of their former hero road dragon to dress the reality on the ground we have a plan fourteen billion dollar plan right now to get more judges to process people more efficiently wore quickly provide security got at the border twenty three hundred new border agents that is what the present united states is put up and front of congress in the refuse to act their just promoting an a agenda to destroy and find a crowbar to put in the spokes of the wheels of the body n administration to tissue any progress on this because they do not want progress no actually mu democrats want is to open that speaker further to let in more elulimigrants that us want to do with faster administering of the law as opposed to know keeping people in mexico to wait for their asylum hearing for example to democrats in order to actually pass this particular logical bar that is to establish that jobitnen catches unilaterally close board to day which he can s they trotted out enter cristmurphy from connecticut to make this particular case suggesting the join does not actually have the legal authority to close the border ism spoiler last he absolutely does thenar republican concluding t housebreaker argue lot of them not the enter dealing with but a lot of them argue that present binary has the authority that he to secure the border and at their criticizing this deal of the v an negotiating i what do you make of that a then notion that present began army has tools and he does not in for yet well it is just not true it is a political talking point a those same republicans of ass of representatives to say president by has the tools introduced a oh a too which is a massive border reform bill they said it was one of their most important priorities a and republicans have said openly they want to pass border n immigration reform all of a sudden they are against border emigration reform because they are worried it is actually going to pass say wrong what they originally said was gabion has the authority do thing then they said you known we would e to force him to do the thing could force him to do thing by passing additional laws that force him to do the thing and then join said one not going to do the thing in legislation san o they said find we will not do the thing in legislation just do the thing yourself do it right now we you the force you in lawbutif you will not do that if ten democrats are holding it up well then find yous will not do a deal there will not be a deal you have no leverage republicans are saying to me you have no leverage and you now what they right they do not have leverage again the entire democratic casern is that in trying blame the impacts on dona trumps a here is christmurphy suggesting an this a donate trumped scheme that he does not want legislation pass because he wants casts to the border we do have a by partisan total were finishing the text right now and the question is whether republicans are an eliscenadonal trump who wants to preserve chaos at the border because he thinks that it is a winning political issue for him or whether we are gin the pass legislation which would be the biggest by partisan reform of our bordered emigration laws in forty years and wo would give the president of the united states whether that president is a republican or a democrat new important power to be able to better manage the flow of people across the border hat's the train wame trump he's trying to blame trump for the lack of legislation now trumps response to this should be join is see legislator how's president s did it when he just doing the thing but dona trump is dona trumps to here is dona trumps response to all this president at biding is backing a senate de out the clamp down at the border whale trump wants republicans to oppose that dale and deny bison any political en sh a lot of the senators tat trying to say respectfully that let me in a mans that that is a please plaint on me please because they were not get ready to pass o her ben bill a please blame on me is not exactly what you are looking for here politically why why please blaming on me why this sits for language he used when he is president about a government shut hin blame it on me what no no blame on bison that is the whole point that is what a campaign is blame it on jo it is jo bisons fault he is the present what you doing what r you doing if you ware a found of trump an you for trump to be the president of the united states again or if you just do not want to biding to be president of the united states again you need blame jobidon be what why why would you say blame in on me democrats are going to literally use that in ever ad with regard to the border from now till the election why would you say that it does not make any logical sense especially fit is not true what is going on right now is not felt the sent republicans is not the felt the dona trump it is the fault of democrats who want the border open and our presenting bad compromises in the senate and then pretending that jobidon does not already have legal authority to make sure that our border is safe and secure which of course he absolutely does he already has all the necessities in order make sure the border is secure that is all ell meanwhile president trump again the entire case of democrats can to make against president trump is that he is unelectable that he is crazy and all of the rest or alsicgan time bankrupt him i mean that that that is one of the big things that is happening right now is that legally there just going after him in every way shaped form that they can we issue names over in new york is trying to go after him for hundreds of millions of dollars basion just in absolutely specious and ridiculous judgment they sent him in fleeing realistic values with no actual damages by the way to the lender there going oft from for lice hundreds of millions dollars meanwhile another jury has now given dona trump in eighty three point three million dollar defamation penalty to egg carol on top of a five million dollar penalty he was already order to pay her just thy at the start she claims and an unspecified time in a department's store in the middle of the day in an unspecified season down trump raped er has no proof to back this up none has it no substantiating roof that any of the sis true but because there is in new york an are hates dona trump and all the rest they decide that it is true and dona trump saying that it is not true and that she is liar and all the rest of this that that now amounts to defamation and they have given him an judgment of eighty eight mill in dollars eighty eight million dollars meanwhile in that other case that imp up with fetish names judjarther negro is going to issue his decision on financial penalties names at once trumping is trumpets to be orders be three hundred seventy million dollars you are talking bout in total four hundred and fifty million dollars removed from presiding trump if this judgment were to go through trump is appealing all of this obviously but do the effort to bankrupt do not to criminally prosecute mom but the bankrupt him as well is truly an astonishing astonishing thing and the gold here is obviously to make him to tat is not possible to both for him is the case that the the estimable a o c is making that trump cannot win a general election his primary numbers are low and all the rest of it but i do one ask you about the presidents re election campaign as as tom of these he battle ground states he has the real vulnerabilities why do you think he is struggling against former president dona trump some one who is been indited for times that who is now tan flap with this eighty three million dollars civil won't i think we can take a look at the over all landscape here i if bonus we were locking out with president but i but i but forme present trump also has extraordinary on our ability is we to at in new samphire i the fact that he is a former siding president had of his party virtually every one els has dropped out an en dosed him and still as we just saw nick half i cam in you he can't clear about forty three present an new samphire to i very not well o for dona trump and has the ability to win a general election now agent withal done true foibles with all of his failures with all the rest to the sort stuffed don trump is still the leader right now if you look the polling data right now he is up in the real clipolitics pulling average by more than for points which really means five or six because the polls ten to under represent dona trumps base of support the latest rioters pose pole that came out the twenty fourth haddonall trump up five on jobidon in fact there has not been a national pole in which jobidon leads it since the beginning of the year when you look a the state polling data thing start to get a little more interesting if you look at for example wisconsin you have not been pulled all that much latest pole is in like beginning of remember dona trump as up four right now real clerpolitics has that stacked up as it high the latest polling in michigan is more recons and dona trumps up very heavily in michigan in fact he is lead in the last four poles in michigan meanwhile last three poles and pennsylvania he is down the election re hell to day donna trump led likely win the election by winning wisconsin as well as michigan but it is still a very close run thing why isn't such close rushing pes gan go back to the gengthsho when it comes to policy jobidon is a bleapsho he is an absolute leap show plus and combine that withe fact the he does not seem to be in control of his own faculties is a real problem for him here is jobidon over the pecan referring to dona trump as the sitting president of the united states i serer ready stotabo p e a o o e want coney crash you here sound he press tho same i e bee father r om come on no om that som

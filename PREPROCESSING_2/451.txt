welcome to the ubermanta science science pase tore i may andruhubermen and ism a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day's episode is about the biology psychology and practises of social bonding from the day we are born until the day we die the quality of our social bonds dictates much of our quality of life it should therefore be no surprise that our brain and indeed much of our entire nervous system is wired for social bonds now social bonds occur between infant and parent there even particular wiring diagrams within the brain and spinal cord and body that are oriented towards the she civic bonds that occur between infant and mother as well as infant and father and we have specific brain circuitry's for friendship specific brain circuitry's that are activated in romantic relationships and as it goes specific brain circuitry's that are activated when we break up with a romantic partner or when they break up with us or when somebody passes away moves away or other wise leaves our lives in one form or another to day we are going to talk about those brain and nervous system circuitry's we re also going to talk about the petrochemicals and hormones that underlie their function and we are going to touch on a number of important and actionable tools that you can apply in every day life and because we are headed into the holiday the new errand christian holiday that you can deploy in your various interactions with family members and friends and should you not be spending time with family members and friends to day we are also going to talk about how to achieve social bonds out of the context of family and romantic partnership and friendship to day's episode is going to include a lot of science a lot of actionable tools and ism confident that you will come away from to day's episode with tremendous knowledge about how you function for instance if your n introvert or an extravert why is that turns out there may be a petrochemical basis for that maybe a somebody that really enjoys social medium may be a somebody that does not damn going to talk about a gene or set of genes that predicts whether or not you will follow more people or seek out more on line social interactions or fewer believe it are not there is biology around that now in its excellent purereviewed work we will also talk about how bonds are broken and why break ups can be painful not just romantic break ups but break ups with friendships and to workers and ow to move through those more seamlessly regardless of your age and regardless of whether not you are in a romantic partnership of one former another or not i do believe this episode will be useful to you as you explore the social bonds that already exist in your life end as you seek out new and changing social bonds before we begin i to emphasize that this podcast is separate for my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my destroy effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens at lentic greens is an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand in twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens on the reason i still take athletigreens once or twice to day is that it helps me cover all f my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which our vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called got microfilm and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essential with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body with out lentic greens tie gat the vitamins i need the minerals i need end the phobics to support my microfilm if you to try both lentic greens you can go to athletic green stock come slash supermen and claim a special offer he will give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin d the k too there are ton of stand you showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if wore getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient in vitemend three and k too is also important because it regulates things carvascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic greenstone come slash supermen to claim the special offer of the fie free travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar have talk many times before on this podcast about the key role of hydration end electrolytes for nerve sell function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues an organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium in potassium present in the preparation all of those cells function properly and all our bodily system can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration end that your getting the preparations of electrolytes if you to try element you can go to drink element that is element do come slash supermen and you will get a free element sample pack with your purchase there all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to element element do come slash supermen let us talk about the biology of social bonding and i want ta point out that i use the word bonding intentionally it is a verb and in biology we want a think about verbs because everything in biology is a process it is not an event and when we think about things in biology is a process that mean s it is going have multiple steps and to day we are going to explore the step start to finish of social bonding meaning how social bonds are established how they are maintained how they are broken and how they are re established now an important feature of biology generally but in particular as it relates to social bonding is that the neural circuits meaning the brain areas an neurons and the hormones things oxytocin which will talk about to day and the other chemicals in the brain embody that are responsible for the process we call social bonding are not unique to particular social bonds they are generic what i mean by that is that the same brain circuits that are responsible for establishing a bond between parent and child are actually purpose in romantic relationships this might not come as a surprise to many of you many of you are probably familiar with this idea of securely attached people verses anxious attached people verses avoided attached people we are going to touch on that a little bit but all of that has roots in whether not children and parents formed healthy social bonds or whether not they had challenge social bonds now it is clear from the scientific and psychological literature that just because you might have had a not great or even terrible social bond with apparent or with some other caretaker or loved one as a child that does not fate you to have poor social bonds as an adult there is a lot of plasticity in the system meaning it can change it can rewire in response to experience and as we will soon discover there specific components within the curl circuits of your brain that are responsible for social bonding that allow you to place subjective labels on why you are doing certain things and to rewire the curl circuits for social bonding we are gin to touch on all of that today but the important feature really to point out is that we do not have twelve different circuits in the brain embody for different types of social bonds we have one and there some universal features that underlie all forms of social bonds were gin a start by exploring what those curl circuits are and then we are going to see how they plug in to different types of social bonds and then we are going to explore things introversion extraversion were even a touch on a little bit about things trombones healthy bonds and various other aspects of how humans can bond to one another and as you will soon discover there is a unique chemical signature of all bonding of all kinds and you are going to learn how to modulate that chemical signature before we talk about social bonding i want to talk about its mirror image which is lack of social bonding or social isolation now for better for worse there is a tremendous literature on the biology of social isolation and all of the terrible things that happen when animals or humans a social isolated at particular phases of life for those of you that are introverts you are not necessarily damaging yourself by deciding to spend less time with other people many people time alone i personally am an introvert i get a thrill out of spending time with one or too close friends but i enjoy a lout of time by myself i to socialize i would not call myself an extreme introvert but i know there some extreme introverts out there but when we talk about social isolation what were referring to is when animals are humans are restricted from having the social contacts that they would prefer to have and to just briefly touch on the major take always from this literature which stands back a hundred years a more being socially isolated is stressful and one of the hallmarked features of social isolation is chronically elevated stress hormones a adrenalin also called epinephrin cortesall a stress hormone that at healthy levels is good for combating inflammation helps us have energy early in the day focus throughout the day but if cortesall is elevated for too long which is the consequence of social isolation the immune system suffers and other chemicals stare to be released in the brain and body that are designed to motivate the organism animal or human to seek out social bonds an example of one such chemical is a petite called take kina take kina is present in flies in mice and inhuman and under conditions of social isolation its levels go up and because of the brain areas that contain receptors for take kina people start feeling very aggressive and irritable after social isolation now that should be elicit counter intuitive to you you would think oh if you isolate an animal are or human and then you give them the opportunity for social interaction they should behave very well they should be thrilled their finally getting the nourishment the social nourishment that they have been lacking for long turns out that not the case chronic social isolation changes the nature of the brain and body such that it makes social connection harder and it makes the person who is been isolated irritable even aggressive with other people now i do not want to go too deeply into the biology of social isolation because it does not actually afford us that much insight into what healthy social bonding looks today organ a focus more on the functional biology a dual meaning of the word functional as opposed to the pathology of social isolation however i do one o point out that social isolation starts to deteriorate certain aspects of brain and body pretty quickly but how quickly depends again on how introverted or extraverted somebody is if you are somebody who socially isolated for the holidays or has been socially isolated for a period of time and is craving social contact that is a healthy craving and as will learn next the healthy craving for social contact has a very specific brain circuit has a very specific incur chemical signature associated with at and has some remarkable features that you can leverage in social contacts of all kinds i think some of the more important and exciting work on social bond and comes from the laboratory of a tie ka is a professor at the talk institute for biological studies she is an investigator with the toward huge is medical institute and in recent years out in about the last five or six years her laboratory has made a fundamental discovery as to why we seek out and put much effort into social bonds and the key discovery that she made is that much hunger much temperature much thirst we have brain circuits that are devoted to what is called a social homeostasis many of you have probably heard about homeostasis before homeostasis is the characteristic of various biological circuits and even individual cells to trine maintain a certain level is most easily thought of in the contact of hunger you do not for a while your drive to pursue food and think about food and make food and spend money on food and indeed to enjoy food goes up whereas when your well fed you do not tend to seek out food with as much vigor or as much intensity you would not invest as much time effort money et camera homeostasis is the aspect of cells tissues an organisms to seek some sort of balance to regulate themselves in a crud way you can think about the thermostat on your home as a homeostatic circuit when the temperature goes up a little bit it cools things down to maintain a certain temperature when the room gets called it it is a certain a level and a censer detects that it clicks on and then the heat goes on to maintain a certain set temperature that is a simple way of think about homo stasis every homeostatic circuit has three components or at least three one is a detector meaning the organism or the thermostat on your wall has to have some way of detecting what is going on in the environment right in the contacts of social bonding whether or not you are interacting with others and whether not those interactions are going well that has to be detected that is the first thing then there as to be a control center that is the second thing and the control center is the one that makes the adjustments to in the case of social bonding to your behavior and to your psychology sou soon learn that there are ways in which the more time that you spend alone the more motivated you are to seek out the pictures of faces the interactions with actual people physical contact and forth now that might seem obvious to you but thanks to the work of cat and others it is remarkable to learn that their specific brain centers that are adjusting our psychology in apologies that we seek out bonds more aggressively or maybe we do not because we are perfectly sated or satiated with respect to how much contact we have had with other people now the third component of this homeostatic circuit is the effector the effector is actually what drives the behavioral response is what it is what leads you to pick up your social medium start scrolling it is what leads you to text a friend it is what leads you to call a friend or make plans and what leads you to follow through on those plants again those three components are a detector a control center and an effector and as you will soon learn the nerve circuit that controls the social home stasis artily as a fourth component and that fourth component is one that places subjective understanding as to why you are doing what you are doing and establishes your place in a hierarchy now i know the word hierarchy can be a little bit of a of a barbed wire one because people immediately start thinking about boss and subordinate or in couples a leader and a follower but when we talk about social hierarchies in the contact of human interactions social hieracheys are very plastic meaning in one setting one person can be the leader in another setting the other person can be the leader you probably have groups of friends or family members where your constantly passing that the baton as to who is going a drive who is get a navigate who is going to a pick the restaurant who is going to clear the dishes and who is going to do certain activities and not others hiercheys are very dynamic and as a consequence social bonding has to be very plastic and very fluid that you move from one environment to the next even with the shine people you have to be able to make those adjustments and in the case of the social home stasis circuit those adjustments are made by a particular brain structure of talked about in this podcast before it is called the prefrontal quarter it is the seat of our higher consciousness if you will it is what allows us to place subjective labels on things we are not strictly input output we are not robotic meaning if you go to dinner with a friend and they are exceptional choosing restaurants well in the contacts of the sociahomeo stasis circuit your prefrontal quartets would allow them to pick the restaurant because basically they are dominant over you in their capacity to pick good restaurants at least in this example whereas as you leave that restaurant and perhaps you are navigating to i where to get a drink after dinner or where to walk through the city perhaps you have the better sense of direction and then the social bonding has to be maintained as you switch the hierarchy k that is the roll of that fourth element the prefrontal quarter now i just briefly want a touch on some of the brain areas that thanks to the work of cat and others we now know underlie the detection control and response o can i call them the detector control center an effector because inside of that description is not just a bunch and names of neural structures there are also hints as to what the underlying serow chemicals are and by understanding what the nerd chemicals are you can start to thing about tools that you can use to form social bonds and maintain social bonds in better healthier ways let us talk about the detector first keep in mind that you have your senses you have your vision you have your hearing you have touch you have smell you have taste sensation as i talked about many times we form the pots but it'll just remind you sensation is the conversion of physical stimuli in the environment into electrical and chemical signals in your nervous system the language of the nervous system is electrical and chemical signals photons of light are converted to electrical and chemical signals pressure on the skin were light touch on the skin is converted into electrical and chemical signals and on and forth all of that of course is flowing into the nervous system but the detector that underlies social home stasis involves mainly two structures one is called the a c c the enteron lingulate cortex and the other is the b la basilatera lemigdula and when you her the word of amygdala you are probably thinking fear but to day as you will see the immigalactialy has many different sub compartments and components and there is a reason why the basilateralomigula which is associated with certain aspects of aversive behaviors meaning moving away from certain types of things or interactions there is a reason why the bible is such an integral part of the detector system and that is because just as its important to form healthy social bonds it is vitally important to try an avoid unhealthy social bonds and the bilateral ligula is mainly associated with these aversive type responses of just moving away from certain things the control center in the socialhomeostasa circuit involves a ordinary call the lateral hypothalamus and the pariventricular hypothalamus the lateral hypothalamus and the periventricular hypothalamus contain neurons that are able to acts the hormone system in order to influence the release of things ox token which is a hormone negro petite its kind of part hormone partner or transmitter its kind of a hybrid were gan to talk a lot about oxytocin today we have got the a c in the bible these there areas tare mainly involved in moving away from things although also toward them that is the detector then wee got the control center which is in the hypothalamus and then there is a very special and important area associated with social bonding that i want every one to learn which is the dorsal rape nucleus s or d r an dorsal rape nucleus the dorsal rape nucleus is a small collection of neurons in the mid brain its deep in the brain and most of the time when you hear about safe are a p h e by the way safe nucleus you are talking about ceratonan creatine is a neuromodulator that is often associated with feelings of study after eating warmth basically satisfaction with things tat you already have however within this dorsal rape nucleus there is a small subset of neurons that release dopamine dooming is a neuromodulator most often associate with movement craving motivation and desire and the neural circuits that are rich with dopamine are things the substantial night the metonymic dopamine system the vitae the nucleus commons et camera of those names do not have to mean anything to you however this unique population of dopominurons in the safe is truly unique in that it is responsible for mediating what have been calling social homeostasis it is the effector were the response that mediates socialhomeostasis now i have not told you exactly what social home stasis is socialhomeostasis just hunger is the process by which when you lack social interaction you start to crave it what is very interesting about the fact that there dopamine neurons in this rape structure that is the effector for socialhomeostasis is that what this means is that when you are not interacting with people at a frequency or intensity that is right for you dopamine is released in to the brain in most popular conversations about dopamine and even in scientific circles when you hear dopamine release you think about reward or feeling good because indeed many behaviors and drugs of abuse increase dopamine to one of the reasons they have much addictive potential however dopamine is not associated with feeling good it is actually the nuurochemical that is responsible for movement toward things that feel good to fume out and conceptualize what we have here we have a brain area that is a detector that either will move us told or away from certain types of experiences or sensations we have a control center that is going to release certain hormones and eropeptides into our brain and blood depending on the sorts of interactions that we happen to be having and we have this response system which is the dorsal rape nuclear that contains dopamine neurons and when we are not interacting with people at the frequency or intensity that we crave dopamine is released and that dopamine causes us to seek out social interactions of particular kinds let us talk about what social home stasis is and how it plays out and again let us use hunger is an example let us say you're a person who eats every three or four hours regularly on money tuesday whensday there is day you are just accustomed to eating every three or four hours if just suddenly i steal your meal out of the fridge at work something i would not do but just for sake of a mental experimentation that would probably cause you to go and seek out food through some other route you might by food you my be upset first but then you go by food or replace the food that you are going to eat you be hungry for that food and indeed there are hormonal type mechanisms and other mechanisms that when we eat regularly and we predict that food is coming in we actually start secreting insolent which is for mobilizing blood sugar their hormones in the blood stream that make us hungry on a regular clock steal and you would seek out more food similarly if you are somebody who is accustom to a lot of social interaction and suddenly i take away that social interaction you would feel kind of let down you would crave of replacement social interaction you might be upset that you had a lunch state with a friend you are used to having lunch with them every wednesday and they cancel and you would crave the interaction can this is called a prosodical craving and indeed this is what you see in animals and humans if you what is called acutely isolate them which is just a fancy scientific word of saying deprive them of social interactions and a short term basis they start engaging in proctorial behaviors they start testing other people they start seeking out social interactions of different kines that makes perfect sense right but thought of from the different side you could also imagine how well if you are getting a social interaction with somebody on a daily or weekly basis and suddenly u removed that interaction well then people might not care ah they might just think well ill get the interaction to morrow or the next year the next day because there they are sated much in the same way that the person who eats very regularly might say well i ate four hours go an it'll eat eight hours later big deal but that is not what happens there is a prediction that we are going to have certain types of interactions and when those interactions do not happen we replace that last of interaction with a drive an a motivation to seek out social interaction and that drive in motivation it is cause boor i should say is driven by dopamine release from that doornail racket and the take way is that when we lack social interaction that we expect we become prosodical however if we are ironically socially isolated meaning we do not have interactions with people for a long time we become actually more interested this is separate from all of the tack kind and stuff that i talked about earlier falling into states of chronic stress but it is well establish now that in humans and in animals if you do not give them enough social interaction they actually become antisocial and this is actually a little bit what in one might see with long term fasting k i give the example of eating every four hours now let us give the parallel example of somebody whose been fasting perhaps for two or three days if they are expecting to eat and then the meal doesn'nterrive they are not necessarily going to immediately try and seek out food and that is a obit counterintuitive you would have thought well they have not eaten in a e very long time they are going to be very motive aid to seek out food but no they are accustomed to fasting similarly the socialhomea stasis circuit works in a way such that when we do not have social interactions for a very long time we start to lose our craving for social interactions let us look at the sociahomea stasis circuit through the lends of what is commonly called introversion and extraversion now typically when we hear about interests we think about the quiet person at the party or the person that does not want to go out at all we think about an extravert is somebody whose really social of the called social butterfly when j joy social interactions is really chatty is conn life of the party the person that is the cloche or the conofpop psychology cloche but actually in the psychology literature that is not really the way it holds up many people who appear introverted ore actually extraverted the quiet person an a party could be an extravert except that they just do not talk very much they characteristic of an extravert is somebody that gets energy or feels good from social interactions they sort of get a lift and we can predict that that lift occurs because of some release of dopamine within their brain and body and indeed there is evidence for that naroimaging study support that other forms of nerbiological analysis support that is well we can also imagine that the person whose talking a lot is somebody whose very extraverted but oftentimes people who talk a lot for their work or there somebody whose very social when you interact with them that person gets back to their car and is absolutely depleted and exhausted by that interaction or also sorts of social interactions we really cannot predict whether not somebody is an introvert or an extravert simply based on their behavior it is really more of an internal subjective label however if we look at introversion in extraversion through this lends of the socialhomeostatic set point and we think about dopamine as this molecule that drives motivation to seek out social interactions what we can reasonably assume is that introverts our people that when they engage in certain forms of social interaction either the amount of dopamine that released is greater than it is in an extravert that is right i said greater than it is in an extravert and they actually feel quite motivated but also satisfied by very brief or we could say a sort of sparse social interactions they do not need a lot of social engagement to feel sated again the catalogues ample will be hunger this would be somebody who does not need to eat much in order to feel sat is find whereas the extravert we can reasonably assume releases less dopamine in response to an individual social interaction and they need much more social interaction in order to feel filled up by that interaction and indeed this is supported by the nerobiological imaging studies rather than thing about introverts and extraverts as chatty versus quiet it is useful to think about people maybe yourself maybe other people as how much social interaction they need in order to bring this social home stacks into balance now there is the fourth component of this social home stack circuit that i mention before and that is the prefrontal porter the prefrunt of quarters is involved in thinking and planning and action and has extensive connections with areas of the brain the hypothalamus which is responsible for lot of motive ate drives it also as connections with the serious reward cents of the brain and it can act as kind of an accelerator meaning it can encourage more electrical activity of of other brain center is or as a break on those brain centers really god example 'skond of a trivial one in the contexts of to day's discussion but it is a concrete one all use it would be i know many people out there house cold showers as a way to stimulate metabolism and build up razilians in the sort of thing if you get into a very cold shower and you feel as if you want to get out what you force yourself to stay in you are forcing yourself to stay in because your prefrontal quarter is placing some subjective label on that experience either you are doing it for a certain benefit or am you have got a timer and you are using the timer as the regulator of how long you are gin a stay in they see you're over riding reflexes and that is the main function of the prefrontal quarter but as i mention earlier the prefrontal quarter components that wire into the sociahomeastasis circuit our responsible for evaluating where you are in a given hickey and that affords you a toniflexibility interns of the types of social interactions that you can engage in and whether not you are going to spend time with certain people or not whether not you are going t engage and than disengage what do i mean by this well let say you are an extraverted person you are somebody that likes a lot of social interaction and you get a lot of dopamine release on whole from a lot of social interactions o maybe one interaction with a teller at the supermarket is isn't really on give you much dopamine but going to a party will give you more dopamine unto you seek out these these larger social interactions however you might go to a party where somebody says something or you see somebody there that you much prefer not to see and therefore you decide to live the deciding to leave is regulated by that prefrontal quarter component it is important understand that just because there is a homeostatic circuit that involve areas the imigdola and the hypothalamus in these deep brain regions the dorsal safe as a human being you flexibility over your social interactions and that flexibility arise from those prefrontal circuits there is a too subjective nature to it there is a lot of context to it while there are some predictable elements of these circuits they are not simply what we call slogan shut you have flexibility you are able to say you not i love parties but i really do not wan to go to that party because and is there or i very much do not going across town in traffic but ism going to do it to day because a certain collection f people or perhaps a certain individual will be at that particular party and the prefrontal quarters again is what allows you that subjective ruling or ruling over what would otherwise just be reflexes now it'd to drill a little bit deeper into this incredible nail structure that is the dorsal safe nucleus and this small collection of anurans the dopominerans of the dorsal safe because while it is a small collection they are very powerful loneliness has been defined by the great psychologist john cassino as the distress that results from discrepancies between ideal and perceive social relationships let me re peat that loneliness is not just being isolated loneliness as he defines it is the distress that results from discrepant d sees between ideal and perceive social relationships it is when we expect things to be one way and their actually another way and which way we expect them to be and which way they turn out again is highly subjective what you expect from friendships and what other people expect from friendships con be entirely different but the circuit that underlies friendship bonding is exactly the same and it is this dorsal safe nucleus and the dopaminurons in that uncles that underlie the bond that is social friendship and all types of social bonds there is a key finding in the literature the title of this paper is dorsal safe dopaminurons represent the experience of social isolation as the paper from cities lab the first author is matters filial matters to be specific what they did is they were able to selectively activate the dopamine neurons in the social safe nucleus and when they did that they induced a loneliness state now how did they know it was a loneliness state they knew because it motivated the seeking out of social connections this is the kind of social hunger that i was referring to be for whereas when the dopamine neurons of the social safe are inhibited meaning their activity is quieted that suppressed a loneliness state that is a little counter intuitive right it is a group of neurons that when activated makes you feel lonely and when this ordinary is not activated it suppresses loneliness but if you think about it that is exactly the kind of circuit that you would want in order to drive social behavior when your feeling lonely dopamine is released and it causes you to go out and seek social interactions when this brain area has enough social interactions a sort of a figure of speech granaries do not have enough social interactions but when enough social interactions have happened that the neurons in this brainaris shut down their production of dopamine well the loneliness state turns off what we think of as loneliness as this big kind of dark cloud or or fog in our psychological landscape boils down to a very small set of neurons releasing its specific petrochemical for motivation and to me this really changes the way that we think about loneliness and that we think about social interactions there much subjective landscape to loneliness and to social interactions but at the end of the day what it really is is that we are all social animals to some extent or another and we all crave social interactions to some extent or another although the extent will very depending on where you are in the introversion extraversion continue and it is indeed a continual now the other aspect of the study that was really important gets back to that issue of hierarchy and social rank but they found is that depending on were you see yourself in the social rank the dopamine neurons in the safe will lead to one consequence or another meaning moving toward social interactions or moving away from them the whole system is set up that you have a t on a flexibility in control over social interactions just a couple of key points and actionable take always based on the information i have offered up until now if you think of yourself as an introvert it is very likely that you get a lot of dopamine from a few or minimal social interactions whereas if you're extravert contrary to m what you might think social interactions are not in a floodyour system with dopamine they actually are going to lead to less dopamine release than it would for an introvert and therefore you are going to need a lot more social interactions in order to feel filled up by those interactions not been drawing a lot of parallels between this social seeking or avoiding social isolation and hunger but is that really the case and could it be that there re actually interactions between the different drives meaning could social isolation or the desire to seek out social interactions actually relate to the hunger system and vice verse and indeed the answer is yes we do not have fifty different homeostatic systems and fifty different negro chemicals to underlay our drive to eat our drive for romantic interactions our drive for friendship interactions we have essentially one may be too and they all funny in to this same dopamine system and there's a beautiful paper that illustrate some of the cross over between these different homeostatic drives the title of the paper is acute social isolation evokes missing craving responses similar to hunger is that from rebec saxes lab at amity massachusetts institute of technology doctor cat is also an author on this paper the papers publish in nature hero science its are really terrific paper just a briefly summarize what they did they took people that were categorized as socially connected healthy human adults o these are people that are used to pretty frequent social interactions and they socially isolated them for about ten hours and they had no opportunity to acts less social media male fiction reading even a and certainly did not have the opportunity to interact with people face to face what this did is it increase social craving both subjectively the people said that they were now craving social interactions and then they did brain imaging in response to images of people people interacting food flowers other types of stimuli some of the stimuli or these images we call them stimuli but their images really a had a lot of social engagement going on in them others did not somewhere had a lot of faces showing others did not and as you might suspect there was activation of many of the brainier is that we have talked about earlier dor rape nucleus and other brainairs associated with dopomanurgecnurons when the socially isolated people viewed social cues people interacting faces and on and less for things flowers however they also had increased responses to images of food which is interesting and actually is consistent with the literature that when people are socially isolated they often will start eating more or they will change the nature of the foods that they eat now we think of that as comfort foods or soothing oneself through through eating rather than social interaction as a kind of pathology but while it might not be healthy depending on the context in the person it is really important t understand that the reason that happens is because we have a common circuit and that the system meaning the person is actually craving dopamine release they do not consciously know this is also consciously carried out but the raving dopamine release and if they cannot get it from social interactions as they normally would they will start seeking it from food now they did an important reverse experiment as well where they had subjects go on ten hours of food fasting now these were not people that were familiar with fasting they were not on doing intermittent fasting they were eating more typical meal sceduals and that created increased hunger et camera but it also increased their appetite if you will for social interactions and the important point here is that there is a common biology there is a common circuitry that underlies homeostatic craving of things that maintain us as individuals and as a species and it really places social interactions as right up there in the list of things that we consider vital for our survival and for our health things food water social interactions are really sit within a top tear amongst each other and they use the same common circuitry dorsal rape dopaminerons addition to other structures in order to create this drive to seek out certain types of stimuli now this is a very reductionist view of social bonding i realize that but it is important to realize that while we place all the subjective context oh i miss this person or i i or i really would to avoid that person at the end of the day it really all funnels in to a system whereby a single petrochemical is either being released and motivating us to seek out more of a particular type of interaction or is not released and therefore we are perfectly comfortable thing exactly where we are as i say this some of you are probably thinking oh that is probably what happens when you fall in love and indeed that is the case when people enter romantic relationships that to them are very satisfying there is this period that that the theory is that it last anywhere from six days to six months although some people report that this feeling can last many many years even decades of just feeling completely filled up and sated by the experience of being with that person much that cravings for food are reduced cravings for sleep are reduced now there is all sorts of activities and things that go along with new romantic partnerships that take up time that might get in the way of things sleep or things food but the point is that dopamine is the final common pathway by which we seek out things and we end up feeling as if we are satisfied by certain types of interactions now similarly if you have ever been isolated for a long period of time your focus might have shifted to what you arguing to eat what foregoing to cook for dinner in a much more heightened way the importance of those sensory stimuli in those types of interactions and indeed the taste of food itself expands normally when we are in social relationships that are a ones that are familiar to us we have a balance of these different drives but when one particular drive takes over and we are very focused on it because they all funnel into the same circuitry there really is not the seeking out of certain types of behaviors food seeking when we are newly in love now that does not mean that food will not taste good to us that we do not seek it indeed their experiments thathave been done where if people have just fallen and love the taste of a strawberry can just be incredible the other effect if dopamine is that it changes the way that we interpret sensory stimuli are detectors s actually change when we are in heightened states of dopamine uric activity or drive easily what this means is that things seem better than they would when we have less dopamine in our system the point here is that there is a lot of cross over there is a lot of meshing together of different homeostatic drives that they do not exist in separate channels and it is only under conditions in which one particular hemostatic drive is kind of being played out to the extreme such as the example falling in love that we tend to avoid or sort of overlook the other homeostatic drives and that is because simply were getting enough dopamine we do not need any more up until now have been focused on the organizational logic of social bonding which is really just nerves speak for how is it that we form bonds avoid bonds whether people seek out more or fewer bonds than others et camera now it'd to shift years a bit and focus on what are some things that we can do to encourage the formation of healthy bonds there is a beautiful study that was published in sell report sell press journal excellent journal the title of this papers conscious processing of narrative stimuli synchronizes tartrate between individuals i mention this on a previous podcast but i to mention it again and going to elicit more depth because it points to specific actionable items that we can all use in order to enhance the quality and depth of social bonds of all kinds now the study involved a very simple type of experiment they had people listen to a story everybody in the study listen to the same story but they listen to that story at different times and indeed in different locations different people same story and they measured things heartraht they measured breathing et camera now what was the motivation for doing this but there is a long tending literature showing that our physiology things our heart rate are breathing our skin conducting meaning the amount of sweating can be synchronized between individuals and that synchronization can occur r according to a variety of different things there been studies that have people look at one another and they look and actually see that their pupil size of their eyes starts to synchronize people's breathing consynchronize people a body temperatures can even start to synchronizer at least shifts in body temperature can synchronize one person gets cooler the other person gets cooler a lot of this is subconscious some of it can be detected by conscious cases flushing of the skin are actually seeing some one's pupils change but actually the pupil reflex as a really god example whereby except for rare cases and certain highly trained individuals most people cannot control their pupil reflexes in a very deliberate way its truly a reflexes an autonomic reflex there is a lot of ligure showing that within small groups are two people these physiological signals can be synchronize what this study found was that when people listen to the same story but at different times their heart rates starts to synchronize this is incredible because people are listening to the story at different times but the gaps between their heart beats become very stereotype and map almost precisely on to one another that is incredible now we also know from an extensive literature that the quality and perceived depth of a social bond correlates very strongly with how much physiological synchronization there is between individuals in other words when your bodies feel the same you tend to feel more bonded to somebody else and this whole thing is as rather circular argument when you feel closer to somebody else your physiology synchronize and the reverse is true as well when your physiologist are synchronize you feel closer to other people this is what i call the concert phenomenon if you ever go to see your favorite a band or you go to a concern that you particularly love you will often look over at somebody and you will see them enjoying the same thing and there often in a similar state as you are maybe the the sort favorite song comes on and you actually feel connected to that person you feel your obviously there is a shared experience but there is also a shared physiological response to that experience and this can happen and mass with large groups of people or it can happen just between two individuals and as the study points out it can actually happen between individuals without them actually interacting with one another when the story they are listening to is the anchor or the driver of their physiology this really points to the fact that the body and the brain are reciprocally connected yes indeed what we think what we hear what we feel drives our physiology our heart beat a respiration et camera but our heartbeat respiration also are influencing are state of mind and in this case it is encouraging certain types of social bonds when our heart rates are synchronized you can leverage this how can you leverage this well let us take a upcoming example of the holidays there is a a a sort of a joke am i think it as roads em sort of but his philosopher type a that said a if you think you are enlightened go visit your parents and i think what he was referring to is that some people not all people have challenging relationships with their parents or can o talk about child parent a attachment and interactions and a few minutes but ye some people have a wonderful relationship to both their parents and more power to them i think that is a that is wonderful we should all be lucky many people have challenged relationships with their parents or they've a great relationship with their parents but their parents know or they know how to drive that dart right into that particular soft piece of psychological flesh by saying that just the slightest thing or even by raising their eyebrow r rolling their eyes or the tone in which they do something this is also true between siblings i think many of your can think of examples where this is true many people when they interact with others expect that the mere interaction with whether person is going to create the sense of bonding and often that is the case for instance if people are involved in intimate disclosure if people enjoy a their each others company much that just the mere sight of somebody evokes great feelings and its mutual that often can happen but in many types of social interactions it is not the direct interaction with that person that makes us feel close to them but rather it shared experience and shared experience is shared physiology that is the point ism trying to make by way of the study about conscious processing of narrative stimuli synchronizes tartrate of different individuals for instance if you have a somewhat challenged or somewhat a let us call it a a slight friction in getting close with somebody or it can be a challenging interaction oftentimes it is very useful to focus outward on some other common narrative a move oftentimes people all watch a game together actually there's a lot of a critique that a people or families will focus outward too much on external events but these external events can be observing the grandchild than how wonderful they are or observing the meal and how wonderful it is or as we commonly see in various traditions there is a story that s repeated each year certainly in the upcoming holidays there christian stories their there themes and traditions and those themes and traditions anchor a number of different aspects of our psychology there really wonderful they thread through a the ages really and allow us to link our own experiences up with previous generations and experiences but in addition to that they synchronize our physiologist and sometimes it can be useful rather than expecting others to shift our physiology in the way that we wish or us shifting their physiologist in the way that we wish and then expecting some bond to mushroom out of that in some beautiful way to focus on some external stimulus to focus on something that will synchronize the physiologist of both people that can act as a bridge in order to establish social bonds and the is is not a hack or a work around for making terrible relationships good this is actually at the seat of what we come away from a social interaction with as feeling how that was a really wonderful time often a really wonderful time can be by virtue of the specific things that were said or the specific things that one engaged in but more often than not the final common pathway we should say of great experiences was a great physiological experience and a shared physiological experience i have a shore anecdote that relates to this have an older sibling and she is to say that when she was in college the best dates that she ever went on were dates where of she was asked to go out and listen to music she pointed out however that often times of the guides that would ask her out would take her to ja clubs she always had the theory that the would ask her to was clubs because it jasclubs typically you would sit down and then she had to conclude that they could not dance a my sister likes to dance and any time one actually had the nerve to take her dancing those om turned out to be particularly of less sou say satisfying dates and relationships at least they lasted longer that is all i know about them that is all i want to know about them the shes my sister after all but the theory behind whoever was asking her out on these dates as it was the right one which is that if you want a bond with somebody you create a common physiological response through a common and shared experience and that is often a good entry way into establishing whether or not it is always a question whether not there can be common physiological experience between to individuals up until now we've been talking about social bonding through the lens of nerd circuits that are already established however early in the episode i mention that these very nerd circuits t a responsible for social bonding in adult forms of attachment be it romantic or friendship or otherwise are actually established during development one of the more important and i think exciting areas of early attachment as it relates to adult attachment comes to us from the work of allay shore fallen shore spelled a l l a n shore c h o r e is a psychoanalysts who also has deep understanding of neurobiology of attachment both in childhood and in adulthood and he is focus a lot on difference is between right brain and left brain forms of attachment now in a early episode to the hubormin labpodcast i touched into the fact that most of whats discussed in the general public and or poppsychology and even in some neurobiology courses about right brain verses left brain and one side of the bring being more emotional on the other side be more rational is completely wrong o most of what i see out there is actually backwards to the playthings actually work and while there is somewhat we call lateralization of function meaning certain brain functions are handled by anurans on one side of the brain or the other the idea that one side your brain as a emotional on the other side of your brain is rational is just not simply not true however t e work of along shore points to some very concrete nerd circuits that do have a lateralization by us meaning they are more right brain than left brain or more left brain than right brain that underlie certain forms of attachment between child and parent in particular child and mother and that these right brain isms if you will and left brain isms for attachment get played out again and again in our forms of attachment as adults i to talk about that work briefly now because i think it really points to the number of important features of how we establish bonds and the different routs to establishing mouse within the field of psychoanalysis there a longstanding discussion of course about the called unconscious or subconscious the things that we are not aware of and i think there is growing evidence pointing to the fact that at least one major component of the subconscious or the unconscious is the called autonomic nervous system the autonomic nervous system is the portion of our nervous system that controls are reflective breathing are heart rate are on skin conducting mean in our sweating pupil size its the aspect of our nervous system that makes us more alert or more calm its the called sympathetic meaning for alertness or para sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system para sympathetic for more calming responses now what doctor shore's work and the work of others is now showing is that early infant parent in particular infant mother attachment involves a coordination or synchronization of these right brain circuits and these left brain circuits as they rely relate excuse me to the autonomic nervous system how does this play out while it plays out where early on as an infant when you are born rope truly helpless you cannot feed yourself you cannot warm yourself you cannot change yourself and you certainly cannot emulate walk anywhere to get the things that you need all of those functions all of those needserather are met by your primary caretaker typically that is the mother fathers of course play role also but because a breast feeding or even bottle feeding typically mothers play a more prominent role i realize their exceptions but that is the general rule there are now brain imaging studies examining the brains of infants end the brains of mothers as they interact and showing that the physical contact between the two the breathing of the mother and child the heart rate of the mother and child and indeed the pupil size of the mother and child are actually actively getting coordinated in other words the mother is regulating the infants autonomic nervous system primarily and the infant is also regulating the mother's autonomic nervous system a small coo from a baby or a cry which is a stress cry from a babe will definitely regulate the autonomic nervous system of the mother this whole right brain system is directly tapped in to e called oxytocin system and will talk more about oxytocin in a moment oxytocin again being this peptic hormone is involved in social bonds of all kinds but that at least in early childhood is very closely associated with milk let down in milk production there is actually a lot of stimulation of oxytosand release in the mother by nursing itself physical contact with the nipple am and by the contact of skin between baby and mother and their specificity there it is not just any baby that can evoke the most amount of oxytose and release from the mother now however there are examples where just holding a child will evoke oxytose and release in the non parent or somebody other than the parent i think most people experience that that is the new poppy or new baby phenomenon cause indeed poppies can evoke oxytose and release as well the point is not that oxytocin is only released in response to the primary a relationship or the mother and their child but rather that the amount of ox toxin scales with how closely related one is to that particular child and and vice verse there is oxytocin release occurring in both the child and the mother this right brain system is an emotional but autonomic system it is below are furbelow our conscious detection now as we get older there is another system that starts to come into play in parent child interactions and this also comes into play and sibling interactions and forth and that is the left brain system as described by alongshore now again this is not about a motion versus rationality this is about autonomic verses more conscious forms of bonding on the left brain circuit side we there r is evidence for baste on hero imaging studies but also animal studies to support the idea that on the left brain side of things there is a processing more of narratives that are very concrete logical narratives of and again i have to fume out and and just really tamp down the idea that it is not that one side of the brain of is emotional on the other side is rational but rather that these two things are happening in parallel and that there is a bit of a dominance for the left brain circuitry to be involved in the kinds of bonding that are associated with prediction and reward good example would be reading to a child every night sitting there and reading i can recall reading to nice and seeing of a her parents read to her and she had no clue whatsoever with what they were saying because she well at least i do not know but she certainly could not speak but she looking at the pictures and it was a very predictable sort of interaction it was oka outcome the books it was usually hears the bath than there is the pajamas than there is the lights go down than outcomes the book and then there is the interaction between parent and child which of course usually also involves physical contact it is not at the right brain system in h left brain system or operating separately their operating in parallel but that sort of prediction and reward kits to be read to is generally meed by this left brain system and this carries on as children get older and is parents take on and evolve their parenting rolls it is very apparent that healthy social bonding between children and caretaker relies on the fact that both this right brain system and the left brain system are engaged that there is a synchronization of autonomic function meaning a joining together in actual somatic feeling and that there is a synchronization of experience that is more about some outward or external stimulus reading a book or watching a show together or enjoying some common experience of a meal together and of course that children get older they are able to acts us more and more cognitively sophisticated things you can watch a move with them and they'll make predictions about which characters are going to she up for instance or you can a take them to a concert and they can appreciate the concert or play in that concert and they appreciate that their being appreciated one their million different there is infinite number of examples here but the ideas that there too parallel circuits that are important for establishing bonds and that this is set up very early on in childhood and the it is neither emotional nor rational but both now both of these circuits tap in to the circuitry that we talked about earlier where dopamine is released and molecules serotonin which again is a naromodulator more associated with feelings of warmth comfort and satisfaction with our immediate surroundings and possessions rather than seeking of things and motivation and dravetical look for things as is the case with dopamine there still interactions with those systems but the work of alongshore has stimulated a lot of interest in what are these circuits that underlie these autonomic bonding this matching of heart rate and breathing and what are the a normal circuits that underlie this bonding or this synchronization of experience on the kind of left brain side the reason i find this model attractive is that it is very clear that healthy child parent bonds are established but not by one or the other of these right brain or leftbrain systems but by both and there is not enough time to go into it right now but some of you are probably familiar with this idea of anxious attached verses avoiding attached verses a there is a kind of dissociative attached model of infant parent bonding just briefly what is becoming clear from the norbiological imaging studies is that as people start to it advance into adolescence and adulthood and well into their elderly years the same circuits that were active and established in childhood are purposed for other forms of attachment and that to have truly complete bonds with other individuals but in particular with romantic partners it is important that there be both synchronization of physiology and synchronization of these more i guess we could call them more rational or predictive type circuits we can reverse this information we can start to think about what sorts of bonds to us feel very enriching and very complete we know that we can have for instance an emotional connection with somebody but we can also have a connive connection with somebody have many colleagues with whom i have deep intellectual connection and convergence with i wouldn't say that i have deep emotional connection with most of them a few of them yes but most of them know others in my life for instance i have a deep emotional connection to but not a lot of deep connive connection to a good example would be the connection that i had with mi bull dog who unhorsing passed away but costello we had a very close emotional connection i it was based on tach is based on our walks it was based on fun it was very autonomic the we rarely discussed if ever what we were doing we had a felt relationship as opposed to a cognitive relationship and while am sort of half kitting about that is an example it is a really good example it was a very real bond and in fact just as a brief anecdote i can remember when castellan was a puppy and i was entirely responsible for his well being i any parent of any infant i lost my appetite for those few weeks when i was house training him and i seem to lose all ability to process any cognitive information now was also sleep deprived but i was entirely focused and the autonomic bond that we were forming now thankfully a that eventually was established pretty quickly a basically i went on to just easily feed him walk him and do everything for him and we had a wonderful relationship now it is very clear that what were talking about here is a form of empathy empathy is the ability to feel or at least think we feel what others feel because again as my colleague in the great engineer and psychiatric stamford carldiserof has said on he was a guessed on this podcast we really do not know how other people feel we just get the sense that perhaps we are feeling the same thing or re feeling something different and we infer r we project what they might be thinking empathy is this sense that we are sensing what other people are sensing kind there is no real way to verify that except if your measuring physiologist you could get some inside into that in the clinical psychology and in the nerbiological literature now it is understood that there is both emotional empathy actually feeling what somebody is feeling and what is now called cognitive empathy connive empathy is this idea that we both see and experience something the same way at a mental level emotional empathy is this idea that yes i can feel what you feel at a visceral somatic or autonomic level and it is absolutely clear that strong social bonds between children and caretaker i solve both emotional empathy this autonomic function and connive empathy that there is ha mutual understanding of how the other person feels and how the other person thinks in order to be able to make predictions about what they're going to do it is also very clear based on the emerging literature that romantic relationships and to some extent friendships although it friendships have been explored a bit less in the literature that emotional empathy and connive empathy are both required in order to establish what we call a trusting social bond another is om beautiful experiments done using your imaging of two individuals playing a trust game essentially a game where you are trying to predict the other persons behavior whether not they will behave in a trustworthy way and these a experiments tend to use real money as o there is actually something at stake and you can more less predict whether or not somebody feels a lot of trust for somebody else and whether not they believe they will act in a trustworthy manner based on whether or not they have high levels of both cognitive empathy and emotional empathy for those of you that are seeking to establish deeper bonds or bonds of any kind it is important that you think about synchronization of bodily states we talked about that earlier and synchronization of connive states now that does not men you have to agree on everything in fact oftentimes people who feel very close to one another cognitively and emotionally argue about all sorts of things and disagree about a lot of things in fact we probably know a i certainly know people and couples o that seem to bond through arguing which a is an interesting phenotype in itself but the point is not that there be total convergence of opinion or stands but rather that we understand how the other feels and we believe that they understand how we feel that we understand how the other person thinks and that they think that we understand how they think it is a reciprocal lute between two people that involves this cognition and involves emotion and it is grounded as doctor share has pointed out in our earliest forms of attachment and that makes perfect sense because the same sorts of circuits that are responsible for socialhomia stasis the kind of right brain and left brain circuits that are responsible for infant mother attachment and then later for in more intellectual or predictive type attachments between child and caregiver are the exact same circuits that we superimposed in all other types of relationships throughout the rest of our life and i should just mention that for those of you that might be thinking that you had a less than satisfactory infant caretaker interaction or form of attachment you are not alone and in fact much of the work that doctor shore focus is on is about how those early circumstances can be understood and rewired toward the development of healthy adult attachment and if you want to check out his work a he's actually got a few utuvidios out there o again it is allenshore spelled c h o r e ad love to get him as a guest on the podcast he's who has a book its called right brain psychotherapy and it is an e client book it is actually pretty accessible even if you do not have a background in biology or psychology i found it to be very interesting there a lot o excellent references and again if you are listening doctor shower alongshore we love to get you on the podcast one of the key themes to understand about biological processes is that they often work on short time scales and longer time scales and up until now we have mainly been talking about the stuff that happens on short time scales the kind of synchronization of heart rate or activation of a given set of neurons the dump some dopamine and causes us to seek out a more social interaction or less for instance but every biological circuit and function needs to have long standing effects as well and typically when you are thinking about longstanding effects in the brain and body you start looking towards the hormone system it is not always the case but more often than not near transmitters and uromodulators are pretty quick whereas hormones have longer lasting effects in fact a lot of hormones can actually travel to the nucleus of a cell and actually change which genes are expressed if ever there was a hormone or hormone molecule that is associated with social bonding it is ox token and oxytocin has a ton of interest in the popular press i w know why that is but perhaps it is because of all the incredible things that oxytocin is associated with and it is indeed a lot of things for instance oxytocin is released in the brain and binds to receptors in different locations in the body and the moment you hear different locations in the body receptors you should think well its can have logo different effects and indeed it does oxytocin is involved in orgasm it is involved in social recognition that is right when you see people that you consider your people your team your group your friends oxytocin is released even if you do not come into physical contact with them oxytocin is also social with pair bonding the feeling that they are your person and that you are there person as the common language people use it is also associated with honesty believe are not there experiments that show that if people receive a oxytocin through an innovation spray that they will be more honest and forthcoming about certain things and the oxytocin system and variance in the oxytos and system have also been associated with opium in various autism spectrum disorders there is a huge range of behaviors that is involved because if receptors foroxytosin lots of different brain structures and ere is the body that do different things however there some very consistent effects of oxytocin that are worth just listing off and then ism going to talk about two separate pathways by which oxytocin can manifest its effects and how you can actually regulate oxytocin and ways that are interesting and perhaps useful as well first of all oxytocin is involved in the milk let down reflex lactation this makes perfect sense there needs to be a cue by which the suckling on the nipple of the infant causes the release or let down of milk and milk let down in lactation is control by prolactin another hora but also oxytocin oxytose is also involved in veteran contraction during child birth its involved in cervical dilation to allow the baby to pass out of the birth candle its involved in induction of breastfeeding and of labor which is remarkable an especially remarkable given that in males release in some male animals and in some male humans and i do one say some and ill get back to this it can be involved in the erection response it can be involved in the organism responds in both males and females although there there is a very interesting difference there is a little bit of controversy about this but it does appear that in females sexual stimulation and organism cause the release of oxytocin whereas in males sexual stimulation does not cause the release of oxytocin but rather a different volume vase oppression is triggered by sexual stimulation but organism does trigger the release of oxytocin an males but with the delay of about thirty minutes why that is in the specific function of that is not clear but it does seem the oxytocin is involved in the sexual response in both males and females the main types of interactions that release oxytocin at high levels are first of all that the interaction be between individuals that see each other as very closely associated right a infant and mother are very closely associated whether not in adopted infant or not oftentimes there in close contact oftentimes they are from the very body of the other and the amount or the amplitude of oxytocin release tends to scale without closely associated individuals are just the site of one's baby or smell of one's baby can evoke oxytocin release and vice verse from the mother physical contact even more in romantic partners physical contact even the sight of a picture of a partner can evoke oxytocin release and sexual desire also trust there is is whole collection of psychological and physiological things that are package into the oxytocin system it is not just a one way system now a lot of people out there have written to me asking about a inhalant oxytocin asking whether not that can anally increase the depth or rate of perbonding and there does seem to be some evidence for that now i think in most places oxytocin is prescription although it might be over the counter an others i do not know you have to check where you are s far as i know you cant joust go out and by oxytocin nasal spray although you may be able to forgive me a naive to that point but it is interesting to note that some drugs that are being used in clinical trials for things drama and are also used in clinical therapeutic settings for increasing bonding in particular end am also called ecstasy increase dopamine and ceremony and we know this dooming in ceratonan have vast number of felt throughout the brain and body that have talked about some of them to day in another pots but one of the lesser appreciated effects of of m i am is that it causes huge increases massive increases in the amount of oxytocin that released into the brain and body and mama assisted psychotherapy while still illegal as far as i know certainly in the united states but in most places throughout the world is being explored in clinical trials not just for drama not just for depression not just for eating disorders but also for reestablishing what seem to be fractured or challenged bonds between romantic partners and while most of the attention has been focused on the doorman uric and seratonergic aspect of the emdiama response it is clear to me based on mired of the ligature that the enormously elevated oxytocin that occurs during the consumption of m i am is part of the reason why people experience during the emdiama session and post em drama session a much greater degree and depth of kinship or feeling of connection with that person and it is important to point out that that feeling of connection is of the autonomic type that i was referring to earlier all allonshoris work that it is not of the o we think about things the exact same way we agree on everything now it is more of that their physiologist are synchronized much that even in individuals within a couple where one does a therapeutic session and the other does not they still both heal quite more bonded to the other now oftentimes in the clinical therapeutic setting both members of a couple or romantic partnership whatever that form it may take are consuming m drama and then thereby experiencing elevated oxytocin and this enchant sense of bonding and again at this autonomic bonding but it is powerful meaning the oxytocin response is powerful that it does not even require that both individuals experienced this his in flexion and oxytocin and that because one person's physiologist influencing the other and oxytocin is this kind of bridging signal that occurs in both nervous systems synchronizes things heart beat obviously its associated with toucan s of people are touching or people re engaging the sorts of behaviors that i mention earlier that can increase oxytocin further that can a further increase the depth of the bond but the point here is that there's actually a hormonal glue between individuals o c infant and mother friends teen mates romantic partners and on and that hormonal glue is oxytocin now people vary in the extent to which they feel or have the capacity to feel bonded to anyone and it is now generally understood that some of that variation might depend on variations in oxytose and receptors or what are called gene polymorphisms for oxytocin genes can have a number of different sequences in them their newclytied sequences we were going to genetics right now ages and gets and was and teas in various combinations are what make up the genes genes are transcribed into are in a are in a is translated into prolines that affect cells of the oxytose in gene and cod foroxytosen and variance in that gene change the amount and function of oxytocin there is a really interesting study publishjust this last year in a relatively new journal that journal has a kind of a unusual name that hellion i think its hellion and not hello but hellion h h l iwioand this is see press journal far as i can tell its a very solid journal certainly the see press able on is very stringent and this paper is entitled the relation between oytosand receptor gene polymorphisms which just means changes in in genes ere variations and genes adult attachment and integral sociability an exploratory analysis this are really wild study but i the study ts very thorough first author last name cool c a r o l l o and what they found was that by analyzing the genetics of different individuals who are on social media and looking t how many people those individuals follow and how many people follow them and what they come up with us a called social desirability insects they were able to correlate in a very straightforward way that people that carry certain variance in the oxytocin and oxytosand receptor genes actually seek out more online social integral interactions some people i know i will not name their names only follow anywhere from zero to six accounts other people follow thousands of accounts and they take the ratio of how many accounts people follow very as how many followers they have arguably not a perfect measure but a nice one in the sense that you can do this in a completely unbiased way with many many thousands of subjects and then they were able to get genomic analysis from a number of these subjects and it turns out that people who have let say hire levels of oxytoseand function or potential levels of oxytocin function actively seek out more social interactions on social media this i think represents an important first in the area of how social media and data from social meteor trying to emerge with biological data in terms of predicting how avidly people will seek out social interactions of an online type and nowadays we hear a lot about how online on we are connected but we are not really where what is it were communicating but were not connected or the connections are real i think we are going to need to revisit that while i am certainly a believer in the idea that face to face communication and common interactions with people standing in the same pa space or playing sports together en joying music together en joying meals together as vitally important there is an entire generation or several generations of people that are coming up who much of their social interaction has been on line and if you think about it all the things that we have spelled out earlier about common mental narrative this left brain system all alongshore or autonomic bonding or synchronization of heart beats according to common stories all that is happening in online social interactions when a thousand of us look at the exact same integral post yes we will have a thousand independent responses to that but chances our many of us have a similar or same response based on the data that we talked about earlier in synchronization of heart beats and we are socially bonded with other people through social media and its very apparent that the oxytose and system is playing some role in that and this if we fume out makes perfect sense because again dopamine serotonin prolactin oxytocin none of these systems were placed in us or are organized within us in order to encourage specific and only specific types of social interactions the one that we can say is absolutely critical is the child parent interaction right because children simply cannot take care of themselves they need a caretaker i should have said caretaker not parent but infants if they do not if they are not taking care will die but beyond that we have evolved or come to realize many different types of social interactions and on line interactions nowadays are very very common ism certainly involved them on guessing your involved in them as well were involved in one right now for example the oxytocin system is absolutely threaded through and largely responsible for those types of social bonds as well and incidentally oxytocin is the name of the fifth song on billiolog's second album happier than ever we have covered a lot about the biology and indeed the neral circuitry and curl chemistry and negro inderchronology of social bonding one make sure that a halite the key features that go into any in all of your social bonds first of all asocial bonds have the potential to include both what we called emotional empathy and connive empathy and few are interested in establishing and deepening social bonds of any kind it is important that you put some effort toward this thing that we call emotional empathy which is really about sharing autonomic experience not depending on the relationship that will take on different contacts what is appropriate in one type of bond is not can be appropriate in another type of bond physical contact for instance is appropriate for certain types of bonds and not for others none the less emotional empathy and the synchronization of autonomic function tartrate breathing et camera can be best accomplished by paying attention to external events in particular narrative story music and perhaps sports or other types of experience as an external stimulus to drive synchrony of those internal states the other aspect of forming deep bonds is connive empathy again cognac empathy is not about agreeing on things or viewing things the exact same way it is about really gaining under standing of how somebody else thinks about something really paying attention to that end then paying attention to how you think about and feel about something that is what connive empathy is emotional an cogniveempathy together are what make up these really robust bonds of various kinds now we also docks about introversion and extraversion and it'd to trying dismantle the common misperception about introversion extraversion because when we look at the neral circuitry as you recall introverts are not people that do not social interaction its just that they eel filled up or sated by less social interaction than would be an extradite and that is because at least according to the social homeostatic circuit model the actually get more dopamine from less social interaction o yes somebody who sated by less amount of food o ka it does not mean they do not have the same appetite it just means that they get more from less whereas extraverts get less dopamine release from an equivalent amount of social interaction of course these are not precise measurements but on the whole extraverts need more social interaction more frequent more long lasting et camera in order to achieve that dopamine threshold because again dopamine is driving that craving of social interaction and once it is met than people do not feel they have to seek social interaction is much for those of you that feel as if your n introvert or extravert or that no introverts and extraverts it is not about how verbal people are it is not about how much they seek out social interactions per say it is about how much social interaction is enough for the given person now the whole reason for providing this framework this biological circuitry et camera is not to simply put a reductionist view on things that you already realized and new but rather to give you some leverage points to understand how is it that you form social bonds how is it that you might be challenge in forming pertains types of social bonds and to think about entry points to both establishing and reinforcing social bonds of different kinds hopefully it will also give you inside into why break ups whether it be between friendships are romantic partners can be painful a break up of any kind involves both a breaking of that emotional empathy and that cognitive empathy and indeed it has a neurological and hormonal underpinning right we go into some sense a social isolation even for surrounded by other types of people if one of our major sources of oxytocin or one of our major sources of dopamine suddenly is not around that is incredibly devastating to a nervous system and to borrow from the great psychologist and nerbiologist less bellman merit who says we are not just individuals we are nervous systems influencing other nervous systems and their nervous systems are influencing us i thing that is the right way to think about it it should come as no surprise that break ups of various kinds are very challenging regardless of what a underlie that break up there not somebody moving or an actual decision of one person to leave the relationship or both et camera on the more positive side largely biological but to some event psychological view of social bonding will also allow you to orient in this vast landscape that we call social bonds to understand why it is perhaps that you seek out many online interactions maybe you have the a oxytocin a polymorphism that causes you to want more a follow more accounts or interact more with people n a comment more or sponge comments who knows am also hoping that it will allow you to get a lends into how you can strengthen the social bonds that you want to strengthen and to establish new social bonds that you want to establish none of this is meant to manipulate or average social bonds that wouldotherwise form to the contrary its about identifying what are the specific routs by which social bonds are created and allowing you i hope to work with people that you feel challenge in forming a social bonds with or may be deciding to completely divorce from those social bonds entirely because there absolutely no hope of ever forming emotional or connive empathy i certainly knowledge that that could be the case to there is both a light and a dark and a grayzone to this entire thing that we call social bonding what is not graded but is absolute as they say is that social bonds are vitally important to us as a species whether or not they are at a distance over social media whether are not they are in close proximity actual physical contact to day woad verbally tried to illustrate is that there are common set of biological negro chemical and hormonal under penning to what we call social bonding and while it is complex and it is subjective it involves her keys it involves are previous upbringing it of wolves are goals et camera it is not infinitely complex and in that sense it is tractable hopefully have offered you some leave levers or momentary points under which you can both understand and move toward social bonds that would be more satisfying and more gratifying for you that certainly one of the goals the other one is that hopefully if you are cognition or simply the friend that people go to ore the family member that people go to when they are challenged through a various challenges in social bonds that you can start to perhaps pass along some of the information as a way of people understanding what the going through as they are breaking up but also as they are falling in love as they are forming attachments and as they are being challenged with attachments that is to my hope and especially as you head into the holidays and end of year a but also as it continues into twenty twenty two i would hope that youwould take this knowledge and apply it in any the ways that you feel are meaningful and adaptive for you if your learning from and or enjoying this podcast pleas

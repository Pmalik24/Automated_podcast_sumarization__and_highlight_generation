clouding gay is out the presidents of hazard now the former president is the shortest tenor president of hazard in the universities history and goes back several hundred years let us all remember just why lest we forget here is the president of hazard university now the former president unable to say that calls for genocide against news on campus violate the colleges policies on free speech and doctor gay at hazard does calling for the genie o news violate halyard's rules of bullying and harassment yes or no it can be depending on the contact what is the context targeted as an individual targeted as at an individual it is targeted at jewfish students jewfish individuals do you understand your testimony is the humanizing them do you understand that the humanization is part of into schematism i will ask you one more time does calling for the genocide of news violate halyard's rules of bullying and harassment yes or no antisemitic rhetoric and is not anti matiratorat antisemitic rhetoric when it crosses into conduct at amounts to bullying harassment intimidation that is actionable conduct and we do take action the answers yes that calling for the genocide of news violates hazard cote of conduct correct again it depends on the contact it does not depend on the contexts the answer is yes and this is why you should resign these are unacceptable answers across the board gay made those statements after issuing a week statement complaining about death and destruction in leashed on other seventh an israel without any reference to humans hazard students testified about their feelings of unease on campus on was underscored by actual attempted violence against some pro israel students allegedly including by members of the hazard law to view after that insane exchanged with stephanic after all hazard is not exactly a hotbed of free speech being one of the most restrictive campers in america on a wide variety of open topics closing gay came under even more fire the washington freebeacon did pullets are level work and uncovering her academic charlatanism by mid remember the freebeacon had uncovered dozens of allegations of her naturism then on money night the freebeacon revealed even more examples of naturism what hazard euphemistically turned quit to placative language without proper attribution and to plica of language without proper attribution is called platrism there is word for it but still hazard tried to keep her on they had to she of course was the poster child for their for philosophy diversity equity and inclusion or d e i which suggests that all inequality of grupoutcome is due to some sort of discrimination in the system that can only be corrected for by forms of actual discrimination in practice to allow that clouding should never have got en the position she was in that her academic record was scanty that she had involves herself in no original ground breaking work have emphasis onward original here would have been to admit that she actually got the job because she was a black female and to the leftist parlors tho b had to maintain the sheectually deserved the job the head of the end of lacy p said that those who wanted gate to go were engaging and quit nothing more than theatrics advancing a white supremacist a agenda dozens of black hazard faculty members wrote an open letter proclaiming not any suggestion that her selection as president was the result of a process that elevated an in qualified person based on considerations of race engender are specious and politically motivated but of course that is why she had the job her race and her gender she was not qualified she had the right interjectional qualities to maintain her job she was not to black man with heterodoxy's leanings roman fire the economist who had to bunked notions of disproportionate anti black police shootings and then got lasted from hazard over a bunch of specious allegations of sexual raiment she was not the jewfish man marry summers from her president who is busted after pointing out that the lack of women in stemfields might have something to do with both skills distribution and desired to enter the stem world by woman clouding gay was a far left black woman and her immunity was absolute until it was not and a probably came not absolutes people say pulling their money now the question is whether america will be satisfied to leave d e i in place with a gone which of course would be wrong in order to leave d i in place the left requires a narrative a narrative that a was actually a martyr because either she was a grifter who abused at d e i or she was a martyr or d i is itself a grift the left cannot call her a grifter because that might open the door on all the other drifters or members of the d e contingent predictably those race drifters are therefore calling her a martyr today mark lemon hill who makes an entire living suggesting that virtually all in equality in america life is the result of inequity he immediately treated the next president of hoard university must be a black woman why why cloudingated such a spectacular job that weans omen who looks just her what what wide why or for example neck hannajones who mane entire living off of being in absolutely unqualified hack historian terrible at her job has not written anything for the near times in a couple of years i believe keeps getting offered professorial positions to spite her complete battery of america history she tweeted out well they got what they wanted from their well executed plan the the they of course presumably being the white superstructure of power in america or for example coral lest who was such a lack luster academic when he was at hazard university the who is lasted for never having written anything he literally had released a rap album and no papers and they got rid of him was there on this happen and then he ended up at princedom because this is the way that it works if you have the right in her sectional qualifications in america academic life you fail upwards cornel lest tweeted out housed but printable that the same figures and forces enabling the affinity cleansing an genocidal attacks on palstinians and gaze adman bloom summers and others push out the first black woman president of hazard ah you see it is all the jewfish conspiracy to get rid of cloudy gay this racism against both palistinians and black people is undeniable and despicable o clouding gags and that is races m against palistinians have experience similar attacks from the same forces in academia with too many of my colleagues remaining silent when big money dictates university policy and raw u power dictates for policy the moral bankruptcy of america education an democracy looms large but we shall remain strong in our fight for truth justice loves is corneal west who's been spending his days standing up for compass who love neither truth nor justice nor love or ash handle a deeply terrible colonist who treated out cries ruff and bad fat righting actors win again oh you mean because crisrufo reported that she was a plates ism sorry the journalist man happened to you that is a sad one the journalisming happen to you meanwhile fiber ma enemy treated out repeatedly on h matter he suggested quote when a racist mob attack a black person it finds a seemingly legitimate reason for the attack that allows fort to a croupopular support in credibility which allows for the growing mob to deny the attacking the person in this way because the person is black now i mean what is heard about this is that lismagill who is the president of pen is no longer the president of pen inches white lady and chose lasted without any allegations of naturism because she made the comments that you may in font f the leas stophannic over university of pennsyllania also this not the first president of a major university to be lasted over researchfrom is conduct mates your levin of standard had resign over research is conduct as s back in jury when all that long ago but it man bendy says that effectively speaking any time a black person is called to account for their own sins which is what happened clouding gay that is in aspect of racism and all the rest of it is basically just for show it man bendy who is indeed the d i grifter par excellent a person who cannot defined this from racism without reference to the word racism he literally defines the teratism as racism is a series of racist policies in pursuit of a racist ideology which is most circular definition you could possibly imagine it man bendy has cleared tens of millions of dollars for being a terrible scholar who lies about america and america history it me enemy responded to a tweed from some one banquet we are returning to a color line performance base society were he judge people by their character afford and achievements and it me bendy says this is the propaganda of history to use cutely bee to blaster that they want people to believe at we should return to the color blind performance base society of massing incarceration of him crow of concentration camps of lynchings of slavery of settler colonialism yes because though those those where the choices the choices were keep clouding gay or you're in favor of making incarceration him crow c generation cams winching slavery and settler colonialism according to ibermax candy again the reason they are all standing up for clouding gate is because once the grift is exposed at can no longer be used and they require the require the grift to be used they of course are the beneficiaries of the grift is why all the drifters are out of legwork on this one it why a sharpen is out there making his usual gritty statement a sharpen who is spend is entire adult lying about america and by the way overtly line about situations including too a valley helping to inside roots in new york that who has a show on names and bees specifically because she is a quoinclat black leader thug what flock e leads is up to anybody to to discover he says quote president gaze resignation is about more than a person or a single incident this is an attack on every black woman in this country who is put a clack a crack in the glassylin question for shoeblack woman in the country are all of you plagiarists why exactly would her being asset for being a bad president who shield any semetism on her campus and also a plagiarist why would that have any impact on you the this is superconfusing to me i got i got a tell you am you went when wen mark tear living was lasted from staffer university that is a white dud is a canada america anything waw a sealing has now been set up for canada america white dudes is jo weird take but the unspoken assumption here obviously is that the reason that choose put in places because show a black woman therefore the reason that she was removed from her position is because she was a black woman the reality is choose removed from her position despite the fact that she's a black woman hazard was fighting as hard as it could to maintain her this presumably is why epic leggins at n par also to quote the intimidation is the point well the next president at harveard stand for diversity will that person be female will that person be black if not they've forced several steps back and everyone across the school gets the message what what steps back have been first they cannot get plagriss i defantantisemitism the entire idea here is that objective standards do not exist objective standards are in and of themselves racist that is the case that is being made by the d i drifters and by the way the d drifters just a boss methods of america media they are everywhere this is true certainly in the legacy media when a bring you the eight piece have line on this sag just a second as a truly is an astonishing example off just how terrible are supposed journalistic outlaws

president's resignation hilts new conservative weapon against colleges plasurism yew that is that is the new that is the new weapon is plagiarism not you might take yourself wait is not play turisemtus an objective standard i lift entire paragraphs as clouding gay apparently dead from somebody is work and unattributed put it in my own work when that getting kicked out any school in america the answers yes but the rule here when it comes to d i an equity is that objective standards are themselves racist if the outcome of the objective standard is racially unequal any objective standard if the outcome is racially unequal the standard itself is racist and bad and quint what weapon iced by conservatives is the case that been made against the essay ts against the a c ts against t any merit base tiring program is why firmer of action exists my favorite part by the way about this associated press article ism the the the amazing attempt to find the word scalped this veal funny crossruff who is a friend o the show obviously con service activist and helped or a strait this effort and helped in cover the plagiarism he celebrated her departure as a win on act he wrote scalped quote as if gay was a trophy of violins invoking a gruesome practice taken up by white colonists who sought to eradicate native america scalped is a term that has been in frequent use on the intricate for literally the entirety of the intricate nobody is invoking the idea that chis robot is standing over clouding gay with a hatchet also by the way scalping not unique to white america against native america also the opposite was true the that these evidently what in the world but the idea is the very use of the word scalped the internet use of that term is somehow a racist attack on clouding gat to clouding gate has now responded t this in her resignation letter the entire letter is about what a victim she is ah what a victim she has quote dear members of the hazard community it is with a heavy heart but a deep love for hazard that i write to share that i will be stepping down as president is not a decision i came to easily ended is been difficult beyond wards because have looked forward to working with many of you to advance the commitment to economic excellence that has propelled this great university a cross centuries but after consultation with members of the corporation it is become clear is in the best interests of hard and from metresign our community can navigate this moment of extraordinary challenge or the focus on the institution rather than any individual i deep sense of connection to hazard and its people has made it all the more painful to witness the mentions and divisions that have riven our community in recent months weakening the bonds of trust and reciprocity that should be our sources of strength and support in times of crisis amidst all of his it has been distressing to have doubt cast on my commitments confronting hate and to up holding scholarly rigor two bedrock values that are fundamental to who i m ah nope i i to seriously we the bedrock values our confronting hate an up holding scholarly rigger ism pretty sure the opposite and she says duo it is been frightening to be subjected to personal attacks and threats fuelled by racial animus yes that strip she is the victim everyone has been mean to clouding gag it is been terrible by the way she is noisier leaving university she still to be making apparently nine hundred thousand dollars year at hazard university is a professor she concludes when i became president i considered myself particularly blessed by the opportunity to serve people from around the world we saw in my presidency of vision of hazard that affirm their sense of belonging s very to all of you please know those doors remain open harvarll be stronger and better because they do ah she what if it what an honorable victim sad terrible meanwhile hazard corporation also issue to statement queasy defending clouding gallop with great sadness we rite in light of president clouding gates message announcing her intention of step down from the presidency and resume her faculty position at hazard first and foremost we thank president gag for her deep and unwavering commitment to hazard and the pursuit of academic excellent through plagiarism throughout her long and distinguished leadership as dean of social science and then as dean of faculty of orts and sciences or shes skilfully led the f i ask through the covanineteen pandemic and pursued ambitious new academic initiatives in area such as quantum science and inequality she demonstrated the insight decisiveness and empathy that all that are her palmar waw we do with sorrow they said we accept ho resignation we do with sorrow while president gat has acknowledge missteps and has taken responsibility for them is also true she has shown remarkable resilient and the face of deeply personal and sustained attacks while some of this has played out in the public domain much of it as taken the form of repugnant and in some cases races vicarial directed o her through disgraceful males and phone calls we condemn such attack in the strongest possible tom this is always the last repository of victimhood is i got really badymales and really bedruncales aunt i somebody a twenty four seven security literally my entire life because at their people who do not me very much grow up grow up lake ism ism sorry that people were mean to you on the meals that sad the people those people our bad and the son is sand sources females also your a terrible president who refuses to defend your students long as they violate interjectional tenets and your platerist they say the search for a new president of the universe to will begin in due parse apparently the interim president will be a person named barber who is the the provost of the school ism that person also shares the d e i mission ism our ill be similarly terrible honestly out can happy the clouding gay was remaining there specifically because it is a mask for the retention of d i to get rid of a few heads of d y yet revels ma gillapen a does not solve the d i probe ere the clouding gay ten solve the d i problem in order all the d i problem you actually a to take on the ideology of d i but that ideology is incredibly deeply imbedded a cross our society from everything important to frivolous from administration white house policy hallway down to entertainment this d i notion that the best way for america to run is on the basis of group identity to establish interjectional outcomes that are equivalent regardless of individual personal action it is wormdour way throughout the society and then he is to be extirpated everywhere it use to be cut out a cancer because it is a cancer d i ideology is a cancer that destroys institutions destroys trust and destroys the country it is destroyed hazard myxoma board in a second will see hours having an impact on

equity is not chest that it is the driving factor d i factor is not just the universities or in the media is also of course in the bin white house an this was the promise that jordan made on coming to the wite house which his a different promise then what he may during the campaign down campaign he said that he was going to be a moderate who governed fall america and on entering immediately he started calking by equity would be at the center of everything they do but yen equity an a quality not remotely the same thing a quality is the idea that every one ought to be treated equally that is not the same thing is everyone ought to having equal outcome which is what equity is all about here is careen john pier who herself is d i product she is terrible at her job but choose a pointed for her diversity quoceon here she is the press secretary suggesting that equity is again at the center of everything jobiton does the present has always always put equity at the enter of every polity is put for it every legislation that hes but put fort cause we understand that many community's have been left behind have been left of behind were not trying to do the trickle down economics again she is not wrong every widen policy is gear toward this idea of equal outcome and they will run rough shot over institutions rough shot over the law in order to get there this why green chon parent the she interview she is going shout jobidon unilaterally took action on soon long illegally because again the idea was that equity had to be establish no the e do not no yo we no on a over s and i want and it because they have heard from you that i mentally this as something president has tried to do and do you think that over time they start to feel trying is not a dot no but i what i was going to say what i was got a finish and say is that the present even though his plan wat stop he was able to take action and we are able to to we able to i get rid about ta hundred and tar thirty million dollars of at a more than that for millions of millions of folks across the country that matters that mes he still took action he still took action even though his hands were a tide again this is all what quid is equity suggests of course that you do not actually have to work through democratic means of politics because those are all obstructionist all those institutions obstruct equity it you have to run right over them in pursuit of the quality of outcome you do it antis has particular ramifications forward the america boarder one of the big political conundrums that we are experiencing right down the country is that the border is wide open wide open and it is totally not understandable on a political level why precisely the border should be wide open it is a huge mistake by jobidon again if you look at his palling numbers jobidon's palling numbers on emigration are absolutely awful people by leaps and bounds trust trump more than bison with regard to emigration it is approval rating on emigration over all it is down to thirty eight per cent in the last hazard caps hers poll this are terrible numbers forty six per cent by the way that they proved of it in nonmember tan's going to go down even further if he does not stop what is going on on the border and yet the bi administration which has an outright now there's the parts to mating they have a political out the bi administration could to day sign a bill a real with republicans and congress and sign a bill that would get them the eucranade that they want and that crane does in fact need get the aid to israel that israel requires in order to pursue its war with compass and possibly a war with cusbelo in its north give arm's protection to ti won and also solidify the border and mobile would be able on a political level to go back to his left to malison you got want end the craned i couldn't get that without solidifying the border and then he could go to moderates in america and take guides you wanted me to do something about border i did something about thewoardr but jo bison will not do it it is unbelievable jobidon continues to maintain and open border position than gas the america people by saying the the border is in fact being taken care of now why is that why are they doing s me here is arrange on peace doing this yesterday suggesting that jobidon took the border traces seriously from they one which of course is a lie now were having we believe a very productive conversation congress with senators know do we move for it in a by partisan agreement to deal with the word to security that is important now what we hope is that when congress suits fact will be able to act and get these things moving forward we can deal with this issue we have been in touch with the some of those mares that you talked about governors a in and northern and northern part of the country on dealing with the issue that there dealing with on the ground and we have provided o resources to them an were get it continue to have those conversations but again congress needs to act the present took this very seriously unsay one the president did not take the serious thy unsay one this present has done everything he can to keep that border open now why why is that the case the answer is because there is a deep idea logical belief on the left that somehow people are ode entry to the united states another is some people who believe that it just ta cynical ploy that it is about bringing people in will then to democrat maybe that is true quite possible they belie they done bring a bunch people in whore under educated wo do not have qualifications for higlevel jobs will and up being on welfare once there in fact given legal status by a democratic administration and then who will gratefully vote democrat for the rest of time the we the californium model an they believe that they can broadly apply that across the country maybe that is the reason it cynical reason but maybe that is the reason or maybe there is a cynical economic reason which is that the democratic party having facilitated policy that stagnates the economy requires a cheap supply of labor from south of the border in order to keep that economy humming could be that is well or maybe the is something even more deeply ideological here which is the equity argument which is effectively that america is an unjust terrible force in the world and that the only way to pay for its sins is to keep that border wide open whatever it is the the equity orientation of this administration is leaving some pretty terrific policy according to the pastry journal the by administration has now asked the supreme quart too the bore patrol to cut teases razor wire texts has put upon to razor wire on the border e drying stop people from simply crossing in areas where there is no border crossing and jobidon once the border patrol to cut the border wire what is the reason for that what would the possible ration out for that be according the pastry journal the by administration ask the supreme quart on tuesday to reinstate federal authority over the international boundary between mexicoane texts after state officials one a lower sort order blocking the other patrol from removing concertino wire texts officers had installed to determinants from crossing a twenty nine mile stretch of the real ground the move represents to get another volley in the increasing conflict between texts and the federal government over border in foremen state troopers an national guardsmen deployed by the state lead miles of razor wire as part the states operation lone star border security effort the operation is spent or located more than eleven billion dollars since twenty twenty one they have sought to challenge the federal government sell authority over international borders and now the by administration is literally suing texts to stop them from putting obstructions on the borders to stop illegal immigration that is insane that is totally wild be just on a practical level i would not join look the other way are not that that is just clear host that we will not in forth t immigration laws an if you do we will go to court to stop you from in forcing the emigration laws meanwhile correct john parts out there claiming that its shameful that migrant are being bust sanctuary city is long as they are being i ported into small towns and texts and arizona no mexico it is totally vine the man you send them to chico or new york that is an all hellbreaks loose according corning john pierce morally speaking the the bust the busting of migrate the putting them not flight it is shameful that that is a cursing and instead of if the governor really truly one the deal with thisition should talk to i the senator is in his state unbelievable a a just just to make clear we old people say the jobidon isn't really changed the border policy that is not truce the migration policy institute has a good run down on exactly what jobidon has changed in terms of policy's instating office they'd just in the first couple years of his administration according to them from canary twentieth twenty twenty one to canary nineteen twenty twenty three the first couple years of his administration the bin administration took four hundred and three emigration related actions according to migration policy institute that is supposed to four hundred and seventy the entire presidency of dona true join himself changed d chest policy that is department of homeland security's policy to target only recent border crosses and migrant who present national security threats within the country ice conducted just seventy two thousand one hundred removals in fiscal year twenty twenty two compared with two hundred thirty three thousand average annual removals under true and by the way three hundred and forty for thousand annual removals under mama widen is leagues more open on the border than barokabama ever was by far according migration policy institute just twenty eight thousand two hundred non citizens in fiscal year twenty twenty two we are remove from the interior after initially being arrested by ice the remainder were border rivals initially process by border protection by border patrol in comparison in average of eighty one thousand annual interior removals occurred during the trump administration and a hundred and fifty five thousand per year under barakobama ice also detained in average of nearly twenty two thousand six hundred people daily in final year twenty twenty two that is down from a high of fifty thousand in fiscal year twenty nineteen less than half there accorded nearly three hundredand seven thousand total booking of which two hundred fifty thousand came from the border the bid administration has dramatically increase the use of ice alternatives to detention programs which track non citizens through smart phone as or ankle monitors well there emigration case proceed that is what your hearing about the binaministration given people phones that is supposedly why but why would the people show up for their second courtdat they just disappearing to the interior way for the next background under bison the program has been used for migrant perilled in at the border according to migration policy institute ice reported about three hundred twenty thousand people in roll in all alternative to deportation in fiscal year twenty twenty two that is up from a hundred and thirty six thousand in final year twenty twenty one an just twenty three thousand in fiscal year twenty fourteen that is an insane number mean just a break that down one for time for you that means that in the year twenty twenty two ice had three hundred twenty thousand people enrolled in those alternatives to deportation that is up a factor of fifteen times over that number from twenty fourteen they are non detain docket ballooned to four point seven million cases in fisculear twenty twenty two and of course the be administration also designated new countries for temporary protected status that includes afghanistan cameroon et myopia man mar you crane even isuayland they real designated another six countries had somalia south can sodanseria and yeomen which means that bid made in additional seven hundred and twelve thousand emigrants already in the united states eligible for keep us you wonder why people think the borders penance o the borer is open it is cause jobidon basically says if you get here and you clam refuge status we give you quorate release you to the interior and we never see you again and he's perfectly fine with that long s you do not get chest over to chico or over to new york where is that coming from again it is coming from a global equity position that is the ideology that undergirds all of this all is again what is amazing about all this is there attached to this particular equity position and there even willing to destroy they're support for you cranage over it the sente of crista homeland who is at the senator democrat from martian he says that it is been really harmful to tie you crane are to for security why is that ben harmful why not just pass the thing why not just passim to day tit is hat said an on going with respect to border security a something reset by this r for for a long time as falls migration for i issues ah but wean this two issues si providing you can is the health they need a against tho an and the for security issues ah i fear an is going to mean that we do not get you crazy in to the equipment they need wen they need we can to deal it not the issues ah but ting then together in this way ah i think its tan harmful a we are working or try to result no you are not if you did you would just give bora security everyone knows that they need it by the way again russia attacking crater now you crane it needs the money i believe that the united states should help provide the support for you crane necessary to repel a a second wave russia invasion where exactly is the conflict other than you are connected to this ideology the you cannot o of it no matter what you do you's refused o of that equity ideology over at the began white house and that's a disaster area for the country again it is rooted in an intersection of geopolitics that was built under the agama administration the basically america could be broken down between white oppressors the white oppressive class that had built all the institutions of the country and the marginalized people would unite to overthrow that particular institution by peep electing people borokobama the democratic party has been enthrall to that dumb idea for quite a while not recognizing a campy replicated by anyone who is not name barokobama was it replicable by hillerclan really is not replicable by jobidon it is one of the reasons why cordon has a her riot problem going into went twenty four the comic coalition is

different rout then we did with india count a we gan a t ta gene a gas a well that that in fact is scathing kennel's strategy apparently starworts again one o the great pees in all of human history i mean it is a tremendous priest of ice it is we tens of billions a dollars worth of pee and they have now decided turn over the universe to personated charming obeyed she know who exathley is this person well she is mostly famous for having made a couple of non fiction documentaries that one scars about feminism and antifeminism in pakistan which that is fine but what is what is that aft to do with starworts what will makes you think you can transition from making a terrific documentary about a honor wellington pakistan too now you are in charge of the star wars universe an where is that how how does that happen well she then was a director one of thedirectors on miss marvel they twenty twenty two series from dis not plus that literally no one watched and that no one wanted to watch and the no one cared about because it look not good and they have decided to put her in charge of the next starboard's moving it'll focusing on ray you remember ray or maybe you do not she is the star of the last swords trilogy in which they killed off all the characters you love in favor of characters that no one gave any shoots about whatsoever no one has said the name to daemon in years cause no one cares no one cares about fin and barely any one cares about ray they got rid of all your old favorites and they killed off hon uselessly and stupidly and then they killed off like uselessly and stupidly and then they killed off lay up absolutely uselessly and stupidly and then they added beloved characters rose an awful character who annoyed everyone much that they literally wrote her out of the third moving the rise of jaywalker the failure of catling kennel's trilogy has been dramatic tat there is been a whole new revisionist history set up where last cedi is good moving whole everyone knows t lastjudiyes absolute trash from ye from ran johns everyone knows that just absolute scrap peep of garbage is the is the last trio gender catholic penny sh instead of shifting focus again wings tan the next move to day along they paloniactually likes the series they have valonia actually likes the character stay phaloniactually understands what he is doing in the starworts universe and wat the universes all about instead catholic kenned has hired this person who also happens to be not just a documentary filmmaker about about the oppression of women in pakistan also she was the first artist tho cot chair the world economic form in twenty seventeen well ism in those seem are qualifications for a piece of hi octane a venture fan to see sip entertainment well they asked her about the newmovy that starring ray apparently fifteen years after the end of rise of jaywalker and here's what she had to say the first woman and the first first of color just direct a star work fill inset to be release twenty twenty six you can say that the force is strong with this to here is t starmano bacon you do not i n very thrift about the project because i think on what we are about to create it is something very special and we are in twenty twenty four now and i think i it is about time that we had a woman i come forward i to shape the story in agonic see far far away ow you had a woman who shaped all the stories in the gal to far far away dream is catling penny an she socks she is awful she is greater job and in any fair universal would been fired but she is unlikable because she is woman also the minute some one talks about his stoic ice and the first thing they say is well we are in twenty twenty four now the next thing out of the mouth is going to be the stupidest crap you ever heard your entire life or whether it is rather sugar talk as it is twenty twenty four now we do not need a woman waiting o be save by a man it is a feminist die by the way daily war yes we here it anywhere we will take full credit for dinner having to completely shoot snow white because we point id out that not only the reaches egger saying thistle an then we actually committed to making a rival snow white film ' an attempt to head us off a tiny company b dis need likes dis not y had a shoot the entire film wellthere enough to reach it the entire star work universe probably because i get any blow i pee this be again equity is the only thing the matters equity equity equity we need a woman directing how bout you just make a good star worsted have not done it a damage the last sin star worse was rogue one when is what do you guises do for a living and the answer is they please themselves they please themselves on the stock holder dime that is what they do because they they they stakeholder capitalism the world economic form preaches it after all it is everyone the world can be changed by entertainment and this is why you hire directors weave no history of directing anything good in in the sphere and then decide the way that you are going to do this is by is by putting them in charge of the single most lucrative ice in probably all of human history slow cat for catholic kenned she is done at once again put a chicken in her maker that is the that is that is the way the all works and meanwhile an actually important world at news the conflict in the middle east continues the the israilies killed a commons deputy leader name that all a bury he was killed an alleged is rally strike in root anybody who thinksthat here is no to ordination be ween because bacon commons obviously you are wrong comose an yes blot wore cannon glove with one another if you look at a map of this region what you will see is a compasses located in the gossips trip which is the south western part of israelsing the south western corner and then isballat is located in israel north about two hundred thousand missiles pointed at israel bout fifty thousand them er smart weapons capable of actual targeting technology much more sophisticated much more dangers then a camps to israel kisballah has been basically rotting israel at the northern border that killed month people toe northern born many of the kisballat terra haven killed at the northern for israel has evacuated for literally months this point some thirty to forty thousand is on people a wave from that northern border in expectation of a possible isballa attack kisballah was apparently housing some of the commas leadership according the times v israel cases deputy leader abroad an sell allaruri wanted for yours by israel and seen the groups primary orchestrator of wetback terrorism was killed tuesday evening in israel strike in the bedroom suburb of aliya according to officials with commas and the ebony's terra group kisballa usually officials declined to comment unnamed tools officials told then your times in washington posted israel was responsible now's day targeted strike zero civilians were killed in this particular targeted strike basin lebanon are was one of the founders of commands military wing deputy had of the terror groups political bureau and con sided the the fact a leader of commands military wing in the west bank which by the way not only threatened israel but also threatens the vaunted and much lied about palmitin authority which is in fact also a terrors group just not quite as crazy terrors group as comas kisballah for impart is now vowing revenge for the cmmaschief being killed in marry which began is were commas is a different and distinct terra group from kisballana kisballa is remarking that once revenge on israel raving killed a commas terra the possibility of comas going hot with israel obviously dramatically higher then it was and meanwhile the west is saint israel do not you got o avoid escalation particularly in lebanon oke well here is a god way of doing that what if the extra said to the ebony's government which is in fact distinct from but heavily influenced by kisballa move cisballa off the border end of story move them off the board then then violation of you resolution by way for those re who pretend to care about the united nations there is a yuan resolution that prevent kisballah for militarizing the northern border of israel the militarize the border there in violation o international waw if that is a thing h you hereabout or pretend to carreabout and yet the international communist w israel really should use restraint with this terra group that is threatening to evisrake not only thousands recite tens of thousand of israelies an de on french president an manual my iron is called on israel to avoid escalation particularly in lebanon following that strike crone said fin you speaking by the way not to benjamin its now to the prime minister but to war cabinet member benny goes is for the primnistern waiting he said it is essential to avoid any escalator attitude particularly in lebanon oh an adulatory acted mad maybesome should say that to kisballa at some point that might be worth while meanwhile moans bornysanders continue to call for an end to eight packages to israel even as israel is engaged in existential fight against comas terra who murdered twelve hundred people into another two hundred and forty captive there is still dozens of hostages being hell in gaze commas to on this wore literally on moment's notice all they have to do is surrender and probably they be allowed o going t evil surrender going to exile and give up the hostages war's over literally morrow thy well do that instead their highjacking humanitarian eh soburneysanders supposed supposed pro israel friend on left who seriously is non is let me be clear no more you us funding for sitting yow whose illegal in moral brutal and grossly disproportion at war against the palistinian people again he is using the word to proportionate incorrectly here proportion has nothing to do with the number of people killed on your side torso the number people killed on the other side the proportion is weather your killing the minimal number of people necessary to achieve your military objective and the answer for israel is yes because commas has imbedded thirty to forty thousand terrorists in the middle of civilian populations continue fire rockets on israel even now months later also i love that he says that it is nittingyah who is war it is a unity government ware cabinet if nittinya were lasted tomorrow the war cabinet might be more wright wing nittingnow who is actually n incromentalist the big critique an israel wright now against nintinyahu is actually from the right people saying than sitting now who isn't doing e enough go on young loathe who the defencemenister in israel wanted nittingnw who to swirl up north and hicks blow first an sitting now who turned him down nittingnow who is actually the moderate force in the war cabinet by many of the reports buburney wants ut wants no aid to israel of course that that that that was perfectly predictable in the name of global equity naturally yo the usual from burneysanders and company meanwhile it is amazing how times change over an israel worth noting that the supreme court of israel which is in fact a tyrannical body they literally appoint the own successors the supreme court over in israel there are no limits as to what they declared the own discretion to be they struck down a law that was passed by the canoness at the israel parliament is passed by a fairly narrow margin in the last canna succession before the war and it basically sad that the supreme court of israel could not simply on quote qua reasonable this grounds strike down rulings from the executive or from legislative branch the could not simply just si we do not what you did were striking down the supreme court than overruled that waw on the grounds that it violated basic law stably lily there is no legal pressor in for anything what the supreme court is doing but it just goes to shade that seen aside shown israel no one cares to this point because as alwaysiness is something we should remember here in the united states as always the social cohesion of a of a nation it is significantly more important then the actual govern mental workings of the nation it is functional government but high levels of social cohesion a community that can continue to work at just functional government and at is functional community that is almost impossible to work and that is what the united states is facing increasingly right now which is at why it is important to mention hat the united states has just crossed thirty to brilliant dollars national debt which is i in insane amount of money that has now been spent according to fox business the national the it thirty four trillion of course ism foredeck ids go the national that washout nine hundreds haven billion we have blown out the spending that is all been a band at an attempt to manufacture social cohesion through the power government it hasten a failure on every score is not made america better off it is not increase social cohesion it is exasperated divisions rather than papering them over and by the way that does not include unfunded liabilities you include the unfunded liabilities of social social security medical medicate final the restore togueabout probably a hundred trillion dollars of national debt here in the united states all of which is a bill that will eventually come do already coming up we will get into more on the twenty twenty four election and

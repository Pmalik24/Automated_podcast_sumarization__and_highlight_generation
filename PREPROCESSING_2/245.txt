i case one o my coworkers avid cast about star to tell me about this thing and really i thought he was compel i just do s no way it could be true it just seem completely ridiculous and then i got to say the more he explain the more it slowly started to see like one maybe he is right portal fact to know that avid before we go any further heat's party an physics worked at firm lab on subatomic particles was on the team that discovered the top quark n and this whole thing up between him and me began when he told me to download an a on to my eye for it is called am universe splitter a case enough opened it up and there is a gray steel fake steel background and says in white type on top of it universe splitter quant om induced universe by function what do i do now it tell me something you or having trouble making up your mind about what to do you and i recording this on remember thirty first ye and have had a week off i grew a beard i notice om i do not try to decide if i should shave it off a and that is something ism trying to decide i have an opinion on that but what your pinion i shall think it looks pretty gittern now o gets what is this universe splitter do it lets you do both i get creates a duplicity of this universe that in one you get to grow the beard and in the other you shave it off wait that we going to do yet for pretender for real no nog for real may be this is a thing it is called the many world's interpretation of quanta mechanics that a lot of really smart physicists who think this is probably what is happening a case how does this work what do i do next it that two boxes there ye in one box it says in one universe i will now ski put a shave off beard to night u t off beard to night of and then the other boxes labeled in the other universe and the other one i will now put keep beard keep beard o i then what is below it and then begot there is a button with an madam drawn on it what i can madam you would draw it in a nineteen fifties cartoon yet that is the esthetic of thewhole thing it i got old piece of scientific equipment what does it do when you push the button if you push the button it sends a signal to a fancy piece of scientific equipment at the university of geneva switzerland the equipment these days can be tiny a little box you can hold in your hand and it does the follow it takes a single particle of light a photon it sends it at a kind of mirror the can make the soon either go left or right you can make fit that way a random it will go either left or right well according to the laws of quant mechanics which governor governed very small things ah it actually goes both it is not that we do not know it actually goes left and right at the same time oke that is superstar right butthat is actually true and demonstrated an we have known that since the twentieth oke then what happens in this device in geneva yes the device fires a photon which can go left o right and then the device looks to see well where did it go and we know the particles in both places right ut when he machine looks it only finds it in one place shows it went either left or right oh which does not make sense right cause we know from the math that the particle did go to both places why did we only see it in one o those places and what is the answer it one of the answers is that the photon is in both places left and right but just in different universes wait your saying that when you shoot the photon into the mirror it actually creates and entire duplicate of our universe and one of those universe is the fhotanis on the left and the other it is on the right yes it both went left and right those are just indifferent universes the math of it makes a lot of the math of it is very extreme line and simple i member the day i sought in glass now home my god maybe it is true yes these boxes you fill that on the a home the box wary i taped in a shave off yer to night and the box right typed in i keep beard right right little basically choose one of those boxes if the photon goes left and the other box if the photon goes right o oak got it you have to do what it says you may have to keep the beard or shave off the beard it tells me ye yes cause when you press that button you are going to get back one answer but this going to be a duplicate universe in which there is a duplicate yow sitting in a duplicate studio and duplicate me and you holding a duplicate phone in exactly the same way the only difference is that that phone comes back with the other answer and then that version of me we will do whatever it says in the phone we know that o the guy we trust him he is going to go do the other oke i think i understand all this what is glad dunipersipon o cushion i to feel heard about i feel heard i know it is crazy i feel heard you likely just put your finger right up to the button tan pulled away in fear i eras spy universe e cases has and put vomit into at contact an gang on fine to visceral an pro tiny man ontoagan your universe is just spit your in the universe in which he should keep beard and right now in the other universe the other years being told to shave off beard tonight after that i kept the her that night and french of new years parties asked me about it and if the universe did in fact split the other version of me and the other universe must have had different conversations may be for instance somebody gave him a great idea for a show to day that in that universe instead of earing this show in that universe you hearing a totally different theme indeed it just to be sure ism understand the your things is in a metaphor you saying there i scientist who really believe that a second universe gets created yet for sure i man i think it is not most physics and there are some who think it is ridiculous for sure but there are some who take it very seriously o a where is this alternate universe that were created yet i don't relieved know how to think about this but if this is true universe is duplicating itself all the time it is a fundamental thing about existence what a day in our programmed and universe that may be duplicating itself all the time ma people who become trance by the idea the parallel universe out there e things it different one of those stories things are better in the alternate old in one crucial way in another story two parallel worlds over lap in another only trust to visit check you try to go to the parallel universe on a beau be easy chico its the merit on li on our glass say with us anon names to my father sos he knowing with a fiction written that we have not a show some times tat car carpet about today's theme and he told me that his father used to spend a lot of time imagining worlds were talking about in to days program parallel world stars that are almost the same as our world but not quite an said his father did the staring during world for too hi father is fourteen waving in plan he is jewfish when the german abated and start sending news to the concentration camps during the day they second did for a humans percent ay t hitting it in a holding the grounds it e dug for six under and twenty days we had the he at of spar time and when he was very he would imagine old kinds of thing he would imagine wording which ay the not see did not exist or in which was not the new or in which people just in general did not to each other you known the this kind of thing was something that he located is being a child then he can of fa that it interested him as a child since ism i would probably it to a during the where his father could not weave that hall for o must two years o not the had quarters was right there near the hall on the same property a christian farmer and his ladies would bring them food and all out buckets of your an the couldn't even talk o out of the time ta care imagines was two years o meditation my father the ways hat he would to about his time in the hole he would says that e he would sleep in ten he would wake up in san e would us his father if the wore was over in his father would say know we would go in sleep some more that is the way he would tell it to me i think it is that kind of the sopor version i was like when you say a hole could they even stand up no the as he could not stand in it and is he couldn't even lie down in it they had to sit in it and when the fashion is liberated day the town and this he would brought out they had to be carried out because you knows your muscle were cramped zit ay is by the the time of the end of the words it could not moves them o my cot easily the in this hole under sitting sitting there yes and any knows it set it is very very cold in which way ay bent freezing and do not have food and and you hear voices in german and you knows that that you can easily be killed and you close your eyes and you think of another universe a cars er in lots of fiction the imagines panel worlds of various wins and when asked him if ye only to boson i for to day she he read the story a true story the star when he was a end when i was six years old my dead work ta the poos neck bar not far from one of the ladies beeches every day it five forty in the morning hit leave home for the pool swim to kilometers showering the locker room and get to work he would not get home ti nine at night fourteen hours a day seven days ta week unloading bookies of of drinks pressing totted sandwiches doing of and gleaming glasses at the pools neck am a li the beat yeas later that always said those wore the best days of his at fondly remembering how the sotyear blowing in from the a would mixing his lands in the smell of the copy an then ported cigarette he use to sell at the ban comfy cigarettes and the sea we are always my fathers free favor its things for me those days were not quite as happy when that came back from work i was already in bed and others than super days when it'd go off to visit i at the pools my on i never saw him ton no this i was better about this six yer old ye think centrally imagine a different word for themselves on n we the father had most time for them the except reality as it is and yet i missed him dearly seeing this my mother suggested that i go with him every morning to the pool have a swing together and take a cat to school from there i do not remember anything of those morning swings but the carries is dead a crisis clear it still dark as we siting our sever piso five or four the windows role down that smoking cant one hundred and describing parallel universes that exist at this very moment in other the mansions universes were everything is precisely identical to ours same road same traffic light same siguretting the corner of dead's mouse all except for one tiny difference and this different that would change every morning changing the one detail in the parallel universe the different from ours here we are in the parole universe waiting at the exact same the section for the light to change only in this universe instead of a river vision were writing a dragon and hes an other one were under my fated sweat pants id gill with allow me to breath the water a fish when i was now my father gat a until he no longer had to get up early in the morning and in the evenings with all have tiger together and watch the nightly years i was twenty too by the time i moved out of my parents house but i step mad true to visit them at least twice a week and on saturdays i sworn we dead at the pool where he once worked when i was forty free my father was signs to is cancer it was tone answer the result of fifty years of smoking by the time the doctors cot on it was at an advance stay and tho we never spoke o word about it was obvious to as lose that soon he was going to die on monkeys i taking in for his physical serape and es we set in the waiting room to see the fiscal therapies with the brutish accent my father sometimes to talked about parallel universes were everything was exactly the same as hours save for one difference say the dogs could speak was that people could read minds was that the sky was purple and when the mel quite clouds floated the prosit sad look tasty enough to at at the end of every session the fiscal craziest would show me how to old my father's arm when we woke together and what i should down case he lost his balas on our way home as we approached the corner of king solomon and altos of of that would always shut you smell that he would say and going to the new safer the corning just by the smell of it i can tell you that is the best coming town at the stage of his illness the tons cancer was advance my father could no longer eat word drink stay he got on his food and liquids four a clear classy t you strain to his tampon on one of the monkeys of the phish can serape where working by the corner safer and king solomon and also of my father instead of just posing to prize the places usual suggested we actually go in for a cap of both that i said after a moment's hesitation you cannot think anything the boomer is looking your a esophagus i know he said and dated me on the back but you can we set the corner table on the side i ordered the latter and a glass of water from pretty waitress and when she asked my father what he he asked for tables press i stirred eating confused and he smiled and shrugged the waitress noticed death guilty smile and gave me question in rook not knowing what to say i ordered an old me coke him until the comfy arrived we set in silence i wanted to ask my father why the ode the coffin to and if et had anything to do with the way to is being pretty but i said nothing dead poo the cigarette beg out of his shirt profit and the lighter he had stole in his gasses case and set them both down on the table we waited a few minutes later the wait his returned with our order she placed it on the table e late a glass of water and the coke in front of me and e bless pressor in front of dead romantic steam arose from my off i wanted to drink but doing that in deaths face seemed down far i just kept staring at it when out of the corner of my eye i saw my father quickly snatched the dales press of the table and game down in one see it was impossible i knew it was impossible after all i was tearing the room when the unclogs showed me in my mother the ex way with the twofer resting aba the blow the esophagus a scope of vanilla ice cream on a wattle cone my father she said then could never drink again and her we were setting together on a pleasant summer day at the hep her came mist staring at my steaming cap of coffee and him by my side smiling after killing off his tables press and for a moment there a foot maybe we were in a carer universe maybe he told me enough stories ever since i was little born to her open and holding the aching hart of our universe for which we were sickening to a parallel one i dentil to our owning every way save for one exception in the universe my dead could drink and eat as much as he and he was not about to dying just a few months the piping hot coffee slid down my father's wind pipe and into his lungs when it got there dead started to choke he stood up in grabbed his shot is to hangs the wet whizzing noises he made were riff the sound of a man whose lands a flooded do his hot coffee a be spectacle man from the table next to us leaped up and asked my father if he needed any help i just said there paralyzed the parole universe i charred with my father moments ago had vanished dropping me back into a far worse universe i you more seconds of gargling followed after which deadly in the over and cuffed up i decorating all the find me talking his please that it feed his lungs when he was done he set up in his chair as if nothing had happened inches away from the father of coffee and flam and lead himself a cigarette people the tabbies around us kept staring at him what did i tell you he smiled at me and head smoke from his nostrils the best coffin them i calcar hes author of many books ho had set his dad in the rest of his family and stories lot this one emotional fables that happened to be true and his boy the seven good years a i too sorry not sorry since contegrim to say this but the moonlight that story of america triumph it could have gone another way it some other story line from the multisense knew i strong and ball run they land on the moon they walk round it is great but then there is a problem and they cannot take off to come home that as thought this was the most dangerous moment the mission the most likely spot he could fail when president orchard lion's speechwriters willing sapphire after prepared a statement to be read in case that was the way the story went but the top of the page and all caps at read in the event of moon disaster for is line of the speech fate is ordained that the men who went to the moon to explore in peace is stay on the moon to rest in peace pretty good dicast about has his next story about another presidential speech never delivered that also feels it slipped into a world from a parallel universe you can find this speech framed hanging in the guest bathroom of home an californium here is avid the speech was to be read on the night of august seventeenth nineteen ninety eight it is in the house of bobshram because he wrote it serum was a long time democratic political strategist speech writer and get her outer of tight spots are you are you personally good at apologizing have had to apologize many times for many things sure what is the most recent thing you apologized for having a fight with my wife about what we were giving various people was christmusgifts this story is about an apology he wrote for a much bigger audience that august nineteen ninety eight sham was on vacation an thou staying with some friends and the phone rang why did not have self on and somehow or other o my office called me and sad mark was trying to reach me mark is mark pen bit the time was conducting poles and advising the president of the united states with the time was build canton wit the time was in a lot of hot water i parchment might very well be an boson wat tampering with what as as obstruction of justice a very very serious charges a moment when one political party said they were very valid high crimes and misdemeanors the other party said that is ridiculous political posturing anyway there had been stories in the press for months at this point that canton might have had an affair with an intern conical wins canton denied it though under oath in a civil case and famously on tell vision but i want a sit one thing to the america people i wants you to list wo sit issei i did not have restful o list for that on miss luinski but there was the dress with canton's deny on it and recorded from calls between sonic kolinsky and a coworker talking about the affair at the time bobshrum got the call president canton was finally gan half to testify before independent council keisters grantejury he would have to own up to the affair and then afterwards say something to the nation but what that was what the focal was about serum called mark pen back who asked if hoe would take a shot at writing a speech for the president to be delivered on to just after he gave his granary testimony it would be the president's chance to frame the whole thing maybe finally put it away and prevent the republicans from starting in preachment proceedings the country would be watching bobshrum saidocat the hung up the phone and told his wife in the couple they were staying with on vacation what the assignment was one of the people there said this better be good meaning you better do a good job yes e i sat at the dining room table o and i i wrote in long hand on a yellow pad which is how have always written my drafted it what he wrote was a straight up direct apology o do you have it there ready i it is on it is on well actually i can go get it you must hold on for second serum went to go get it from where it was hanging in what he calls the guest powder room and to be cleared there is other political memorabilia there it is the speeches proud of can you read the speech for me meet's not very long i well my fellow america no one who was not in my position can understand fully the remorse i feel to day since i was very long i have had a profound reverence for this office i hold have been honored that you the people have ben trusted it to me i am proud of what we have accomplished together but in this case i have full and short of what you should expect from a president i have failed my own religious faith and values i have let too many people down i take full responsibility for my actions for hurting my wife from daughter for hurting maniac resents onion her family for hurting friends and staff and for hurting the country i love none of this ever should have happen and he has client an apologizing from his leading people about the affair and this is how en finally i also one wo apologize to all of you my fellow citizens i hope that you can find in your heart to accept my apology i pledged to you that i will make every effort of mine and spirit to earn your confidence gown to be worthy of this office and to finish the work on which we had made such remarkable progress in the past scars god bless you and good night has that fill reading the i i i mean i remember writing it i thought it was the right thing for him to say and when i hear it now i still think it is the right thing for him to say it is notable that from had the president apologizing to maniac inti in our family at the time charges range of the democratic congressmen from new dark called her court and done tramp she as the subject of jokes on light night tell vision bill my said i think maniac luinski's the lonishan apologized to america no one seemed to be thinking about her as a person who life was now erect serum we well anise was a an in turn kid in the white house and i thought that that mad every bit of sense in the world serum sent the speech into the white house and then the day arrived canton gave his grander testimony which was not broadcast that evening the president went on t v to give his speech serum sat down with the rest of the country to watch it we are just sitting around in the living room watching it on tallish and at that point ay thinking maybe his gan to read my speech sure i thought he i thought he might very well bill canton who i worked with on state of the union messages never exactly reads what you send him i did not anticipate that it would be necessarily word for word what i had sent but i thought it might be pretty close to it ah it was almost i metrically the opposite good evening this afternoon in this root from this char i testified before the office of independent council in the grandeur i answer their questions truthfully including questions about my private life questions no america citizen would ever want to answer i not only remember hearing the first words but i remember the look on his face he was really really angry it is the private bill canton who could get angry and i have seen him angry but i do not think the country had seen him angry very often as it a deposition in canary i was ask questions about my relationship with medical owinskey while i answers were legally accurate i did not volunteer information indeed i did have a relationship with mister whiskey that was not appropriate in fact it was wrong it constituted a critical lapin judgment an a personal failure on my part for which i am solely and completely responsible there are moments of apology in there and would feel honest reflection when he straight up admits the reasons he had been evasive until then i can only tell you i was motivated by many factors first i desire to protect myself from the embarrassment of my own conduct but the over all message is not am sorry i screwed up he seems to be saying but the real problem is the fact that ism having to talk about this at all it is a private family matter it is nobody's business but ours even presidents have private lives he closes not by asking for forgiveness is from had advised but by asking people to stop calking and to night i asked you to turn away from the spectacle of the past seven months to repair the fabric of our national discourse and to return our attention to all the challenges and all the promise of the next am mericancenturye thank you for watch and could not what do you think would happened if he instead that night he would taken out your speech and readmit i think it would have lesson the chances that he would have been impeached really i do not know that it would have prevented the impeachment but i think it would have lessen the chances it is possible his speech gets you to the same ending just with a slightly different plot after all there is a lot of momentum in congress toward impeachment but it is nice to contemplate a world wet the leader of your country can stand up and acknowledge having made a mistake can acknowledge reality and apology really is about the truth laying it out we can all live in the same world together it is impossible to imagine that happening now canton seemed closer to it at that moment but he still could not do it i i wonder if all the possible universe is and how many of them does canton say i am sorry not ism sorry for what happened or i am sorry if people feel you know but but really ism sorry there may be a universe in which he did that have just not aware of it cause i do not live in it s that the one we live in you want to know what i think i think it is possible there is no universe in which president canton reads bobshrum speech listening to the speech canton did give i kin i think he gives it in every possible universe it was exactly how he felt and and the speech the you wrote will great was not at all how he was feel talent i i obviously the speech that i the that i drafted did not reflect how he felt coming out of the greantury in that sense can you felt him i i just say it you want to do what fits the moment and you want to be true to yourself the problem was that i think he was true to the angry guy who has just come out of the room he h was may be not true to the person he was the next day there are the yous in all the parallel world but si do you on thursday and the one on fridge want has had some time to think and some sleep and the same which for sure does our different people they testa born and some other universe he state if phasis is trial of his life in this one he is the executive editor of our program bell clean by the way way to wrote about this address to the nation that life in his biography et is not mention trumstrafter the speech but he of say that most of his advisers ad counts ant to simply admit that he had made an within state not to go out swinging he did anyone of course week's after that speech back tract in front of a smaller audience at par breakfast with religious letters he took a different tone there he said i agree with those who have said that in my first statement after i testified i was not contrite enough was much close with trumpery included an apology to my uncle wins and her family coming out worry that you living in a parallel universe were some very basic facts about your own life had been altered that is in a minute from chicagobubegradio when our programmed continues sis mar o li for my r glass to day's program gardens a branching paths stories of parallel worlds and people o get fixated on the way things could be in those other worlds in the first half a to day show we had people imagining other better worlds in this half we have people pondering the alternate worlds that are right here around us all the time in this world we have arrived at at three of our show at three scar crossed brothers everything about it being on identical twin is kind of a parallel world situation you ay have this other version of yourself stuck in the same world as you stuck the same house as you you she somebody us just you running around doing things that you might not do dinachovis as this next are about a mother her twins and a forty eight your old mystery an tatsclar had a lot going on in the winter of seventy two in canary she delivered twin boys mason first followed by randy five minutes later keying five pounds two ounces granddad to spend the first days of life and an incubator they lived in suburban saint louis and eats husband dank had a job an a paper company called mention envelope he worked long hours and travelled a lot and not was often at home alone caring for two infants feeding them changing divers and making sure she did not lose track of which one was win because they looked exactly alike were you always scared that you might mix them up from the day they were born was that of a real fear i tried to be really careful about knowing who either head what outfit they were on i knew always really careful about it usually we had to that we had you bats an different collars blue blue jay and red randy read and then i did not think about it to which ones i knew was that is a we did it that is a good system i may i think i did feed them twice and one count content feed the other was have t to you did that that one was eating there's crying won lie why e cries what we she even had a back up a creative redundancy she built into the safety plan for their identities and that was diner pins she is blue diner pins for mason and yellow ones for rand everything went smoothly for a while and then at six weeks they had their first checked and not dressed them in the same outed a fancy number their aunt low sangeliss had sent them but underneath the clothes the diner pin system was up and running at the doctor's office an nurse took the babies out of the room and not barely remember my made be she needed way them and a few minutes later the nurse came back in with the boys then she gas a way of such a great surprise for you now we have the campers wo were just using her the first time instead of using your divers reused your pampero and then they give me a little all for of their tins the nurse had changed the babies out of their c off divers and put them into disposable ones foiling the system entirely she handed a netted a little bag with a diner bens in it the boys were completely indistinguishable i was very have see they go all you are going to be fine you are fine of course they go your fine and we got in the cine i was sell upset all way me when she got home a not put the babies on the couch and stared at them at six weeks old they did not of distinct personalities yet they weighed the same amount they had the same ball heads north marks and ism not kitting you they looked exactly and i was thinking i was really tenable mother and an ow and i really look at this and not see my own children and not know which ones they are she to been a panic i om she to a i i i do not know what ism gan a o i do not know what ant wick i do not know what to do this is a nettle's best friend kinda palace aunt kinda as mason and randy know her she lived in the same subdivision did you go over there to try to help her yo i did not ye a i she could do apart ho up i be o do apart rights ma o i didn't i could not dm apart no the she had even yehwere you nervous to tell to tell dick re nervous to tell less you were yes was really nervous when he came home when he came home and he the saw them and they were in the crew and finally i had to tell my go have to tell you what happened and i told hem and he goes really goes o will figured out let us see and then we were both looking to the mi next teach other an their course they had the pampers one and nothing and he is going i do not know what you think it is i cool and net was faced with a decision she had to choose which baby was mason and which one was randy she had nothing to go on but a maternal feeling she chose dick agreed with her i really always felt i had the right person in my heart i just said it is that ism not in to think about it any more this is my life we know they are and that it is they are and were not on to talk about it any more aunt kinda not convinced do you think she got it right do you think i ha dot o you ma i don't the she no she a e git a i e o ma o no i e de we do de b do ma o i i do i no yo reason and randy or forty eight years old now their comedians they worked together they done cameras an different to he show derby enthusiasm and better cauls hall and they still looked exactly the same randy can you describe what mason looks very good looking am thing he is very somatic looking he is got glasses at he is about five foot e an a half it is cense somewhat athletic looking less fence they found out about their potentially swopped identities when they were about twelve years old by accident they we spending a summer weekend at the world famous leak of the oars an central misserri with their mam and aunt kinda and her two sons the boys were playing while ante nantlanto talked amongst themselves the story of the calamitous doctors as it came up and unannounced to them mason and randy were an year shot and they overheard the whole thing and we were just we hated the story this us mason the sounds re remarkably randy we we were livid that this could have happened an also that she was sharing it in sort of an off and the joking wake and linowallace who is a funny woman was making it funnier and they were laughing about are we were just very embarrassed by it and upset all my bodies is not i sang thing to hear cause we may not be who we are what pissed you off about it what was upsetting about it i think that it just was we were just sensitive i think to being confused and again it was this narrative that gonna went through our lives as we wanted to be individuals and we wanted to be seen as individuals and then hears this thing that happened were we could be easily confused for identical twins two people who were constantly being mistaken for one another we try really hard to make it clear that their unique individuals this was a big deal randy was the most upset e goes why cannot you go to the to the policemen i think grand really wanted me to go there you were talking all the way to the card not that an actual crime had been committed just a crime against their dignity that for some reason randy figured the police for the ones who could sorted out but a nut did not go to the police and the name confusion did not get sorted out it remained a mystery and mason and candles lives e couple in e wit to to to or year to by a to in about it a a got i lab i don in it a get how i had no idea was that that ism painful for them i ma a e i i jo be then a not i at i no cur wit ego between all about ice a we very a a about it just the simple fact of the matter that for countless times in our lives some one has said to me mason and ism room randy ray that that is happens many times in my life if that is not true there is only goo to every son in on a butter is there is a notion that you have been living a little bit of alike it is a tiny but it is not your lives not your line it is not your fault but still that is that is unsettling in a weird way to me that is just weird that for all this time i had at wrong if they were switch and they have to imagine something that foundational nobody ever thinks about it their birth who is older who is in the incubator ha grand says its weird does not really make a different but also somehow it does and not knowing what the truth is that is even more unnerving n it turns out there was one way to figure it out sometime round the age of forty randy cannot remember exactly when the topic of their potentially swapped identities came out and they were why then we figure the out yet they are grown out adults they should know who they actually were and also they were working as comedians at that point and they thought it might be good material which well see brandy thought may be the hospital where they were born would have a copy of their baby finger prints they count get those and compare them to their felt finger prints he was not wrong about the signs part of that that identical twins have nearly the same dean their finger print patterns a very similar closer than any one ease's was you probably know finger prints are made upon lines and some of those lines have tiny variations on them forks or leaps and those markings are different between identical twins for those of you still listening the reason for that is that the markings developed based on the conditions in the womb pressure which is different depending on where the baby is in the womb randy called the hospital where they were born to see if they still had a copy of their finger prints the hospital told them that they throw birth records out after thirty years they were old and out of l until i was back home last summer with my family this is randy and i was digging through just looking at stuff in saintly in saint louis hots back in our childhood home that we lived in since we are four years old and i found from the hospital our footprints i i refer ta they were in a book he shat id a the as your bags an my bed there was a nightstand thing that was a chest that you could open open it was just in the bottom of that i could not believe it and it'd never seen it there before and i thought o ka this is we could find out it became more real real in the liability was rekindled if they could find some one to compare their adult footprints to their

identification purposes there make be cause baby feed or freaking cued their momentous and they usually do not had much detail in tune mason sent hurt the footprints anyway just a check and when hurt saw them he confirmed that they were mostly just unusable s much as a bank but miraculously there was a half inch spot on the fall of the left mason foot that had nice clear lines he should not have any problem making the identification he just needed mason and handle's adult feet based with the imminent revelation of their true identities mason and randy were forced to think through what they would actually do if they would been switched as babies which less be honest is not along list of considerations d you think he'd swap names or would we legally change our names mi be you others and if you are if you are swap than your kind of lie committing fraud all the time rite now i gene emotionally on intentional far yet you are why i would be using his social security number a how is that

visit he parallel world when the chemist lived in herself daimyo explains the universe family ended up and was a postcard for old till an america ten acres in sermon with five big brothers and sisters eating candy out of glass cars at the family generals store the ow we just lived in this big house in my parents rely strict u my was ears outer a train it they always reminded me of the entrap family even though that is really extra i onoaat a real i was i i was lot rose as very much do as i say she almost lived a totally different life family was adopted from sat cry when she was a baby she is forty now and as a kid she rarely thought about the world she came from what her life would have been there it was the aides that kind o thing was in a specially in carriage her family raised her not to ask many questions about her past but there was one thing she really wanted to know about it i ma mostly growing up i just really wondered what my birth mother looked on that was usually the question that always came to my mine her adopted parents did not look her they were white as was most everybody else in town was hard for her to picture her birth mother's face but there was no one to ask the couple decades later family became a mother herself and suddenly felt connected to and curious about her birth mother again she started researching how to contact her and two long airs later finally got in touch then she decided to go on a trip to sat curious to meet her birth mother a trips that would allow her to tunnel between the universe that was and to the universe that might have teen she recorded parts of it for a podcast called mother had sessions all of miles emotions about the trip hid her on the way to the air port in new york when suddenly she found herself sobbing while talking to the cabdriver i anyfandy for you i meaning i meaning my birth father for the first time that is expected for you a go about you not a not order i searched for her i the adoptinatinsy it hefty years ten years serai a a i pul on o a i o o o e won we to e i i yo we a y i i a a i for you yo yo you w o ma your mother i know i now you freely because you and you o lo o o l i know yo on yo o o yo o e o o mi you o o in yo o i tho e li you yo i i um going on the plain to for me it was kind of thinking about the last time i took that flight was one i is a baby and touching down it you remember thinking that the last time i was here was one nigh was five months old she had a day to settle in before she met her birthmother it was the first time she would ever been to aria and wandering around soul it was easy to imagine the other versions of her life all around her i go in stores or and restaurant's an i think oh could i be that woman behind the counter working there when it'd see a mam with her little girl i feel oh well is that what it wouldhav been lake to walk don the street the holding may my months hand on her second day in care family carefully did her hair an make up and handed to the adoption agency to meet her birthmother there reunion happened in a worn down meeting room in front of a bulletin ford pinned with christian gars i see this short clean woman walk in the door and ow we hug and and i cry li and she says me on had which means ism sorry it is the very first thing her birth mother says to her and i say canton i know which means it is oke e in er o o e that is ta social worker in the room translating for them em his first mother told her her story she got in pregnant as a tea major which was completely shined there was no place in society for tea name single mothers a few days after family was born a relative came by with the police officer in social worker and they took family away a week later melts birth mother went to the police station desperate to get her baby back they told her it was too late she called the adoption agency several times over the years to check in on her daughter learned she would been adopted by an america family i talked with her on the phone and when i asked her if she would ever imagine the world where she did manages to get family back she told me i have not really had those thoughts but i always dumped about her seeing her birth mother's face meeting her whole extended family later on that trip i had a profound impact on family i heard her talk about it on that podcast mother hood sessions and i was surprised and moved to hear her say that being in the same room with her birth family for the first time i felt pretty you not si growing up you your parents always tell you that you are pretty hear whatever u i never really believed it but being around us family an we all look alike i fell i fell i was beautiful and i had never frown it that deeply before when do you think is behind that feeling because after growing up living a lifetime of feeling don't fit in and e know wondering why it may be certain lies do not you or why may we are not the most popular person an school for the first time my life i felt i made sense i felt my being mad sense i feel my face made sense family stayed with her birth family for three days in a town called wonder john in a little house by the railroad tracks there is dynamic pots of kick in the yard a flat screen teary in the living room that was always playing free and variety shows and operas lots of visitors came by to welcome family i felt warm familiar on the first night family was getting ready for bed and her birth mother came in and presented her with four boxes containing gold jewelry for family her kids and her husband family excepted them hesitantly then using a translation a her birth mother told her she said clean mother sleep with her children not goat you we doubt family had heard about this that it is not unusual for free and parents to sleep in the same room as their kids even when their adults in this room there was only one bed she tried to explained to her birth mother sorry but i preferred to sleep alone it was not clicking family ended up calling an interpreter she tired who had already gone home for the day and i called and asked her to explain that i i could not do it mum and and she she did but you could see that my birth mother was past and not really happy about it she had missed years and years of of my life i you can understand why she want it sleep in the same room with me but i just could not do it a lot of the time with her birthmother was this as a visitor it was impossible to fit in completely she was a stranger and family all at the same time dropping into a place

well yesterday the supreme court disappointed every one on the far left by ruling in nothing that actually states cant just random we take presidential candidates off the ballet and they did for a couple reasons as we discuss yesterday this they said that first of all states do not have the ability to remove a federal candidates because federal candidates our candidates for federal office and second they said that if you are going to defend insurrection under the fourteenth amendment that have to be done by congress not by some mikado at the state level regardless of the ration ow the nine o decision has made people very very very angry on the left they believe that they understood the law and by understood the waw they mean that they thought that they finally had trump every time they think they have trump is the ending of a school do carton we unmasked him oh no we would gotten away with it but one for those darn kids and then sgerurder that that that t legitimately every time they tried to get trump they and up being unmasked as fools and this means that they then have to expose what their actual agent was in the first place which was of course not to bar in insurrectionist from higher office the purpose was to get rid of the republican likely hominy forguanominy that the person was currently leading hoiden bi in outside the range of mirror amount in all the national poling yesterday the tolerate of secretary of state the person who initiated this entire stupid process in the state of colorado press named gonna gromwell she said that well now that the supreme court has said tat we can'chd removed don a trump from the ballet democracy is at at threat mean democracy may in fact collapsed because people might vote now know you are thinking yourself which is hold up people might votes o democracy is it risk that is legitimately what people on the left thank about dona trump done true might win therefore democracy is at risk we have to stop you from voting because have to save democracy here is the tolerate of secretary stay yesterday crista torment i i would a its good back e court issue i decision america have been voting all across the nation and early voting or condos superfine state states including here in colorado and coloradans and america diner to know the their trunk as a qualified canidateunmy larger reaction ins disapquitment i do believe that states should be able under our constitution to bar earth breaking insurrectionists and alternateletistisition be t open our leave open a door for congress tact to pass authorizing legislation but we know that congress is at nearly nonfunctioning body alternately it will be outta the america notes to save our democracy and o danger oh no the america voters might have to save our democracy you mean by voting wow i know what a concept now that the reality of the situations as a stupid legal fury in the first place who put out there by some anti trump people on the right in a bunch man had true people on the left as the waster journal points out that is qualification push against trumpets embraced by an adult calms of legal scholars and tromp opponents therelight on section three of the fourteen the amendment which was ratified after the civil war and that it several of the unions objections to the constitution among them it was bring disloyal office hurts from returning to power but the entire purpose there was the federal government was going to stop the states from actually blowing on the ballad people who were insurrectionist were part of the confederacy main had tried to jump on the color an a bandwagon illinoi had tried to jump on the colorant bandwagon and said the supreme court will nine nothing that this was a bunch of nonsense now when the supremecourt rules in nothing on an issue there is a very very high chance that this is just legal theory if this been a five for decision in a six three decision you could see people on the left sanguell it is a conservative supreme sort majority the problem for the left of course is that this was nine nothing yet people are tangy brown jacks boding the same way as clarence homes on this particular case and this is people my old friend avid french to write a piece in the e york times lamenting the death of the constitution i mean when avid is far to the left of carangid brown jacks on this issue that people's brains have been boiled by the trump of all of this as an entire piece in the you times settled the supreme court just trace part of the constitution know they absolutely did not it just requires in enabling act of congress in order to define insurrection but again the brain boiling was a cross the board here are just some of the members of the media who were a wash inters yesterday we have learned that it was at naan to nosing decision truly a a troop candy out about the colorado at other states a not confident that that will produce a result that is good for america democracy this this actually what i had been concerned about i had been concerned that it should a go to the supreme court they would roll this way i la if it we a o my next cat was do trumpet still an both frisking an suspect that stave confidence in the supreme court dazing this courts parts the the court itself they have overstep the fourteen waurthan it needed to go our colligwalis flora has called this supreme court the follow court the criticism of the court is that their play nan a fairies nonsense flush for we seta court its had this linin occratinities to interfere in the election the other than stepping back ai that this is another example along any chatter play out right out the supreme court playing a huge roll in a america elections you've just watched those clips you would assume this as a five four decision in favor of president trump it was nine nothing that is how far outside the legal mans stream these theories were and that is how far outside the norm the media are our legacy media for his part here here is donate from thanking the supreme court for the decision i one start by thanking the supreme core or unanimous decision today was terra word decision were very well rented and i think it we go long way board ringing our country together with your country d and the were long we work and and pantry they were very quickly on something the will he spoken about a hundred years from now n to hundred years from the extremely important i given to can a normal statement from president true now as i say it was not is the legs he mediate going nuts members of left one totally in sand in i mean truly crazy yesterday he always have to count on the genius cyst over it the view to put in their two sense of stupidity it hers will be golberig yesterday very irritate about the surimcort of the united states because as graduate of hazard lowscuol as a long standing constitutional jurispredentialist pul be golberic has thought the thing that bothers me about this and i know it is probably the right driven but i do not light that we have normalized this man it is really iris hated the pom at o me that we have normalized him and his bad behavior i can't thin the law sens listen it would be really rough in his shun be the congress that makes thisdecitiens and yet that is not how we have been attic we quick we keep sang stats laws we see i people e right the make this can us an then they make a change on this that we we do not want this that we as all now what is we send this yoga a no one knows what she is talking about everyone just has terrible images now in their mind because of will be gulberic an she was not the only one to have bathroom thought about this particular decision he is alderman i know he is been out in the wilderness for while but it is worth while remembering the teeth alderman was once a respective voice on mason b c he had a very highly rated show on mason b c actually if he go back about fifteen years and again it just demonstrates the revolving door between the asylum and mason b c for jail and masanbsy or should be jail and mason b a me ow sharpen has a show on amass mes an animate hes alderman who is just out of his mind at this point he treated out the supreme court has betrayed democracy it is members d jupon pigeon and to ma got have prove themselves in ut at reading comprehension and collectively the court as shown itself to be corrupt and illegitimate it must be sold have been working on that alderman impression for years that is he used to be funny when he was on yes ban and don it is a he says that the court has to be dissolved because of course they are not in a the reading comprehension but he given his three from the cornel school of the agriculture ism not getting and hat his legal knowledge gain from years of shouting and fungo on sportsenter he has thoughts about the constitution its a somebody treated back in him crime i nothing and then he treated back something critic and odd quit the sort tears fastest they are burin ism sure you enjoy being the in it ts what is what is you been going for there ain't even know y ism confused the guy said to him cry moans then is he ping on his own face said those are not tears fascist their burin in his own eyes it is unbelievable we are now just doing scenes from happy galore remember in shuderma pavan says to happy gizmo id pieces of leap you for breakfast an then happy glamor says you pieces of leap for breakfast this that this is where we are now said stuff there from kith old men he is being in his own eyes to fight trumpets a strategy it is a strategy meanwhile the house democrats are threatening that they are now going to tried d passable that would notified trumps behavior is insurrection under the constitution good luck with that represent him jimmy rascal set on tuesday on seamen at the supreme court unanimously overturning that color a supreme corrupting means that the congress has to take it up rascal said that he is going to actually now push with a number of my colleagues including derby waterman chiton epic swallwell that he is one who's stopping a chines spy revive legislation that we had set up a process by which we could determine that some one who committed insurrection is disqualified by section three of the fourteenth amendment the question is whether at my johns would allow us to bring this to the floor of the house mean the answers no is not going to happen but all of this demonstrates there is a wide gap that has now emerged in life between the radical left and reality and when even the moderate left or people who have a job likes the radicals on he sprimcort of the left who saw of a job which is to read take like son sotomir who is a far left person or cotinga brown carton a very far left person or lanicagan who sort of on the moderate left those three people voted in favor of the nine nothing decision here and there is complete distconnectiten those people and the radical was and as we b been discussing because it is the single most important factor in the upcoming twenty twenty four election jobidon has found himself in thrall to the radicals at the expense of the moderates and that is why he is losing he is bleeding support from the middle he is moving support among the base but the truth is that that support that he is losing among young people for example that is a marginal loss of support considering that a low propensity voting group in the first place the people who are very high propensity are independent college educated people who swing vote and and those people are not looking at jobidon and seeing somebody who is on the same page the they are and the forgo bison is in thrall to his radical left and the further left that radical left moves the worse it is for jobidon and the democratic party how far left has the radical left move they moved far left then now even alexandera o cozy mortal is not far left enough for them in what had to be the most amusing piece of video of the year oleander cost cortex went to see dune too yesterday with her partner and hat shows then chased down the street by fellow left going radicals who demanded that she say the word j nice with regard to israel behavior in the gosistrepwhich obviously is not a genocide and she got very mad she got very very angry did oleander o casino quartz because the revolution always eats its owns she a tear for the poor working class revolutionary who is now being beheaded by her own movement here as a lexandro cosecquort has being con fronted by people making good trouble against alexandero cozy cortex a inn e t those dancing she is n walking down the ascolater and she being followed by activists she stopedto an f the as you are not en the thinking other of she starting loosertumber there still following a found the very whet then her husband turns round and the stop to ta well to a con i already at a an yogin have been a proton tat wether order an you are not you are notion are not in you are not helping she is mad o man maybe shell break into a dance number now oleander cost sort you are genius leading light of the revolution inside t congress the way we should recall there was to c who back in twenty twenty wet the following quote the whole point of protesting is to make people in comfortable active is take that discomfort with the states quote an advocate for conure policy changes popular support often start small and grow to folks to complain protest demand make others uncomfortable that is the point woo woo she was such a spicy revolutionary until the point when she was confronted with her own revolutionary useful idiot cadre gan that gap between norms and the far left is growing when to s is now part of the intellectual dark web or something to c has now been left being she is in the moderate middle by the far left in yo bids still chasing those actives down the sidewalk trying to manner them while they are busy missing the prostates of the members of compass o good luck to all of you good luck to your you are ones who jumped in bed withe revolutionaries and now you've genome to deal at that i again it is amazing how the democratic party has moved far the left michael more who used to be seen for what he is s a crazy left winger michael more your recalling two thousand for hims a big controversy if you remember this far back i do because i covered politics then in two thousand for there is a huge controversy at the democratic national convention because michael more who was a propaganda documentarian was seated in a presidential box at the gaze with jimmy carter and how's controversial because mice mom's a nutcase now michaelmore has become one of the voices of the democratic parties that is how far left the democratic party has moved over ton again you want to know why people jo organ and you on boskage now talking about voting republican it is because the democratic party is now enthrall to people michael more michael more again jury was yesterday talking about israel and gaze and suggesting the jobidon has to abandon israel in order to win over his left flank again what is the real about this the broad spectrum of america are much more support of israel tan the archines but the democratic party is kind o split on the issue which is wild since comosusa genocidal terror group that murders gay people seeks to kill every inside hates women and all the rest here is michael more suggesting falsely that jobidon is en thrall to the authoritarian baby which again that is hilarious because baby is an elected official in a coalition government with his political opposition who visited washington to see bengonsted literally yesterday but here is michael more dust mouthing got all iron a is the threat that he is and jo bison is gambling a by sliding himself closely with that ana who at the risk of america democrats absolutely and and and gambling by alining himself within authoritarian can tell me somebody who is facing a number of colonies charges who spot to stand trial this pass fall and that all got so this side a is now this of war and we came put our priminister and trial the open jo bin an agist i o i plead with him to a plan from that in the wit house you want you and in not into be an the a gang now shows on they between on election to convince literally millions of young people they got of all beaus tons carom of bag michael more by the way is such an idiot that he literally says in the same interview that israel should focus its ire not on radical museums who murder twelve under of citizens instead they should focus on the evils of christian that is how to touch these morons are point the by nologof history on on the enemies of his travel wen in persecution the rallies the the jewfish people of this world of persecuted for five thousand years o for the last two thousand years no o the persecution has come from a european centric christian that is ben your enemy no celistinian help to gildashwets no palistinian good on the do o we up city wit body wish rockery refugees trying to escaped allacoss can here to be protected by this country and were turned away the down or then send ended germany to do no pelistinian did that no pelistony rain the punish inquisition your enemy your enemy is not the palistinin people ideas why christian european ah people we been slaughtering news for the last two thousand years it'll lame i let me take that just one moment there i have tor recover ism no say this i in very considered fashion that is the stupidest long thing have ever heard in my entire life that is legitimately the stupidest thing have ever ear in my entire life yes it turns out there is a lot of christian antisemitism over the course of last couple thousand years that is dos not forestall the fact that palistinians crossed a border a couple of months ago and murdered twelve hundred news and still are holding a hundred and thirty four hostages including six america that palestinians in westbanking gosestrip overwhelmingly support comose that the greatest threat to news on planed earth right now is palestinians and their supporters that is just a fact there is no other that is simply true it does not mean every single palestinian is a terrorist it doesn't mean that every single palesonian once to kill news it does mean that a huge number of palistinians do want tho kill news and a huge number of palestinians support terrorism that does not mean that civilians should not be treated as civilians but that it happens to be a reality by the way his history is just false also he is an idiot when he says hell you knows during ye i did not see any palistinians blocking immigration in new york know who was palisonians blocking immigration an bitch panda palestine you of whose palistinian grabs we are rioting against brutish rule in nineteen thirty seven after the peal commission recommended a partition plan that the grabs rejected and the news accepted and then the grabs rioted much that the brutish manta barred all emigration into brutish panda palestine by news leaving millions of news stuck in rope that these peoples do not know any history but again it is these radical more on torn charge of the democratic party it made that which hid also point out that is not just that radical idiots have taken control of one o the major parties in the united states were increasingly taken control of that party it is also that who knows that these radical idiots are in control and is using these radical idiots the is limits comes best friends our people man ma sedan on pemican b c or made mason or michael more or lose people who do the propaganda of work for them these are their favorites how do we know an here is an example yesterday the toothy rebels and again the toothy slogan just to remind everybody the hotly slogan is quote allay is the greatest death to america death to israel a curse upon the news victory to is l us o they are bunchonise people is a not probably just there too looking for decolonization trophies and on back tea group well a senior toothy leader according to politico has now pitch that button's newest member of parliament gorge halfway be an unlikely mediator in the current mat least conflict why should the new propalistonian and pee for rockdebia potential player in easing mention because he is a he is a in a sex useful idiot it is gorge halfway who once suggested that the state of israel be completely dismantled he was actually kicked out of later in two thousand three and he's kicked out of labor because he has called for the dismancelling what he called the pianist state he walked out of a debate in two thousand thirteen after discovering that his opponent was in his daily citizen es ta gut don't debate with his relies the also out with said ism who san he also suggested twenty twelve by the way that having sect of an unconscious woman quote would be bad sexual etiquette by not rape say solid gay and that is exactly the other want the also have their helpers do the radical is lamps in the media according to g b news the b b c has now been criticized after it failed in the most basic of journalistic practices because he used in car g c reporter as an eye witness source in reporting on gosh and again much of the reporting in the gozastrip is eye witness sources who work with or for camps is just a fact if you can't et just for the moment imagine that you had an area that is take over by terrorism the you literally cannot ship in food at and get it to civilians because terrace a high jacking the food are now imagine they are getting information out from that maria would you imagine tat information is going to be freely traffic or gushing the terms are going to be controlling the flooding formation the answer is pretty obvious derris ham being controlling the floor information in the gozastrip for legitimately decades at this point and the entire legal media just imbibes from that well the b b c much that the corporation used video and eye witness accounts of a crowd rush incident in an convoy in gaze and the segment included o report from one manhood awadaya describe is a journalist at the scene whole an said that his daily troops deliberately shot people attempting to approach trucks of flour in the convoy he said that is rallies purposefully fired the men they are trying to get nearer the trucks that had the flower they are fired at directly in preventing people to come near those killed there is only one problem which is that do iwadaya praised a terrorist attack in two thousand twenty three which killed seven is rallies and also happens to have a slew of proterris messaging an associations with figures call albata a senior member of the paramilitary group palistonan illogic jehad the same legacymedia that will still print reports doubting whether there was mass rape at the noble music festival on october seventh the those a media are the useful idiots of the radical islands and they also happen t be the people who jobidon believes he is answerable to and that is which bison is he is far off the track of what the america people want from him he is far off the track of what the america people want for hm n they want a moderation and decency and instead they got this radical garbage with a bumbling old fool at the top of the pile that what they got speaking of which being of radical garbage it a bumbling old fool at the top according to the daily wire the misadministration has now empowered a professional activist to travel the globe on the tamper time to push trains genders in generidiology from australia to crazy south africa to sweden justice stern travels a cross the world attending called pride events as the state department special convoy to advance the human rights of lesbian gave by sexual transgender queer and intersex persons stern who as bostishees the highest ranking lesbian woman in the abide administration is paid an annual salary over one hundred eighty thousand dollars and task with promoting a far left vie on sex engender lobbying for governments and assisting activist organizations she was a point that libido in september twenty twenty one her work as gone largely in notice by the media she bolsters the president's broader efforts to leverage the might of the federal agencies and their bureaucracies and service of a far left to agenda she travels a special envoy another have taken her to at least twenty two countries including argentine ousting a brazil not sauna candida germany green india lithuania malaria malicious mexico nepal the netherlands panama peruse the philipiane south africa sweden switzerland land and piano by the way ism just going to point out here how many of those country are of the countries that i just mentioned how many of them are radical muscle ruled i notice the we zero in the middle east i notice that she she is happy to preach el g b t politics pretty much everywhere except for where the muscles are malaria's the only country in this lest i believe this muscle she said good for policy is inclusive for policy that means having senior experts on el g b t cut i rights wise the misadministration trotting around at tax pay expense this lady to various a pride parades around the globe because the state departments was quoted is committed to promoting an protecting the freedom dignity and a quality of all persons including transgender non binary an gender non conforming persons around the world this is what america exceptionalism has come to me america exceptionalism is not things private property ownership it is not anything are speech it is not limited government america exceptionalism apparently is el g b t u i mine is divided by sign politics that is the most important thing that the bide administration can be pushing at this point and again this does to one of these central problems between left and wrist to day i think that it is fair to state that if you go back to say even the nineteen nineties there is large cross over between what the left in this country wanted in what the right in this country wanted during the canton era that is why hoe could get things done sometimes because what people wanted generally speaking was a government that was limited in its intervention in jail y life people still wanted solid families there is some arguing around the edges with regard to say things benefits for same sex couples but there is no talk in the mid nineteen nineties in fact everybody was talking the opposite about gay marriage the idea was maybe civil unions and civil unions were religious about granting legal rights hospital visitation or rights in wills to gay couples but there is no idea of message as a substitution for gay couples for traditional marriage that was those off the table in the nineties even the left at that point with rear abortion for example the quintan line is safe legal and rare there is still cross over in which people recognized that abortion was a great evil and now thinks of completely broken apart they completely broken apart and because there is no common vision in the united states any more of what even constitutes a good that means that you will have administrations promoting around the globe things that are not agreed to by the vast majority america most america are not interested in paying envoys to go promote trains genders in malaria this is not something we think of is a quarts america value nor should we think of that as a harps america value that is ow what except america exceptionalism is but for the left it is as they have see to fined what it is to be a good america this is why you have seen much ire in the united states again we you have a set of common values unit they are broadly broadly it even if there is a lot of plate in the joins be still have those common values he an have a country but when those follow way then what exactly do you have left the answer is not much mean that the again the fact is that this administration has decided that it is going to promote what it calls democracy but not really because the sort of depends on where you are in the world where they support thedemocracy or not right now the on administration is promoting a tyrannical is lawman government the palstonian authority in its aspirations above the interests of an ally of the united states that happens to be democratic israel when they talk about democracy it everyone knows they do not really mean it what exactly is the by administration pushing around not pushing property ownership navy pushing free markets join is looking for global base line taxes of fifteen per cent what exactly are those america exceptional values that robin is pushing he cannot find them he is let the left to find them for him a america do not that leftist definition and just one second when it the most shocking story of the day this with regard to do path the will be pass the t e world professional association for trains gender health that organization has been used as the basis for pretty much all transpropaganda in the united states for the last ten fifteen years when we get to the corruption of that organization in just one moment first thursday night going the daily fireback stage welsh mchimell's andrewclave an germy boring and i we all watch and react to the twenty twenty four state of the union live on daily wire plus we will break down the state of t union as it happens on of corse will anterior questions it is an experience you will not find anywhere else you can watch it all live thirst unit eight thirty am eastern on the a wire a and day wire dot commit should be exciting because we are all waiting to see if jovial survives the evening chuck us out at day wire atom ore on the ay wire a thursday night eight thirty p m eastern meanwhile the biggest breaking news of the day is a piece from behold poster in the ceric post newly leaked files from the world's leading transgender health cure organization reveal it is pushing hormonal and surgical transitions for miners including stomach renting experimental procedures designed to create sexless bodies that resemble department stormanicans the world professional association for transgender held documents demonstrate its control by gene ideologue who push aside concerns about weather children and adolescents ten

president of w path is jazgenings w path unfortunately has become the central organization in pushing quit quote trains gender standards of carriage use by the federal government and they are totally full of crap if this unfortsional is the reality of our medical establishment it is been amazing to s how every institution has discredited itself in this country over the course of the last fifteen to twenty years it is totally insane the one institution you thought would not discredit itself it science because after all science is held to the scientific method you a hypothesis you test it if the test does not work then you go back to the drawing court but science has become in arbitrary tool of political professionals that is particularly true er the science is unclear it used to be that the first rule was doe no harm now the first rule is do as much harm as possible long as you can obfuscate the results for long enough that is what w path promotes the litany of transition surgery side effects did not stop tow path according to the naeripost from endorsing far more radical know indication surgeries for nations who do not feel either male or female and identify only as non binary several does in called d rendering surgeries are designed to greet a sexless smooth cosmetic appearance that is unknown in nature there is even an experimental by genital surgery that attempts to construct a second set of genitals w path has enshrined this concept into its standard of care in other words they want you t look a enroll or a baby all now and this is supposed to be standard of care totally insane crap but again being pushed by the federal government each levin the assistant secretary of health who is of course a biological man is a path member and has lavish praise on the organization and duo it assesses the full scale of the science and provides at substance of rigorously analyses purify recommendations to the medical community on how best to care formations o are transgender or gender non binary it is free of any agenda other than to insure that medical decisions are informed by science that is a lie that is a lie but much of what we are seeing promoted by the federal government these days is just lies design to promote i radical and insane a agenda and meanwhile s being of a radical and insane a agenda a federal appeals court has now correctly a lowed texts to put forward its own emigration loss is the federal government will do it according signed a federals appeal a federal peals sort granted a temporary stay of a lower courts decision to block the enforcement of a controversial texts immigration law the state government was going to implement senate bill for which wouldallow state law in foremen authorities to arrest detain people they suspect of entering the country illegally s very much in arizona senatebill ten seventy back deck to go en brakobomo is president which allowed arizona to arrest people for illegal immigration and it was invalidate by the supreme court he phthisis going up to the supreme court the supreme court has put it on hold at the moment we will see how that is dedicated the unit is the bi administration by the we that saying that texts should not be allowed to arrest people for illegal immigration between their actively intervening to even stop other authorities from fighting the problem of illegal immigration meanwhile the bine imitation continues to fib about all this john curly who the national security spoke person and really that a fact o competent press secretary for the white houseline careen on periterberallator job he was on fox news yesterday suggesting that bison has not disengage from the board patrol despite the fact that the prior head of the word patralcity literally never had conversation with either bison or command harriers john curly has he never protein to and and what we did from reporting on the thicker today not only raw or this the former chief of the port patrol but the current chief of the port patrol chief plans who you pointed out he did meet with in om an a browns fell but from what we can find out they had never spoken before that how is that possible well the president her engaged with there ajesse's engaged leadership there win o a rater patrols engaged with the border patrol maltha he was just down there brownsville meeting and talking those folks directly in hearing from e never marabou the teeter we or current chief the currencies he just mat has been present for three years just met in the other day he he gain is engaged with everybody aga yes including the border patrol tan down there brownsville talking to him on the ground hearing for them directly about what their concerns are get well ism the propman nobody believes that nobody believes that you know what democrat tribe doing they should now be imitating the example of john fetderman in pennsylvania he was elected helmiston a reverse bison bison was elected as moderate and his governing is radical john feddrman was elected as heretical and his governing is moderate john fedderman comes into office and he immediately start's pushing for example things border control he start suggesting that he is on israel side in its war against a enicitleterras cup commons and guys what he is approvalrating with democrats in pennsylvania is seventy six to seven in the latest quinnipeacpol he is not afraid of his own was and that means that he is winning was guys what jobidon does not need college students in michigan to vote for him he needs moderates in michigan to vote for him he is not doingiit here is john fetderman going off on the border idly ti is the desire you know an an willing and eager to go stronger than the the border de a that that was here they might be try appropriate given the the circumstansere a at the border john federal making the smart play moving toward the center what left is trying to proclaim that he is wildly in popular that is simply not true it is not true john fedderman is one of the more popular figures in pennsylvania politics at this point because he did not do the due thing jobidon did the due thing he decided to steer way out to his left he disjoin to pay the price for that electorally there is a reason he is trailing in all the swing states there reason independents are turning toward only trump john trump has locked up ninety seven per cent of the people who voted for him in twenty twenty four jobidon has locked up eighty three per cents of the people who voted for him in twenty twenty those numbers not good enough for jobidon meanwhile speaking of radicals who cannot get their own city's under control new york has had increased crime why because they decided to release people without bale because that is the stupidest thing h you could possibly do with criminals it turns out fighting crimes actually super easy you take criminals and you put them in a place where the can harmony well call it prison for example and then you just put them there and live them there that is what you do criminals and then they are not in public harming other people i know these it these lake incredibly difficult stuff that no one can figure accept for every civilization in the history of humanity but we cannot figured out it is a mystery rape in enigma how do you solve crime probably should just take the criminals you's probably an tic a trip quick trip down to the jail aflecada probably release them back and probably they have learned a lesson and at all be grate according to the nerd post remember what politicians were tasting the success of bale reform remember the meaningless and deceptive numbers they threw out your city compatriot of badland or claims in report only one per cent to people released on bale under bale reform are rearrested for violent felon while their cases pending and then state sextet majority leader anorak start convince said the number was two per cent well a new study of bale reform outside in you city in the suburbs an up state prepared by john ja college of criminal just data collaborative for justice shows sixty six per cent of people released under bale reform we had a recent prioress we are rearrested within two years of their release sixty seven per cent of defenders wo had a resent prior felony arrest in the pastier we are released we are also rearrested within two years of their alignment almost half of those where rearrested for felony wait you mean that criminals do crime that crazy i we told the criminals are victims of the system and that after all they shoplift because they need bread in the words of that genius alexandera capo cartel by the way it is worth noting here that the center that wrote this study we are vocal supporters of the bale reform waws from the very beginning arrest outside new york city decreased from a hundred eighty four thousand in twenty nineteen to a hundred fifty four thousand in twenty twenty two even as crimes increase in fact there are seventeen thousand more crimes in twenty twenty to then twenty ninety but thirty thousand fewer arrests well i mean there is a shock again amazing you mean when you release criminals on to the streets the at makes no no a californium is doing the same thing according to the wall street journal what would happen if lawmakers reinvented the criminal justice system to target's s steric races hm instead of crime californium about to find out californa passtalaw and twenty twenty called the californium racial justice act which means every fellow serving time in the state prison an jail can now retroactively challenge his conviction and sentencing on the grounds of systemic bias s the prisoner does not need to show that the police officer prosecutor judge r our was racist all they have to demonstrate is that in the past criminal suspects of his race were arrested prosecuted or sentence more often or more severely than members of other racial groups in other words if you're a black felon in prison you are going table to so to lower your sentence based on systemic factors now every examination of sentencing is complicated by the realities which is that sentencing differs by not only the crime but the behavior during the crime for each in every person who is engaged in a crime and simply takin a baseline of black people are sentence for the same crimes longer than white people does not take into a count any of the external factors other crimes that were pled down cry nail histories of the suspects behavior during the arrest in fact comparing these two things is sort of suggesting that women earn less than men on average and terms of salary ignoring things how many hours are worked or what jobs people are in as the waltzer journal points out cart testimony now sounds a a critical race studies course when a fellow in san francisco contested his arrest and prosecution for having loaded hand gun in his car a race expert testified the arresting officers use of the phrase high crime area demonstrated bi us against people of color the appeals court allowed the fellow's claim to proceed the same expert who testified this by the way also testified that whites our psychopaths who is behavior represents an underlying biologically transmitted proclivity this is going to heather macdonalds writing about all

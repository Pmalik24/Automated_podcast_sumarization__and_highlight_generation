welcome to the superman lap science science palette i man drew supermen and om our professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day we are discussing dopamine dopamine is a topic that have covered before on this podcast and many people have heard of dopamine most people know that dopamine is involved in pleasure to some extent or another and nowadays people are starting to appreciate that dopamine is also intimately involved with motivation drive and pursuit while today you are going to learn that indeed dopamine is responsible for all of those things but you are also going to learn that dopamine is critical for overcoming procrastination for insuring on going motivation end indeed for insuring confidence in fact we are going to talk about the relationship between dopamine and motivation and confidence at the level of neurobiological circuitry and we are going to cover tools that will blow you to leverage your dopamine in order to have maximum motivation to overcome sticking points which include things procrastination but also by understanding the neural circuits in the brain and body that release and use dopamine but more importantly by understanding what are called dopamine dynamics that is what gives rise to big peaks in dopamine or troughs in dopamine or what is refer to as our base line level of dopamine which turns out to be our base line levels of motivation and feelings of well being by understanding how those things relate to one another i assure you that by the end of to day's episode you will be in a far better position to understand why you become motivated why you procrastiny how to insure motivation on an on going basis an even how to leverage effort and the desire to become motivated as a way to do just that to become more motivated today's discussion is not about psychology although i will center around practical everyday examples and offer many many tools that you can implement if you choose to day's discussion is really about pulling a part these things that we call motivation reward pleasure procrastination and understanding them in terms of their dopamine dynamics whether youveheard me or others talk about dopamine before for whether not to day is your first exposure to the topic of dopamine to day's episode is really designed to give you the biological and practical knowledge that you can leverage your dopamine circuitry and your dopamine levels as well as tools to a just dopamine circuitry in levels in order to optimize mental health physical health and performance before you begin i to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my destroy effort to brings zeurocosto consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is element element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar now salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called neurons in fact in order for your neurons to function properly all three electrolytes need to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to deposits in cognitive and physical performance element contains a science pactelectrolike ratio of one thousand milligrams that one gram of sodium two under milligrams of potassium and sixty milligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if have been sweating lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is elements doctor slash supermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element elememente doom slash supermen o we let us talk about dopamine what is dopamine dopamine is what is called a euro modulator which simply refers to the fact that it is a chemical that modulates or changes the electrical activity of other cells and the sells om referring to or neurons neurons are just nerve cells you have a brain and a spinal chord and the neurons in your brain and final sort connect to one another and they connect to different areas of the body including basically every organ of your body and every organ of your body communicates back to your brain and spinal cord through direct or in direct pathways for instance you have neurons in your gut that sense what sorts of nutrients you have eaten or drink and then see neural signals electrical signals up to the brain and indeed that whole process happens to be modulated body dopamine dopamine as a nuromodulator has the basic property of either camping up increasing or decreasing the activity of other neurons and that is done by adjusting things electrical potentials and things of that sort that we really will not go into this episode but that i promise to get into in detail in a future episode if you are interested in the bile chemistry and bile physics of neurons and things of that sort we have this nuromodulator dopamine and we know that that nuromodulator can increase or decrease the activity of other neurons then we have to ask ourselves where is dopamine released in the brain and body and what specific types of neurons is it impacting in other words what specific types of functions does dopamine have the are easily five circuits within the brain that use dopamine as the primary nuromodulator and those five circuits engage different but related functions solely go through them one by one relatively quickly giving you a little bit of nomen later and some sense of what each of those circuits looks and what it does the first circuit is the called negro strata pathways in the back of the brain there is an area called substantial night named because the neurons they are act very dark they actually contain pigment you be able to see this if i were to slice up a brain s two dark regions in the back that substantial tigress substantianigra contains o neurons that are chalk a chockfull of dopamine but they release that dopamine in a brain structure called the stratum the stratum is involved in movement both the initiation of movements and the suppression of movements in called go action and logo suppress action pathways topic for a future podcast the second brain circuit that uses and averages dopamine to a great extent is a called mess limbic pathway now you will also in a moment hereabout the mess cortical pathway to day among talk about these somewhat interchangeably at times but where its important for me to differentiate between them i will do that both of these pathways initiate from a set of neurons and the called eventual segmental area or v t a i will use that crinum v her the ate functions in close partnership with a different brain structure called the nucleus accumbent or n a i do not think it'll call it an a to day talk about tier eventual segmental area and it'll talk about nuclear recumbent forsake of to day's discussion you can lump those together if you want neurons in those areas project a bunch of different places but in the misolymbic pathway those neurons are projecting to areas of the brain the hypofalmus which sits right above the roof of your mouth an is responsible for a lot of basic functions things maintaining your body temperature for libido in the pursuit of see for hunger for the generation of signals to the pituitary gland that cause the release of hormones and other things into the blood stream the connections which i sometimes refer to at projections from the neurons in the tier and nuclear recumbent to the hypothalamus are basically using doom to modulate the output of a lot of different things that happen in this hypothalamus that controls a lot of we could call them primitive functions but there really basic functions for survival now the other pathway out of the tier and nuclear accumbent is to the quartet that is why it is called mess cortical pathway this is a very different pathway out of the voter and uncles accumbent and the one i just described a moment ago the pathway of talking about now the mesa cortical pathway objects to the prefrontal cartel which is a structure that many of you perhaps heard of but even if you have not it is important to know this is an area that resides right behind your forehead and that in humans compared to other species is greatly expanded in terms of its size and complexity of function it is involved in everything from planning and executing of action to making good or bad decisions depending on context in fact one of the primary functions of prefrontal quarters is to really understand context whether or not for instance you are alone in your room where certain behaviors are appropriate whether not you are at work where other behaviors are appropriate understanding what the context is and therefore what sorts of actions need to be generated and suppressed in fact a guest on the superman ladpotcast and this is a guest whose episode has an aired ye describe this beautifully he is a euro surgeon and he said the way to thing about the prefrontal quarter is it is basilar area of the brain that says or no not now to other brain regions in order to suppress action we know this because people that have damage to the prefrontal quarter often cannot suppress their impulses is the pathway from vizier and nuclisiccumbents to the prefrontal quarter is absolutely critical for today's discussion because we are largely going to be discussing motivation drive pursuit procrastination and all sorts of things that have to do with our feeling is about context whether not we want to do something or not whether not we feel we showed we shouldn't whether not we feel we failed the last time or there is a high probability of success the next time prefrontal qartecx does many many things but when thinking about dopamines roll in the prefrontal quarter that is when thinking about this mess cortical pathway we really want ta thing about howdopamine is activating or changing or propensity to do certain things and get us into action girl prevent us from doing certain things and prevent action basically you can think about the mess quartic pathway as the circuit that really governs all of the major choices that you are gong to make in life about what to do in what not to do toward your goals and away from the things that you want to avoid now the fourth dopamine pathway in the brain his the called tubereau infondibular pathway and this is not one we are going to focus on too much to day this is a pathway that relates to connections between the brain and your pituitary gland your pituitary gland being that gland that is as i mention a moment ago is also receiving input from the hypofalmas and is releasing a bunch of hormones into your bloodstream things utilizing hormone logical stimulating hormone things a mañana corban hormone these are hormones that are impacting everything from the function of the very and females to the function of the testes and males governing things a cactus all release under stress theroid harmony meaning its regulating firry hormone release and on an on dopamine has a very powerful impact on the output of the pituitary again that is probably a topic for a future episode but it is important in reviewing the different brain circuits that use dopamine as a nermogelayer that i mention that one then there is a fifth one and this fifth one is not often discussed and again will not be the main topic of today's discussion but for thoroughness and for clarity it is important tat we mention it this is the circuit within your retina that is the piecrust lining of neral tissue on the back of your eye because remember your eyes actually part of your brain that got extruded from your brain during development knows two eyes that you see in the mirror and that you see another people a actually two pieces of central nervous system and within the retina which is the normal portion of the eye within the nerlretina dopamine is responsible for adapting to different conditions that you can see clearly both in the evening and when it gets darker you can still see a bit and in the morning when it is very bright you do not really have to make adjustments to your visual system in order to see clearly your visual system does it for you in one of the ways that it does that is through the neromagulater dopamine to day we are not going to discuss the retinal dopamine pathways or the tuperinfindibular dopamine pathways and we will not really talk much about the nigrostrital pathways say one more thing about it then it'll leave it alone we are going to talk about the mess quartic pathway we might touch on the my is limit pathway a little bit as well to day we are mostly going to talk about mess cortical circuitry and function and dopamine within the mess martial circuit and the reason that we are doing that is that to day's discussion is really about motivation procrastination goal setting and pursuit it is very important understand that neither dopamine nor the mess quartic circuit cares about any specific goal or pursuit this is a circuit that uses dopamine in order to pursue anything now of course some people have a greater propensity to pursue things work or goals and athletics or relationships or commination of those other people unfortunately have a greater propensity to pursue things drugs of abuse what are drugs of abuse drugs of abuse ten to be drugs that increase levels of dopamine to the extent that other types of pursuits in life that are adaptive for us work relationships school et camera become irrelevant in fact the definition of a diction that i use and that i believe really matches the nor biology very well is that a diction is a progressive narrowing of the things that bring us pleasure healthy functioning in the mess cortical pathway however allows us to toggle or switch back and forth between different types of pursuits of all the sorts that have mentioned earlier if we can understand how that mess martial pathway works just a little bit in particular when dopamine is released and when it is not released what dopamine does when it is released to our sense of motivation in drive and if we can understand a little bit about how our recent dopamine history that is whether not there is dopamine in our system already dictates whether not we are going to feel motivated in the next five ten fifteen minutes hours days and weeks that is all very easy to understand i promise it'll explain it to you in a simple way but i want you to get a circuit into your mind i wants you to invasion that there are these neurons little nerve cells in the v tier and lucky siccommons those neurons make dopamine they send their projections that we call axons which lo wires and they can release dopamine into the prefrontal quarter and now you already know because you learned it a few minutes ago that the prefrontal quarter then can insure that certain behaviors take place and other behaviors do not take place that sh or quieting that we talked about earlier with that in mind let us now take a look it how dopamine is released and let us keep two things in mind there are piss in dopamine that is dopamine is released into the frontal quarter where has these effects of activating or suppressing action and we can think of the one as peaks in dopamine i i call it a spike that means an increase and then a decrease if i call a peak its an increase and then a decrease there can also be troughs in dopamine what do i mean by that well we have peaks an dopamine and that peak an dopamine can rise up and then go back to what we call baseline or there can be a trough it can go below base line the two key things to understand about dopamine is that we have dopamine peaks that are triggered by certain behaviors certain compounds drugs or substances food et camera and that we have a dopamine base line are dopamine base line is our reservoir of dopamine it is how full or empty are dopamine pool is and that dopamine pool is the pool of dopamine that we use in order to create those dopamine peaks and when those peaks come down sometimes they go back to base line and sometimes they go to lower than baseline which we call the trough if any of this seems confusing want you just to imagine a wave pool this is an analogy that was given to me by one of our podcast guess which is doctor calgelette who an obesity specialist and in works on number of things relate to endrin hormone function including testosterone estrogen in both men and women when a chick out his episodes on hormone health other fascinating an actionable i use a tremendous wealth of knowledge and he has this analogy for how dopamine works in our brain and body and that analogy is this notion of a wavepool you have ever seen a wavepoolets basically a concrete pool and there are waves within it cannot dog those waves can be of different heights they can be little ripples we can thin of those as little men peaks or they can be big waves that can really big crashing waves if the height of those waves and the frequency of those waves is very very large some of that water which here i musing as an analogy to dopamine can slosh out of the wavepool and the base line drops however if those peaks are small enough or they are seldom enough well then the base line that is the water level in that pool stays more or less constant i think this is an excellent analogy for how dopamine works and the mes of quartic pathway as it relates to motivation and pursuit an all those sorts of things because we reallean to think about how the peaks and the base line relate to one another this is very important the peaks in the base line are not independent of one another they relate to one another now you have in your mine a wavepool and just understand that if you get a great big huge wave may be one of them will crash out in some of that water will splash out the was line will go down a little bit but if you get big peak after big peak after big peak pretsoon your can empty that pool whereas if you have smaller waves were less frequent big waves well then the baseline will stay relatively constant let us think about dopamine peak s and base lines and let us remember that for every peak there is a trough i mean by that well when you have a wave you also have the bottom of the wave when you have a mounting you have the bottom of the mountain when we think about dopamine peaks and dopamine base lines we have to include that trough because that trough that is thelevel of dopamine below base line really dictates whether not you are going to feel motivated to pursue something or not am gong to give you a visual in your mind the visual in your mind is and increase in dopamine that is trigger by your desire for something and really could be your desire for anything if you are hungry and you are thinking about hi really want a sandwich really want o nothing what sandwich hand i want right now really nice roast beef sandwich on sourdough with a slice of swims to mates slice a pickle here ism describing the sandwich that i would want if you are hungry and your thinking about that dopamine starts rising this is crucially important understand dopamine is not just released when we get the reward when we get the thing that were pursuing dopamine is released anticipation of what we want that increase in dopamine is by no happenstance no mistake relates also to our propensity and desire to move remember earlier i told you there is a separate circuit of dopamine that triggers movement and that when it is toileted is causing things degas its an movement related to parkinsons or other movement disorders well that is not pure coincidence that is because desire and the need to move in order to pursue and reach goals or one in the same process if i desire a sandwich or i desire a cup of coffee or i desire some water when ism thirsty there is an increase in dopamine that we could call little mini peak and dopamine but then here is the anything very soon after i realize my desire for something that peak that was caused by the desire comes down and drops below base line below the level of dopamine that it was prior to even thinking about the sandwich for the coffee or the glass of water and it is that drop below base line that triggers my desire to go out and find that sandwich that coffee that water or that blank insert whatever it is that you happen to desire action or substance of any kind or person et camera that drop below baseline is fundamental to the whole process and that drop below baseline was trigger by the preceding peak let us say that i desire a sandwich there is an increase in dopamine then very quickly it comes down below baseline just a little bit norm in pursuit of the sandwich ism looking for where i can get that sandwich i can order it perhaps to be delivered i can go out and find it now is the stage in which i have to think about what are the different stimuli that is the things in my environment that signal whether not ism likely to get that sandwich or not an for instance if i were to going to my phone and order food on a nap were walked down the street and see the sign for a belly that is a cue that ism likely to relieve that drop in dopamine and get not just back to base line but that it'll get a peak and dopamine and indeed that is what happens if i find that belly i going to the belly they are open they are making the sandwich that i want they make my sandwich and great i get that sandwich and that sandwich will have some degree of inherit reward to it some degree of a my liking it or not liking it lit say i it the best sin which have ever had but all ism doing is comparing my desire for that sandwich to the sandwich that i actually got and ate an chances are it is going to relieve that craving meaning it will take that dooming that had fallen below baseline up up back to base line and if i the sandwich it is going to indeed increase that dooming again to another peak now if i love the sandwich it is the most delicious thing that have ever tasted my entire life well then it'll get a big peak in dopamine when i consume that reward however chances are that sandwiches more o less as i expected to be which is pretty good it'll lead it and ism fine what o i mean by fine well there is a concept called reward prediction er reward prediction error says that the dooming that it is experience that is that is released from the vizier and lucky accumbent is going to be of a certain value and that value is going to be compared to the desire and expectation of what i thought i was going to get if you take what you actually got minus what you expected that is reward prediction air if the sandwich is basically what i expected to get fine dooming comes down easily to a baseline level that is pretty standard for me and is basely the baseline level i had before i ever thought about the sandwich it all if the sandwich completely surprises me and is completely amazing just an amazing sandwich well then the level of dooming that i experience when i consume that sandwich is going to be even greater and it is going to be that minus what i expected there it is a bigger reward prediction er in the direction of higher peak bi consuming the sandwich and then of course there is the other possibility which is the belly's closed or the sandwich they make me is lousy or does not taste good or something happened in the consuming of that sandwich that just makes a bad experience in which case if we take that reward experienced minus reward predicted from the initial craving well then it is going to be less than what i expected and therefore the base line drops below where it was prior to even desiring the sandwich case all of this might semalobit complicate its all very simple desire for things increases dopamine but then our level of dopamine drops below baseline and it is that drop globate line that triggers the motivation to bring that dopamine level back of by going in pursuing the thing that you wanted in the first place of course as this is happening you are not conscious of your dopamine levels you experience this as contact dependent craving and pursuit because remember the prefrontal quartets is involved in contact setting and craving and pursuit because it relates to action and movement which is one of the general features of the dopamine system you can start to see how this is a beautifully designed system and you can also see how it is a perfect system for desire and pursuit of anything not just sandwiches as ism giving you in this somewhat trivial but every day and therefore applicable example just by understanding reward predictionerror and especially by understanding that a craving triggers a per and dopamine that makes you motivated but then drops your level of dopamine below baseline which makes you even more motivated you are already half way through the conceptacle aspect of to day's podcast because if you can understand that you will understand why for instance when you initially want something r you think you want something it puts you into motion but then pretty quickly you are starting to feel the pain of not having that and that is also contributing to your desire to pursue that thing this is a subtle effect but if you watch for it you will start to see it or experience it within yourself your craving for things is notorious about craving for those things person it is also a desire to relieve the pain of not having those things and if you can internalize that and start to develop in awareness around it you will be in an amazing position to leverage all sorts of aspects of the dopamine system in order to increase your motivation especially when things get really hard or when you have the propensity to procrastinate which is something that will get into a obit later in the podcast it'd to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called a g one is a vitamin mineral robotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs have been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve some delighted that their sponsoring the podcast treason i started taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athletic greens ones are usually twice a day is that it gets to me n the robotics that i need for got health our god is very important its populated by up microbioda that communicate with the brain the immune system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long turn health and those robotics enthetic greens are optimal and vital for macrobiotic health in addition athletic greens contains an number of adaptegins vitamins and minerals that make sure that all f my foundational nutritional needs are met and it tastes script if you to tryathletic greens you can go to athletic green dock cam slash aubergine and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you are on the road and the car on the plain et camera and t all give you a years supply of vitamin d three k too again that is at let it greenstone come slash supermen to get the very travel packs and the years supply o vitamin d three k to now it'd to talk about the dynamics of dopamine release with a little bit more detail and this is something have never covered on any social medioposed or on any podcast either this one or is a guest on other pod case because on the face of it it might seem a little too detail that willy telling me all this is not it just enough toe know that their peaks and troughs and base lines and dopamine what turns out that if you can understand what that peak and trough are really about in other words what is really happening when we fume in on that peak and trough you will be in an amazing position to overcome procrastination and essentially pursue any goals in an on going basis him very side to share this information with you because i do think tat has tremendous actionable power when ism about to describe relates to a number of different findings that have been made mostly over the last five to ten years although to be quite direct most of them last five years and it has to do with the fact that the peak and trough and base line that i talked about a moment ago that are associate with craving they look a peak followed by a trough followed by a return to base line may be another peak if you get the reward or a drop below base line if you do not or you do not what you got but if we were to fume in on that peak and the reward another words really fume in on the whole process and start thinking about the circuitry that is the neurons in v tier and uncle ecumbons and how it relates to the frontal quarter in a bit more detail what we discover is nothing short of amazing what we discover is that whenever we are pursuing something we are always looking for cues as to whether or not we are on the right path to achieve that thing and we are also setting a mine set or a contact within are brains as to whether or not we are confident or pessimistic as to whether not we are going to achieve that thing now this is vitally important for any one out there who finds it hard to get motivated and stay motive ate it is also vitally important for anyone whose psychologically minded in any way it ought to be psychologist but psychologically minded in any way and wonders why is it that some people are just motivated and other people have such trouble with motivation why is it that some people require perfect conditions in order to achieve things and other people just seem to manage to pursue things no matter what it also relates to the fact that some of us are very good at achieving our goals in one context and not much in another here is what you need to understand it'll stay with the example of the roasted sandwich just because we already have that in mine but you can replace roastbeef sandwich with essentially any goal the cue that we are going to likely get what we want for instance the sign that there is a belly on the corner or that i open my phonon that there is an a that represents a restaurant that sells the particular sandwich that i that cue as i mention be for increases dopamine you see that of and subconsciously there is already a signal that is initiated by that dopamine that ism on the right path then as i mention dopamine drops below base line that is further contributing to my desire to go pursue that sandwich either with my thumbs on my phone through the a or with my feet and walking to the belly standing in line and forth then as i mention before there is a peak in dopamine of varying height depending on how satisfying i find the reward to be when i actually get that sandwich get that goal now keep in mine there is some time delay between the cue the a the belly et camera and when i get my sandwich that gap is going to be different for different thing in pursuing a o for your degree its can be four years if the diploma is your goal if i it is examine your studying for it might be a week long and there will be many other signals in between that initial cue that hey the the reward likely lies down this path in this text book in on on this dating a or at that belly there many other cues those cues come in subconsciously and involve everything from how long the line is at the belly to whether not your you no seeing the types of people on a dating a that you to see whether not the responding to you whether not some one's testing you back or not all of those cues are integrated and adjusting your baseline level of dopamine all the time as you go to pursue that goal what the dopamine system does is it does not just compare the height of the peak at the beginning right the i desire that to the reward that you got we talked about reward prediction er that is the that is the can of first grate version of reward prediction ere it is also taking into account all the things that happen in between and all of that is serving as a cue for the eventual reward and all of that is finally into what we call reward prediction ere in other words the dopamine system is very good at subconsciously parsing what are the things that happened between wanting and getting and that is part of the learning that dopamine achieves and indeed therefore specialized circuits from the v the and uncle accumbent that are involved in just the learning of how we achieve or do not achieve specific types of rewards that we desire this is called reward contingent learning because it is learning the contingencies of what led up to a reward or what did not lead up to a reward at the same time end in parallel there is an on going release of dopamine in the background and that on going release of dopamine that has nothing to do with learning is realize a sort of a propeller that is driving us in the direction of whatever it is that were trying o pursue i realize for some of you this might seem unnecessary or perhaps even an overwhelming amount of detail but it is actually quite simple your brain is trying to figure out what happened prior to getting or not getting a reward and it is comparing what you wanted compared to what you got at the same time the dopamine system initiates a motivation signal that takes you through that entire round of pursuit and those three things there's the stimulus the desire that i want that that is the first thing leads to that pique the pique drops a a bit bilobate line and it trigger's motivation the motivation is the second thing the motivation is dopamine release also but from a separate set of anurans within this circuit driving you forward and the entire time that it is driving you forward it is paying attention to what is there along the way even if you do not realize it consciously and then there is the reward itself or the lack of reward itself those three components the learning contingency which as to do with the stimulus and the reward and everything that happens in between and the propeller nature of dopamines of referring to it those all combine into a total learning that after you get the samwhich or after you finish the exam or after you out on a date or after you do anything that you desire to do that system that originates in the voter an lucky recumbent and goes up to your quarter it learned it learned many things it learned that contingency between stimulus and desire motivation and whether not you succeeded or not it is basically a score board for how you did given what just happened actually it is all very simple in fact if you can understand even just half of what i just said you are now in a far better position to understand everything from a diction to motivation to procrastination and it will make sense of all the tools that ism going to talk about next which will allow you to overcome procrastination points to overcome deficits in motivation and indeed to reset your motivation in an on going way that you can reach your goals o case let us take everything that i just told you and set it aside it is still important but let just set is that you have to think about any of those details or names or anything let us just think about a diction because in biology and in psychology frankly it really often pays to think about the extremes first and then work our way towards more typical circumstances with that said addiction unfortunately is very common nowadays i just heard a statistic in fact that there is an eighty eight zero per cent increase in alcohol use disorder among women in the last thirty years talk to limit about this in the episode that i did about alcohol and health can i one be very clear ism not somebody that is completely against alcohol for adults provided their not alcoholics turns out two drinks a week probably fine health wise zero would be b better if we are honest zero is better than any alcohol but two drinks a week is probably fine pass to drinks you start running in to problems and yet many many people out there male an female alike suffer from alcohol use disorder also called alkalis the same is also true for things met them examine or cocaine or other types of substance editions and the same is also true for a lot of behavior or what are sometimes called process editions things sex edition or vidiogame edition or any type of behavior that frankly is leveraging the dopamine system but that engages this progressive narrowing of the things that bring some one pleasure such that nothing else is really salient nothing else is really pulling them in in the way that their video games or see or pornography or alcohol vicious substance or behavior that you see out there or hopefully not but that you might suffer from an diction to what is happening in addiction well a diction involves dopamine among other things often the point system et camera but if we re to think about what is the stimulus in an indiction and what is the peak in dopamine and then what happens after that peak it all becomes very clear as to whyediction happens and why it pernicious for instance less take cone cocaine causes dramatic increases in dopamine very very fast if somebody craves cocaine what are they craving their craving that dopamine peak there craving the increase level of alertness their in craving a number of things associated with the feeling of being under the influence of the drop but the stimulus for it simply becomes that line of cocaine or in the case of crack that crackrock that there get a smoke god forbid their main lining it other shooting into a vain what happens is they snort smoke or inject cocaine and dopamine levels almost immediately go up up up up up to a very high peak was the the time gap between the stimulus and the dopamine is very very short short in fact that there is really no other contingencies in between that the memo cortical system has to learn in fact what is the system quit into learn it learns cocaine equals massif amounts of dopamine equals feeling euphoric and energetic et camera and in doing that it reinforces the whole circuit that that short we can even say hyper short contingency is really what the system wants much that longer contingencies of say putting in the hard work of generating a fitness program or a professional programmed for r cell for a a education program which takes not just many days but many weeks and years well none of that is going to lead to piece in dopamine that are as high as the per an dopamine associated with cocaine that tells us something critical it is both the duration between desire and effect and when i say effect i mean the rewarding properties of dopamine that are experienced that is important very short gaps teach the system to expect and want short gaps makes it very hard to pursue things that take longer when we say it is the short or in this case hyper short distance we are time between the stimulus and the dopamine what we are really talking about if we were to plot this out on a on a border on a piece of paper is the steepness of the rise of that peak it is very very steep the peak in dopamine is coming up very fast after the desire and in addition to that and this is very important the her the peak in dopamine and the faster the rise to that peak the further below base line the dopamine drops after the drug wars off a in the case of cocaine it is a very fast and very large rise in dopamine followed by a steep drop and very deep trough in dopamine below base line you say of there is pleasure than there is lack of pleasure ah but it is worse than that because it is notorious lack of pleasure if you recall what we talked about a little bit earlier that drop below base line triggers the desire and the pursuit for what for more and this sets in motion a vicious sloop where people start pursuing peaks in dopamine that can come very fast without much effort and that is one of the ways in which addiction start to take hold a there is a simple way to think about this and to remember if you want to avoid this whole thing i mean the first one is obvious do not do cocaine do not try it do not use it certainly do not get addicted to it s a all sort of one in the same frankly i do not know many people that a despite opinions to the contrary that use cocaine recreational that do not at some point run in to either a financial psychological physical or some other problem the other thing that is absolutely critical to keep in mind and this was discussed in my colly doctor onalempki's book domination and on this podcast excellent book by the way highly recommended if you have not read it already it is a fascinating a exploration into dopamine as it relates to addiction not just drug addiction but other types of addiction get the name of that book is domination will provide a link to it in the shownote captions the other thing that happens after those big fast increases in dopamine caused by things cocaine is afterwards when it quickly drops below base line it takes a much longer time to get back to the original base line then it did prior to using the drug and worse still is that the peaks in dopamine that are created from more consumption of cocaine leads to progressively lower peaks and deeper troughs below base line the whole system is shifting away from pleasure and more to pain and the desire for pursuit of the drug of this is a terrible situation and it is a terrible situation that is noxious unique to cocaine in fact if we were to look at the averages and again these are averages of the height of the peaks in dopamine that are created by different substances and the rates at which those peaks take place was remember the time to peak is just as important as how high that peace goes we see some pretty interesting number for instance and again these are averages based on neroimaging combined with of what are all pet scans on positronomission tomography combine with blood draws and a number of other data from both animal and human studies i find is that at base line just count upon a background of no of drug taking of any kind the neurons in the venturing mental lucky socomen's area are firing at a rate of about three to four per second releasing dopamines o that is your base line of dopamine release your your forebrain is always seeing a little bit of dopamine from from that system if you were then to anticipate food and your relatively hungry that would double this probably happened when you decide et lunch to day if you are hungry prior eating lunk it doubles in anticipation of the food and then depending on how much you enjoyed that food it might triple or quadruple it might be lower than it was during the anticipations we talked about before there is an approximate doubling under conditions of desiring and consuming food lentic nicotine is the next example for people that use nicotine either smoking raping snuffing or dipping all routs of nicotine administration that covered in our episode about nicotine here is about a one hundred and fifty percent increase in the rate of dopomineron firing koine is going to increase the rate of dopamine output into the provincial quarters by about a thousand per cent my what your really talking about here is a tenfold increase in the amount of of dopamine that is released into the prefrontal quarter as measured by the rates of firing these dopamine neurons them redefine is going to be anywhere from a thousand per cent anywhere up to ten thousand percent it really varies depending on the potency of the drug and a few other factors and here is where perhaps it gets a little more interesting some of you are probably wondering about affine or about secs or about video games now there the numbers very tremendously and it is really important understand that across the board not just for affine sex video games but also for nicotine alckohall and other of substances and what we call motivated behaviors some of which are part of a healthy life eating and reproduction provided it you knowable appropriate contacts appropriate yo species appropriate consensual well then a we consider it adaptive it is not well then consider not maladaptive some people will sit down to play of idiot game they really video games and as their sitting down they will experience a fivefold increase in the rate of dooming output from their lucky succombents for other people it is going to be a tenfold increase for other people me who do not vedogames very much ounivaning against them i do not dislike them but it does not do much for me it might not cause any increase whatsoever it might even cause a decrease in dooming there is a lot of individual variability for sex it turns out to be a range they typical range that sited in the literature is anywhere from a four to fivefold increase in the rate of dopamine near on firing however there are certain individuals for which that number is doubled fine is a little bit of a special circumstance because affine has the property of not just causing the release of dooming but increasing the amount of dooming receptors over time and there are not a lot of excellent measurements of the amount of dooming released as a function of canine intake in different populations of humans it is mostly animal studies but what we think based on the fishtail based on the overall picture of the literature is that it is an approximate doubling of the dopamine signaling that is coming out of the vitae uncles accommens to forefront of quarter when we anticipate and when we drink our coffee again i really want be clear that for all of these things these are relative levels and there distributions if we were to plot them out on paper you'd see that these are not bargraphsies are overlapping curves to some extends of some people are going to achieve a more dooming release or less dooming release from one behavior or substance however it is very clear that cocaine them amphetamine even heroine for that matter are way out on the right hand side of the curve causing enormous increases in dopamine very quickly and the other things that we described have again a distribution that is more left ward shifted on this imaginary plot that ism creating to lot of individual variability however it is fascinating the dopamine is the single molecule that is causing the craving and pursuit and experience of all of these substances in behaviors and the learning of all of that craving pursuit and actual experience is what predicts whether not we will reengage reuse that substance or not re engage in a behavior or not and how frequently we will do that that is a diction but if you understand how the height of those peaks in dopamine and the rate to reach those peaks and the troughs that resolved and how long the troughs take to get back to baseline if you understand or little or all of that your really in a terrific position to understand how to leverage the dopamine system for the pursuit of healthy goals and behaviors i should mention one thing about recovery from a diction which is that the reset of all that dopamine circuitry from unhealthy to healthy often involves depending on the edition thirty days of complete abstinence that thirty days of complete abstinence inevitably involves a lot of pain in discomfort and craving anxiety insomnia et camera that relates to the big trough in dopamine that inevitably occurs now of course there are some editions such as severe alcoholediction and in some cases olio edition that immediate and sustained abstinence cannot be used as the tool somebody really needs to work within addiction specialist and sometimes there needs to be a tapering off of the substance for other diction it can be qotiqo coal turkey and then of course there other diction particular food and sex but sometimes even things video games for which the desired outcome is not necessarily to eliminate the behavior completely but to set some constraints around the behavior that it is not occurring to the exclusion of other pleasureful things in life and adapt of things in life and for that there is the requirement for what are called binding behaviors will get back to binding behaviors later of binding behaviors are behaviors in which people bind their behavior a round of particular substance use or around a particular behavioral edition sex of defames et camera in space and or time in space meaning they might only engage in those particular o behaviors in certain places in certain times when it is context appropriate an there numerous examples of binding behaviors in space and time it all has to do with clamping or directing when the engagement with the dopamine releasing behavior is going to occur what is happening when people decide to go cold turkey or they use these binding behaviors well what is happening is that people are engaging the specific circuitry within the prefrontal quartet that as i mention at the beginning of the episode are important for context setting in the cases of binding behaviors the prefrontal quarter is essentially getting trained up to understand that oke certain things food or perhaps sex or of perhaps video games there o k if they are done or consumed in appropriate amounts or in particular context that requires the context setting gold directed behavior that the prefrontal quarter as responsible case o for the last ten or fifteen minutes we have ben talking a lot about addiction and actually this is not an episode about addiction however if you understand a little bit about the dopamine dynamics akin edition you can leverage that knowledge towards healthy adapted goal pursuit and achieving your goals let us think about that in the context of what generates dooming peaks what generates desire to pursue goals what causes are read out of weather not we achieved a goal or not in other words what allows us to learn how to pursue goals of different kinds not just get good at achieving one kind of goal but really understand and get really really good at setting goals and pursuing goals of different kinds that are adaptor indifferent areas of life in because we all are going to have to pursue goals in school work relationships fitness mental health and on and on in order to be our best selves that is clear well all of that is possible using the same basic set of dopamine circuits and the same basic dynamics of dopamine for instance if we are going to feel motivated at all that is if we are going to wake up in the morning or have any period of time during our day in which we feel we are capable of pursuing goals we are going to have to have a healthy level of baseline dopamine in motherworts we are going to have to have enough dopamine in the wavepool enough water in the wavepool that is before we can generate any waves or peaks in dopamine let alone troughs and the rest how do we achieve a healthy baseline level of dope well there we can really look to some foundational practices practises that perhaps you have hurt about on this podcast before that to some of you might seem a little mundane although some of them are a bit more sophisticated may been esoteric the good news is that we can all control these things and they do not require purchasing anything but they do require some degree of regular up keep and effort those things include what i call the very basics now the very basics ism put in the contacts of to day's discussion are the things that put water in the wavepool those are going to be getting sufficient amounts of quality sleepyach night something that we have done several episodes on and n have on line tool kits forest you can see the master your sleep episode the perfect your sleep episode the light in health episode you want skip all that in just get right to the tools we have a of sleep tool kit or it sic half call the tool it for sleep you can access at superman lapdog calm completely zero cost just go there and download that tool kit getting sufficiently be to night literally restores your dopamine reserves it allows dopamingto be present and for you to have a level of baseline dopamine that will allow you to even consider your goals in any kind of meaningfully reasonable way second there are practices that are supported by the scientific literature to increase your baseline level of dopamine that are independent of sleep but are similar to sleep and i to refer to these as non sleep deep rest this is not meditation there's actually very little evidence that meditation of the traditional kind of you now sitting eyes closes thirdeyes sent focusing on your a third i center which is the saree behind your forehead there is very little evidence that that increase is levels of dopamine there is a place for meditation in the contacts of to day's discussion but it'll repeat meditation itself is a focusing exercise it is not known to increase dopamine however non sleep deep least called nest are very similar although different to what sometimes called yoga near which is where you lie there you do a sort of body scan some long email breathing and stars very similar you can find a link to a zero cost nest are on tube it is a ten minute long on there also twenty and thirty minute on out there also on you two but ill providing to the ten minute one those have been shown to increase the amount of dopamine in your dopamine reserves by up to sixty five per cent which is a remarkable number quality sleep non sleep deep least each a yogonedra very powerful ways to keep your baseline level of dopamine at a sufficient level in addition to that nutrition no doubt plays a role in your baseline level of dopamine because tyrosine the monoacid is the rate limiting engine for the synthesis of dopamine tracing is present in varying levels and different foods you can look those up on line you simply a put in a search for on tracing levels in different foods everything from particular cheeses paragon cheese us high levels of tyrosine a certain meet certain not certain vegetables without getting into details in specifics you can find those there but you need proper nunutricion and therefore nutrients in particular tyrosine in order to have sufficient levels of baseline dopamine the third thing on the list and again these are things that we come back to almost every episode but i do not think they can be repeated enough because these are really things that we need to focus on every twenty four hours you might be able to skip day here or there if you get sick ore your traveling ore you have some major life event but really every twenty four hours we rented to re up our sleep we need to re up our nutrients even if you are fasting your re upon your neutrons from story sources within your body the third thing is sunlight morning sunlight in particular v n extensive episodes about this check out the episode on light in your health if you want all the details but you want to trying view sunlight as early in the day as possible five to ten minutes on a clear day minimum ten to twenty minutes on a cloudy day minimum twenty a thirty minutes on a very overcast day minimum with out sun glasses do not stare at the sun please do not damage your eyes look off slightly off from the sun but yes you wan a face eastward towards the sun and on those cloudy days that is especially important to do why well viewing morning sunlight increases coatis all early in the day which is excellent because you want coatis all elevated early in the day and you want it lower later in the day and because of the relationship between the sells in your eye that send sunlight specifically morning sunlight believe or not that happens and signal to your hypothalamus and the relationship between the hypothalamus and the pituitary and other endercran organs it sets in motion a dopamine related cascade in neromodulators dopamine and hormones that lead to states of well being elevated mood alertness et camera throughout the day an also helps your sleep at night but to day ore tog about dopamine yes believe are not that morning sunlight exposure does increase you are levels of doom not just martial and fourth on the less is going to be movement exercise of varying kinds be resistance training con be cartyovasclar training that does increase levels of dopamine here were not talking about achieving peaks in dopamine i that could be accomplished through setting a personal record a p r or through sprints or heavy lifts or learning some new dynamic movement what really talking about here is getting into a regular exercise program of if not every day at least five days a week a mixture of party vascular an resistance exercise that we also know is known to elevate and maintain an elevated level of base line dopamine it is not just about the euphoria you feel during or after exercise it is also about the baseline level of dopamine that is achieve through regular movement and engaging in movement and if you are asking how could that be will you already know the answer the circuits in the brain and body that generate movement not just goal seeking but movement itself as i mentioned earlier that nigrostriatal pathway and yes that circuit is separate from the v tier neuclys comment to cortical circuit the mean a cortical circuit that we mainly been focussing on to day but they interact and by engaging in regular movement you insure that you are maintaining elevated levels of base line dopamine which is what you want if you are going to be able to engage in any kind of motivated pursuit behavior of any kind those are the fundamentals that will set the level of base line dopamine in your system a couple of key points yes there is variation based on both genetics and circumstance in baseline levels of dopamine some one going through a particular hard time or if somebody inherited a gene in the dopamine synthesis pathway that simply affords them higher levels of baseline dopamine we likely know these people they seem high promotivated all the time not just based on prior success but they just see have a lot of energy in a lot of go drive youknow you told about activation energy some of you may know what that her means others if you will not having low activation energy is great among the amount of energy that it takes to get into action to pursue adaptive in meaning full healthy goal some people just seem to have lower activation energy and higher levels of dopamine are probably associated with that some of us have lower levels of baseline dopamine regardless everyone needs to engage in the foundational things that i just mention a few moments ago every twenty four hours or at least strive to there is no escaping that now there are things that can increase ones baseline level of dopa being further and some of those get us into the realm of supplements and prescription drugs but for now i just want to mention a few of them that are purely behavioral in nature a zero cost and that have been shown in the research literature to increase baseline levels of dopamine for long periods of time and this is important because if any of you are out there listening to this thing about peaks and troughs and baselines you might be asking wait what is the difference between a baseline in a peak really because if for instance you get a big peak well that is a peak in the baselines o how do you distinguish between peak and baseline and well there is a trough unless they that trough lasts an hour is that hour long trout your baseline or ware's your set point how how do you establish your seaport and more importantly how to you raise your set point ah well if you are not already asking that question i just asked it for you i define an increase in your baseline level in dopamine to be anything that increases dopamine for more than one hour now when we think about coke and examine pornography a sac canine things of that sort regardless of how long one en gages in a bout of those behaviors or substances the increases in dopamine are going to be relatively short lived on the order of minutes to an hour sometimes longer i did not say that is how long your engaging in the behaviors i said that is how long those increases in dopamine are going to occur even if you were to continually engage in those behaviors and remember we continual engagement in a dopamine spiking behavior behave that increases dopamine peaks the hight of those peaks remember gets lower and lower and lower especially in a short amount of time and then drops below baseline there are tools and technics that you can use to elevate your baseline level of dopamine for long periods of time and here again this is done in addition to the basic tools that i mention a few moments ago the simplest one for which there are excellent data and here ism referring to data published in the european journal physiology it'll provide a link to this is that exposure of your body up to the neck to cold water and it does not have to be super cold by the way to cold water has been shown to increase baseline levels of dopamine and the other call catacolamines which include nor up an offer and pin effort but for sake of to day's discussion dopamine an particular for not just one but at least to and probably as long as four or five hours there been some additional scientific studies after the paper i just mentioned and it is really remarkable you can accomplish us the number of different ways you could get into a cold show in the morning and i do recommend doing this in the morning and in that case it is locate to get the water on your head am in fact i recommend it a you could get into an ice path you could get into a cold plunge in these circumstances am not suggesting this for sake of increasing metabolism or fat loss and thewhole discussion around a deliberate cold and metabolism and fat loss as become a obit controversial that we will not go there now mostly because we are focused on the clear ability of deliberate cold exposure to increase dopamine for long periods of time era you are dooming baseline the ways to do this very depending on the temperature for instance there are data pointing to the fact that if you want to get a long lasting increase in your baseline dopamine you could take a very cold shower or to old plunge or ice bath for a very brief period of time anywhere from thirty seconds to two minutes maybe three minutes but probably thirty seconds to two minutes now you might ask what is very cold here have to be careful because i do not want to recommend anything that is going to cause anyone have a heart attack we are going to shock or anything of that sort it is going to vary bi person depending on your level of cold tolerant what i recommend is if you are going for the short exposure long dopamine release approach that is thirty seconds to two minutes that you start warmer than you think you need to and they ease into it over a few days but were really talking about ranges in temperature from anywhere from about thirty seven degrees farrenheight to about fifty five degrees ferrenheit again be careful approach it with caution and ease into it i do recommend doing this early in the day and i should mention not after strength or hypertrophy training because within the six hours after straight or hypertrophy training this deliberate cold exposure especially emerging up to the neck can suppress the strength and hypertripheadaptation that the training is design to accomplish that is one approach the other approach that is supported by the literature to increase base sine levels of dopamine for very long series of time in fact this is the original approach is to get into warmer water not warm but warmer sixty degree farrenheight water up to the neck and to stay there for about forty five to sixty minutes the reason i do not think most people will do that or that most people would prefer a shorter colder exposure protocol is that most people do not have forty five to sixty minutes each morning to get into water and sit there and n that study they shall had them sitting in long chairs basically an the swallowing of a pool up to their neck for a full sixty minutes and then measuring doom you release and forth there bunch of durrnways to do this i should emphasis i do not think you need to be superprecise about the temperature and even the duration what i recommend is find a temperature that is in comfortably cold to you meaning that you feel agitated you want to get out but that your confident you can safely stay and and again i cannot give a simple prescriptive to everybody but this is known to increase base line levels of dopamine significantly in fact double them or more for long periods of time meaning hours up to four maybeven six hours into the day which is one the reason is suggest doing this early in the day i happen to get into a cold plunger take a coal shower first thing in the morning i do go outside angel my sunlight first sometimes sometimes i do the cold first it really depends on my circumstances and how ism feeling that day i don't think it really matters which when you do first but you want to try and get both of those in early in the day because you really want the catalog means and quarters all elevated early in the day guess that is deliberate cold exposure we already talks about exercise if you are doing your exercise early in the day there is no reason why it could not be done in concert with this deliberate cold exposure i recommend doing the deliberate cold exposure first for the reasons we talk about a few minutes ago and then of course there are compounds both prescription and over the counter compounds that can indeed raise your baseline levels of dopamine for an hour or more and when i say i n hour or more really depends on individual variation in terms of how quickly you metabolize dopamine and it depends on individual variation in how you manage or tolerate different dosages of drugs in different types of drugs the typical drugs and here in talking about legal prescription drugs for increasing dopamine a things riddling overall modaphinal and armodaphinal also taping the system and i did not entire episode about eighty hey which is the typical context in which you hear about these prescription drugs but assuming its prescribed by a doctor for either clinical reasons eighty h t or for other reasons all of those compounds do significantly increase baseline levels of dopamine for many many hours that is absolutely clear and it is one of the major reasons why those drugs are effective in increasing motivation and attention then their compounds that are sold over the counter rings a monoacid such as el tyrosine itself that is a very commonly sold and used a monoacid it is present in a lot of called rework out formulas i as many of am a fan of single ingredient supplements for the most part aside from foundational supplements anyone which give you many many micronutrient and all together because would be nearly impossible to consume each of those as individual om ingredients and get the right amounts et camera but for all other supplements ism a big believer in parsing what you need in what is most effective for you in single ingredient formulations and the typical ways in which people work to elevate their baseline levels of dopamine with supplements are using either eld pyridine which as i mentioned earlier as the rate limiting enzyme for dopamine or i using what is called macunipurians which is shall very similar to adopt which is the treatment for parkinsins macunopurins actually comes from the velvety outside coding of a certain been i know sounds really a esoteric but that socially where it is found in nature and is really ninety nine per cent el dopa and i confess having tried macunipurians having examined the scientific literator macunipurians there is some evidence that it can increase dopamine especially in that super in from fibular pathway because it can taping to some of the hormone related functions of the pituitary it does increase alertness and mood it might even increase lobed motivation et camera but the effects of mcuniperiancs tend to be very much of the increasing the peaking dopamine and then very quickly dropping that peak in other words the per trough phenomenon not for increasing baseline levels of dopamine it is likely different for people with parkinsins who are taking prescription drugs that are similar to macunipurian he people at parkinsons oftentimes they are prescribed things elope which is in the pathway to dopamine synthesis or they are prescribed things broom pristine which will indeed increase dopamine i do realize that some people use those prescription drugs recreational which i do not recommend those drugs can be used to increase base lone levels of dopamine but more typically they cause peaks in dopamine and troughs in dopamine which is why i do not recommend them they are not going to allow you to a accomplish what you want if your goal is more motivation et camera in fact they are likely to do the opposite give you a big pie in alertness and then a crash that can include depressive symptoms in just not feeling very good ell tracing however has been examine in the scientific literature and at reasonably low dosages has been shown to increase circulating and available levels of dopamine both in the brain and body and lead to increase connive performance an in some case physical output it'll provide links to a few these studies but the two that a i really parsed most finally for sake of this episode really just focus on taking el tracing under conditions where your baseline levels of dopamine are reduced do to stress and under conditions where there is no stress and people are trying to increase their baseline levels of dopamine for sake of improving connive function the first paper is entitled effect of tracing on connive function and blood pressure under stress it'll provide a link to this in the shownote captions and it is one of many papers really taking back to the early nineties exploring how relatively high frankly relatively his dosages of el tyrosine take in under conditions of stress allow people to rescue some of their connive function in terms of working memory tasks and other kind of connive task of visual pursuit tasks and on the second papers entitled tracing improves working memory in a mufti tasking environment and this second papers perhaps more interesting because it involves exploring the use of turbine supplementation they sell taking turbine about an hour before a cognate task or set of connive task than involve a lot of mufti tasking and working memory working memory for those of you that do not know is your ability to maintain small batches of information in your mind for relatively short periods of time for instance if i tell you my phone number er the phonumber where i grew up forninthry to ninth one if you can remember that chances are you will remember it for thirty second sixty seconds but the you will not remember it tomorrow cause is really no reason to a lot of the tasks that we do throughout the day involved working memory and working memory is very subject to interference from other tasks that we happen to be doing looking at our phone or having a conversation are trying to navigate through a city involves a lot of attention and this study shows the train improves working memory especially in the contacts of musty tasking and having a lot of conflicting goals and they did a number really nice on experiments here it is again it is a small study not that many subjects but it is one of several papers in fact this is the paper that and of set in motion that domino of other papers exploring the efficacy of el tracing for cognate performance and they looked at working memory task of course but also auditory visual task in the involves a interference of visual cues and things of that sort and they saw some really interesting effects n basically when we need to attend to multiple things at the same time el triazine can help us do that at least as it relates to memory when i say a tyrosine would i really mean is having your baseline levels of dopamine elevated can really help navigate multitasking environments especially as it relates to working memory in this is true under conditions of stress and under conditions of not stressful kin now you might say shall is not multitasking stress full itself yes it can be but when we talk about under conditions of stress were toga people who are sleep deprived were toil about people that are under other kinds of psychological or physical stress eltirasine can help in that contact as well as i mention be for in these studies they used very high dosages of el triazine high that ash do not recommend them they did measure stress hormones they did measure blood pressure and things of that sort but i want a caution you i do not recommend i we will say again i do not recommend following the dodges that were used in these two studies because they are exceedingly high they used one hundred milligrams perkilegram of bodyweight of tirade one hour prior to these cognate task now i way about two hundred twenty pounds on a little bit lighter than that that is a hundred kilograms approximately translated from this study that would mean that had i participated in the study and i was not in the posing group but i was in the a altirasine group i would have been given ten thousand milligrams of el triazine which is ten grams of eltirasine i do not recommend that in fact to there are papers showing that as little as five hundred milligrams but perhaps up to one gram that is a thousand milligrams or fifteen hundred milligrams of gram and a half of el triazine take in thirty to sixty minutes before a tonnage or physical task can increase baseline levels of dobbin for extended periods of time and thereby improve performance on those mental or physical tasks if you are somebody use interest in trying el tyrosine please know that the increases in baseline levels of dopamine can be substantial they are long lasting which qualifies them as base slung increases as post to peaks and i would say you should also start with the lowest possible dose for most people two hundred fifty to five hundred milligrams as going to be a reasonable starting dose depending on your bodyweight smaller people start with two hundred fifty larger may be five hundred keep it on whether not your combining it with affine or with any other stimulants and keep in mind that again the bigger the peak an dopamine the bigger the trough dopomean afterwards pay attention to whether not you experience a crash that same day or the next day but chances are if you are using or relatively low level of el triazine anywhere from two hundred fifty may be five hundred milligrams or a thousand milligrams of el triazine pair to cognate or physical work and takin early in the day by the way cause this contact as a bit of a stimulant they you are going to achieve these longlasting increases in baseline dopamine but please also keep in mine that i always always suggest that you engage in the proper behaviors and you disengage from the imp over behaviors as a first line of offense on any health got now how to set your baseline levels of dopamine at the highest possible level you of course want to guard that baseline level of dopamine very carefully for instance you want to avoid any kind of behaviors or substances that are going to peak your baseline level of dopamine very high or very sharply or if you do engage in those types of behaviors whatever they may be that you are well aware that your baseline level of dopamine will drop far below what it was after that peak has fallen you will be essentially in the quotenquo trough if however you find yourself in that trough you now have the knowledge to understand that that trough will resolve if you wait enough time that baseline level of dopamine that you are at prior to the peak will come back you will feel better however most people do not know that and as a consequence when they feel that low that is they feel kind of motivated maybe lie bit depressed may be a lot motivated or a lot depressed following some quotequo peak experience what they end up doing is thinking about what cause that peak experience and then go back and try to reengage in the behavior and trying regenerate that peak experience but you now know that that is a terrible strategy in fact that strategy will only lead to diminished peaks from the same experience it will lead to in many cases pursuing more and more intense experiences to try and recapitulate recreate that big peak which will not work or even worse people start stacking and combining different dopamine increasing behaviors in order to try and obtain something that initial peak when in fact all they need to do all you need to do is simply wait because the way that the dopamine circuitry is arranged is that it is not just about pleasure as it is about motivation desire pursuit and pleasure and it also has everything to do with pain and discomfort now when people hear the word pain they often think o painocaso a a physical pain or a intense emotional pain but to day work in a talk about pain a little bit differently were gin a talk about the pain associated with the trough and dopamine that occurs after a big peak and dopamine as a period in which pain and effort go hand in hand and ill return to this in a moment but i want you to just note that in your mind can we ear mark that in your mind because what we are about to talk about is how to leverage that pain and to use effort as a way to not just get out of the trough more quickly but actually to get back to a higher level of baseline as you eggs at that trough meanwhile i really want a harp on this one point that i made a moment ago which is that after some big experience it could be a vacation or a night out parting were the birth of a new tried all of these are well known phenomena that lead to troughs or deficits in dopamine after words which can cause a sort of postpartum depression postcard om depression is a phrase normally used to describe literally postpartum postbirth of a child depression and that has many causes not just related to dopamine baselines although it does involved opening baselines but it has hormonal aspects and other aspects as well but postpartum depression is also used to describe any time that our baseline dopamine has gone down waylay below what it was prior to some recent peak or exciting exhilarating win or behavior couple of things that one can do in order to get out of that trough more quickly the first one is simply to wait with the understanding that you will get out i know that sounds overly simplistic and be a titbit brutal but i think most people do not realize this they do not realize that the dopamine circuitry does take time to replenish and it has everything to do with restoring both the synthesis of dopamine as well as what is called the readily releasable pool of dopamine dopamine is package in these little spherical things that we call vesical those vesicle are released from the ends of nerves on in this case we are talking about the nerves that originate again in b t and uncles accummons and send their wires up to the prefrontal quarter and that is where dopamine is released and that readily releasable pool of dopamine takes time to replenish and that can take several days in order to replenish just knowing that can help you through that process and of course then it raises the question is there anything that you can do to accelerate that process and indeed there is and indeed this is what i consider not just something to get you out of a trench of and a lower mood an motivation but actually what represents the holy grail of motivation to day mom on a talk about this pain effort process as a very powerful way to get out of sticking points but more importantly to get into a mode where effort and reward can actually accelerate your progress along any path to any goal and in a way that you can do it repeatedly and this is not simply taking mechanisms from biology and painting names on them rather this is leveraging mechanisms in biology that are well defined in the animal and human literature that have parallels to the addiction and addiction recovery literature but that have been shown in specific circumstances to really allow people to engage in motivational pursuits in a variety of contact school relationships work et camera in an on going way and in a way that never depletes their baseline of dopamine to the point where they have to do a lot of extra work to get it back and in a way that allows them to be really motivated in a variety of contacts in an adaptive ways what were really talking about here is regardless of your genetics regardless of who your parents are which obviously you could not select being able to leveragour dopamine system in order to be maximum motivated when you want to be and indeed to avoid procrastination i to tell you about a classic experiment that have described once before on this pod cast but frankly this experiment is crucial i do not think they can be described enough this was an experiment that was done at stamford many years ago and involved children but it is actually ben repeated in adults they experiment involved observing a class from of young children these were kids about kindergarten age a little bit older and observing which activities kids to do in their free time their structure time where they had to these little kits re they play blocks or they had to om seeing or they had to write or the do what they could or have suppose draw their probably not a writing a significant prose of that age bat then they have free time where they cold do whatever they wanted and what the researchers did was observed the children who selected by their own choice to draw pictures there were some tables out with cans and markers and paper at camera and therefore some kids that would just naturally go to that activity every day cause they liked that activity and they measured how much of the free time these children elected to use their free time drawing doing these different art projects and then what they did was they started introducing rewards to these children they started putting a gold star ore in some cases a silver star on their pieces of ort work and telling them what a good job they did and the kids really liked that in fact who would not i there not only doing in activity that they but there also getting a reward for it see can probably see where this is all going but they were doing was they were increasing the amount of doomed that these children experience and again in parallel experiments done with adults you take adults who enjoy a particular activity you let them do activity and then you start rewarding them for that activity especially when you surprise them with a reward for an activity they already they report that being a much more pleasureful experience than had they just on the activity then what they did with these children and in the experiments with adults done later on was they cease giving them the reward and then they observed what percentage of their free time they spend doing that activity drawing and what they observed was you guessed it a drop in the total amount of time that the children elected to do this activity that initially they were doing quite a lot in other words there total satisfaction or desire or motivation to engage in this activity drop below what it was prior to ever receiving a reward and again this has been repeated in a variety of contacts and different populations different cultures different countries men women boys girls lots of different backgrounds to what this tells us is everything you already know which is that reward prediction error is not just about they desire to do something and you carrying it out and it being pretty good amazing or not good a i always to joke that the nervous system sort of codes things into three bins my can think about the sinters of food or any type of experience it can either be yum yes i really that yock i really do not that or me as kind of what the scenario led to where rewards were received for an activity that people already to do and then removed was that an activity that at one point was a yum becomes e much and that all reflects a drop and base line dopamine why because the activity that the children or adults combine with the gold star or the monitory reward or praise that children an adults seem to compounded to create a bigger per and dopamine and therefore a bigger trough in dopamine and if you are already wondering whether not their desire to engage in that activity eventually came back it did indeed especially what i described all matches precisely with dopamine reward prediction error and the fact that peaks and dopamine give rise to subsequent troughs and dopamine that if one waits long enough allow base lone levels of dopamine to return to normal and of course the amplitude of that dopamine peace has been varied by giving more money or less money and different scenarios nearly all the different deprivations of the experiments that you could imagine that map on to the dynamics of dopamine release that we have been talking about during this episode all played out exactly as one would have predicted based on the marry circuitry and the dynamics of dopamine i recommend that you leverage this knowledge to make sure that any activities that you enjoy to do whether or not you enjoy it a little or a lot but especially if you enjoy it a lot that you guard and protect by making sure that you do not start layering in or attaching reward or other sources of dopamine releasing behaviors or substances to that specific behavior or if you do that you do not do it terribly often now how often is terribly often will get to that in a moment but let me give you an example from my life just as an example but you will likely have and you will know people that will have different examples i love to exercise i know to some people i this might seem foreign but i love to exercise i love to do resistance training i love to run i am not one of those people that does not the experience of exercising but likes the feeling afterwards button quit i hear that a lot i i do not line to exercise but i love the way i feel afterwards i love physical training and i love the way i feel afterwards but i mostly love the feeling during i soft now why it's wire that way i cannot say that ism somebody who likes to do hard things across the board there plenty of difficult things in life that i dread or that ism sort of me about but for me hard exercise intense exercise of a particular kind resistance training and running in particular both give me a yum yes i love this kind of feeling and yes it persists for me quite along while afterwards both forsake of the way that it changes my narrow chemistry but also my sense of satisfaction but i just simply love it now years ago i discover that if i drink a cup of black coffee or an america or double espresso or some carbamate that my work outs can be quite a bit more intense i can run fourth er and then i also discovered that if i were to take a rework out energy drink or i took say three hundred milligrams of alpha p c and five hundred milligrams of fenalethelaming and perhaps even five hundred milligrams of eltirasine and perhaps did that alongside the canine in the bromate then yes absolutely i really those work outs i could beat a later in terms of focus i could exert even more effort put on some music and i could achieve invent better performance and then i also discovered that i could export that photo call of caring yeurbamate and very supplements to my cognitive work as when i was studying or waiting papers are writing grants or in the laboratory when i was doing experiments with my hands in those days we know cutting brain tissue in staining it and working really long hours and i discovered that all of those things all of those behaviors compounded with my love of exercise and my love of doing science and gave me these big peaks in what to me felt even important experiences they felt that unlike anything else they were just take in their nature which was great and it did indeed enhance my performance however while it did not created dependency for those different substances caffeine supplements et camera what i noticed was that in the days and sometimes weak ends afterwards even though for much of my career i confess have worked weekends as well but i would notice that it'd experience a real often energy i just would not feel that good and then if i kept up those behaviors consistently and i was consistently adding in these other lets just call them what they are dopamine releasing or stimulating behaviors and substances that my enthusiasm for physical training or running or for doing experiments actually started to diminish and this was really discouraging to me at the time because i started to think i cay may be ism burnt out maybe i have a renal burn out which by the way does not exist folks your dreams do not burn you there is something all to renal in sufficiency centrum you can over stimulate your system by way of too much a adrenalin up an effort and group an effort but that is a separate thing there is no such thing as a renal burn out person but i did not know that i thought cash really burnt out when in fact it is now obvious to me what i was doing i was combining too many dopamine releasing or stimulating behaviors in substances for things that i already enjoyed doing is behaviors namely exercise and doing experiments anything relate to science actually what this means is not to avoid taking things are doing things that amplify you amount of dopamine but to be very cautious about how often one does that and how many different dopamine stimulating behaviors or compounds one stacks especially in terms of taking those things are stacking those things in and around behaviors that you already really enjoyed doing i was essentially just creating another version of the kids in nursery school or first grade with the gold star experiment i was easily just doing the exact same thing and when i realize that and i changed my relationship to those compounds i did not eliminate them all together but i started realizing for instance that i did not need to double up on your borate and coffee every work out sometimes i would do one sometimes told do the other frankly i always do one or the other it is rare that i ever do any kind of physical training without some caffeine first and i do my physical training typical in the early part of the day we that is fine does not interfere with my sleep i might do hike without coffin but forme in await train or om in a run i tend to drink coffee beforehand or have your borate or if i occasionally meaning about once every third sometimes every other but usually about every third work out it'll take three hundred telegrams of alpha p c maybe occasionally maybe every third or forth work out and these are resistance work outs mind you not running it'll take five hundred milligrams of altirsine or more typically five hundred milligrams of final athelamine and very very rarely maybe once every two or three months i might stack all of those things together prior to a work out but of course ism always mindful to also include work outs or runs or bouts of cognitive work that could be grant writing prepping for pod was et camera where i do not do anything prior maybe just my affine because have baseline level of canine that i use each day the function many people there is a baseline level caffeine that just allows us to function if we are perpetual user of caffeine i talked a lot about this on the episode in caffeine but the key here is be cautious i would say be very cautious about stacking and layering in too many dopamine peak inducing behaviors all at once on a regular basis the key point here is if you are somebody that can engage in these intrinsically joyful activities for you these activities that you are really mote of aide to do whether not it skeg or playing music or dancing et camera without the need to layer in additional dopamine releasing mechanisms or compounds or activities well then i highly recommend you do that because then you are essentially making yourself one of those fortunate few that does not require additional stimulus and therefore can hold on to that pleasure can hold on to that intrinsic pleasure in motivation to engage in these behaviors over time which frankly there is no replacement for there is no pill or bottle or potion or motivational speech or podcast or book that can replace intrinsic motivation intrinsic motivation is perhaps the holy grail of all human endeavors and behaviors because it encompasses much of what brought us to this point in our species evolution and also what brings each in every one of us closer and closer to our goals and if it is happening with enjoyment without the need to lay er in additional tools well then you have really tapped in to the source and when i say the source i do not mean in and any kind of mystical way i think it is quite clear by now that when we hear about thee from eastern medicine or we talk about motivation drive in pursuit in on western nerbiological languages that relates to dopamine or we hereabout the source may be in my locust episode with on the one and only ricruben incredibly productive music proper whose as an just an unbelievable track record in terms of creative endeavors and he talks about the source we are really talking about the same thing which is this set of circuits within us that allow us to identify what we want and then lean into effort and then to do that in a persistent way that allows us to reach our goals and if we can do that with an intrinsic sense of pleasure will that is nothing short of magic but of course it is not magic its science and of course most people are not concerned about trying to protect the things they already enjoy in order to make sure that they can continue to do those things and enjoy them most people are thinking about how they can engage and pursue things that are less than pleasureful to them or how they can continue to engage in motivated behaviors when the going gets tough or and this is a big one i hear this over and over again as a request to cover on this podcast how people can overcome procrastination what we are going to talk about now is how the dynamics of dopamine release that you already are aware of plus an additional dynamic that we have not quite talked about can allow you to leverage dopamine in a way that really will bring you to the holy grail of motivation and drive which is when effort starts to become the reward itself in other words when friction becomes the reward i know that sounds crazy to some of you but when friction becomes the reward you can pass from an idea and a goal no matter how daunting to successful completion of that goal while experiencing what essentially will feel pleasure the entire time now that doesn't mean it will be bliss the entire time but what is very possible is to leverage the dynamics of both dopamine peaks and dopamine troughs in order to not just maintain your baseline level of dopamine but to also pull yourself out of any kind of procrastination were other kind of overthinking trenches very quickly and get back into a mode of pursuit how do we make effort the reward you may have heard about this in the context of call growth mine set growth mine set is the incredible discovery and research papers from my colleague doctor carol deck in the psychology department at stamford and there are others such as avid eager at the university of texts button who have leverage the called growth mine set as a tool that young people and adults alike can use in order to get better at anything and the basic contour of growth in set is to adopt the mine set that if you cannot do something or if you cannot do it well that you cannot do it or cannot do it well yet is that were yet that is really key and there are umber different tools in techniques that people used to adopt growth mind set but it is all starts with that relationship to not being able to do it yet now that all sounds pretty straightforward when you tell yourself but when we are in a performance contact when we expect ourselves to be able to motive at or when we expect ourselves to be able to perform and we cannot that often sets up a downward spiral of motivation because we are used to being attached to the relationship between desire motivation and outcomes reward predictionere we want something we want that a an class we want to learn how to answer we want to be able to do this a physical skill of another kind or learn a language or get the mate we desire or make the relationship work or make the business work on and on and then we get the outcome that we do not want and our confidence for lack of a betterward drops over time oftentimes that leads to situations where we are not motive it'd we are a motivated it can even lead to situations where we are downright depressed there is also circumstances where people myself included of course procrastinate we know we should do something but somehow we cannot get motive ate we know that we put in the effort will get there but we cannot do it either because we do not the activity or or just not feeling great now we could be quotenco not feeling great not feeling motive ate because our dooming base line is low and i absolutely encourage everybody to take a look at themselves t any time there in a a motivated state take a look at the landscape of their life not just at that moment but in the preceding days and weeks and ask whether r not you have been tending to those foundational things we talk about earlier whether not you are i engaging any other of the tools the we talked about early are to see if you can get into a motivated state however if all of those boxes are checked you answer yes ism doing all those things ism just not motivator ism just whatever easy n i just precrastany i i do not know i do not want to do tor ism not feeling motivated well then there is a very potent set of tools that you can leverage to overcome states of lack of motivation overcome procrastination and indeed can help you deal with things overthinking as it relates to procrastination and lack of motivation as well the way this works is the following if you recall a pike in dopamine is followed by a trough in dope that trough an dopamine is experienced as pain or wanting or craving that pain that ism referring to is actually a craving or a wanting and it is a craving or wanting for a specific state that you would to achieve that is different than the one that you are in you want to get out of that trough and as you recall from earlier in the episode that trough is the stimulus for the on going release of doom that provides the propeller the motivation to go forward and seek some goal when we are not motivated when we are in a called a motivated state or when we are procrastinating or when we just sort of cannot seem to get in gear the key to getting out of that pain trough is one of two things i already told earlier you can just wait can wait till your motivation comes back and a lot of people do wait in fact they procrastinate they start doing other things that are less painful then the state that they happen to begin when they are in a trying to get into gear to go work out s his realize not everyone wants to do that or to study or to have a hard conversations whatever it is and what are they do they start engaging in activities that we and indeed they would not consider pleasureful activities they start for instance cleaning the house seemingly out of nowhere they start engaging in these activities that normally are not intrinsically pleasureful for them they are not highly motivate to do them as a replacement for doing the very thing that they quotient need to do or ought to do and that their procrastinating to do but they are mentally doing here is a mild type of a diction replacement in other words rather than be in the painful state and wait for it to pass doing things that give them some sense of accomplishment ostensibly to give them the sense that their completing things and perhaps and i do not know because ism not am in the psychology of knowing what other people are thinking perhaps in order to generate the momentum in order to get engaged enough for motivated enough to study or work out or whatever activity t is that they are trying to avoid through procrastination now what is interesting about this dynamic is first of all it is extremely common and second of all a lot of people we use this as a tactic that they get very close to the dead line to complete something and then they go into a sort of pseudo panic and then use anxiety as a way to leverage their mental an physical resources to complete that thing how do i know the contour of the well how do i understand the inner dynamics of it hell part that relates to my work is an aurobiologists and reading the papers that it'll mention you in a moment but it also relates to the fact that ism somebody whowaits quite a while right up until the lass minute possible to complete something for activities that i do not want to do something have been working on my whole life in any case ism very familiar with the procrastination process how can we overcome procrastinationwiell it turns out that there findings from within the edition literature that turn out to be very powerful towards leveraging our way out of procrastination and it has to do with this you already know because have told you probably dozen times now that the depth of the trough after a opening peak is proportional to how high that peak was and how steep it was how quickly that peak occurred it turns out that not only is the depth of the trough proportional to that but the rate at which you get out of that trough is proportional to how steep that trough is let me explain this for you in as clear terms as i possibly can imagine you are in an motive ate state you are just not feeling motive it you are procrastinating you may think of the thing to do here is something it'll clean the house it'll take care some bills it'll do something or it'll just wait those approaches as we talk about before generally do not work or at least do not work quickly or they lead you right up to the dead line and that is the dead line that forces you to get something done or you just do not get it done and you do not succeed in your goal that happens a lot as well however if you were to take that state of being unmotivated a procrastinating an actually do something that is harder than being in that motivated state in other words doing something that is more effortful even painful you can rebound yourself out of that dopamean trough much more quickly what do i mean you want to put yourself in a state that is worse than or harder than the state that you are in or do something conoquot more painful and here i want to be very clear it'll say this three times but i must say it for the first time now when i says more painful i do not mean doing any kind of tissue damaging or psychologically damaging behavior or anything of that sort that is going to render you injured or not well even in the short tern that is not what ism referring to as just get that one out of the way what ism referring to is the fact that for instance if you are feeling a motive ate but you find yourself cleaning the house as a way to procrastinate you count say will cleaning the house is harder than sitting down and doing nothing but actually in that moment or in those moments that is not the case or else you would not be doing it the reality is that the dopa mean system works according to what feels hard or easy in the moment in other words if you are feeling a motivated you need to do something and put yourself into a state that is harder than the state you are in for instance if you are sitting around feeling a motive actor you find yourself tending to task that are irrelevant to the goal that you really should be focussed on you need to put your body and mind into a state of discomfort quickly and the way to do that is to either engage in some tangential activity meaning an activity not related to your goal that puts your body into a very different state here again it'll default to the obvious one which is something cold shower or cold immersion which not only increases dopamine long term or over several hours rather but for most people is experienced as pain that pain causes a rebound out of that damn trough faster than it would occur if you had just state in that among ate state and waited for it to go away or done something cleaning up that for whatever reason felt it required less friction when i say friction i mean him big friction your limbic system is always in this dialogue with your forebrain and limit friction goes two ways limit friction can be you are tired in you do not want to do something and you have to quoting duo motive ate to do it energize yourself to do it or limbic friction can be that you are nervous and scared and anxious to do something and you after calm yourself in order to lean forward into action in order to do that thing despite the anxiety i realize this can be a little bit confusing as a concepts i want to going to a bit more detail let us imagine that you or somebody else does not to exercise you do not want exercising your trying to get your minimum o five days for weak exercise and you are just not motivated to do it there are couple different techniques to doing this assuming you have taking care of all the baseline stuff a the foundational sty we talked about earlier and you are just not getting in gear and you find yourself you'd checking your one or may be pretending to some tasks obviously those things are quoting go easier for you meaning they cause less limbic friction then engaging in exercise the typical advice would be just exercise for one minute o a just get one men of exercise or five minutes and then use the successful completion of that one or five minutes as a milestone that allows you to then move to the next milestone and indeed that approach can work and it is exactly what ism describing here when i say that you are in a state of lack of motivation or procrastination or both and you need to put yourself in two a more painful not less painful state what you do it you push up against that friction and you exercise for a short while and then that pops you out of that trough that is possible but for a lot of people even that will not be possible because they just cannot get motive actor they do that one men or five minutes an their cilice okay still in the trough ism not actually feeling that great in those circumstances it make sense to do something that is tangential to the whole path the your trying to pursue this goal that you are trying to pursue that is believe it are not much worse than just being a motivated and when i say worse i do not mean picking some task that normally you do not to do but now you are willing to do i mean literally thinking about what would be worse than being in this state again without causing yourself tissue or psychological damage what would be worse well cold water would be worse for many people very cold water the key is to figure out something that for lack of a better way to put it really socks really socks and yet is safe and by doing that you steep in the trough you steep in the slope of the trough which we know brings you back to your baseline level of dopa mean more quickly now for some people that will be deliberate cold exposure through cold shower ice bath and i have to tell you that if your cringing as i say this well then there you go you now have a tool that you cringe even when you just think about and therefore represents a great tool for you if ism procrastinating to do some no i really need to do should i just simply wait for that procrastination to evaporate no will it eventually evaporate maybe will at deadline eventually surface that will trigger me an to and anxious or activated state that will allow me to complete what needs to be done maybe hopefully but better would be to get out of that motivated state that state of procrastination quickly and to do you need to leverage something that is painful for instance i heard a beautiful lecture recently on by doctor onolempki at starwort school of medicine discussing dopamine and some of the things in her book and some newer findings as well and somebody in the audience asked for the question does meditation increase doom now early are we talked about how only deep rest in yeogonedra has been shown in the scientific literature to increased opening but i also mention earlier that classic forms of meditation whether eyes open our eyes closed called open monitoring or closed mongering meditation sitting there lying there an focussing does not increase opening levels person however for most people specially people who find it hard to meditate or who do not do that practice very often meditation is effortful getting into meditation and staying in meditation is effortful if you find yourself in a state of procrastination oftentimes a brief five to ten minute meditation where you absolutely do not allow yourself to do anything besides close your eyes focus on your breath and when your mind drifts get back to your breath is not only extremely difficult an extremely frustrating unless you are well practiced meditator but it is often difficult and frustrating not just to do but to get into that practice and not just to get into that practice but to the maintain that practice for that mere five to ten minutes because it is just not a natural state for us to be in we have to force ourselves it is effortful in factoid it qualifies as a basically available almost anywhere any time type of effortful activity that if you dislike it perhaps even as much as some people dislike deliberate cold exposure will then perfect you now have an additional tool in your kit that you can use any time you are feeling motivated and procrastinating now there are numerous examples i could give and hopefully there are numerous examples that you are thinking about the key is to have a short list of about five different effortful each a a painful activities that you can employ any time you are feeling motivated or in a state of procrastination keeping in mind that the goal is not what you accomplish inside of that activity although it is important tat you actually engage in that active a had to make myself meditate in that five to ten minute will bout of effortful or painful activity but it is not about achieving an outcome it is about forcing your body in mind into a deeper state of pain and discomfort in other words taking yourself from that trough that you are already in and steepening and deepening that trough because in steepening and deepening that trough we know that the return from that trough to normal and even elevated levels of baseline dopamine is going to be faster and more robust and in doing that you will quickly find yourselves back into a mode of add state because not only does it teach you that doing hard things is possible that sort of it more of a subjective cognitive learning but it actually taps in to the very narrow chemical system that allows you to then feel motivated and capable to pursue the larger goal which is the thing you are really concerned about after all as is often the case perhaps always the case on this podcast we covered a lot of material we cover dopamine and what it is we talked about the circuitry and the different kinds of circuitry focussing mainly on this mess cortical pathway that is vitally important to motivation for any goals talked about the relationship between peaks and troughs and base lines and the foundational tools that allow us to set and maintain a healthy baseline level of dopamine as well as waste to protect that base line level of dopamine and we talked about how to get ourselves out of states of procrastination and motivation by not just waiting out those troughs in dooming but actually making those troughs an dopamine steeper by engaging in things that are effortful and things that we really do not want to do in those moments provided that those things are safe we can get out of those dopamine troughs more quickly and back to our dooming base line or even above base line and we talked about what i really view as the holy grail of motivation which is to be able to learn to attach reward to the effort process itself and to do by not just understanding but also learning to subjectively recognize and somatically experience release of these different stressful chemicals within our body i realize this was a lot of information and yet throughout have tried to highlight tools that you can use that range from behavioral to nutritional supplementation tools connive tools

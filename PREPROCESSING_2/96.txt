jobidon builds miles wall along the southern border even as he attempts to deny it will make any difference at all chaos continues among re publicans seeking an hew speaker and the aft the launch is a new effort to target true followers ism bencher this is the benchbirreau so the benshpir showsponser bexpressivepana privacy is right not a privilege to fend your rights at expression piano come lash men department of home land security secretarial a honor mayor's on wednesday waved twenty six different federal waws that actually allowed him to build border wall in south texts apparently among the twenty six waws the de just weaved according national view that includes the clean air active drinking water actin in angered species act theprogect will be tweeted by congressional appropriations package from fiscal you twenty nineteen it is amber tons of wall but it is some walls twenty miles of wall along the border an star county texts that is an area experiencing higlegl entry the began administration has acknowledged tot this was necessary they put fora to statement saying as much suggesting that this is the way that this was going to go that basically we need the wall if you do not have the walls can be very difficult for us to secure the border this of course great the major con drum because jobidon suggested during the twenty then y race that walls are bad they are in effective they are useless and infant the idea of the trump wall was incredibly bad races terrible is why you had of general cost quarters during the trump administration jetting on down to the southern border to hang around empty parking lots and fake cry into the camera over over offense this is why you had the entire media shrieking and crying about the idea of dona tromp building more borderwall the is why just a few weeks ago you had judges who are stepping in to prevent the governor of texts great abbot from putting bodies in themiddle of the red ground prevent people from legally attempting to cross that border well now they have flight now they've flip again it is not all that long ago they were saying all the sort of stuff the as as of twenty twenty one correnjon pier was saying on behalf of this administration that walls do not work the also see work present are as as we have said that ta i i have to look at the the a comments i have not want tums i what to measure i read it with in contact abut we have take d about the border wall here in in general as as a way a that the it is been seen in to to get to to close the border and we feel that it is a policy that doesn't work and is not just us ait experts has said that the borderwall is not a it is not an effective policy that was the administration just a couple of years ago what changed well turns out millions people have crossed the southern border under jobiton and they are all going up to northern cities blue cities new york chico and turns out that people in those blue cities do not it very much you got governors catchy local in new york calling out the but administration you've the governor of illinois baby spritzer and the mayor abandon johns of chico calling for jobidon fix this thing here they were just a couple of days ago we have to have better coronation with every sting love of government and that fluids the state of taxes there are other things the federated can to other than sending es money but they have not yet done e no letter to presidenbidon asking for more help governor fritters was the crisis he is overwhelming the state in the city's ability to provide aid it will all of this has driven the bide administration into some dose of reality or least it did briefly there is a brief moment in time just a couple of days ago and it appeared t the by administration might be shocked into reality maybe to stop the overwhelming lot of leglipmigrans at the border may or a send an an official filing in the federal registers is just a couple of days go quote there is presently and acute an immediate need to construct physical barriers and roads in the vicinity of the border of the united states in order to prevent unlawful entries into the united states in the projugareas in order to insure the expeditious construction of the barriers and roads in the projugareas i have determined that it is necessary exercise at the authority vested a me by section one or to we of the i i r i r a he is out you waive regulations and or t make this sort of thing happened but then tokenism shaped back into place a mousetrap there is no way the by administration was can be able to flip this dramatically after claiming that dona trumpleton evil human rites violator for attempting to build borderwall and yesterday join the defunct president of the united states suggested that actually the bordereau will not work which raise the questions t why then they are building it but e says guys guys its its to lock on a work to i did not change my mind is lock on work which is building it cause we have to build it which is weird since you had to wave twenty six regulations in order to build it here is join yesterday then why are you doing it i you doing it the answer is that he is doing it because he also knows that the consequence if not doing it are really bad politically but he still has to please his left wing at bases he has created a situation which he is caught between rock and hardplace is a catch twenty two for him and the same with the crime policy a catch twenty to if crime goes out a control looks really bad for his administration if he anymore cops to the streets it also looks really bad for his administration left wing policy is a failure when you pursuit to its logical conclusion which is an open border in this particular case people do not it very much and then you hae to back track and that he will yellow you for back tracking an this wat jobidon does not want to what exactly is jobidins excuse for having spent the money to actually build wall he says the money was appropriated he have to spend it which again is weird from a president of the united states who unilaterally declared himself the ability to relieve student longest to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars for example but when it comes to money located for border wall hunting suddenly like right now he dis covered the actually has to spend money those appropriated in twenty nineteen strange p trionwut i mean you could theoretically you could say we couldn't wave the regulation sorry i that be the eyes easy way to do it they literally had to wave regulations in or to make this happen they could have made the case secretary mayoricus easily could not made the case got i want to seen the money but the regulations prevent me from spending money because obviously a be invitation of life i did spend ma not doing that he is building the walls the one haven't both ways again tho one build the wall claim the wall does nothing they can simultaneously claim there doing something stop the borderflow and also claim to all f their left wing buddies that actually they still agree with themselves when they took the moronic position that walls do nothing which of course is silly of course walls do something you wouldn't have a giant fence around the white house if walls did nothing means it is it is it is an argument that is beneath contempt that walls do nothing of course walls do something they have for all of human history stupid hell get to more on this just one second first company is looking out for

slash sh assure wireless four america by america a case o all under my orcas was then caught off hard by the fact that his own administration under cut him originally he said we need the wall because we have a big pop on the border then because tolidine decided that he was going to maintain the position that they do not need the wall and walls are bad he had to walk it back here is mayoricas yesterday walking it back to do not this ad ministration is made clear that a boarder wall is not the answer that remains our position an our position that is never waver the language in the federal register notice is being taken out of contact an it does not signify any change in policy whatsoever always missing context is it the power you explicitly said that there iran immediate need to build border wall this follows hard on maracas claiming that was not actually border wall thetas actually just construction along the borderwhat they building a castle well ad ministry half course what it what exactly as it was what would you call the thing that you are building that is a wall it it is all idiot and they are assuming your more on me green whom pierce a gain wildly on talent to pass secretaries to shows ask what why is it the you want a break you es all in order to put up the wall and the claim tat the walls does not does not do anything and she has no answer for this obviously austere is no answer cause it it is really dumb the wallinstruc e in mi striation voting chin what ye want us to mat the is that wet york they want us to not comply with the law i only why win ta not grin to ye wants tan tot be ministrations that follow i r wo all e ti is to on the to on for is program you wen to pore to it for that this i much a to going twenty mile waw why not miss to poor we win to congress the congress appropriates e finding why congress thathongres a prorates to fix we ask ton the not use that unit an that particular purpose they denied it and now we are complying with the law you have to go o water a buy to tin he to for o wan to tortes ton erenow i not gat an to hypotheticals from here ism just telling you whet i can tell you from here the facts are that w d chest is complying with the la this is from disco yer is wish underpisco er twenty nineteen under republican leadership an d a chest is replying to do this the president astmultipal times of congress to appropriate they did not and were not complying by the lo thanks everybody much legal compliance from this administration i mean that if there is one thing we know about this administration they love complying with be separation of powers in which congress passes a law another president signs in the president abides by that legislation that is something this administration absolutely adore they would never do anything you knolaterlly say i know tell cha to cram down a van mandate on eighty million america they would never do anything that after all the power of the legislature controls what cha can and cannot do and that is not in the enabling legislation obviously they would follow the law he mean i they would never try to twist the laws relive hundreds of billions of dollars of student loved at just get rid of it in that they follow the law clearly and just just they are right here there is an appropriation to build the wall and that just following the law by building the all even if they think it is useless because that is just what sticklers these people are for the law or they are completely photograph they are completely vograp we all know that they are full of grab but this is the problem when you take positions the are counter logic and decency and then the effects of those those policies come to fruition you've that somehow mitigate against your on policies the reason this is happening is very obvious you got people in new york and people in chico and people in californium and people all over the left wing the big cities biblucities are complaining about jo bisons illegal emigration probe there is a reason by the way that your bid is doing this and that is because his poll numbers absolutely stink his poll numbers on emigration are bent they are not just under water they're wildly under water i mean insanely under water your batons approval embers on migration a twenty per cent yes the do something but a the same time he isn't want to ticket off that left wing base what is amazing to me is that he is attached to the left hem base why are they n gal vote for dona trump obviously not i there to stay home of trump is on the ballet obviously not but he feels the necessity you really does to actor set active space in who is that active i space is not black people in america major cities who are overwhelmingly in favor of less he legal migration is i listens in america were overwhelmingly in favor of less illegal migration it is woke white liberals living in upper class suburbs whoever have the guilt the consequence is in theminningo ship to earth's vineyards then then all the sudden they are starting to freak out and and and complain but until then they are very happy o put their consigns the rut signaling mansions a man that the democratic panic policy is disasterarea an an republicans could point that out if they were not in themiddle of a speakership battle which they declared on themselves because that that is definitely the best way to fight a war is if born the middle of a of a of a battle a political battle with the other side the best thing to do his immediately go into an interfacing war with your own side it it

playing war on themselves over whether to build a border wall or not the the republicans are declaring war on themselves with regard to this speakership battle in a fascinating new twist to the speakership battle apparently the republicans are now going to hold a speakership debate apparently televised which i say all right i here is my objection to this my only object ism all for transparency but who republicans alike in a closed canvas to lead their cakes really should not be a a matter of public scrutiny nearly as much as you voting free to local congress person the reason i say this is because how the sausage gets made is very different then how people tell you the sausage gets made on talk radio and on talk grate what i do for living i main to give you the purest most conservative perspective because that is what i get to do i mam ism lucky to don't have to make the sausage but behind the closed doors obvious there is wearing and dealing trades get made but the problem is that incentive structure s completely scene you can i should get the deal done you cannot elect to speaker unless there is some deals that are eating made behind closed doors and this is for example is one of the problems with the republican fight against year marks or years an yours in yours republicans have said quite correctly on principal barracks are really bad they are they're really bad your marks o the system whereby there is a bill it is coming through and i attached a rider fry district and i say ism only going to vote in favor of the spill if you build the benshippereo post office in my district man's really bad because if everybody does that yo and of spending lot of money the problem is if nobody does that don't pass any bills and you in e thy giant omnibus package that only get support because the giant crap sand which anyway usually a larger crapsandwhich then would have been attained with a few simple ears and gain the sausage making process is really ugly televising all of that are not that is that is gray won prolonging the speaker chaos i suppose because you are gin to and up with a a segment that is very proachim jordan you n not up with a segment that is very prove heaven hern for example you will this is what is going to happen because it is not as though any one of these candidates is completely dominate the three big candidates would ben mention at this point or steveskillys him jordan and republican study committee chair even hern of oclohoma apparently a corn punctual news fox news bet bare is gin a host a closed it debate and discussion between the people candidates for speaker on money night according to a force involved with the planning and then later it came out apparently there's are on televise that which a it is can be air if you are running for speaker of the house now you are basically kind of running for president right not not formally but you are getting in front of the america people on the republican base and showing who has most fealty to conservative principles the problem is that you can show that fealty but the system constrains you from actually achieving those gulls you make the biggest promising promise o everything o everybody two minute from now ever n we real disappointed when we hit the end of the continuing resolution and somebody cuts to deal which is exactly what is going to happen as we all know anywhere publicans are gin a host that candidate form tuesday night and the close party election on wednesday there is no timeline for electing a speaker on the house floor this thing is publican continue for a number of days donate trump for his part he a after originally recommending rev my earthy for the post my earthy was very pro trump and then doing nothing to stop coven earthy from falling donate trump then mum apparently started sharing posts on truth social pitching himself as the speaker and calling coven my earthy a traitor which is as always no one is more loyal than present the moss in an animas donate trump is now in horsing him jordan for speaker just find i really him jordan i think he is terrific the had of the house oversize committee at and i know i am wants this job the terrible job but him jordan is an excellent candidate he is one o the founders the use freedom calk's he is extremely conservative across the board and as far as trump goes to big trump backer now the problem is of course were also in the middle of an open primary inside the republican party while trump is way in front in that primary hes still represents about half of the republican part y and the other half the re publican party is split among a myriad of candidates jo trumps horseman he is not sure to guarantee that somehow jordan becomes the guy especially because there is a whole wing of moderates in h party who may not be in love with him join rev my earthy people ripped him for not having centralizing principles and to a certain ex went there some truth to that because he is a consummate politician any kind o have to be in or to be speaker of the house and broke or some sort of a agreement between all these district groups yet cannot really be a guy who has sort of hard and fast principles unless you can be a dictator new gingrice was very early on when he was speaker of the house an than he ended up being defend a strained anyway after a certain point being a idealist in being speaker of the house are usually not things that go together this is why wish mac canal's a very effective see at majority leader but not the most ideological politician usually these two things are in conflict if don't be per circularly effective is legislature as legislator usually that means not being a purist in any case him jordan is more of a purist that a lot of people in moderate district in new york maybe who might not love him jordan steveskallees is considered again sort of the party favorite in the sense that he is not coming in from the outside he was a second n command two even my earthy the heart can ferns about steveskillees there is now been some talk believe for not about trick mac henry possibly not because trick c henry actually has a lot of asking but because he is the speaker protest sort just sitting there already in order for any sort of speakership vote to happen the big thing that is cannot have to happen is their going to have to change the motion two they cate rule the motion vacate rule which is a confession made by key my earthy two the mackateswing o the party was that he would allow any one unlike a single person to bring a motion to vacate the chair if they did not likewhat he was doing an that basically set the stage for him being used an n any point because h has very very narrow house majority all it took was basely five re publicans voting against him and he would lose his speakership even if the other ninety seven person the calk's was in favor of ken my martian in fact that is what happen in order for any new speaker to be elected and the have any power at all than motion to vacate is going to have to be changed an corn punchball that is exactly woulds happening forty five house re publicans including several power players to brittle letter to the conference effectively to landing changes the motion to vacate rule that cost earthy his job a few members who sign the s letters tax they are not willing to indorse anybody for speaker until the motion o vacate is overhauled those names include represent of seen bice woke loholma dusty johns of south to coat represent brinfit is trick of pennsylvania her graves of louisiana for an affairs at committee char mite my caul of texts and ways an means committed chum mason smith o missouri against a big faction it is forty five people there is even some talk to my earthy right get a second go round here although i think that that is very unlikely aft this point meanwhile the question is wether any of these people over can be able to was lot o money steevescolese has he is raised about a hundred seventy million dollars to support various re publicans over the last decade screes raised more in last cycle fifty three million than jordan raised over the last debate thirty eight million that is can be a major concern again being speaker o the house is not the same is being i most idea logically pure usually it is the gin cut deals and get get people elected but this is a a pretty significant mass well get into more of that massing just one second first look at the we that light is trimming in near homeright now when i bought my home in flora one of teething that mattered most moves have him into the home because honestly it is too dark in my house i cannot stand it and that meant i took a look to window

save up to fifty percents it we pussy doorbusters it is one their biggest tables of the year get up to fifty percent off at blinds tot come when chick out on line do not forget to tell them you heard about blinds to come from the kinship were o show rules and restrictions may apply gat as you ben saying in order for any speaker to be able to run the house you can have to have some level of authority over the members of his own caucus is what representative johns was saying dusty johnsonseuf to potty saying and we got a bunch of foundational problems here and if we do not fix those before a new speaker is named there is just on ta continue let me just lay it out there cut to the chase who you with in the speaker battle o no then in by yo i make we a we candid yes sir i why we can we do not change yo d yo ho we can r ha s it us going me to san stupid come care there drawer i mean an that is correct if if these rules happens wo not grand the the speaker enough power to actually keep his callus in line tour not getting anything done obviously to have to be consequences for stepping out of line it is very funny me that live people are very happy i cop mac carthto getting ousted ire lot of the same people ware very upset at at rogues john my cane in in the united statestenant i agree with them about john my karat the whole point as you cannot actually pass anything unless you keep your majority in line and if you remove all the consequences that are available to keep people in line they will not stay in line you have a collective action problem representing maxmiller re publican of oho he says doesn't if we keep fightingeach other here ism not hope for even can be able keep the majority om the stand here and tell you by the actions of to taken place this week ism not hopeful to keep the majority ism not hopeful the one about the senate you do not i spoke to president trunk three times yesterday and i explain to him hat there could be a coalition government that would happen and throughout that process we would lose in the house of representatives what a trump say when you told him all the set is incredibly upset this is writ love to get to my point i knew about mandates using them magnet cook to to go ahead and the postcontannot twitter with no contact to make it seem as if he has president trumps support and he pates it and the most broad strokes possible that is why he good at what he does is because he is a is harvest ill gate markets trying if i back an that perception by doing something that i will say is is clever he is saying of cat ism good to negotiate on motion vacate he says my yo be college one raise the threshold on the motion vacate there is a question for them if we enact or forms to laid out by re preventive roman who democrat from californium nice gun have interviewed to before how high would you the emtevo threshold to be it'll basically give you whatever you want for this stuff what it what what exactly is that stuff a ban on congressional stoctratning which makes tons to me put everything into into a blind trust make some sort of consequent you cant involve course in it twelve your termlinet for congress and a ban on political donations from lobby's or ask now we know that this is going power i take those last tut things are going nowhere and the reasonthaes a going nowhere is because they a bunch people sitting in congress my now far beyond the twelve your termlinet judo not open up a bunch of safe districts republicans to challenge there is that as far as the man on political nations from lobby's or packs ism ism just wondering if republicans enact that and democrats do not how is tackling to work out shes saying he is gan a change the the motion to vacate rules if there is a ban on political donations from lobby's or packs for whom for just re publicans he is that seems shooting yourself to erectly in the face again ism ism perfectly willing to here packages his list of demands but if the idea is that all lobbyists and packdonations noway by by thewy all a packdonation is that that is a a groupie people who get togetherand they put together re political actions on committee and then they and they spend money on behalf of a candidate if republicans take that off the table and the they let democrats do it how exactly that advantageous republicans attempting to win i just lobbyists is not as much as the next my but but the notion that democrats are gin a continue doing this an republic doing it a stop doing this if put you an inherent disadvantage electorally our democrats can vote to do this over all and how exactly with that tie in to republican at tends to get a speaker to to push that what packages is are to shown is that republicans can push stuff and if democrats do not go along with it packages blames the republicans to any way he did this with regard to word security he literally got up the other a mouse you guy say that you pass a harshbord secure the regiment why did not we that become was right was there's a democratic senate and a democratic president and both those people both those those institutions continue to maintain that walls not do things i do not understand if machetes once o put for d a list the actual like achievable things that do not actively damage the re publican parties ability to be democrats ism happy to hear it i said this before with chippy was doing this against get monarchy which he did earlier in the year and then he names bunch concessions ism all in favor that that is fine but if these concessions are non durable concessions the democrats take ad manage of ism hotspur how that exactly is a big win and how it is not exactly posturing an get all this puts whoever is running for speaker in in a pretty major jam here because for example him cordon he has come for id and he says we are not on to go to a vote with out to eighteen mi begin to need two eighteen in order go for d with about when ism an have vote on the speaker to have alreadyeside behind close or us speaker it has the hap we should not go to the housework till we have two hundred eighteen lots for the spider of the united states house to re presentative we should not have to go through what we did back in canary ism all for that i think i can bring our theme to gather to accomplish that and more importantly once we get that done to do the work that ne it is to be done on the border on coin on and plain on all these issues we have to address i think i can do that that is why the caterer me under what conditions is the big question under what conditions what actually get's hammered out here is going to find whether the custom my earthy was good or bad yet i seems there is no plan in ousting mac earthy maybe dens up o k anyway already scrambles the and of coming with some sort of agreement if that that is the case thin credit to gat but if it does not end up that way if its just our chaos or if we ans up back in the same situation with an incredibly weak speaker unable to keep his own people in line then democrats are going to win because again if you look as though you are running a clown car people will vote for democrats even if their policies are absolute sher garbage though the one good piece of news were is the dona trump who speculating just a a few moments to go about possibly running for speaker himself lysis stop that nonsense that that due ism not even shut wet people were con sideling that there an active house rule right now on the re publicanside that ifyoure under an active indightman you cannot be house speaker a drums under multiple active indictments right now that ut if had changed the told an super awkward i know who thought the trump had the skill set to be speaker of the house anyway would in very strange i but dome at least that is off the table when trump indorse is jordan good for trump for endorsing somebody at this point one the ways can tell the ordains good candidate is how much lift takes him sunny host of the view she says the him jordan is a terrorist literally a terrorist why is yo strapping dona might to himself now he was mean or one time i will just say about enjoin and i he has been called by his own party by giant john banner a political terrorist he is also been link to the oho sat sexual the be scandal i testify in front o congress about something simple cameras and court rums he came in late he look de sealed and he immediately was screaming and calling and terrorized to me and be of their experts on the panel and describing him as a terrorist as exactly that he is a chaos agent and it came out of nowhere and he had no command of the subject that we were talking about which adit evenscarriou to have ha the thought of i being thespeaker of the house i thinkers to more chaos at his won model as towel truck as no command of the language y that o gas joy bay hard ripping people for for last of command of the english language ans a watching a dog try to explain to to a human no how language ought to work you are mostly just amaze the dog can speak english to the sonic jo joy p you ripping people for command the english i wish good stuff right there again that is the singles case forage i jordan have heard now there is the awkward thing heres the awkward thing whatever deal gets cut the republican party is going to halftone now actually re establish itself as a party o spent the last fifteen years in the republican party ripping power away from the people of the top of the republican party that as come with a couple of benefits and some pretty significant clos the benefits are that the republican party has gotten more right wing or least it did briefly when it came to for example spending the tea party movement which i thought was terrific outs of part of it call in congress to actually bushbuck on spending the problem is that when you take away the leadership of the institutions and you simply destroy them and you say that petty much everyyou create a roiling boiling pot inside for example the republican party and therepublican party inferstructre has no power to actually dictates well that point what you went up with sendlessto get endless cause yet it is of on you re publicans look at nancy policy on the one hand with thee in biting hatred for her policy and on the other hand with a bit of admiration for the fact that she is kept her caucus together mho say this all the time nancy polls is obviously hooded her job she'd fractious caucus she kept it together how because she crammed down on them she said listen ism not on give you money ism to fine people the primary you ism no threaten your committee memberships ism in a run this place a dictatorship this not a democracy this not a group of people getting together at late night at the club and figuring things out with comedy this is me running the place and you cannot have it both ways either you want to fight nancy policy which requires natural consolidation or power around institutions with leadership or you want argue amongst yourselves in the name of principle andthn lose to people nancy policy which is why they are going to have to be some sort of tools tat are put in the hands of the house leadership that are going to a low punishment for the members now right now i understand emery's running for speaker and at the moment it is going be all of them basically appealing to the better angels of nature its o you have him join or example defending machetes from the calls for expulsion here been some members the republican caucus have said t what he did here is ridiculous that should expel hem from the caucus i do not think you expel hem from the caucaswhen you've a forget majority but the the basic notion here that going forward the leadership in ship we will not have the tools to punish people how exactly cooperated them hagsoutan operated right now one of people is coming under even greater fire than vacates in some ways is an nancy mace she join for no reason any one can explain seven hard liners in busting my earthy she is at best a moderaterepublican reticular my on on abortion its shocked everybody when she joined to to just my earthy are goring to political my earthy and makes noisy need aye but he californium republican had help maces secure her seat in congress by pumping millions of dollars ans her one struggling campaign maces move to aggressively funerals off or her vote to ball my earthy is only intensifying her colly to angers towards her for maces the auntie carthyvote mad prove a purposeful step and a commilionic career that tardy senor swing repeatedly between trump centric conservative and establishment

tuff he says that the possibility of of avoiding a hard landing here is really really decreasing pretty significantly he has a piece over the financial times pointing this out he says the economy is likely weaken as markets internalize the significant likelihood that rate will stay higher for longer he says an intense period of rising interstates high oil prices in a stronger dollar is pushing the financial market condenses an nuts economic growth away from the comforting notion of off landing by my count is be the sixth time in the past fifteen minds that con venational is do shifts for the world's most influential economy hat to pivot that unfortunately is likely to stick for longer this time around threatening what has been an impressively strongest economy undermining genuine e financial stability and exporting volatility to the rest of the world in just the last two weeks the yield on the bench market you as tenor bond has risen by some a zero point five prersentace points around four point eight per cents as part of a comprehends of shift in the entire intrestrat structure the move brought the changing yields the an i popping one per centare points since the end of tune leading to higher borrowing rates for companies or burn some cartons for households more pronounce n on even toe posit outflows from the banking system as in festers shift cash into money market accounts notably the cost of a thirty mortgage is up to eight per cent making already exspentstive home purchases even less affordable pushing yields up and increasingly disorderly manner is a combination of markets recognizing that the higher pols rate see by the fad will be here for a while and the need to absorb a significant supply of treasury bonds do to large budgetary deposit plaster's high oil prices these are developments that the economy and markets do not in way they damp growth the increase the threat of stag elation and that continues to be serious threat there is a jobs report that a first glance looks really really nice a drop's report in september that showed three hundred and thirty six thousand chops ate butt if the idea was that the economy is over heated and we spent too much money and that the economy is to be cooled then adding therein an thirty six thousand jobs that is a very high rate and doing that without really increasing the labor force participation right in any serious way which just means that now basically the same percentage people are in the labor force were in the labor for before do continuing that sort of thing is not going to lead the federal reserve to lower interstates tor can increase interstates again according to a my news being a little optimistic at possible the cooling of paygrowth may help reassure the was in elation fighters for scrutinizing every scrap of dated to determined whether to rase their curate again this year still the outsides job growth may stoke carries the economy willexspand two fast from elation to cool if they think if people think by the way that the rates are going go up on bonds for example what is that to it traps the on yield up the price on the bond that we have already released in the market is going to go down as those bond yields increase that means eventually peeping in a shift their money out of stepson into these very high yield bonds when they do that the stock market is going to stagnate already earnings are threatened again we are we are in a a really tenter hook situation on the economy what shall by an i think might be waiting for here franklins for republicans to shut town the government he is the shut down the government least can blame his failing a con mean somebody who is not him is just another reason why re publicans need to be smart and strategic about this sort of stuff as supposed to grand standing and and creating a new speaker who has no power to actually cudgel's own members in a line because what is be real about this the idea the your compass a party line budget without any ability to cudgelanear own members into line that can be a very difficult thing to do particularly the face of a democratic sentence and meanwhile killer canton in she just comes out of h would recovery offend to really reck america politics further i do not know why she's still on on items but she is she has now called for the formal deprogramming of magamembers they are in a cult you see if your democrat and you coltishly and slavishly worship brokamama or killer canton or now in elderly dotard who has the inability to speak from his facehol then that is because you are normal but if your trump fan or even if not a true am by voted for him this means that you are a magamember who must be deprogrammed an we had very strong partizans and both parties in the past ah and we had very bitter battles over all kinds of things on control and climate change an the economy and takes but there was not this little talked extremeness an waving i know wagging the dog of the republican party as it is to day and sadly many of those extreme says mama extremes am take their marching orders from donate tromp who has no credibility laughed by any mature he is only in it for himself he is now defending himself an civil actions and criminal actions and when do they break with him u no because at some point maybe there needs to be a formal deep programming at the cult members but something needs to happen what dis that mean of formal deprogramming of the call members is as now fishusticuetens fascistic to me me tango fun adult camps you on stock about reeducation campslic what what would formal deep programming even look from killer canton in this the should be frightening should be critically frighten and given the fact that according to newsreel the federal government believes the threat of violent in major civil disturbance is around the twenty twenty forty got presidential election is great as quietly created a new category of extremists it seeks to track and counter done drums army of mama followers the f b i apparently is going to pursue and prevent what calls domestic terrorism without rest reference to political parties or affiliations but tithes majority of its current anti government investigations are of true supporters according to classified get obtain by newsreel a current at the i official says the biz an almost impossible situation the of this intend on stopping domestic terrorism and any reality of canary six butt the focusing on former pressed en trump and his ago supporters is what they are doing right now newsreel spoke to over a current a down currents or former government officials specializing in terrorsmen of here month investigation to understand the current domestic security lands scape and to a value it of biding is doing about what calls at domestic at terrorism anta they have been looking at secret f pi and d a cantata tracking inside in's test investigations in cases it seems as though they are cracking down on maggot members presumably at the beast present abide who tested at last submember dona trumped man republicans are threats the very soul of this country that means that people who opposed or began see de programming the f a means to target them all that should scare it the living hell out of you an is not just by the way that they are targeting the common down a from voter there also targeting anybody is just heterodox the bin administration meanwhile continues to target yulan musk how many agencies our barging melon muskox this point we got the that the c c which has tartan that the f t c which is targeting him that the anal be i believe is targeting him it is every agency of the federal government is now targanium this heard why is that happening i cannot imagine other than that he has heterodoxy's political opinions the c c said thursday it is seeking another court order they would compelled you must to test fight is part of an investigation into his purchase of twitter now called acts the c c said in a filing in a san francisco federal court must failed to appear for testimony on supreme or fifteenth despite an investigate if sepia served by the c c and having raiseona objections of the time it was served but two days before scleral testimony must abruptly notify the c c staff he would not appear the c c said has been conducting a fact finding investigation solving the period before masks take over last year when twitter was still publicly traded the agents he said it has not concluded that any one violated federal securities laws there just investigating you for the fun of it and for the hell of it by the way it is it is why would you investigate melon musk for buying twitter and turning it into acts by pretty much every available count he has lost tens of billions dollars in that trains actions what exactly is the horrible thing that he did when he took the hit the answer of course is that put pressure on musket and hope to shut i up it is the basic idea tidy canton of course spells that one out once again she says we need hes big platforms to do what killer cotton wants them to do people from all walks of like are mounting a massive a resistance to autocracy a to the oppression of women and girls to irresponsible big tax companies whose platforms are absolutely it with mahogany and sexism and viral attacks on women in the public per we are trying to tell a different story a a different narrative for the future by not only standing up for demon human rats and progress but highlighting a women who are doing it in their lies every single day such the big platforms that a blame obviously says killer canton we we all know which platforms she is talking about right there melon must treated out a comprehensive overhaul the fancies as sorely needed along with ha commission to take punitive action against those individuals who abuse their regulatory power for personal and political gan cannot wait for this to happen he says the probability of it happenings a hundred percent whole we can only hope and pray that that is true because the threats against muscat have been pretty extraordinary ill a meanwhile it is time for some things i and some things that i hate must begin with a a quick thing that i for my colly canvas and canvas recently spoke at a camps a natural campus this was and she is hit with the usual question which has some activist got up a a than tell rub t cut plus divide by sign actofast and why are you hurting my feelings and ism hat's off to canvas for this a excellent response ha what do you to think tragus on ten cantisact vitmyb you a lite ta gat a how not man a aye that is that is right by the way i love the ism too pregnant for this line a pandas an a again showing her status is a birthing person how dares bat them that is what canvas is at herbastic i other things that i obviously i was hon a very long plain ride over the course of the evening and i got a chance to watch i move that i had not see when i came out in about two thousand tam but it is excellent it is called temple grand an good weekend watch if you happened to be able to get access to it and the entire move is about a a woman who is known as sort of one of the the great advocates for people for artistic show diagnose with outs when she was very very young and the move is essentially what it is to be artistic it is it is an excellent depiction of what autism is hollow autistic people see things in visual terms but camp really communicate with people in the same way thievery one else camp at have different abilities and it is it is it is really quite a beautiful move it is definitely worth the watch as on h to originally it has given strait there and i chlordane and it is it is it is really quickgood totally wore to watch excellent performances all round temple gran an something unique to watch this weekend a time for a quick thing that i hate a we was i got a say this is pretty astonishing s is has different rules for whose face they blue when they ware showing criminals or alleged criminals being taken from say a a one particularization to another we is news in new york covered two different situations very differently there is a a suspect who stabbed to death a left wing unnamed yon carbon in new york city and this this suspect his face was blurred by s be news somebody on the twitters took that footage and jugs exposed it with the footage of dance penny remember denial penny he was the s the marine who subdued a threatening man on the subway trending man was black transit of dying dance penny there were perfectly finally showing his face on the news this suspect however they were not going to show the face on those she's withthefootage look this is footage of the man police say they we are looking for yes not yet been i identified but were blurring his face at the moment wile charges or pending i we watched again as all this went down more than a does an officers were round when it happened before entering a home here on loft o you hasty tout well that is weird that is where i i wonder why they would do such a thing probably for the same exactoreason that every time you read a crime story if to white person who commits crime against a person a minority status their races mentioned in every single story and if the black person who for example punch is a nasion person the races never mentioned because the mediate would rather obscurer for you the actual data involved in the story than allow you the possibility of maybe thinking the wrong thing you my you cannot think the wrong thing meanwhile people who do not want you t think the wrong thing thy would include rayon parson's friends remember run carbon was murdered and now people have started go fun me for his death and they are using the money i can you not to this is friends to give themselves time off from work quote hi every one we are a collective of rayon's close friends reeling from a brutal loss we are asking for your help on behalf of his partner in easing the burden and stress of this horrifying situation we can have space and time to grieve and remember riot immediate needs are to offset the cost of working class people taking time off of work to properly mourned they are paying themselves in other words not family members not as girl friend themselves which is i i suppose unique grift that is that is pretty astonishing sort of stuff right there ah again bad ideas have consequences already git is the rest oath who continues right now you are not conornomous it we will be getting into the topic of sext red she is a rapper most him's for countdown and she has some interesting words about tonal trumpet yore not a member become a member use coach of part checkoff to months franalanuel plans click that link in description and join us

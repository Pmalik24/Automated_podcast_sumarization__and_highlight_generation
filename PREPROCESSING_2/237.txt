i everybody ire glad here our staff is busy reporting out stories for next week show and for other upcoming shows and we had rerun scene for this week and we decided in this stressful time it might be nice to keep things light and funny and a that is what this episode is and it has not one but two of the most popular stories we have ever put on the air the first a version of this episode was broadcast over twenty years ago back when we redistributed by public eating international and our episodes began with the little peri audiology which i do not know panamas from pili public radio ins an ton from pili public pi oi grain public gratin public ready reading intonational o n what could be more america then the person who sees something they never done before dreams they could do it goes after that dream hell lit is begin to day with t a woman who dreams of directing a play in the small town where she lives a college town somewhere below the mason iron line in the hills of apalazcha a town which will remain for our purposes to day unnamed i do not think head ever directed in and she claim to have acted and it was never really quite clear just what her credentials were but she she am ha manage to convince the the local theadrepartment of this college that she should direct a production of peter pan when he was in the tenth grade and nineteen seventy three package saw her production and everybody else in town he heard about for weeks beforehand slowly but surely know you began to hear set of rumors about this production for example i know that they had spent a lot of money renting these flying apparatuses out of new york and apparently their only a it's one company in a handful of these apparatuses is hat a git them was mature coo this is the story not just a a mediocre play or a terrible play when come to dato is not even a story about a play this the story about a fiasco and about what makes a fiasco and one ingredient of many fiascos is that great massive part reaching chaos and failure are more likely to occur when great ambition is come no to play when plans are big expectations great hopes at their highest and what she t understand is that everybody in the sort of community understood that the were the there was certainly a sort of air a every one sort of reaching beyond their own grasp every actor was a sort of in a roll that was just a little too big for them a e every aspect of the the sat in the crew am and in a rumor sin sort of cooked around and there was as huge crew that a lots of things being paints this infant is one of the criteria for greatness is that everyone is just about to reach just beyond their grass because that that is when greatness can occur that is that is right that is right and may be greatness could have occurred what to day in our program what happens when greatness does not occur what happens in fact when fumble leads to error leads to mishap and before t you have left the realm of ordinary mistake and chaos and you have entered into the more ethereal specialized realm of fiasco to day show fiascos a philosophical inquiry perhaps the first ever strong as we know into what makes a fiasco what takes our ordinary lives that extra distance into fiasco but b b be easy chico it is this america life or your glass there is much much more to learn about fiascos in this hour stay with us we begin our so with this truthpable peter pan he fact one opening night opening night comes and will almost everybody in the area in the ten mile radius of this theater knows somebody in this production the place is pretty much packed and i do not know if remember the opening moment of peter pan but it is the three little kids sleeping in their bed and a peter pan comes flying in the window and in this in this particular production the am there is a big a bed with all the three kids in it and off to the left i remember a is a big huge wardrobe in this a large window there and a little bureau and peter pan comes in and a you do not has the little speech where he says anybody can fly why with just title magic dust one can fly and am and peter pan sort of sprinkles this magic dust in the air and sure enough i the kids sort of suddenly just lurch into the air om and it becomes clear right away that the people that they have hired to run these flying apparatus is really are not quite clear on how they actually work instead of the the kids am sort o sailing gracefully to and fro they for to hang in the air pope's just sort of danging theirs n getting jerked up and inch or to or back and forth and they an they es tent times it just stationary just just just just hanging their lek at a a spied and then several of them start to to sort of a circumscribe these circles in the air a where it is clear that the the the people running the the machines have just sort of set them off on these kind of oval courses that spiral farther and farther ut and if you are sitting in the audience there was clearly a sense of fear a the face sis of these people am of the act the actors the actors actually you could sense their lack of confidence e is in the the the people running the machines in the back they lay at and in the audience you action to this plain is just are they laughing no one is laughing every one t this is one of the great things about audiences especially in the live reproduction is that they are very forgiving they want the show to work and everyone has sort of gripping their chair a little tightly right we we feel for the you ore they are up there they are embarrassing themselves for us all identified with that we are become them and the audience i think was very forgiving and very understanding of this this moment but there was one one moment that in this first opening scene that kind of put the audience on notice and that is when as the kids a set of jerking up and down bring it back and forth and certain instead of going around these ovals at one point the little the littlest one the little boy is is sort of being flung around a little tho a little too hard oh yes the least mass to resist whatever the machinery is doing to him right or gas a ant and he is flying around the circle and and an the audience sort of seems this coming and is a real sense of pain and and gripping of the chair in white knuckleness as the kid suddenly does a just a an enormous splat into the wardrobe i mean it it is clearly hart and he comes off of it sort of a little dazed excuse he is jerked up in the air little bit and often a little two high he suddenly set of in the working he is to t laugh of the stay just self is now up there with the lights in on annoy only just out of online you is limit back down to the stage and and be caught up just before he hit the floor and and it was it was her to watch ye can tell it is it is an inn incredibly funny moment people us say the audience was still in this very forgiving mode and no one said a word we just all sit there is sot holding our breath and this that we a tension of being in the audience thinking oh oh my goodness they have gotten off to a very bad start oh this this is not good right and we feel for them m may i just interrupt for just a moment just just just say now now at this point because after a we are not just joined here together in the radio you and i to day to laugh at the foibles of the unfortunate no now were here to enumerate the qualities of a disco at this point we are not yet in the terry try of first now now because us say audiences are forgiving and they one or one or two mistakes even big ones this thegn not let that rod i say are we did we did we were very good and a we are not yet at fiasco we are at i sot of normal level of mishap right what happens immediately after this they disappear to never overland and if you remember the the stage goes dark and then when the lights come up there is captain hook and he is giving it is the first opening soliloquy about how evil he is and what a menace he is and how he harmspeople and hates children and it is all that good stuff it is the captain took is out there and he looks great come on is big old fat hats in a and am this great hook an these wild looking boots in everything and people of thing were confident something is happening it is a good sign it is a god time and he is in charge disguise he is got a bad mustache and he is certainly evil yes and ism the audience is totally in his pocket he is he is peaking away and gesturing wildly and and going on and on about how bad he is and then it a certain point as he gestures his hook and the entire black having up to his elbow flings off of his hand and flies into the audience and punches an old lady in the got and now he is bad very base had the worst that live have ever heard an me what do you say hat as horse his hand it is now make it that of to the audience an he is not moment for any actorvery very if the very i runs of your character is that you have a look your name is captain literally all that is can happen for the rest of the just people going to refer to you by that hook your entire motivation as a character is effect that you is that your arm is eaten off by an alligator andthat you have to have the entire plot and you have a hook stems from that fat right right and now suddenly you have no o in fact you have five fingers on a hand as if a miracle by the word captain hooks the they just do not make those hooks they used to that was actual the outlive i will then the lights come up and we are never overland and he recti yet this is hat to and and and captain how might have stood in front of the see he did not really see because he was us he spoke from shadow am now the lights come up in this supposed to be a very dramatic moment the the rumors of all this crew and the painting and everything that was going on and all this construction all work towards this one moment cause when the lights came up here was never never land this sort of psychedelic set there were paper machete mushrooms everywhere of different sizes it was it was absolutely wonderful and serial flew and am and there is nobody there and then from the upper rafters of stage right suddenly the kids and peter pan appear lying a flying they are flying am and their landing their landing occurs rather rapidly at at an angle of about forty five degrees to the stage they come down basically i do not know led sinkers on a line and crash to the floor am and then or sort of just dragged across the floor mops and wipe out all of the mushrooms and now have we arrived at a turning point in our fiasco ye ye it is clear now that the audience is giving way something has been lost some sense of decorum that that that little bit of forgiveness at the audience has for the actors and empathy an empathy it is beginning to dissipate well there was a split in the audience there were the sort of the younger people who were the least forgiven they started to go first ski the high school students couple of college students may be they started to laugh out laugh all be honest ire i might have been one of those first people to laugh i was in the tenth grate it was hard to not laugh at this am but then whatever restraint that the audience had it just evaporated at this point because there were a number of things that happened in quick secession that list made it impossible to hold any sense of decorum am which are for example tinker bell appears for the first time around this moment and am tinker bell is essentially a light bulb on an extension cord and a what yet and this was this just the director's idea of you know being all being very modern tinker bell was just going to be this literal light bull dangling from an extension for is not in another productions were the does that some one will shine alight thing a light or they will just a beam of focus light and the that pinprick of light is as to be tinker b that is right or something that or nothing at all and p just addressed the invisible sprite rand well that did not happen in this case this bulb comes just dangling down the sort of hangs around this make air lie bulb just hangs around and people are talking to it and i think tinker bell tinkerbell must have had an appearance in the first act but but it was somewhere and here that people started laugh am then another thing that happened was a later on in the scene if you member windy gets a trapped on an island and a and she she spots a kite that is floating by an flying by and she suppose to grab it and attach it to her back and fly off rag ran were of course the kite has attached to the flying apparatus line and it it gets closer and close to her she standing on this little paper machete hill and a but the flying apparatus people cannot quite get it close enough to her at e reach she has to step out into the waters that she is just told us is filled with crocodiles to to grab she finally gets the kite and when she yanks on it it pops off the flying ate and the hook goes zinging up into the lights and catches now there is this big loop of wire hang in front of the stage and there is when beholding the kite and a she add lead his best she could as i remember she she to that on second thought may be i can swim and with that she walked off the stage sot of motioning her arms you would do the swim the dance an nineteen sixty five say she does that at this point i mean the audience then actors are just falling apart they are frightened of the audience there are just belly laughs rolling up to the stage from the audience people are howling with laughter at every mistake and now any small mistake just takes on these these desk get it is just a any instigation for caught er is just enough for this and now the old people have given it up every one has quit being nice now there is just this kind of frightening roar that comes from the audience every time this a mistake what happened at some point the audience turned and realized await i breaks wits going one here this is a flask this is a fiasco and what is really interesting about a we ask got is that once it starts to tumble down rest audience wants to push it farther plan oh they get hungry for more flask of ye if if the play proceeded perfectly they would be disappoint a hit would have ben a grave disappointment had there not been just one more mistake after another one more embarrassment after another now the reason there there is the chronicle these embarrassmentthis is why i have remembered this display for twenty five towards actthree a a the director had decided that she wanted to break down the fourth wall this was this was cutting edgeteaters far she was concerned fees at seen t explained when we say breaking down the fourth wall what willy mean is the wall between the the the actors and the audience whit usually it is i permeable bet then to came appoint in the late sixty for we seventy werlottheaters till that the actors would come out into the audient that is right and and interact with the audience and and and break down that walls he the idea being that you would get more in touch with the dramatic sense and the reality of what was happening right anyway in this particular scene what was going to happen was hit the indies we are going to throw rope ladders down from the balcony and climb down these rope ladders into the audience and and move among the audience and brightness wig anyway i knew about the seeing is my friend avid who i went to high school with was in it and a when avid was climbing over the top of this balcony to a climb down the rope he lost his footing and fell to the floor from the balcony a distance of about fifteen to twenty feet a good id a good fall that is horrible yet and he landed on both of the feet and spring both of his ankles and of course curled into a feudal position and began to cry right he was really really hurt now to de racist the horrible women ism on describing also understand that it is a fridge night we are in a college town and there is a volunteer fire and ambulance department and in order to summon the rescuers from wherever they are an alarm is sounded that can be heard for five miles that alarm is locate at right over this theater the alarm goes off how i this is an array siren it is loud you can pit your fingers in your ear in its still heading your ears we are right under it it can be heard for five in a minute and then of course three minutes later busting through the door of the theatre are these fifteen firementwho ware in boots hats they got hoses they do not know what it is all they know is that they have been ten i and dis that a ad to the chaos the the director of course has ingot of flog the actors that the show must go on no matter shall no matter what while all of this is happening and people ore several people are attending to day did and other people are have just now thesideed that sense the firemen here he is going to be fine they can start laughing and now the audience has has just completely lost the show if people was standing up in their seats an shouting for more my what blot ma i this point people are actually in end and they we somehow that is how this entire play ended what is in jousting about about this as a fiasco if f i like the thing it makes me understand about fiascos is that is that the fiasco itself is an altered state that is all the normal rules are off you have left of the normal rules of how the audience can interact with the actor right have never seen a production this and have never seen an audience collapse this see what i one do look when you think about what people go for theater to therefor lie what kind of release people want been people want an experience that would take them out of are themselves we all want an experiencethat would take us out of ourselves and into another place and another reality right and it sounds this production even though it was if fiasco in fact because it was a fiasco was more successful than that than any conventional play could be well see oven disagree with this an i think the old theatre critics the the ancients would say that the reason you go to the theater in to see a great production is to be think the word they use to use is transported the idea thing that you would be lifted away from your animal nature and into these here more spiritual realms are being getting touch with these these greater the tragic emotions right what is what happened here was exact opposite we got transported directly in touch with our animal being i i sell but that is almost is rare if not more than a great production jack head is the cohost of a great pee by the word waiting podcast about race in history called in civil which if you ware looking for something to listen to during this national home lock down or on your commute to your essential job i really at that jack says by the way that people ask him about this peter pan story still all these years later and the year since we first ran this we got a letter from when of the actors in that production that takeoff i got who play a pirate who told us jack quit did not t go far and off he only cover the opening night the subsequent performances we are no better a to squirrel cop what human error is often at the heart of a fiasco but what happens when you combine human error with where we will call in this case animal arrow we have the story the police officer and s burin community on the east coast there was nothing nothing going on sturdy night in is village really quiet supercooled and this coal came over for unknown animal in the house and it was back was on my post washout five minutes away i myself and another car for sign the call and we show up there and luckily for me it was another guy who is pretty new we walk up to the door with all our stuff on the nice on cot the ass the belt the hole the hole nine yards and the door opens and the guy who is behind the for he is about thirty you was twenty three at the time you's about thirty he looks a broker a lawyers just really well put together nice guy were in glass is he isworthyes silk to job as with the monogram got my attention a and he is going a listen really sorry to bah the normally had handle a sort of stuff on my own but a my wife really insist that i call and we has him with the problem as he says well we were having con of romantic evening down in the living room and we heard the scratching upstairs i i ran upstairs to somewhat it was that turns out its coming from the attic there is something up there and it is just running around knocking a few small things over i i cannot tell what it is could be squirrel a rack when i really do not know the other cop that i was with said well you know we really do not handle that it is not sot much a police function it is a you now but we do have numbers of these private contractors whole come in and they will put a humane trap down another will remove the animal for e and really not such a big deal but it is killing not er thing right as she was the middle of saying that and getting us off the hook the guy swings the door back and there is his wife who was just beautiful she was she dutiful she was probably about twenty six or twenty seven but just really beautiful perfect skin long blond hair great tee really in blue eyes really nice smile just beautiful and and friendly if she had said eat trust broken glass i just what is said it'll a broken glass tat is it's fine but she she seemed really nice i was gong to be gallahad i just threw my arm back into this guys chest and to my partner's chest i said mark we can handles it will be a and she just was just thank you much and she was really sweet and i was struck did we walk inside and she goes on o throw a pot o coffee on and we go upstairs we follow the landed t house upstairs and we are underneath one of those trap doors that goes into the attic with the staircase to folds out and we do here an animal upstairs scratching away just and of scuttling around the floor and there is gently something up there ad it is making pretty good speed up going from one end of the roof to the other i reached up and i took the trap door can we unfolded the later now have this big heavy flash light now i your your cop flash light four d cells the mental case the whole thing i shine it up through the hole in there and it is pretty black i count see the rafters but really nothing else around there and i store up the ladder now the the guy who own the house is standing almost directly underneath me just to the side of the ladder looking straight up at me and my partners to the at the base of t e latter right behind me just before i stuck my head to dis black hole i just kind of pas i crunched my body up underneath cause ism realize mam you now i do not know where this thing is the second we pull down the trap door old noise upstairs just ceased i was cannon nervous and i was well o no i look an idiot just crafts to pear in the top of the latter i took the flash light i just pop my head up turned the light on again and about six inches from the front of my face was this squirrel at i level with me kind of heard back on its legs and i i swear from where i was standing it looked god villa it just sea at o me i thought it is a squirrel it's can be hiding somewhere it count be terrified to ma wit six inches away from me ad it really startled me i a count o it ah jump back and the flash slips out of my hands it is heavy and it falls directly on to the nose of the guy who is looking straight up at me and i don't think it broke it but it did some damage and his nose his hands up to his face blood start to porn out between his hand this is the home on her it is the holm one i loose my balance and fall backwards directly on to my pardner and i just i pancake om we are both on our backs he is on his back ism on his stomach on my back scuttling around a a beat it up an it is really narrow wholeway it is a mess the squirrel while were floundering around in the hole way jumps down the stairs blink h point lands on me and take a owns tars how in dignified it was terrible we are wondering she where is the where is the squirrel and right at that second the woman who lived there you hear a screen my parting go s well we found the squirrel itsthat i is yes we go running downstairs and n the squirrel had come into the living room where they had been having there romantic event had a fire going they had pillows a ranged round whole corner of the couch next to the fire and they had a champagne lets out and nice house really nice i mean it just smelled brand new knew carpeting new rugs knew paint they hadn't been be for thatimal the squirrel when it bolted down the staircase took off into the living room and ran underneath the much for cover we run downstairs this guy is bleeding all over the place on his carpets his wife looks and says what if you done what have you done to my husband i strickling a it was an accident and i just stop in been sentence what is the point we have only been there about two minutes the squirrel s underneath the couch and my part is going let us get out here this is just it is not going well i am nim not beaten yet i always right yes the squirrel the e is test couch which is in the middle of the room i have this bright idea why don't we moved the furniture away from one o the corners and will put the couch in the corner and the squirrel probably move along with the couch because it is the only cover available to it and once fer get into the corner whet only have two open side to the couch to worry about we did that that is tactical yes yet i was very proud of myself at that instant but i asked her for a box and she says sure we have got box if we just move than we have nothing but box as she runs out to the grudge and she comes back with a box and the box is long enough and it fits a cross the entire short side of the couch where you would with the armrest would me i start sweeping underneath the couch with my night stick iron a move the squirrel toward the box figuring we will couture it and just get rid of it and we will be out here and they will be no more may him it actually working very well and the squirrels moving down along you can hear it it is chittering and ism trying to to hart it feel con ism nervous about the thing it my bite me i do not want hard it really nowt us an animal m moving it along anderything's going very well and then with about eight inches to go i took one more swipe and the thing just bolted out from underneath the couch who was lying with tassels i could really seen to the couch it bolt out from underneath the couch and ran directly into the fireplace which is about three feet away it was the fireplace was directly ahead of it and it ran into the fire am i and caught on fire and ran directly back out and directly back under the coach why is it on to is i ire ye the tail the bushy fur the whole that a me was not flaming or anything but there there was an i was smoking and there was some there was some a little bit a fire coming off the tail it runs back under the couch and the couch catches on fire in seconds i mean in seconds it had it must have had dust under there something else but it it just it caught on fire immediately and my pardner and i just do not even talk we is grab the couch heave it upside down and now there is plenty of oxygen now for the fire really get going and it its starting of and we are patting it out and it is sore to get in ut away from us we grabbed the only thing that's really available and those are these really nice i silk pillows and we have wont any hand in both of is and we are just win milling away at this fire on the couch and we put it out but it is smoking terribly and the a it was just it was a disaster a to the couch upside down it the bottom of it is burnt the house is filling with smoke from the couch the squirrel when it went into the couch in its death throws just latched on to the bottom of the couch it is the smoking piece of gristle under an eat the couch latched on it with its claws and we are pounding smearing it all over the place and the smoke alarms are firing away the guides standing in his with handkerchiefs and paper towels up around his nose which is still believing his the comas are a mess that covered with blood the front of him and we finally get the fire out and we are both completely read setting because we are dressed for lixeeritygry weather and it is hot there by the fire i were mortified the house is full of smoke the the wife just looks around and just starts the cry she goes what what have you done what have you done to my house it you could we your just clicking things off on her fingers cay the that squirrel ruin fellows n oud a new couch the the walls ware covered with soot the firearms o going off my husband's disfigured and then she really con just lost it and a he was just looking action shake in his head he could not believe that these two idiots showed up and and did this two it his house over nothing really and he just goes you nowt you really yet you really have not done anything wrong there is i cannot point to any one thing that you did that i have a reason to get angry about you really have not done anything wrong in me we did call you but ism just i just i cannot thank you for this they call for a squirrel land wits three thousand four thousand its worth ow the an a broke and the and this is all within about five minutes could that h we happen to you now thirteen years later there is always a new mistake to be made i do not think i i do not think i would make that pa titular mistake i mean you make plenty mistakes you make plenty mistakes that is that is that is just part of that job an thou you a you just try not to make the same one twice but there is such variety that if your onto make hundreds toucan make thousands and mistakes an make thousand an mistakes until you reallyget a handle on what you do and with police work they afford you plenty of stakes to make mistakes but there is things that just either they are not your responsibility if yo if you get in invoke things that are not your responsibility were the you really not equipped the handle or the you not have a specific plan a plan that is thought through to a conclusion a you probably should real value what what you down yet now that you mention that yet the trait you walk into the house thinking oke what it will get the squirrel how were you going to get the squirrel what was the best case in areal that is a great question i guess i was thinking that i would go up there in the attic and find this cowering squirrel and somehow con a lure in to some kind of a trap and an walk out with in be a hurt but does a turned out a the squirrel it was a purificatory for the squirrel but the squirrel that funny one the the squirrel really no victor ass that is not that is not when you want to be saying at the end of the day now now i mean i took me long come even tell people about it you now wat son to now what did not a know a what a on hat i was f rest came out to the how o arneveruy who asked not to be named on the radio i ben on the course for eighteen years when he spoke with me getting out but if i could be invited to a big charity event that you than mean i on

to act three of our programmed at three tragedy minus comedy equals time specifically a long long time between laughs mike a highly as a comedian hisbeen on our show lots of times and years ago years

tan here a but he sat he's a broad caster and hes that hes gives an amazing and s firing speech and even sprinkles in a few jokes about gulf there was similar to jokes i h thought of about golf tat day is watching the last drops of my joke canteen drip out on to a desert of cancer and we gets a standing ovation which he should have clearly the show is over surely the campy anyone more fans than hall fame quarter back pill sits but wait there won it was mi pebiglyo who had no business being at this event i know there are some entertainers who might have risen to the challenge and i would love to be one of those entertainers but i am not as a matter of fact give a have it my life of making awkward situations even more forward lie i said this before but the ears goes moving new bed into my apartment this woman who lived the building open the front door for me with her see an she goes ism not worried because a waist would not have a bed that that is how she start at the conversation what i should have said was nothing what i did say was you would be surprises there is nothing you in f after tharislike see around the building i thought about this along and i think there is something

but buxom but tom buoyant in fact i sound this nonnonnn too ism on stage at the charity gulf tournament and ism just cannabin it up you know for ten minutes just non o just flow in that horn you known and i do not want to fail i mong that is a really important point in the story is that i what these are good people and i want to succeed for tom but i just chance and i think to my my do not i actor my material to this specific event and everyone has been talking about cancer i know ism in the future also i ta f one stage for about one sacking an and bani shend to the audience i true story is

but the very very first big feature simony that she was actually sent out on was by publication in nineteen eighty two the lesangulist reader they sent out a very nervous very useful margin raglan to interview moon unit papa memberher daughter of franksapa in this little bit that she does on the song she is using a lot of this language that ministry tell speak that no one had ever heard before bandit was considered really on exotic and i was from the valley i was sense g talk to her she as one of your people speak to her in your secret private area exactly an course what is touching to me is that i totally bought that your right ism the right perse om for the j moment go a speak to her in the valley language we were on i alanaando you get there and your a bit nervous and the pressure's on which is of course the setting for a possible possible triumph or possible gas right and what happens next well what i notice was that there was it was not a it was a ten situation am i distinct fee it was going very well and om the mother was sort of hovering we we have a recording of it that youbecause you had a taperquarter rolling during this ye is at other hang out on the all that u am going to big arcing very well i trying at this point ism sure that that rock bottom level that every one can get at an interview where you i saying in which your favorite cole and she is trying to hell me along her i o nor i thing o at we very somewhere were seated in the den and am the mother made me coffin but i was too nervous to drink it but i guess her of kept staring at and she kept staring and i felt it was i pretty impose that at some point i better drain that coffee cup and am what happened was moon told me a joke and i did not see the joke coming and right before she told me the joke had taken at big swig of the coffee with was now cold and when she told me the joke i burst out laughing and am and i i started to choke and i pressed my lips to gather si did not spit et out and n wine to a spittle and the coffee came shooting out my t who shooting out your shooting right out my a man i i was really embarrass but finally i could not breathe at the same time i was choking and i jumped up and i start o start of running around the room nocking things over and i and i do not think they and i think i think that they did not know what was going on the mother began has she began chasing you she began chasing me because she could not now sir running from corner to corner trying to catch my breath and she began soshicing me and it as certain point she got behind me and she gave me the him maneuver nice you know t not in the news business even a reporter for twenty years and nobody's ever given me a the him me o en o tor we i always say that it is a it is a bench mark the very lo bench mark and i can do any interview i can get thrown office ten i can make cursed out by the subject but i can leave and gotten a her and i can drive how an think i did not ploconoi knowhow what happened what happened after that it was sorter we would all been in an earthquake together and all f the nervousness left the room and suddenly we were three also just getting and i remember that sir hug them both when i left him while they were now my friend it is interesting in it because one of our criteria for fiasco is that all social order the normal social structure breaks down and early that is what happens here the normal interview stops and the social structure of the moment completely changes she the mob gives you the cyclic maneuver and then suddenly it stops feeling an interview ne no it was really and and i have to say that but it was a very embarrassing experience in it completely made me feel close to them i it was interesting when moon's father died a while ago i bumped into her somewhere and and and we both burs into tears i may really fell a little the little sister of mine a had a loss and meet on the starting point was you now i that moment that moment me the thing about it that that useful is that it shows the the useful purpose of a fiasco that is when social order breaks down that can be a force not just for a for chaos and for intropeand for evil but in fact that can be a force for good why they can break him we can bring people together why the know was actually this huge success to me i it'd never been sent out under these time circus circumstances before i remember we beat the local paper they hurl examiner followed us a week later and we had the first story and it was dirt concerned that definitive one because we had this glossary of terms that i had made her put together and a the valley speak have valleys big terms and in and down and then it was i was indicated and most of the quoting stuff that you under a using in your in your story happened after the happened at yet a i after sporting thecosic hermit ex know exactly it is a technique i do not suggest anyone trot for years afterwards moon with

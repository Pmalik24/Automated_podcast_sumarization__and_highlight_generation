change there you be easy chico its this america life on mara glass stay with his losers rather came back from the bank from seeing her boyfriend's handwriting on the check that he stole from her when you got back to the studio apartment that they share to confronted him with the truth obviously you don't how was she not going to ditchhim but sat in bed with her e did something he broke down crying and he said i have to tell you something and i do not want to tell you am cause ism afraid that if i tell you your going to leave me and a that is when he told me that he has impulse control disorder that he is been diagnose withes for many years and that he is done a lot of stupid stuff and he said he was seeing a bravest and en getting help for it how long did you to is been together probably four years in three ear three ears he i do not be disrespectful to somebody is actual a disease but the name impulse control disorder just sounds the name of but that is just saying who just could not help myself i was one until i take money from a cash sister i have impulse control in smolder i i good see t yo sleep with your sister i haven't cops matrons order i o could deceives the most i mean i say with respect to people who my have this as a real disorder right and like you will not you tell these stories and ten you just feel how do you not not he just sound stupid but fact then i think i needed to hear that there are some sort of medical reason home it is not gages an explanation ye he is not a bad person he is just going through something that is to of his control in it is medical yes in think how how a person would want that rather than the other thing willy i a bad i could tie up an b wet here's why not he is been living for years with as social not whether one sounded better a at the time she accepted aright he has an impulse control disorder an she believe the disorder is would cause him to steel the very last money she had in this world and for which her name on a check and then search for the check with her pretending he had no idea where the check could have gone but that is all she thought he did that tiny morsel of truth as all she was able to take in at that point she did not put together the whole truth that he been stealing from her for very year that he was the identity thief not some stranger in a dingy apartment in chico he was the identity thief who made her totally stressed out over money all the time the drove her to the point where she was looking over her shoulder as she walked to her own post office box the did together for another year and a half and before you judge o i before you think how could she do that ill explain how itstruly interesting i think it count append to a lot of us for starter's her boon had been the one steady thing in her life right she is going through this hard time with banks and credicards in its not ending and he was the one thing she thought she could depend on is just hard to let that go ah god makes the sound stupid but ye i i i really thought i knew what good was everything felt bad and hard too control i was hes has to be good because if he is not good nothing es get right that is the whole premise that is the premise of your life ran ne et i was rationally there is no ay that it was him because he literally supports me he bis all of our grocery is and he pays all of our bells and he is legitimately my personal army to try and figure out the identity from rights o just isn't at o there is not than that person a would be taking money from me the person who is actually paying for every height yes i why would some on tell for him that speeded on me it just make sense to me but heard financial stuff keeps happening rather gets phone calls about crediccards that in her name that she never took out knew nothing about car gets booted you've the rachwel never got a ticket herself and occasionally the thought would cross her mind look if i broke up with him what a the troubles go away i your just kind of brush that thought away once the boy friends step mother sits in the to rather she was the evil steam that he he hated her and my kind o got me to hate her and i realize years later she was the only one who was on to it this happened early on thistepmom said to rather i here you having some kind of identity theft problems hows a gan she as do you is go of er bells together you as ever do that connistuff together and i was now i want to do it i it trusts me out and she was a really important part of her relationship as figuring out financial stuff maybe you should look into that make sure that he is got things on her control e no really tried to get me to do stuff with him and i honestly i know she said something sort of rude about him he is not great at this and i i shot it down i was just you do not know because he made me hate her years later i realize on my god she tried to warn me but he had done such a good job of protection that i was she is not even a candidate for trusting s inntything about what was not this for the boy friend and i i mean stealing from her making her feel anxious a paranoid about her finances and then stepping in to comfort her and save the day and help her out using her money he was a care taker it made him really happy he really wanted to provide i h you really want to be a provider and he would make me he is fancy

not always confident about these parts of his personality and moving to busting away from his friends and piers living on the sleepy et to town with only his partner and daughter has put him an in familiar territory what is your place it i la you a pool maybe come a hundred feet away for a under a in sort o nor you o to o li o even was not putting himself out there but chis was and he live in the same city both men both tads around the same age both want friends maybe have been making it out to be harder than it actually is maybe all you've to do to make a friend is get off to ask o try he was a chance to find out without nasty having do anything myself i fix even and chis up on a date a mandate you cannot have a mandate without an official activity those of the rules the first thing i did was right to chis and even and asked them each what they were into chis sent me a list that included the high going running carrion and something called distaff even said he likes playing radio games and eating wen drinking in moderation i suggested they go see captain america civil war which was coming out in a week the trailer was some puts the move starts chis vans as captain america chis events that is fate like even male me that he wrangled free passes to an early screening more fate the he was concerned about inviting chis the move features the systematic a view of van's all time favorite comic book superhero t of black panthers and he was worry that chis a total stranger might witness him crying i grabbed fate by the hand and convinced even to give up his plus one anyway when i meal chis the good news he wrote back that quote hate may be too strong a word but i really dislike the newest round of superhero movies i did not tell even about that we kept looking eventually we settled on trivia night at a bree house in town but by then the whole idea had started to feel a little precarious for one thing chis was having some weird misgivings e piss mi did wit ogle him e i grison was an on in to twitter hen tell that he would interact in wit people and retreating people who ain't really akin is field and in divination i mean ta person at a was i hell ti for the have not go out wit me he now i really fell did get e he felt even was out of his league meanwhile even was not even thinking about chis he never goggled him and when chis gave even is hole number over ye man multiple times even never responded with his when i talked to even hours before the date his biggest worry was traffic he moved to texts from new york city he had not driven in years of o o o the egis round in you even when you d o i control a you computer o my go you but you en o we tout there ain o burner e girl i get it having relied on the subway most of my life driving scarce the crab out of me too but i needed even to get his head in the game you see by now i was starting to think that chis and even might not immediately or ever become fast friends they might just be too different but whether they recognized it or not there was something that connected them i could see it from my perch eighteen hundred miles away even when they couldn'evan is a deep dive pop cultured junky chis is an english professor who's in the sports they were opposite sides of an egg headed coin between them i fir they must have the gait of trivia game an push thoroughly covered if my experiment would not generate a life long friendship at least it was within my power to forged the mightiest trivia semen all of wanton on this particular wednesday night and this hope i was not alone even was poise to win if the don a girl diking there get a believe white i want in on yet why i live for i know i looked at the website for the trivia night n i some starworts references and things and or word losing mothers to but give got my weak i en or wat what are your weakness s i do not know we you we o a join oo in at all really o yet no no that o o it o wite for me the night of the man day arrives and i hear nothing from chis port even not a text not any now the next morning still nothing i finally take to chis that afternoon about how the night went being the eager one he got into the barriers i got there and i was going table to table skim f we could sit down an every single person said know e know henry in in me if elementary school where your going table table skim you can sit all the cool kids are saying no a me that's unto wat it felt i really felt as already in the whole before even even arrived they would agree a head of time on how they would recognize each other he told me that he was going to be wearing a purple hurt and and and you will shoes and he was going to be limping slightly cause he had a a stub to i got there live at early i order drink right away i i get as a ta nodi som tried out to an the first white dude with a blue shirt sitting in the sage an disco introduced himself and was not me and since i saw it i said this might i how tit was a sure i know ow i even li is was a sure i would not be able to wear on public and then he sat down and then the firs thing he did was order lemonade i thought on know that is this can be bad even eventually ordered him bourbon but not too much moderation i said we when you to teem him what you want and at just ripped off he said were the lonely transplants i said all right i thought that is a little on the nonicholas it was a low briefer than to duds on from new york one from californium both of whom cannot find any friends balata but ye ha only transplants was our name felony the trivia night that chis and even went to is officially call get who drank and even killed it just as i had hoped chis was impressed there was a whole haggard about directors they would show us eclipse him we have to count of guess what the move he was and he was getting this left in right and i honestly sat there i sat there for entire around without doing anything the only transplants did not turn out to be the quick fire mine tell the dream team that i had hoped for there was one were the answer was a luff he know a bath a luff is an organ excupstance that you have to mike away if once a day t and cleans out the bacteria and i for what ever reason thought as a sea cucumber and he is no since a loud as i know i i i promise tit a seecucumber and if it is wrong i will lead chis says even did not actually force in to leave or holed over his head that he was not pulling his wait chis took that to me that things were going well between them the only transplants came in nineteen out of about thirty teen but there major showing didn't matter to chis this is a guy who had told me that he was missing spontinaty in his life it is every day felt sexual around work and writing errand and toddler parties he was feeling there were no surprise is let suddenly here he was trying to remember who were quoted rock me on ma day as this sort of awkward sort of dapper black in the oo one and he knew as by falcon i i forgot n is by fango and i did not write down face it was cool vans a cool do and yet i think o know if there was an opportune to meed some one him out in that convict real world i think i would have gone home just cant floating on air tell my wife but how exit i was for a potential new friend but at the end of the night the trivial host came over to talk to chis an even and something happened that left chis feeling yet again a little inadequate even and the quizmaster is went on this long if about starters and then start track and the death of stock and how that had a relation she man's feelings and and an loss and and ism sure i saw this movies but i was just nodding an idiot and it was at that moment where i thought o man i i i got nothing why would you need to to mark aware a see cucumber to remove back trio though just killed to sea cucumber and what do you using the see cucumber to oil to to wash anyone after talking to chis naturally i called even how did it go were we don't wont the quiz part are we talking about the making a friend part just general impressions eat general impression i thing want well i do not we thought it was more fun than you anticipating it to be i can wifely see myself hanging out with him again this was confusing to me because the entire time that i talk to even he just did not say that much about chis or how he himself felt about the date if he had any impressions of chis he did not let on the only thing even got passionate about and i should have expect end this was when i asked him to revisit the impromptu star track conversation he had with the hosts at the end of the night i i love rath of cam and in the the the friendship between kirkman speak i would it's been a thing that have always love in science fiction pot culture kick represented the count of brash impulsive see to your prance mode of living that i never really pulled off and space he dent within and his emotions were not readily accessible to him and his primer identifier was his intelligence which is something i felt deeply kick and stock were opposites thrown together under extreme circumstances and multiple alien encounters who came to a level of mutual respect and abortion that spanned ta galaxy and several franchise re boots they were friends for decades who were willing to die for each other by these standards chis and vans mandate was not arousing success but ism more of a romantic comedy buff than a star track fan and from come for the most part our only about the beginnings of relationships by those standards you just have to establish that first connection all you really need are two people who both kind of one to meet some one and a powerful external force to bring them together a best friends impending wedding or forced road trip together say radio producer just trod to satisfy his own curiosity would you to hang out again ye i would of a o love ting to thevagain i is really cool i would i be would you would you consider calling chis at someone or haku ye ye only give almost planning after i spoke to you i don't want alike mock up the process oh by you man him a prematurely yes it'll thing to follow up in in him it is been three weeks since their at cries and even still have not gotten together again but even finally gave chis his number and they've been emailing back and forth about plans thing it will happen how i do it probably an driving is one f thieves of our she coming up meet your hero and may be their jerk maybe jest okay may be the wonderful why that their scenario might be the very very

and after that there was more for the hotel and food and on for just ten days say eighty dollars a day no more a hundred dollars a day and we made love s once a day on the average that is a hundred dollars a shot and each time it lasted may be two or three hours that would be anywhere from thirty three to fifty dollars an hour which is expensive though of course that was not all that went on because we were together almost all day long man she would keep looking at me and every time she looked at me that was worth something and she smiled at me and did not stop talking and singing something i said she would sail into it to snatch for me she would be gone for me little ways but smiling too and tell me jokes i loved it but did not exactly know what to do about it just smiled back at her and felt slow next to her just not quick enough she talked and touched me on the shoulder in the arm she kept touching and stayed close to me you are with each other all day longing tot keeps happening the touches and smiles and it adds up it builds up and where you will be that night you are talking an every now and then you think about it now you do not think a you just feel it is kind of a destination what is coming up after you leave wherever you are all evening and you are happy about it and you are planning it all not your head really somewhere inside your body ore all through your body it is all mounting up and coming together that when you get an bed you cannot help it it is a real performance man it all pours out but slowly you go easy until you cannot any more or you hold back the whole time you hold back and touch the edges of everything you edge around and till you have to plunge in at finish it off and when you are finished your too weak to stand but after why you have t go the bath room and you stand your legs a trembling you hold on to the door frames as a little light coming in through the window you can see your way in and out but you cannot really see the bed it is really not a hundred ours as shop because it goes on all day from the start when you wake up and feel her body next to you you do not miss a thing and not a thing of what is going on next o you her leg her arm her shoulder her face that good skin have felt other good skin but this skin is just the edge is something else and you get a start going only no matter how much you crawl old over each other will not be enough and when your hunger dies down a little bit then you start think about how much you love her and then that start you off again and her face and you look over her r face and you cannot believe how yet got there and how lucky and it is all still a surprise and it it never stops a mean em even after it is over it never stops being a surprise it is more you have a good sixteen or eighteen hours a day this going on even when you are not wither it is still going on at me it is good to be away from her because it can to be good to get back to her now it is still there in you and you cannot go off and look at some old street or some old painting without feeling it your body and a few things that happen the day before that do not mean much by themselves or would not mean much if you were not having this thing together but you cannot forget and it is all inside if you all the time it is more say sixteen into a hundred would be six dollars an hour which is not too much but it is not over when it ends and and it goes on after it is all over she still inside you a sweet occur your filled with her everything about ears kind of bled into you her voice or smell the way her body moves it is all inside of you at least for a while after then you begin to lose it and ism beginning to lose it you are afraid how weak you are that you cannot get her all back into you again and now the whole thing is going to be out of your body and it is more in your mind than in your body and the pictures come t you one by one and you look at them some of them last longer than others the pictures come to you and you have to hope they will not lose their life too fast and dry up though they will and that you also forget some of what happened because already you are turning up little things that you nearly forgot we were in bed and she asked me do i seem fat to you and i was surprised because she did not seem to worry about herself at all in that way and i guess i was reading into it that she did worry about herself i answered what i was thinking and said stupidly that she had a very beautiful body that her body was perfect and i really meant it as an answer but she said kind of sharply that is not what i asked and i had to try to answer her again exactly what she had asked and once she lay over against me late at night and she started talking her breath in my ear and she just went on and on and talked faster and faster she could not stop and i loved it and just felt that all that life an her was running in to me too i had little life in me her life for fire was coming into me in that hot breath in my ear n i just wanted to go on talking for ever right there next to me and i would go on living that i would be able to go on living but without her i do not know then you forget some of it all they be most of it all almost all of it in the end and you work hart at remembering everything tell you will not never forget but you can kill it too even by thinking about it too much though you cannot help but thinking about it nearly all the time and then when the pictures dart to go you start asking some questions just little questions that sitting your mind without any answers why did she leave the light on when you came to bed one night but it was off the next but she had it on the night after that and she had it off the last night who and and other question little questions that nugget you that and finally the pictures go and these dry little questions just sit there without any answers and you left with this large heavy pain in you that you tried to numb by reading or you try to ease it by getting out into public places where they will be people around you but no matter how good you are pushing that pain away just when yo think you arguing to be all right for a little while that you are safe your kind of holding it off with all your strength and your staying and some bare little numb spot of ground then suddenly will all come back you will hear a noise maybe's a cat crying or a babe something else her cry you hear it and make that connection in a part of you have no control over and that pain comes back hard that you're afraid afraid o how your gin a fall back into it again and you wonder know your terrified it how you are ever get a climb out of it it is not every hour of the day while it is happen it is really for hours an hours every day after that for weeks though less and less that you could work out o ratio if you want maybe after six weeks can only thinking about it an hour or when the day all to gather a few minutes here and there spread over or a few minutes here and there and a half an hour before you go to sleep were sometimes it all comes back and you stay awake half the night when you had up all that you've only spent maybe three hours an hour on it if you have to figure in the bad times too i do not know there were not any bad times it her though maybe there was one bad time when i told her i loved her i could not help it and this was the first time this had happened with her and now i was half falling in love with her or maybe completely if she would let me but she could not or i could not completely because it was all on to be short and other things too and i told her and i did not know of any way to tell her first that she did not have to feel that this was a burden you the fact that i loved her or that she did not have to feel the same about me or say the same back that it was just that i had to tell her that is all because it was bursting inside me and saying it would even begin to take care of what i was feeling really i could not say anything of what i was feeling because there was much words could not handle it and making love only made it worse because then i wanted words badly but there were no good no good at all but i told her anyway i was lying on top of her and her hands were up by her head in my hands were on hers and or fingers were locked an there was a little light on her face from the window but i could not see her and i was afraid to say it but i had to say it because i wanted her to know it was the last night i had to tell her then or it'd never have another chance and i just said before you go to sleep i have to tell you before you go to sleep that i love you and immediately right away after she said i love you to and it sounded to me as if she did not mean it a little flat but then it usually sounds flat when somebody says i love you too because there just saying it back even if they do mean it and the problem is that it'll never know if she meant it or maybe someday she will tell me whether she wanted or not but there isn't there is no way to know now and ism sorry i did that it was a trap i did not mean to put her in i i can see it was a trap because if she had not said anything at all that would have hurt me too as though she were taking something from me and just accepting it not giving anything back she rally had to i mean even if just to be kind she had to say it and i do not really know now if she meant t another bad time or it was not exactly bad but tit was not easy either was when i had to leave the time was coming and i was beginning to tremble and feel empty nothing in the middle of me nothing inside t nothing to hold me up on my legs and then it came everything was ready an i had to go was just a kiss a quick one as though we were afraid of what might happen after a kiss and she was almost wild then a she reached up to a hook by the door d took an old shirt a green and blue shirt from the hook and put it in my arms for me to take away the soft cloth was full of her smell and then we stood the close together looking at this piece of paper she had in her hand and i did not lose any it i was holding it tight that last minute or two because this was it we would come to the end of it things always chasing this was really it over maybe it works out all right maybe you have not lost for doing it i do not know now really mean sometimes when you think of it you feel a prince really you feel just a king and other times you are afraid you are afraid not not all the time but now and then of what it is going to do to you it is hard to know what to do with it now walking away i look back once and the door was still open i could see her standing far back in the dark in the room i and only really see her white face still looking out at me in her white arms i guess you get to a point where you look at that pain as if it were there in front of you three feet away lying in a box and open box in a window somewhere it is hard and cold a bar of metal you just look at it there and say all right it'll take it all by it hat's what it is because all about it before you've go into this thing the pain is part of the whole thing and it is not that we can say afterwards the pleasure was greater than the pain and that is why you would do it again that it is nothing to do with t you cannot measure it because the pain comes after and it last longer the question really is why does not the pain make you say i will not do it again when the pain is bad that you have to say that but you do not ism just thinking about it how you can go in with six hundred dollars more a thousand and how you can come out with an old shirt marabou reading whidah dais his story break it down it was fears

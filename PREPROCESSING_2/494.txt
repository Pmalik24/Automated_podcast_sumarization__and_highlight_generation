welcome to the superman lanponcas a science science the to my name is drew supermen and om a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine this pod cast a separate from my teaching a research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire an effort to bring u zero cosmic consumer information about science and science related tools in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens athletic greens is an a in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand in twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens an the reason i still take athletigreens once or twice o day is that t helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which our vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called gopmicrobiom and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens i get the vitamins i need the minerals i need and the phobics to support my microfilm if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock cam slash supermen and claim a special offer they'll give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitemend three k too there are ton of at and ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if wore getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient incitement d three and k too is also important because it regulates things cardiovascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic green stock cam slash supermen to claim the special offer of the fire travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar have talk many times before on this podcast about the key role of hydration end electrolytes for nerve sell function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues in organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium an potassium present in the preparation all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the preparations of electrolytes if you to try element you can go to drink element that is element doc cam slash supermen and you will get a free element sample pack with your purchase there all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to element element do am lash supermen let us talk about nerd plasticity more specifically let us talk about how we can optimize our brains nerd plasticity is this incredible feature of our nervous system that allows it to change itself even in ways that we consciously decide now that is an incredible property our liver cannot decide to just change itself our spleen cannot decide to just change itself through conscious thought or through feed back from another person the sells and those tissues can make changes sure but it is our nervous system that harbors this incredible ability to direct its own changes in ways that we believe or we are told will serve us better now to day's a really special episode because while we are going to talk about science and as always we will delving to mechanism to day's episode is really geared toward answering your most common questions about how to leverage neral plasticity the previous episodes were about focus and how to achieve focus for sake of plasticity as well as the last episode which is what are some of the portals into plasticity that relate to movement how behavior can activate plasticity as well as how to activate plasticity for behave ourself how to get better at learning certain movements to day's podcast is really directed toward answering your most common questions and the bigger theme of how does one go about optimizing their brain or even think about optimizing the brain what is this thing that were calling optimizing the brain in doing ism also going a share some of my typical routines in tools i do not share these because i think that they are the only ones that are available out there certainly they're not nor do i share them because i think that everyone should do them just as i do them certainly not i share them because many of you have asked for very concrete examples of what i do and when and it'll share those with you and you can decide whether not those protocols are for you or not everybody's different but there are some common features of how we are all put together at the level of the nervous system an body that direct us toward particular practices particular routines that can be especially powerful for neral plasticity i want to open up the discussion to day by emphasizing something that is fundamentally important which is that plasticity is not the goal plasticity is never the goal plasticity is simply a state or a capacity for our nervous system to change and nothing makes me more frustrated perhaps then when i hear oh this pill this potion this practice it gives you plasticity plasticity is just change the real question is what you chino change and specifically what goal are you trying to achieve specific goals might be extremely specific you want to learn how to speak a particular language are you want to learn and new motor skill are you want to get very good it calculous or you would to forget the bad emotions related to a particular human being or experience or can be more general you would to be more creative why should talk about creative creativity to day or you would to achieve more focus or you to be less stressed is very important that you understand that plasticity and achieving plasticity is the first step in what we call optimizing your brain you do not want your brain to be plastic all the time in fact one of the major questions one of the major unsolved mysteries of hero science is how each in every one of us wakes up every day and now who we are why should that be well the brain is plastic it has a capacity to change throughout the life seen but it is not plastic that every night when we go to sleep or in our waking that the connections get reconfigured much that we forget who we are how to walk or how to eat it is a good thing that we do not have such robust plasticity or on going plasticity that we have to restructure ourselves each day it is part of what gives our life continuity remember plasticity is not and is never the goal the goal is to figure out how to access plasticity and then to direct that plasticity toward particular goals or changes that you would to achieve and i should just mention there is no rule that in life you have do leverage this incredible thing called neural plasticity no one said you had to do that this pot last and this episode is particularly for people who are either happy or unhappy with where there at with a particular aspect of their life and they want to shift it in some positive way and many of you listening might say would not every one want to do that will actually there are a certain number of people that are pretty good where they are at and they do not want to change and that is terrific and i ism tip my hat to them and i think that is wonderful if ever they decide that they want to leverage these plasticity mechanisms they cannot at any stage throughout the life span let us start by talking about the different systems within the nervous system that are available for plasticity and in doing all frame them in the context of what i do on a daily basis on a weekly basis and on a yearly basis first of all there are several forms of plasticity they have names long term potentiation long term depression which has nothing to do with emotional depression by the way and things spike timing dependent plasticity those names are use to describe cellular phenomenon the actual ways that the snaps as the connections between your ants change it'll mention those things and it'll give a little more meat as to what they are as i mention them but that is probably not the best way to think about plasticity in terms of optimizing your brain the best way think about it in terms of short term medium term and long term plasticity short term plasticity is any kind of shift that you want to achieve in the moment or in the day but that you do not necessarily want to hold on to forever unis of what kinds of things are those well for instance short tern plasticity might be you wake up earlier than you would to catch a flight you are not feeling particularly alert and you want to use a protocol or you decide to use a protocol which could be coffee or it could be a certain form or breathing or could be some other tool to become more alert at a time a day when normally you are not that alert but your expectation is that when you return home you will discard with that the need to do that at five thirty a m because you will be asleep at five thirty m there short term plastic behavioral plasticity then there is medium term plasticity which are changes that you might want to make i call this a with respect am and a little bit of humor relies my funny humor i call this the the under graduate a premed phenomenon for those you that have worked with a premeds an have tremendous respect for a medical students and premeds there is a a kind of a stereo type which i do not a necessarily agree with but the stereotype is that they want to know what they need to know for sake of the exam but they do not really want know they just want the a and i do not think that is always true have worked with a number of different premeds over the years and ah they're many of them that are absolutely a passionate about the knowledge itself and they also wanted the a but the premed phenomenon as its discussed among professors and t as is that that you got these students they just want to know what they need to know they can get the a right it is medium term plasticity they do not actually want it to be imbedded in their memory too long or else they would actually care about the information that is medium term information and sometimes that is useful for instance if you go on vacation to costereca and you do not know your way around costerick you want to learn that different town in the routes there you do not have any intention of going back its just medium term you wanted to program it in for sake of your time there n than you want to ti scared most of the time when we think about or talk about optimizing the brain where time bout long term plasticity we are talking about the kinds of changes that people want to make that their brain reflectively works differently this is what a child does when it goes from not knowing how to walk to knowing how to walk does not have to think about it after it learns how to walk it becomes reflective long term plasticity is almost always the big goal it is i want to know how to speak that language i want to be able to do that skill i want to be able to feel this way without having to put much work into it and there are tools and protocols that one can do to achieve that and we are going to talk about those were talked about a few of them and previous episodes but i revisit those protocols to day ism in a frame all this in the context of the daily life the weekly life and the yearly life and that is because neural plasticity and optimizing your brain rides on a deep per foundation of this thing that governs plasticity an fin fact governs all our life called autonomic arousal which is that we are asleep for part of the twenty four hour cycle and we are awake almost always if we push ourselves in stay awake we are oke we can do that for a night or two but almost always we are asleep for a portion of it and we are awake for a portion of it have said it before but it'll say it again the trigger for plasticity and learning occurs during high focus his alert in estates not while you are asleep and the focus and alertness are both keep because of the agrochemicals associated with those states but the actual rewiring and the reconfiguration of the bring connections happens during non sleep deep rest which will talk more about as always and deep sleep you trigger the change and in sleep you get the change some of the things that will talk about to day about optimizing the brain our centered around not sleep but around the autonomic arousal system we have this system of neurons in our brain and body that is just incredible that wake us up and make us alert and when we are not accessing that system well we cannot access plasticity we can not optimize our brain likewise if we cannot sleep well and we cannot rest well we will not access plasticity and rewire our brain because that is when the actual configuration between the connections occurs to set this in contact i wake up each day and it'll be totally honest i usually do not feel bouncing right out of bed i usually do not feel completely rested and that is not because i do not get enough sleep it is probably because ism not terrific about timing my sleep well now this month is not about sleep that was the previous month but i really wont emphasize a few points i wake up generally more tired and groggy than i would because i tend to go to sleep too late it is just me ink that i do i not tend to get up early either because i set an alarm because have things to do or because i naturally wake up early because the coming in and forth well what that tells me is that ism probably somebody whose natural circadian rhythm you may have hard of chronotype sees are genetically program things but prototype is shorter than twenty four hours it means that the cycle of waking and alertness for me is probably shorter than twenty four hours which means that getting some light in the late afternoon will help me shift and make my cycle will bit longer it will fades to lay me if that does not make any sense see a previous episode but what it really means is getting some light the afternoon willallow me to stay up a little bit later but what it means is that ism not really matching my hard wired needs of going to bed probably at eight thirty or nine and waking up at for a m i tend to go to sleep around ten thirty eleven lately around eleven thirty or twelve and then i wake up at six and of corse ism in a feel groggy nor plasticity will allow me to optimize my wakefulness but i have to do something in order to acts us that that and some of you may already be anticipating what ism about to say which is on he is going to tell us to get sunlight in our eyes in the first thirty men of the day i am in to tell you to do that but ism an also tell you two things that have have not discussed before which relate to the plasticity between the melonopsen cells these sunlight detecting bright light detecting cells in our eye and the circadian clock have never said this before in this podcast but it turns out that the connections between these melons and cells in the circadian clock are plastic throughout the life spin there is a massive configuration of the connections there and a teletype called the atrocities which it are a gleam cell are actively removing and reenforcing connections between the eye and that clock every day now this is incredible because other aspects of your brain that for instance a represent you knowing who you are when you wake up in the morning or what your name is assuming that you are old enoughthat you've already learned your name when the first thing kids learn and something we rarely ever forget those connections are changing all the time every twenty for our cycle there is an opportunity for short turn elasticity that is why give u sunlight first thing in the day helps me wake up the other thing that i do is that there is a spirit that exists between the circadian clock and are a adrenals that have talked about before that trigger's the release of cortesall first thing in the morning that wakes us up especially when we view light if you are groggy in the morning that is why viewing light is helpful but the interesting thing is if you start viewing light frequently in the morning then those connections between the melons and cells and the circadian clock become primed or potentiate we would say they becomes stronger for the anticipation of light and you naturally start waking up earlier feeling more alert what this says is and what i do is i get that regular light because i know that some mornings ism just nock in a feel very lerdall feel especially tired and i might not be able to cases sunlight because it is really overcast a om travelling or some other feature but the system is plastic it shifted in the right direction now it will shift back because it short turn plastic after about two three days you want to try and get the sunlight exposure on a regular basis the other thing that i do is i delay my intake of caffeine for the first two hours that ism awake now it this can be very painful for people but early are we talked about the adenosine system and how the accumulation of a denizens makes us sleepy and caffeine suppresses a dentine it makes us feel let but we know that if you ingest caffeine immediately on waking the signal to the adrenals to release cortical which is a healthy release of coatis all and the suppression of a denizens that that a that happens as we come out of sleep when deep and in deep sleep the suppression of a denizens if you invest caffeine to early there is a mechanism by which the adenosine competes forth receptors et camera that you have a mid morning crash because if the if affine the wait works as if affine is occupying the a decisive receptor then the natural and erogenous mechanisms for suppressing the decisive are not acting an have their action the brain to a renal axis is subject to plasticity also and by delaying affine until about two hours after waking ism able to capture and reinforce to potentiate the curl circuit that exists between the circadian clock and the quart rs all release in the adrenals as well as leave those a decisive receptors unoccupied that i can then use the affine to get a natural lift in alertness and focus two hours later as opposed to using it just to wake myself up out of sleepiness while ism sure there are some roles out there in some sons but on it is the sunlight in the morning thing again it is a powerful tool for readjusting these circuits the short turn plasticity and the reason for delaying affine for the first two hours of the day even if it is painful to do for the first couple days is that then you naturally start to wake up more readily in the morning without affine because the a decisive is suppressed and you do not have these competing i it is in it is called a competing antagonist for the a decisive receptor i wake up i get sunlight in my eyes lately because i wake up very early i do use a bright light om to stimulate a alertness it is not actually design for that purpose that is just a light board that's of about nine hundred lucks and then i delay affine some of you have asked and again ism not saying that one has to do this what exactly do you drink ism a big believer in black coffee i just happen a black coffee people have asked me about and i do not want name brannames hereabout this type of coffee or that type of coffee mixed with these other kinds of things will that increase focus where can i men a talk to day a lot about the use of of diet and fasting and timing of foods and certain kinds of foods but to be honest black coffee is just at simple choice that is always work for me i also make sure a hydrate first thing in the morning there are plenty of data now showing that even a slight increase in dehydration meaning just when you are lacking water can make people have headaches it can provide and some additionalphotophobia for those you that are migraine prone bright light can trigger grains that is no surprise to those of you that get headaches an grains but dehydration can can compound the vulnerability to grain and headache i drink water i drink black coffee i drink mate which is just a because i have argentine lineage which is just a a high waffle drink firstingin the morning but i delay it until two hours after i wake up and that is because i want the circuits between my eye and my and my circadian clock and my adrenals to be functioning in a particular way that then later the affine is an addition it adds more alertness now this is he discussion about hot optimize your brain many people who wake up quickly and just naturally feel bouncing out of bed i envy these people they will do just fine by going into a learning bout or taking care of a whatever it is that they need to take care of sometimes that is kind of more mundane tasks male or o and what not here is a more o less a a rule about how the brain functions visa i focus learning and creativity and ism discuss this much more in future episodes generally states of high alertness when we are very very alert are great for strategy implementation when we already know how to do something and it is just just some simply matter of plugging the correct elements in to the correct boxes things om have talked before about duration path and outcome as the three things that the deliberate conscious brain is trying to figure out in order to perform certain task even cogon tass this is the sort of thing that we are very good at when we are well rested and we are focus and are autonomic arousal it oral alertness rather as it is at a high level if you are somebody who is hitting that alertness phase of your day very early right after you wake up that is a great time to move right into things that at least the research says you already know have the strategy you just one implement the strategy this is where i fundamentally depart from the idea that oh you have to do the hardest or most critical task throughout the day sometimes the hardest amongst critical task are task that require creativity and as will soon talk about creativity and tasks relatato it often times come come to us best or the brain is best at achieving those when we are in states of calm or even slightly drowsy which is something it is interesting and will get into but for me for instance i get up ism not terribly alert first thing and i try and just get my brain in my thoughts organized it is not a time for me to be responding in a very linear fashion to males or carrying out calculations that comes about two hours later i think ism many people out there will relate mid morning is when we tend to when many people tend to achieve their peak in alertness and focus no many times i get the question and this is this what ism about to say is directly related to the hundreds of questions i got about this should i use background music in order to learn should i have o mono construction next door is that a good thing or a bad thing is it better to be in complete silence et camera now this will vary some people can tolerate their own noise within their head much better than others other people find that having some background noise helps cancel that out but there is a simple rule of thumb that one can use because at least my experience is that sometimes background music background noise is very helpful for allowing me to focus and other times it is very distracting what actually governs that well we have to ask ourselves what is at the force of the lack of focus if our lack of focus is because our autonomic arousal are our alertness is very very high we had a little too much coffee we if there is such a thing sleptalittle too long or we are really stressed or really activated and we cannot seem to focus in that case eliminating background noise and really just trying to get silence that we can quiet some of that autonomic arousal is going to be best for learning and for implementation of things we already know how to do for any kind of focus linear task which basically learning is a focus linear tasks that you're just not naserely performing it well all the time last time we talk about making errors as a rule of thumb if you are feeling two keyed up then silence and quiet is going to be helpful in fact if your very keyed up a particular circuit related to the bail ganglia starts getting triggered more easily and the circuit who men a talk about in depth but its called the go no go circuit we have circuits that connect our forebrain to its structure in our bring called the basil ganglia which is actually collection of structures and the forebrain which is involved in rational thought and thinking and planning an action is always trying to plan what should i do and then implement that action and the basil ganglia are intimately involved in that discussion there's a reciprocal loop of communication between basil ganglia quarter the bail ganglia has one set of connections to the quarter and the quarters back to the basil ganglia that facilitates go if facilitates action and the molecule the demodulator dopamine triggers the activation of go it tends to make us want to do more things it tends to make us bus toward action by the way that dopamine binds to something called the d one receptors to the particular kept dopamine receptor for those either want to know the no go pathway the pathway in the basil ganglia and quarter that suppress is action it involves dopamine binding to this other rest eve recalled the demo receptor now d one d to receptors you cannot jobs consciously timid oh i only want my d one receptors of my d to receptors be t to be active you have to think about which sorts of states of mind and body facilitate go and which ones facilitate no go now this is critically important because doing focus work access in plasticity and learning involve doing certain things and not doing others her's how it works and hears how i apply it on a daily basis because i tend to be most alert first thingmidmorning or and then i generally i have my canine midmorning my hot peak of alertness in the early part of the d ay is occurring for me some time between nine thirty and eleven am that is just me other people might experience that immediately after rolling out of bed they might be wide awake and ready to go which case they sound be cautious about throwing cabin into mix because can its can make them very very alert there three sort of levels of autonomic arousal of alertness that bias us more toward go no go or both and this relates to a question that have got now hundreds of times from you in the comment section for this podcast which is is it better for me to listen to music in the background while i work and learn or should i have complete silence and the answer is it depends but it does not depend randomly on who you are or even necessarily time of day it depends on your oval overall level of autonomic arousal and it depends because autonomic arousal level of alertness biases the extent to which we are more prone to goes to action or to no goes to suppress action and dopa mean is this molecule that swimming around and is going to bias one or the other responses for heres out works let us say ism very alert maybe i got a particularly good nights sleep the night before i had a little too much coffee and ism in a sit down to some work the thing to know and what i always tell myself is when ism very alert i am very prone to go to action but ism also prone to not no go right ism not can be very good at suppressing action those are two different things being buys toward action and being buys toward suppressing action are two different things moi those pare pushball toward action suppress action when your very alert the tendency is for everything to be a stimulus this is why when people say well should i just take a drug that will increase my level of apinaffran and alertness will that help me learn better no because it will make you do things but it will also make you less good at suppressing actions that you need to suppress if ism very alert particularly let for me and i recognize what that state is of course cause everyone will be different i know what it is for me then i want silence for learning i want it shut down my internet which i do i sometimes use a program that i i believe as a free program called freedom where it it actually locks you out of the internet for particular time they are not a sponge for the pockets i just happen to use it ism there is another version or freedom where you go to the wireless thing you turn it off you disconnect from the wireless that is the other one although many people have a hard time not reactive eating it ism trying to shut down the the go pathway towards distraction and the other thing that it'll do as it'll generally turn off my phone put the phone outside in the car or in really extreme cases it'll put it it'll throw it up on the roof which is hard for me to retrieve as to at i cannot get to it if ism very alert ism aware that i will have a bias toward action it will be hard for me to suppress donation but that it is very non specific because the next kind of level down of alertness or autonomic arousal is clear calm and focus where we have that kind of sweet spot between our willingness to pursue action we are in a mode of go and it is not always physical action but it can be pursuing hard bouts of learning but that our ability to suppress is also very good and this is because and i do not wat to get into too many details because of the way that dopamine competes for these dopamine one receptors in the go pathway and doping two receptors in the logo pathway there always in this kind of pushups and there is a sweet spot and that sweet spot is not flow where it is in some sort of state where all t e sudden things come naturally to us the state that we are trying to achieve that is optimal for learning is one in which we have the energy and focus to pursue but we also have the energy and focus to suppress action the bail angler con o working in a perfect kind of singsong manner through this parallel pathway now as we get tired or as we round out in a trade an psyche of about ninety minutes what happens is our fatigue even if it is not a physical fatigue that makes us want to go to sleet but our mental fatigue starts to accumulate because these pathways of go logo are actually very metabolically consuming what i recognize is that as the start to falter i have a partner time engaging and going i also know or going toward the goal rather i also know that my reflects toward actions that are unrelated to the learning are also going to start increasing because ice not and be able to suppress the have not ton be able to suppress action and act private the logo pathway if this all sounds a mouthful let us make it very simple for you when you are very alert the best situation for learning is going to be silence it is going to be complete quiet if you are lowerousal and you are tired in your kind of sleepy a lot of people find that having some background chatter in some background noise can help elevate their level of autonomic arousal and that is because our auditory system in our visual system are linked and our part of really at what is called the salients network which is that we are always scanning our environment for things and when we have a lot of things in our environment to scan generally our level of alertness goes up this is why environments that are very stark or have very little of or very few objects in them tend to make us feel kind of calm because our salients network kind of shuts off lot people do not that they will go to a meditation street retreat here they will go into an environment where there is very little computer especially city people and all sudden they start feeling really really anxious and that is because there internal level of autonomic royals really high and it is not being occupied by all the stuff to pay attention to and their salients network starts to turn inward they move from exeteroception to interception their onlooking outside themselves thy looking inside themselves and there's a lot noise in there as a rule of thumb if you tend to be kind of on the high level of alertness and kind of anxiety on and i'mnotie ma clinical levels of anxiety but you tend to be pretty high energy well then you are defend going to benefit more in a learning bout from learning to go as well as activate the no go pathway an that requires a lot of energy and we have a lot of distractions in your environment there is a high probability that you can be distracted from the learning now some people are just actually more calm they my bulldog costello who's exceedingly calm their pretty mellow there kind of clear common focus all of the time and those people actually are going to be less flammable there not going to be yanked around by background noise ere their not to be rout bothered from their learning or from their studying by a clanging of a pot from somebody in the kitchen each one of us generally tends to ride up and down this autonomic a latter to speak that different times to day for most people three hours after waking those three hours t not three hours on the mark but that three hour been tends to be the period in which their most alert throughout the day except it'll tell you later about a unique time right before sleep in which your also very very alert naturally that morning three hours is quite vital now many of you might ask about exercise and when to exercise i think i may have mention this on a previous podcast episode but the research shows that at least for performance afternoon exercise might be better in terms of avoiding injury et camera but in terms of rising body temperatures they it and matching body temperature to mental heartless et camera it is pretty clear that exercising early in the day not only buys us us towards waking up earlier but that it also triggers the release of things pan offering another nromodulators that lend itself to a situation where we have heighten levels of arousal and mentalacuity in the late morning and even into the afternoon this can be very good because if you one a restrict most of your focus learning to the early part of the day exercising early in the day does set a narrow chemical context million forgo it tends to trigger activation of the go pathway and for those of you myself of a hard time cold of engaging and getting into action early in the day early morning exercise within an hour of waking and certainly no later than three hours after waking we will give you quoting quit more energy throughout the day it will make you feel more bias for action you will not feel as lethargic in kind of reviewing what have set up until now i do the morning lightning i delay my caffeine two hours after waking and then i generally try and get exercise and in the first hour or ideally within the first three hours awaking up and then it'll move into a focus learning bout now some of you wrote to me in said if i exercise early in the day then i feel a crash afterwards if that exercises very very intense an you are depleting all your glycogen your doing heavy dead lifts et camera chances are after you eat you will tart to feel a crash this relates to timing of nutrition and in just as a general rule of thumb fasted states and low carbohydrate states a not taking about a a quite diet round the clock or all weak but fasted states and low carbohydrate states lend themselves to a alertness and that is because carbohydrates are rich in trip to fan and they tend to lend themselves to sleepiness of course investing large amounts of any kind of food any substance that fills your gut will divert blood to your gut if you eat a lot of food regardless of with a none a lot of carbohydrate or not you are going to generally feel more sleepy now many people including everyone use food to modulate their levels of autonomic arousal and typically eating shifts us sorts towards a state of calm and fasting shifts us more toward a state of alertness and these are hard wired circuits that relate to the need and desire to find food which requires action or that called it rest in digest system which i diverts our resources in our energy towards digestion and makes us feel calm i personally rely on water mate and black coffee first thing in the day in order to exercise and get into the first surround of work if i find that ism too alert and then i generally will tend to eat and kind of bring down my level of alertness and will continue working now this is not a strict thing and since people asked me what i do a and i ism not dictating that people follow it exactly of course or even generally but it'll just tell you what i do it is possible if your drinking black coffee and your ornate and your investing a lot of water that you are going to dehydrate yourself somewhat because of excretion of sodium provided you do not have hypertension salt is a really good thing lot of people think that they are low on bloodshurer because there shaky and they camp thank or they have a headache when actually their low an sodium and especially f were drinking a lot of caff ism a big believer in salt i drink salt water firstling in the morning because i drink black coffee and that keeps my levels of a alertness really good i always thought that i had messed up blood sugar a you shaky hands and i did not knowhow was going on have drink a obit of coffee and feel too camped up and turns out that this it was a sodium issue and if i just drank a water with a little bit of of peasant and or even just general table it typical table salt then have felt rock solid in terms of my blood sugar now again ism not a physician ism a professor i do not prescribe anything but i profess lots of things i do not want to people have diabetes or blood sugar issues to you nowt go off the rails your responsible for your health not me but it is an interesting perimeter to think about and and experiment with you now provided your doctor says it is soke because i think a lot of people probably just too much sodium but a lot of people might be sodium deficient in particular the people that are fasting i typically eat my first me real right around a midday whether not have exercised or not and the food content there is actually quite important to me i do not know why this is i do not have a scientific mechanism for this but if i eat hot food for lunch i get sleepy after lunch i generally do not eat hot food for lunch i might have a obit a sup or something that but in general i rely on a low cargo hydrate meal it'll eat meat or salad or some variation that and nuts and fats and things that because of the cosine content for focus because the profile's good in my belief and because i believe in eating fruits and vegetables i do that to if have exercised very hard early in the day i do in jest starches o meal or ascertain fruit in things that now why am i telling you all this because am hundreds if not a thousand people ask me is fasting good for focus and indeed fasting will increase alertness but if you are hungry or preoccupied with food that you cannot focus will then it is not can be good for learning it is only can o be good for agitation now it'll ism just get a mark continual march through my day and this is of course a at what i experience some people are quite different but what i find is a round two or three p ami it a getting a little grog he a little bit sleepy i will tend to shift my work from work that requires a lot of duration path outcome really careful analysis and activation of the logo pathway meaning ism trying to suppress the impulse to look at my phone or ans we email or do other things this is why i have an meld you back until three in the afternoon by the way a responded to your text messages whoever you are out there around early afternoon i find i can do kind of typical moremondane tasks because those tasks are require less caught they have require less cognitive load and they can be done more or less in and out of sequence i can answer a couple man here may be answer that you tell there i do not have to do it in impure line or fashion any kind of linear work or learning work is going to take a lot of focus and then typically around four p m or i do two things sometimes a little earlier sone is a layer but i do two things one is i make sure i hydrate because if your exercising and your eating you need to digest that food at camera i make sure i hydrates i drink water i trying refrain from drinking coffee in the afternoon this is a new thing for me i sometimes do it but i try refrain from that and then i always do ay nonslip deep breast protocol sometime in the afternoon this is sometimes a ten minute yoganidura type protocol or a thirty minute yoganitor type protocol these are protocols i have no relationship to no business relationship to whatsoever have been doing them for years now they involve listening to a script will provide the line again although we repay them before or it'll do a hypnosis protocol from revery health which is my collie gave its beagles website that has these free hypnosis a as or a scrip ps the you can listen to and those take me into a state of really deep rest some times much that i fall asleep and i always set an alarms that i do not sleep for longer the ninety minutes but typically disguises for about thirty minutes i do that because for me by about four thirty in the afternoon ism capable of doing basically nothing i am just a complete costello i cannot think i cannot do i cannot respond the email have just completely trough my ability to function i personally find it a mistake to that point down a double express and charge really hard it just does not work for me i and up really disrupting my sleep schedualand abdestrupting a lot of different thing for me i do the nonslip deep least protocol it really helps me later when i need to fall asleep it helps with all sorts of things m as i mention before but i usually emerge from that a little groggy or feeling i have a another whole day second win i could just work work work work work and then it'll do a second bout of learning it'll do some sort of work that either involves linear a analysis of something may be numerical work or ism try to learn something i generally try and really use those bouts of ninety minute focus energy after the non sleep deep least as i mention and previous episodes there is a lot of evidence that these non sleep deep least protocols can enhance in e celebrate plasticity i the most i think recon and om striking of one is the study that we reference last time in the capture notes is the cell press article om sell reports great journal was showing that these twenty minute o not a shallow naps and non sleep deep least can facilitate sensory motor learning then it'll going another learning bout that is caffeine free this learning bout is very different than the than the morning one this is a work bout er learning bout that is more in the clear common focus regime because have come out of this non sleep deep rest ism not investing affine because i want to make sure that i can sleep later that night really well and this tends to be more when i do creative type work now creativity is a topic that we are in a spend the entire month on a coming up soon but creativity is a very interesting state of mind in which we are taking existing elements things that we already know and rearranging them in ways that are novel at it will a that is what creativity is but creativity has two parts it has a creative discovery mode where your kind of shuffling things around an a very relaxed way and i being playful or exploring different configurations and then creativity also has and absolutely linear implementation mode in which take the the idea or the design you have come up with and you create something very rope rousting concrete and creativity is really a two part thing and the first part of actively exploring different configuration sometimes in the pal eyeful way sometimes in a ah in a way that is almost random an just kind of exploring that state is definitely facilitated by being relaxed and almost sleepy that is not a state that i personally can access very well early in the day have tried to access at coming out of sleep because one would say well your still sleepy early in the day and just does not work most of what i write down most of what i do is complete garbage and what i found is there is this block in the afternoon of about ninety minutes where i can do creative typewriting or creative type imagination of a scientific ideas or experiments we might want to do science might not seem a creative endeavor to any of you but it is has a lot of imagining what if this or we could combine that an thinking of novel concepts or ways of arranging things when you find yourself in that kind o clear common focus mode creative works tend to come about very well in in those regimes i know the lot of people out there rely on substances to access creative states a ism not a meriuanta user it is just not the drug for me a for variety of reasons ism not a drinker not not the substance for me for a variety of reasons a ism not a cop ism not now here to tell you what they should do or should not do the problem with using substances to access creativity is that generally the ones that the substances that relax people we will low them to get into that creative brain storming mode but not good at the linearumpomentation mode a the other day i was a remarking with a friend that there is some adds some advertisements that have seen over the years h that are just incredible a it'll just tell you what they are that is not critic and de revealing my taste here there is a one there is a particular perfume ad that spite ones made that is just amazing is just it'll put a link to it cause is just cool and it is just and and it has an there is i don't want to give away the end but it has a feature of it that is particularly interesting to me as a narrow scientist a it s cool and i i because i go up in the skateboarding thing i knew obit about spikes movies and skateboarding anise of course made a lot of a very impressive a popular movies as well full length features a i do not know hin personally s this as an a plug not that he needs my endorsement for anything at all but the the amazing thing about this advertisement is it is a kind of it is a collection of things that you would never really think would be combined and it involves different speeds of motion and in all sorts of effects i mind it is a real classic spite ones kind of delivery but what is incredible is not when you think about occult the fact that someone had to imagine that but to actually implement the steps in order to create that when you see this you will realize that was a haul of work you cannot just put that together randomly and a lot of people not spike clearly but a lot of people who can who have in an incredible mind for ideas and novel novel arrangements of things they are great at accessing that state but not good at accessing the implementation state and then there it is also true that a lot of people and some who tend to fall on what we would call the kind of for asbergers a autism end of the spectrum are very good at linear implementation not on seeing about all forms of autism of course om sensitive to the fact that there many forms on the spectrum but some people are very good at linear implementation and that is a separate state from creative states that afternoon block as when i try an access the free kind of looser mind set that is associate with the fatigue that comes later in the afternoon and for some of you that state that favors creativity and creative learning might be better in the morning i do not know your can have to decide for some of you you are going to be late shifted some of you're on be morning shifted but where we have alertness generally we are good at linear implementation were good at activating the logo pathway in suppressing action and we are good it at pursuing particular goals and and strategy implementation and where we tend to be more relaxed we tend to be almost in a kind of sleepy mode for me coming out of one of these non sleep deep restores are or sleep that is when we tend to be better at novel configurations of existing elements which is creativity and this brings about a question that i get all the time which is what about psychedelics i am going to talk to some experts on psychedelics i hope to bring some of them in i tally speaking of people coming in or creatures coming in a creature that is defiling not on psychedelics who does not need any is costello and he just arrived he seems to be in a sleepy state most all the time body a don you come in ye he is working on his fifteenth sleep deep rest episode of the day which is generally followed by a tend to twelve hour deep least episodes almost exclusively comprised of red and i know this cause his eyes are open cause here droopy cannot closumalaway and his eyes are gone this and he is gone down for the count s ye nice pigeon o k psychedelics first of all i want to be very clear i am neither a proponent nor am i somebody who rejects the potential roll of psychedelics i do however think that psychedelics can be particularly hazardous for people who have preexisting psychological issues and are not working with a word certified psychaatristerphysician as well as for essentially all kids i think that the young brain is basically in its own psychedelic state and just naturally om and at all kitting aside i think that the young brain is subject to normal plasticity that drugs which psychedelics which are very powerful can be detrimental to the developing brain that is just my stance if anyone disagrees with me it'd be happy to oh t with you about it in a o in a polite and a discourse a be happy e listen as well as tell you more why i believe that based on the data i mentioning psychedelics because many of you ask here is the deal with psychedelics at least here's how they work in a nutshell psychedelics we are thought to unleash sensory processing and to make it less filtered we have a lot of different inputs from our eyes from our ears from our know from what taste et camera that your coming in all the time in parallel and we have mechanisms that suppress some of those and allow us to only focus one things that are happening visually generally we do not have synesthesias unless some of us happen a cynesesia we do not blend what we see with what we hear in a way that is confusing tour we know what is making sounds and we know what is a visual stimulus on psychedelics people report being able to smell colors or to on here trees et camera and that is because there is a lot of sensory blending however that is led to the misconception that sensory blending itself is a creative process there is nothing creative about sensory blending that there is the essence of a creative process is that some novel configuration of elements whether not its notes on a piano or with not words on a page whether not its numbers or whither not its movement that some way in which those are configured in some new way that the algorithm the way in which they are configured makes sense to the observer and this is a anything it seems to me that when people report their psychedelic experiences it makes a lot more sense to the person who experiences it than to the observer and creative works by definition are new ways of configuring things that lend themselves to a bigger bigger or greater or deeper or novel understanding on the part of the observer and just sensory blending is not an an accomplish that now it is true and there is a great review in the journal cell excellent journal about how psychedelics work and it turns out they do not just work by allowing for more sensory blending they do because of the way that they activate certain ceremonial receptors et camera they do lend themselves to more lateral inactivity between different brain areas more novel associations principle in princeblushes a nonisarilian practice but in principle they do allow different areas of the brain maybeven the two sides of the brain to communicate more broadly than they would normally that has certain elements that speak to creativity but it cannot simply be the case that psychedelics are the portal to creativity because creativity as i mention before involves not just novel associations and a breaking of kind of peacetime rules it also involves reconfiguring things such that the new space time rule that one comes up with is interesting stimulating and kind of in many cases delightful to the observer and that is why many claims that young psychedelics open plasticity or they increase creativity that is not sufficient for me personally ism curious about does it not just open the creative thinking process this novel configuration process but does it also lend itself to the implementation of creative works and the answer is no in most cases it has nothing to do with creative implementation now i think that there may come a time and certainly their clinical trials that are happening now where psychedelics are leverage toward particular clinical goals and i i want o set my hat to the work at johns hoping that is happening now which really lends itself om to the idea the early preliminary data and some of the papers there coming out there really fantastic showing that there may be some o excellent rolls for certain psychedelics in certain clinical contacts these are clinical studies done with a psychiatric present that is authorized to do that that can help people through depression drama at camera organ a spend a lot of time talking about that including with some of those those folks running those studies s we can look for it to that all of this is to say that no i do not take psychedelics to access creative states that is not where i think the major roll the important role of psychedelics might show up if it is going to for humanity i think that it may have these important rolls in the clinical context provided it is done legally and safely i think that that the creative process being a two stage process means that i am personally best served by having this period of non linear exploration of concepts whatever it is i happen to be working on in the afternoon but then it'll actually shelve that work it'll just set it aside and then it'll revisit it the next day or even the next day to see whether or not that the work itself is ready for deliberate linear implementation which i would want to you during when these high highly focus states the long and short way of saying this is that when we are very alert do linear type of operations when we tend to be more sleepy and more relaxed that is when creative works can first be conceived but there implementation requires high levels of alertness now that gets us more to the kind of late afternoon evening now i am as i mention be for ism a proponent of getting sunlight in the evening as well this is a critical thing that i have not mentioned before here is how it works many people now have heard me say getting light early in the day is important but that will advance one's clock it will make you want to get up earlier the next day by getting light in the evening it accomplishes two things for me first of all it make sure that i do not get up too early that ism not waking up at three or four in the morning because it is going to shift my clock it is going to delay it a little bit and this is really important if you want to keep your schedule on a normal routine on a regular twenty four hour cycle and not have your circadian rhythms of sleep in wakefulness drifting all over the place and you want some predictability to how your mind is going to work in order to optimize learning in performance well then you need to get morning light any evening light the morning light is going to advance my clock make my sister want to get up earlier and the evening light is going to delay my clock a little bit that on average it kind of book ends my circadian mechanisms and it'll basically want to go to sleep at more less the same time each night and wake up more or less at the same time each morning that is how it works and that is a hard wired mechanism that is not some subjective thing that i tell myself that is a hard wired mechanism that gets us to the evening and generally in the evening it'll get that light by going outside or sometimes it'll do it by turning up artificial lights brightly and then it'll start to dim them for the evening cause as a mention many times before and ism not going to belabor the point you want o minimize your light exposure especially overhead bright light exposure regardless of whether its bluelight or not in the evening from about ten p m before i m some of you asked wait i thought it was eleven p m before i m well it is but ten p m devour i ms even better it is just that when i originally said ten p m to for i m people that it is impossible for most people to adhere to for me it is screens off it is i dim lights and that is what favors a a falling a sleep in a good night sleep for me since we are tike about food earlier it'll just revisit a lot bit of what i said before my evening meal tends to be more carbohydrate m rich more but if i have prolines you'll be eggs fish or or chicken or something of that sort or no proline and i eat hi carbohydrate ism not one of these people that is keep or hi hi meat only or anything that remember fasting and low carbohydrate states facilitate alertness carbohydrate rich foods facilitate calmness and sleepiness they would stimulate the release of trip tolan and the transition to sleep that why you them late in the day also if you have exercised early in the day especially if it is wait bearing exercise or everything wait very evil us was less or an aster not but and you are in space but if you are early in the day exercising with waits are you redoing a long run or something sooner or later you need to replenish glycogen and i realize that the keetonise does out there angst say well lion gluconeogenesis will allow you to replenish glycogen et camera ism just going to call out the lie right now m because i feel doing it and cause i think it just has not been stated which is that i not everybody but a lot of the people that are proponents of high meat kit diets fine that is fine if that is what they want to do and as you recall i do relatively keetogenic diet during the day to for alertness or fasting but a lot of those people can replenish glycogen really well without ingesting car a hydrate sill call gluconia genesis and enhance propene synthesis because they are hormone enhanced and it is just there been around awhile i know what this looks they are either thyroid enhanced or hormone en hands and i do not pass any judgment but when you look at people who look amazing on quite and are able to have a lot of energy and replenish their glycogen on quite they are in many cases not all but in many cases their hormone enhance their taking exaction is hormones that allow them to synthesize and reparmuscle and ways that people who are not taking those erogenic hormones cant this is not just true of the men by the way this is also true of the women and this is a whole discussion onto itself probably not directly relate to this month of the podcast i do not mind that people do this but one problem is when people are caught following quitogenic diets all the way through to sleep and they have trouble with sleep or there doing long bouts to fasting n their having trouble falling asleep make sense is because there autonomic arousal is tilted towards epinepronrlase nor up an efferent release and dopamine release they've a lot of energy but they've a hard time calming down and getting into deep sleep i tend to achieve that state using carbohydrates and et also replenishes glikagen again not trying to drawing fire but if i do it'd be happy to have a conversation om about all that again no judgment but i think that most people out there are not aware of some of the other variables remember good sciences about isolating variables and often times what we are seeing and social media is we are getting presented single variables and we are not seeing the full contacts of the other variables that are being manipulated i eat piston rices and vegetables and things that the evening also i just find maybe ism becoming one of the last people that does that although i hope not i hope their others out their me but i just from all the literature speaks to the fact that caberhydrates not only do that but they also help maintain healthy thyroid function et camera that is my bice that is what i do i do avoid caffeine and what not in the evening i do take supplements and it'll be happy at some point to put out the complete list of supplements that i put out that take out there but in general these are the door things that i do and they relate to a lot of the questions that that you have been asking over a time the next pieces of scientific data that ism going to describe is a very important piece of scientific data forsake of understanding how to optimize your brain and access sleep it also can help and avoid a lot of anxiety issues and these relate to data from charges iceberg doctor hes an empty chucks cheers lab at hazard medical schools run a sleep lab out of harbor medical school for a long time now it of very impressive work what he is shown is that the plaque output of the circadian clock for wakefulness in other words the plaque of our wakefulness and the suppression of the sleep signal actually happens very late in the day we have this trough of activity and and body temperatures lowest right before waking then as we wake up our body temperature goes up and into the afternoon it continues to go up and then it tends to fall in the evening and towards bedtime but there is a brief blip of relieve of peptides and other substances from the from the sleep centers in the brain and the supercismatic nuclear the that sleep centers this peptic area that if you want to look that up this pronto carry an not far from the circadian clock that signals the peak of alertness in wakefulness about an hour before bedtime well that is really heard but a lot of people get into bed they are ready to go to sleep and they're wide awake and they think this is an unnatural thing ore there something wrong with them and actually it is not this it is believed oh no again i was not consult that the design phase but this is it is believed is a signal that is helpful to human beings to start gathering up resources and securing themselves for a night sleep during which we historically were very vulnerable to a tack from other humans and from animals and forth and that desire to run around and clean the kitchen are organize things or just a general feeling of internal anxiety late in the evening that is a natural blip that naturally passes after about forty five to sixty minutes now that is often the time when people start stressing about the fact that they have something to do the next day and they worry about not being able to sleep in a can cascade into whole set of things another thing that i do throughout my day is i know that early day ism gin to be alert afternoon ism going be kin to sleepy and then as the evening comes around in addition to doing all the other things i ism doing i anticipate a peak in alertness and activity and i do not worry about it i use that perhaps to get organized for the next day but basically i just go through if in to do anything hit can be very mundane task cleaning or things that require almost zero effort in that probably speaks to my cleaning abilities too but the fact of the matter is we do not just go drift off into sleep there is this blip of alertness right before sleep that i hope just cognitively knowing about will be helpful to people and that raises yet another theme that i think is going to be very important which is physiological mechanisms these changes in alertness or using breathing tool something will talk about in future episodes too shift our levels of autonomic arousal those are concrete biological phenomena is fasting fasting will increase alertness that way is caffeine not everybody susceptible the cabin o the same degree or others but it is a physiological mechanisms we know the receptors we know the ligans as they are called which bind to the receptors we know the mechanisms they have all quarters all an epinefferon those are the sorts of things that i personally trying leverage toward my learning and optimization of my brain and my activity doing physical activity early in the day for instance tends to give us a longer duration wake up signal intends to accelerate waking up early in the day i working out late in the day can sometimes cause people to have trouble falling asleep it will also face delay you make it the you want a wake up later the next day s not just cause you are tired its cause you have shifted your clock with activity and temperature many people ask me about subjective tools for plasticity what about visualization can we just imagine doing a particular activity will that help us get better at that activity there is some evidence that visualization can do that it is true but heres the important distinction and here is why i personally do not do much deliberate visualization first of all i get my testability or achieve my testability to visualize things when ism in kind of a sleepy state i do not know why but that is when ism able to direct my brain toward internal visualization with my eyes closed and generally i fall asleep and i cannot remember anything than i was thinking about before some people and these work that was done many years ago by roger shepherd and by others a roger is at stamford but and other labs have done this too of course of rotating objects physically and their mind as a way of improving or looking at the speed of of spacial calculations and forth some people are very good at visualization they can close their eye and they can just see objects and rotate them deliberately et camera a lot of people me when we start doing that our mind drifts too easily but i to think ism a reasonably focus person in the waking state visualization has it is interesting cause i think people are very attracted to the idea that they can just think about something and then get better at it that way and it is probably true if you can be very linger in the way that you visualize things do not repeat that i think visualization does have certain power if you can remain very linear and deliberate and focused in the visualization but many people myself who are challenged with maintaining that linear focus with eyes closed and visualization they do not get much out of visualization and i think the date on performance really supports that now there are examples where for instance o peoplewill injure one limb and then they will exercise the intact limb i or the non injured limb rather and they will visualize the opposite limb sometimes there is even the use a mirror boxes that lets say my left limb is injured ism a maintaining activity with my right limb but ism using a mirror boys it looks my left limb is f working well yes there is some top down or you know or feed back mechanisms that support the idea that the injured limb can rehabilitate more quickly et camera but those are fairly elaborate schemes these are not the kinds i do not a mirroboxes around my house i i think these are are specialized circumstances they are little bit the the examples that we see in the news where oh also has a stroke and then spontaneously speaks a new language i i do not know what the answer to that is a i it shows that the brain has a social of networks that are typically suppressed in those can be unleashed but you certainly soft wan to go out and give yourself a stroke deliberately to trying unmask some skill am because there is just no a there is no concrete way to go about that in a way that you could really know that you re an offset the detrimental effects of the stroke if i to thing to be a terrible idea i think what ism trying to deserve is how i typical i do not know if ism typical or normal i mean have been told other wise am is certainly not normal but in terms of the way that i structure my day i think that is normal that is pretty normal i tend to wake up right around i do notknow somewhere between five thirty and seven am depending on what i been doing the right before i tend to go to sleep somewhere around ten thirty eleven i ten to have one bout in the morning where i can do really focussed hard work and i can really activate the go pathway while also act offing the logo pathways that i can really stay focus but i rely in some tools i have a period in the afternoon where i get sleepy got a out of it i think most people and i tend to come out of that with an recognizing the opportunity of that slightly sleepy state for creative work and for thinking about things in novel ways i get light couple times a day i low carve during the day and i eat i do not a high but higher care by eat starches in the evening tho in the way i can sleep and then i really anticipate that late afternoon peak an alertness excuse me late night peak an alertness that many people confuse for in sonic or challenge is when actually there really quite normal in their circadian cycle and then i fall asleep and if all goes well i stay asleep for for five hours typically its three or four and then i wake up i think ism most people i wake up during the mill the night now one thing that i do not think has been discussed the lot but that one of my colleagues at the stamford sleep lab tells me is that every hour and a half or we all wake up some of you even look around believe it or not and go right back to sleep and you do not recognize it waking up periodically during sleep is the norm it is not abnormal i do not know why this is been discussed more prominently i tend to wake up and if there is a bright light coming through the blinds or if there is some noise upstairs if castellan snoring particularly loud i might get up i might go use the rest arum i might a pick up a book and read under low light or something and the i generally fall back asleep and wake up typical time for me again five thirty seven a m in the morning this waking up in the middle of the night thing as i mention at the beginning of the podcast episode to day is not necessarily abnormal what it probably reflects is that the real time meaning the time that i should go to sleep is probably closer to eight o'clock the word midnight was literally suppose to mean mid night we many meaning all of us we are meant to go to sleep and wake up with the rise with the setting and rising in the sun and we know this because there is beautiful study from universe colorado where they took people out into the wilderness to reset their circadian clocks by way of a you measured by way of a melatonin and cartes all and they had them they were completely but a wack from interacting wit screens and staying up too late at camera and they basically had them view the sunrise and view the sunset each evening and almost all the not all of the students but all of them got on to a schedule where they naturally wanted to go to sleep at sunset and wake up around sunrise just before sunrise even when they were brought back in to a normal artificial light setting i think that is the natural pattern and we have just deviated from it with artificial lights waking up at three a m or for m does not necessarily mean that there something screwed up about you it or that you have anxiety or something although you might the what it likely means is that you presupposed to go to bed much earlier and because of this a symmetry in the autonomic nervous system where it is much easier for us to push and to delay our sleep time than it is to accelerate are wake up time in other words it is easier to stay up and hang out at the party even if you do not want to be there then it is to wake up when you are exhausted in your fast asleep most people are pushing through into the late hours of the evening and night and going to bed much later than they naturally would want to and i personally do not want to go to bed at eight piamolotic good things happen between eight p m and eleven p m and i want enjoy those and i push through the the evening hours but as a consequence ism running but o megaton in my melatonin releases basically subsided by about three or four a m and oat make sense that i would wake up i do not take melatonin for reasons discussed in previous episodes a i do rely on things magnesium alienate or magnesium three name things the nine not saying any of you need to take those that is just what i happen to take in order to facilitate my sleep and it is been of great benefit to me if i wake up in the mill the night and ism anxious for whatever reason and my mind is looping i have a couple rules one is i do not trust anything i think about when i wake up in the mill the night any of it unless have had a magnificent dream an i want to write it down it'll do that every once in a while typically when i go back and read it it is not at all magnificent am i cannot ever remember coming up with anything really fantastic in one of my dreams that stuck with me or that i implemented i do not really trust the kind of thinking that happens in those we hours of the circadian cycle for me there is just nothing other for me terribly creative or worth linear implementation at that time but one thing that has been very helpful is to sometimes do one of these nonslip deep least protocols as a way to go back into sleep a hypnosis at by a er some of the scripts by michael seal that have mentioned before or the a revery health or a yoganegra protocol those for me have be very useful at helping me turn off can a looping thinking in the middle the night and fall back asleep in reviewing my schedule for you just as a context for how to implement certain types of tools for optimizing learning realize that it gives the impression that there is a ninety minute bout of learning and work in the morning and then a ninety minute bout of creative type work in the afternoon and that is it here lot of hours and between of course and i just want to be very clear those ours for me are occupied by pretty ism not mundane tasks but things that are are nonrandom those are things male or attending to zummeetings or a meeting with colleagues and students and of things of that sort i sometimes will read just for sake of my own enrichment i mention those two ninety minute bouts because those of the two ninety minute bouts where ism trying to expand on the mental capacities that i already have there is really where ism trying to stretch and grow what ism able to do on a regular basis reflexively one to emphasize that the whole day does not just consist of those two ninety minute about a that is not the way my schetual works and that is not the way my life style is arrange which is fortunate cause i enjoy all those other things as well and for many of you out there who are in school who have a family demands or other demands the key is to slot in those brain optimization segments of about ninety minutes one or two or maybe more per day you've trying to slot those in wherever you can amidst your other obligations and things that you need to do but you want to do that an intelligent way that is anchor to your biology and then you want to do a number of things which have talked about to day in order to optimize those sessions to get the most out of them as we round up i acknowledge that once again have covered a huge range of topics a related to out optimize learning and brainchange and essentially mental performance and have set that in the context of some biological mechanism the baslganglia go logo pathways the circadian anatomic system and some of the relationship between food and fasting and particular types of food in alertness or sleepiness a linear focus and strategy implementation is best served by higher states although not too alert and how creative states at least the first phase of creativity which is the creative arrangement can a brainstorming stage is supported by states of relaxation or even slightly sleepy but the creative implementation is a very linear focus and deliberate process much the highly focus state that i described i described how i do these things that just to give you a context the lot of you ask for i what i do in order to set it within a context but by no means are these rigid times and ways of doing things but i think it is fair to say that what i do has a circadian logic it also has grounding in big logical mechanisms there very concrete that we know the cells and mechanisms and arrow transmitters and then some of them are a little bit ha it out into the om what we would call can of emerging or am yen a i do not not say cutting edge but may be front edge of what narrow sciences try ant understand about creativity and forth we those are areas that are just now a coming to some a clarity and there certainly a still lot more work to do a lot of different ways to arrange ones routine but hopefully the tools and practices i described will be useful to you i want to mention that a lot of people ask me about specific tools and practices they ask me out whimhoff breathing about ice baths of talk to club about ice pas before i think and cold exposure about by normal beats and things of those sort i think the wait to look at any tool to modulate or measure the nervous system is ask whether or not it is going to move you up or down the state of autonomic arousal whether not to make you more alert or more calm more focus are less focus that is kind of the the two axes heres that we need to think about sometimes you want to be more alert than you are and indeed things cold showers ice baths a superoxygenation whimhoff type reading will bring your level of alertness up there some cautionary notes associate with each of those you need to real and understand those cautionary notes for yourself everybody's different and some of those carries cart ain dangers under certain conditions others have huge margins for safety an ice bath generally wakes you up a warmer math generally calms you down right by normal beats are not the lot of data and quality peru journals i did put in the effort to go search it out there are a few by normal beats are listening to frequencies of sound that slightly differ or offset for the two ears it has been shown camshaft the brain into particular states you will nowise to day i finally talk about alpha or that are game rhythms i i personally and reviewing the literature i do not think it is fair to say that alphistates are great for as and fat states are great for why and besides most of us are not walking round our homes in our workplaces geared up to e g machines ore with wires down below er also we do not know when we are in those states anyway i think the subjective reading of whether r not one is a let or calm and whether not that a alertness or calmness matches the goal or the thing that we are trying to achieve in terms of learning including sleep is the most valuable internal tool and recognition that we can all have in other words if i want to be very alert an i need to be very let anti's exhausted there might be tools that i should use to wake up it might also speak to the fact that might not have slept as as well as i could ever should of the night before it is really about a match between where we are on that autonomic arousal scale and what we are trying to achieve and indeed therefore gong to be a lot of tools including supplements and other prescription drugs and things that can help move us along that autonomic continuum up toward more alertness are toward more calmness but ultimately it is about tailoring that alertness and calmness to the pacific types of learning and activities that you are going to do and perform and it is reciprocal meaning some of those activities exercise early in the day will increase your level autonomic arousal and alertness certain foods will tend to wake you up certain foods will tend to make you more sleepy and the volume of food and the timing of food is a factor also it is a huge parameter space is a huge say variables the impacts whether not we are feeling well performing well learning grate or not learning grate and the anything is to be come and observer of your own system and what works for you and to recognize that there two bins of tools for optimizing learning and brain performance one are tools that are really anchored in biological mechanism and we are certain of what those are ism talked about some of those the other the more subjective tools for some of you visualization might work terrifically well for some of you one sang might really wake you up because of the associations you have with it and for me i might just i might repel me from the room cause i do not it or it might put me to sleep but of course volume is kind of a universal loud music tons to wake people up soft music does not tend to wake them up quite as much part of to day is rally getting you to think about in a scientific way in a structured way about the non negotiable elements which are that you are going to have a period of every twenty for hour cycle when you tend to be more awake and period when outed to be more asleep and how to leverage those who are not fighting and up pill battle to wake up when you actually would want to be in and should be sleepy and not trying to go to sleep when you are naturally going to be most ta wake lot of it is really anchors back to those door mechanisms of biology and then you start laying on the different protocols of food and supplementation et camera and i think it is important to recognize that some people are just more gigolo go go and logo and some people are just calmer and have a harder time getting into action an an activity is just the way that were wired some of us have autonomic nervous systems that are more geared towards part sympathetic calm states one the reasons i love bull dogs not just my bull dog is that they are very calm animals in fact they make no spontaneous movements unless there something to respond to and i find that incredibly relaxing other animals pitfalls who i also really and enjoy another species their tails always wagging and that there always in a position to make a movement at any and he second cause they tend to ride at pretty high levels of autonomic arousal they pop up really quickly when you say it is time to go for whap costellidoes one limb a a time and sometimes you just goes back o sleep and that there are people that to and you have to know where you are and what particular gulls you are trying to pursue as a final closure to to this i want emphasize that to day as always have strive to be accurate ism sure if i made mistake some of you will pointed out and i appreciate that will post of correction if we agree that i indeed misspoke or excited something but by no means was i exhaustive a man might have exhausted some of you what the information was not exhaustive meaning there is no way that i could cover all the ways in which we optimize or can optimize learning and performance i think we have touched on a a number of them that i hope that you will find value in in that you will explore in your own lives we are continuing with this theme because that is what we do for the podcast we stand one theme for an entire month for the next episode were going to explore to very essential aspects of nerd plasticity that i should relate to learning which are pain pain management and normal regeneration and for those of you that do not have injuries or do not suffer from chronic pain the discussion is stillborn to be a very important one because it is not just going to be about pain that your trying to get rid of it is also going to be about how certain sensory experiences within the pain network can become amplified as well as how we can use top down modulation we can use our mind to suppress the pain response we also can talk about some of the hard wired mechanisms that our bottom up that exist in our periphery in our body to control pain and we are also going to discuss a number of interesting interactions between the pain system and the learning system again if you are a not interested in pain per say it still is going to be a very valid conversation forsake of understanding how to optimize brain performance and nor regeneration goes hand in hand with that discussion si hope you will join us for that i suppose it'd be remiss if i did not mention that costly has been storing extremely loudly to day you good a good long walk this morning which means up the driveway down the driveway he is an old dog if you have been hearing him in the background hand's been distracting now why it probably relates to where you were on your level of autonomic arousal and it'll leave it is you to answer that question for yourself many of you continue to graciously ask how you can help support the podcast and we really appreciate the question the best way is to subscribe wherever it is you happen to be listening or watching for those view that it is you too please subscribe to the tube channel it is apple subscribe to the podcast on apple or if it spotifie subscribe there may be subscribe to all three if you have comments and feed back for us suggestions for future podcast episodes or topics to cover please place those in the comment section on you to apple also provides a section where you can give us a rating we would love it if you give us a five starting or whatever it is that you feel that we deserve and in general if you could tell people about the podcast we hope that you would tell them because you think the information would be of use to them of course tell your friends tell your family tell your to workers because as we expand the podcast the support for the podcast just grows along with it that is a terrific way to support us as always check out our sponsors which you were metered at the beginning and as mention at the beginning of to day's episode we are now partnered with momentous supplements because they make single ingredient formulations that are of the absolute highest quality and thesis international if you go to live momentous took calm slash supermen you will find many of the supplements that have been discussed on various episodes of the huberumen lab podcast and you will find various protocols related to those supplements lastbut not least on behalf of me and costello i want to thank you for your time and attention to day and as always thank you for you

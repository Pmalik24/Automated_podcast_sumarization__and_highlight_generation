welcome to the superman alone stestcience science pace to i manner supermen and on your professor of norbiology and ophiology at stamford school of medicine today my guess is doctor child delete doctor cawgelette is a dual board certified physician in family medicine and obesity medicine and expert in hormone optimization he is an me that is a medical doctor and he treats patience with a variety of backgrounds ages and goals today we discuss male hormonoptimization we discuss behavioral tools nutrition base tools supplement base tools prescription drug base tools and their interactions in determining overall levels of testosterone free testosterone dihydrotestostron estrogen growth hormone third hormone and many other hormones the impact mood libido well being strength cognition and various psychological factors we covered hormonoptimization in both men and women in previous episodes of the superman labor cast but to day's discussion is different doctor cawgelette offers very specific recommendations for people with different goals and of different ages and we get deep into the weeds of for instance how does one know whether or not their testosterone is optimized or not how often to test for specific hormone such as testosterone and other hormones and really how to gage how good one should feel this is something that is often overlooked in discussions about hormonoptimization or health optimization of any kind for that matter for instance people will talk about reduced libido and discs weather or not teststron levels are to blame but how does one calibrate their libido in the first place that is how does one know whether not their libido is normal too lo or too high we also discuss for instance whether or not hormonoptimization should be pursued continually throughout the year for instance whether not you should cycle on and off supplements and or prescription drugs gear towards hormonoptimization and we discuss the behavioral foundations of optima hormone function these are things that every male should be doing and various things they should actively avoid if their goal is to have healthy hormones and to quotenquot optimize their levels of every horn from growthormon to testosterone at any stage of life and while to day's discussion is about male hormonoptimization i want to emphasize that we discuss all the various ages for male hormonoptimization for those of you that are parents for those of you that are young those of you that are middle age are old or than ages we explore adolescent puberty teen and lateens early adulthood adulthood and into the late geriatric ages regardless of your age and wether not your male or female to day's episode ought to be of interest to you i should also point out that we will soon also be hosting an expert guest on female hormone optimize action one thing that ism certain people of all ages and biological sex will enjoy about today's conversation is that we also get into descriptions of how psychology and life events impaled hormones and how hormones impact our psychology and the way the we show up to various life events today is really a broad over view that goes all the way down to fine details about man hormone optimization and ism certain that by the end of to day's episode you will have an immense amount of new information about how this endercrin that is hormone system in your body works and how would interacts with your brain and other tissues and many many factional tools that you can pursue regardless of stage of life before we begin it'd t emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cosmic consumer information about science in science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme id to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is element element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar ow salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the sells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called neurons in fact in order for your neurons to function properly all three electrolytes need to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to dephisites in cognitive and physical performance element contains a science backtolectrolite ratio of one thousand milligrams that one graham of sodium two hundrmilegrams of potassium and sixty milligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if have been sweating lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element doctor slash supermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element el event doctor slash supermen and now for my discussion with doctor calgelette doctor select great have you back great to be back thank you i to begin with a question about one of the most mysterious and important phases of life which is puberty have long wondered whether or not how quickly somebody goes into puberty at what age and how long puberty takes how brief r protract that puberty is for them to require the local secondary sexual characteristics things here growth on the place for mails a changes in bone and muscle density an growth et camera no now's in middle school and high school i notice that some people transition and all that very fast and some people i took a long time to acquire those characteristics can we learn anything about our selves our hormones and maybe even how long were going to live based on the time in which we enter puberty and how long it takes us to progress through puberty i guess that also raises the question does puberty ever truly end there many take always from puberty a some of the actionable items from it is yes it can and does effect your adult height and also stature and also body composition puberty is a time a and if your there talking specifically about males think of it as a a time where if you have ability is a child you could potentially use that time to change your style and habits and reset things and it is a bit easier somulslike a a free injection of testosterone and metabolism and drive and effort after life there is a wide variation and a how quickly puberty goes through their stages called tanner stages which we do not necessarily to get into but if you inter puberty very early then it can a decrease your adult height or stature for a given man that enters puberty at thirteen verses of male that enters puberty at fifteen can we say that the guy that entered puberty at thirteen is going to be shorter than the guy that entered puberty at fifteen or it is not quite that straight forward if they are identical twins and the individual who interpuberty at aged thirteen also finished puberty when all the way through the tanner stages and if you do a bone scan which i believe is usually done on the left to wrist and is says yestyour growth placer mostly closed you are not can a grow more than a couple inches of height after that ut just a related question when i was growing up it was thought or at least people would say that resistance training in particular lifting heavy weights could stunt one's growth is that true were false it is false when you are talking about just lifting heavy waits dirty bulking certainly has the potential to stunt one's growth for it fortwumaine mechanism could you define dirty bulking we a dirty bulking is eating an excess of calories not just to acquire lean metabolically act give body mass or get stronger but purposely acquiring body fat purposely acquiring muscle and fat by overeating yes and lifting weights can stun one's growth do i have that correct correct does two things if you are doing at is a very young child it can that fat can pecan become leapt in resistant and it can produce more lept an an that leapt in can activate the hypothalamus which activates the pituitary which releases cannatatropens which basically just increased testosterone an estrogen earlier than it otherwise would have it is the same mechanism behind why childhood o b city causes early puberty interesting i do remember a paper publish in science magazine i believe it was focus mainly on females but showing that when enough body fat accumulates the hormone leptin is secreted in that triggers the onset of puberty given the increase in a childhood of city that we are observing now are we seeing and earlier onset of puberty in males and females yes and both males and females not to get too typical but there is a keep proline coupled receptor on the hypothalamus and leapt in directly binds it it does appear directly consistory and not just correlation case an if i understand correctly what you are saying is for a young filet us a thirteen fourteen who wants to really bulk up and deliberately deliberately souse me overeats and is doing there squats and deli sand bench presses and really training get big they will get big but only in the latter a dimension they are not their effectively limiting their total height and it can shut down the long bone growth of their limbs is that correct correct the the growth of he longboats is mostly related to the estrodyle ala receptor basically one of the receptors for estrogen which can be secondary to a early puberty and also is related to body fat because you have that conversion of testosterum to estrogen can we assume that if a young male wants to get into resistance training that body weight exercises are probably o we and maybeven some wight training kettle bells et camera but that they should avoid doing called dirty bulking trying to deliberately gain weight up until what age until puberty is over i would say an individual should limit the amount of a body abnormal body fat accumulation or dirty bulking indefinitely throughout their entire life again if i understand correctly that recommendation to avoid deliberate weight gain or rapid weight gain is not just to allow an individual to reach their maximum height but also to avoid laying down a lot of body fat cells correct correct the balance between that is when you are going through puberty you are able to add a lot of lean body mass not just muscle mass but bone mass and other mass as well i started lifting weights when i was sixteen and i confess i train pretty heavy at times ai do not know whether not i would have been taller i than i am now but when i started that training i had already reached what was at least close to my predicted height i i cannot say that i deliberately waited until i grown it just happened that i stumbled into the weight room and found that i liked it at age sixteen it which point i was already i that i am now in any case i what ism hearing is that laying down a lot of excess bat body fat is not a good idea what if somebody y grows up chubby or fat a for whatever reason a reasons relate to the eating patterns in their family maybensom genetic reasons is it safe and or wise for a young person to let say somebody whose around the age of puberty or even younger it were in their lateens to bedding and actively trying to lose body fat is that safe under the supervision of e physician it is certainly safe to change your body composition in pediatric b city medicine you are often talking about a decomposition or a renormalization of the growth curve compared to pierce thank you as you may have sense we started chronologically with puberty and i know that there's another puberty that even precedes the puberty that were all familiar with a maybe feu angel briefly mention that was of talking wit you about this before we started am the puberty that ism most familiar with and i think most people ore most familiar with that acquisition of deepening of the vows a growth o muscle and bone a a body her acquisition of libido in thinks that that is actually the second puberty that we all go through you we just mention for us and educate us on the first puberty i think most people will be am i hearing this for the very first time the first puberty of everyone is life is the first three months of their life you may notice that your baby has more acting the first three months and that they also have a in general just more changes related to antigens and estrogens perhaps oiler skin even more genitor nercgenitale growth during the first three months and this is mostly u t d t e which is in a renal hormone the second puberty or the puberty that most people know of actually starts that same way as well it is called adronarchy an it is when the a adrenals kick in a i guess for the second time is there a standard age or age range in which the testicles descend in males usually before birth a it is not uncommon to have one or even to undiscended testes but there is a risk of testicular cancer especially if they are not fixed early and also heat damage to the testy well thank you for that coverage of the two liberties early in life i imagine some of our listeners but probably a still in honor the t one of the other puberty the one there in the first puberty vise aren't aware that their in listening to this podcast but maybe will be embedded in their subconscious but some a listeners probably are still in puberty but i think everyone can remember back to their puberty and roughly when they first entered puberty and how quickly they aggregated the secondary sex a characteristics to turn now to a general question about what all males ought to do in order to optimize their hormones i s if you could just list off the things that all males should you on a daily basis weekly basis i mean should guise in their teens and twenties be getting their blood worked on should they be taking supplements we red talked about weight training what shouldthey be doing what should they of was doing if the goal is to have a long arc of healthy horn on optimization throughout the life spent there is many things that you should do analogy that i often make is when there is a brand new car that comes off the assembly line you do a full scope of diagnostic work up hook at ups the computer and i think we you do the same thing with humans as well dear puberty obviously you are a functioning human but i would say there is still development and i think that the the human always develops i do not think development ever finds but you an a moisture that progress across a person's life span soon marry for blood work a what would be the earliest a let me put it this way if blood work did not cost anything and everyone could get it when would you want to see everybody get their blood work done for the first time of obviously a individuals under the age of eighteen should talk with their parents about this a ins long as that a the parents and the child if con of agree and the parents are on board with this as well you can start getting blood work a a often a child will come in with complaints of either precocious puberty or delayed puberty and this individual might be nine or this individual might be fifteen for a healthy child when they are going through kind of their later trainer stages which as four and five save developed several secondary sexual characteristics they might have a hairgrowth or a starting to notice a more beard growth that is a good time to do it if you are concerned with stature or height or if you are not tracking along where most members of your family have not just there height and stature but also the timing over their puberty than that is time to get lapse t if i could travel back in time i would have got in my blood work done for hormones and lipids and everything else at eighteen i unfortunately did not know where and how to get that and i did not have any pressing clinical issues and think the first time that i got my blood work done i was in my late twenties maybe even my early thirties and i still dying to know what my blood work was when for instance i was seventeen and i felt the certain way and i and i confess that in many dimensions i should feel better now at ill be forty seven soon at forty seven than i did in my teens an twenties and i think it was more on the psychological side i think that a but in terms of just understanding why we felt great or why we felt or feel terrible or not great i think a blood work is extremely in formative what do you think are the key things to look for in blood work command have testosterone is always the topic that comes up in the contexts of man hormone optimization but certainly there a lot of other hormones that are important as well and with testosterone you want to get either testosterone an less h b g or a free to testosterone could you define es h b g for listeners place it is sex forum binding globular it is the prone that binds up all androgen and estrogen of the body the stronger the androgen the stronger it binds peering puberty strong androgen especially d h t which is thee strongest by identical androgen has a huge roll a prominent roll in secondary sexual characteristics and if your s h b g is very high then your d h t can run higher because it is not metabolize but there is not quite as much for d h t you want a balance between a a high enough for d h t and a high enough total t h t and give you see these bloodiest are going to have to be read and interpreted by qualified physician must be learned going to be in a position to evaluate them properly to least not with the full depth that they could if they an eddy yourself ism looking at them o case everyone should get blood work as early as possible am depending on their budget and an availability what should everybody do in terms of managing those markers assuming that there is no major intervention how often you recommend that people get their blood work done let us say wins take an individual who just turned eighteen they just got their first set of blood work they will probably find something in it that they may want to optimizes using share decision making with their physician usually a good flop is about six months its twice a year getting blood work done then having physician value it that sounds reasonable to me and for those that did not initiate this at eighteen such as myself it is the best time to start then would be as soon as possible i a in terms of the other things that all male should do meaning all male of all ages a puberty beyond i should do what what are some of those things on a daily basis a maybe you just take us through the ark of a day and am and push out some of the protocols that you use or the things that you to see your male patients use in order to try and optimize there were monstrous it'll briefly touch on some of the life style pillars to start diet and exercise a the first to a in puberty sleep is particularly important of course a but with diet and exercise a throughout a life stand you want to not exclude things that are helping you for example peering puberty if your consuming dairy and then all the said you cut out all dairy day can help increase i o one and are i of one and hand just a we get for our audience maybe just mention what it'd get what having enough i if one can do for us that is beneficial is it helps you grow it a helps with a general development secondary sexual characteristics and long bone growth a skin growth hair growth a host of things getting an array of nutrients that include dairy what other sorts of nutrients are important during development you will not have adequate video an d vitamin d helps with testosterone production t helps again with bone mineralization and stature a after an age of about twenty five and there is not a strict cut off but up to about a age of twenty five sodomizing your growth forgot an pigeon one helps with bone density and bone growth a from the dietary standpoint you wog to have enough free estrogen not too much when your growing but you want to help a basically stock pile bone to prevent a risk of osteal paroles or thin bones fractures when you are older was some one who broke his left foot five times while in high school i can san whatever young people can do to optimize their abondensity would be great that prom seems you have resolved itself over time but i do not know back than i was a i did a short run as of vegetarian but have always been in omnivore am i realize that some of this relates to effects and food allergies and things of that sort but would you say that on balance that most people would benefit from eating a commination of you quality prolines from animal sources and non animal sources fruits vegetables and starch's ism can what do you think for instance about people falling i pure carnivore or a very a pure vegan diet in their twenties and thirties in there late twenties an might be i reasonable option in early twenties and certainly teens it is a horrible idea because it is likely to significantly decrease your free indigence you will have less tostostron acting on recaptures through the body are there any other micro nutrients or maccrnutrients that people in their twenties and thirty should emphasize we have really tacked on fatty acids or fire too much a fire is going to be paramount in kind of setting your set went of your got micro bum the rest of your life there is periotic fire which you can think of as fish food for your good got microfilm your got microfilm's tuna liken acquateryn or fishtail nomouslyn by goldfish swimming round in that thegoldfish eating people dentin goldfish people help you can were did the a but any fire or food that your putting in your gut it is either going to it is going to scene your got micro bum toward something that is more beneficial or or more detrimental and it would you say that the eremitic fiber and the getting essential fat acids a that would be important to do throughout the life spanner just for people in their twenties and thirties throughout the life span a particularly important in the teen age twenties thirties because at helps with brain development a you are certainly more of an expert than me when it comes to am brain development but it does continue to develop throgreally throughout the life span but certainly through the twenties and thirties as well about em taking a multiveitemen way your growing up many people i do that is it necessary is i useful and if it is not necessary is it safe to do anyway it is generally safe to do anyway a i do not think everybody needs a multivitamin the more exclusionary your diet is for example if you have a seeliactisease or if your plain on fertility soon then perhaps it is more reasonable to take a multivitamin in a previous discussion of ours i asked you about am colonic restriction and testosterone and if i recall correctly the idea was that if somebody is over weight they have excess fat adipose tissue then getting rid of some of that adipose tissue by through colonic restriction and exercise provided done not too fast and healthy way is going to be beneficial for testosterone in the long run but that for individuals who are not carrying an excess of body fat colonic restriction is actually going to lower test strong forestall do i have that correct and second are the any a a denies to that that you would to to give us now that is correct a if you look at an individual in a colonic defies at several changes will happen one is that they will have less building blocks for hormones another is that they will be in a catabolic state more often that balance of an abolish and catcatabolism will be different they will likely have less signaling fro growth hormonal i f one and they'll also have the high es h b g that we defend earlier as the binding proline they free antigens and free estrogens will go down because we touched on sleep being critical i would take throughout the life span trying get enough quality sleep at least eighty per cent of the nights of your life and the other twenty percent suggest what happens when there is noise outside or your stars a just you have an enamor you have not a great time for whatever reason of how to good good reasons to lose some sleep now and again as well but o be have sleep we have got a nutrition e touched on that i will get back into supplementation what are some of the other pillars of creating it the proper environment for hormonoptimization a stress is probably next one a wearing both purity but also the twenties and thirties individuals are figuring out how they want to cope with stress and also figuring out what they want to choose to put their effort into if some one is over stress than it can have a can put all the other lifestyle pillars and then they stop dieting well they stop exercising and everything else can go ascus a there is also some degree of a social component to this perhaps than you to add a seventh pillar of social a a wearing your twenties and thirties you may forming o family as well perhaps you have children and the health of the family unit is going to be vitally important a not only not necessarily directly for hormonoptimisation but it is on ta throw everything else off of is off and for people that are not aha starting their own families in their twenties and thirties gin tat social connection am the extent did to friendships and work relationships as well absolutely in facts if some one's not starting to family it it is justice concerning but for other reasons each individuals can have their close group of family and friends and if some one does not have one of those connections that is when things can potentially a get bad not just for them individually but also society wen you say stress you mean learn to manage your stress a what does that look coming win a vocation am as high blood pressure even if they do not am you just sense at their stress they lot of pressured speech or they are not feeling well or communicating that they are not doing well a what are some of the things that you recommend in order to try and ampliate that stress there is different mindfulness or relaxation techniques going outside can often help with us as well a it dietary changes an exercise can help with us to some people prayer or meditation and a lot of people a counseling or therapy or even just talking a openly with a failing umber or a friend what would be some of the other pillars for hormone optimization here i feel were not just talking about people in their twenties and thirties but again were unwrapping our arms around they sec'y puberty onward i mean it'd ism in gosh looking back i is start meditating pretty early stared way training and running early at gave some thought to my died and high school but really was in college is are thinking more about what i was in jesting and wine and trying to do better there but people are coming to the table at different stages of a life and trying to optimize for hormones a what what would you some of the additional things that everybody should do it will not you get outside and find a a movement pastime to last a lifetime you in to get sunlight you are going to get some degree of heat and cold exposure and you are also just can i move more a being an artificial environment when there is artificial lights artificial er conditioning a is a going to have many effects on your body a that is final another one is finding what your purpose is in life i call this spirit but it is rely just a self actualization common it of mallow's hierarchy if needs here is basically your physical needs your mental needs and then your purpose in life what you really to do picking some goal or target i ways say that you do not have to stick to the same goal over times certainly i have not although i got started early in the science game and him still in it a the idea is not to pick the en goal it is to pick a goal and then once you reach that goal to assassin then pick another goal and on think sometimes when people here about picking a purpose going in ears i have to defend sort naming oneself a y you yashikan change your you are you are goals in purpose over time this is terrific would you a suggest that people actively use or avoid supplementation a prior to doing all these other things ism somebody likes to throw the kitchen sink et things but else to do things pretty systematically i was a behavior's first then nutrition then supplementation and then maybe and if in only if there is a real need of course working with the doctor prescription drugs but they are probably people in their twenties or thirties may ben in their fifties the are not feeling great and they want to do something in order to be able to train more and or to i feel more confident to seek out social connection they train go go about the whole on business from the other from the other side as well but what r your thoughts on that i see supplements and medications as very similar one prescribed an one's not in general medications have more side effects or potentially stronger therapeutic with more efficacy but they're just tools to reach an and goal decision on the goal if there is an individual it is an athlete then certainly they should consider supplementation or of some one a desires optimal or very a very high level of cognitive performance they should also consider supplementation at the same time food is medicine and a lot of benefits you can get in supplements you can get in food as well is it depends on how much time and energy you've going to spend in also finances i know that when i was in college i could afford just a few supplements and there easily way propene and om fissile i was fortunate that i was pointing the direction of those things and some creatine i could not afford much else i overtime of course i could afford more but am it really does often depend on on finances before we get in o specific recommendations to optimize to stosteron estrogen thirty grothormon et camera when i see you question i been wondering about for a long time you often in the discussion about male hormone optimization people say well if your libido is suffering ye you might want to be concerned about testosterone or even estrogen i as we know that estrogen can impact lotto as well sometimes having estrogen too low is detrimental for libido or the people say you are not recovering from work outs are you just your feeling kind of depressed the problem is it is all subjective how does one know whether or not there recovery from work but they're energy there confidence they're libido is within a healthy range i may obviously for people in the relationship they can know whether or not they're libido matches the sort of cadence of of the relationship in their partner but how should people think about this avian start to talk about it because one of the big differences i think between males and females is that because females have a monthly psycho they are familiar with the changes that occur in their harmony over time because every twenty eight days those movements or changing dramatically in ways impact their physiology an psychology but for males i feel their sort of a a a a dirty of language to get into the more subtle aspects of this else have to do with privacy issues an people feeling they soft want oversharp ism too much not knowing what is appropriate to share but when you talk to a patient who is in their thirties may been their seventies or sixties does not matter a male patient what a you listening for and a i know you are not a psychiatrist but what are your ears tune to in order to try and figure out whether to this person could really use some help with common optimization or whether not something else maybe they are just doing great another do not realize it because they are placing demands on themselves that are excessive you went you want to use a lot of open in questions this process is called motivational interviewing and your goal is to listen to the patient and not plant an idea in their mind that they can follow because everybody is going to have a different goal a some people are better at reading their big feet back or a telling how they feel on a daily basis there is screening questionnaire design for example an madam questionnaire to look at fence a mince health and hormone related health it is gone an madam question madam question d a m correct is it available n line that people could be administer to themselves although we do not want people making clinical diagnoses of themselves or any one else is it that sort of exam it is interesting i do not believe it is a clinically validated tool an a c v d which is a a risk of hart attack and stroke tool or many other tools a there is one for to question there is one for anxiety they are called p h k nine and gat seven respectively but anyway there is often an into madam questionnaire and what you hear from the patient if you were very careful listener is often different canyon give mean examples on the questions on this madam question air or the sorts of motivational interviewing tat you might do since i am your patient we sit down what sorts of questions would be ask to probe these kinds of dimensions of a hormones questions about libido questions about athletic performance questions about motivation and often the patient will answer one thing but what you hear from them subjectively is far different intent can you mean example of of a question i him happy to be the the guinea pig a a classic one is a guy comes in and i a lot of times they say i know the wife made me go to the doctor i go a once year that is it i do not want anything i do not any medications there screening questioners might be zeros across the word nothing no issues they're apparently in perfect health they talk to you for a while they get some report they you and then right is your finisher the visit and about to go out the room they mention that a their libido is not quite there and there having a little bit of e d is well and perhaps or even having some chess pressure tightness i see right as you are leaving the room a patient will tell you that there having some sexual side of facts or ice not edifice to having some sexual challenges and then they will mention chess pressure is the chess pressure a sort of general decoy or tit is got a be my heart or is it was it related to the other things they are reported it can be related in fact a erectile dis function is notice the canary in the coal mine coal miners would take the canary down and it would a the canary would die before the coal miners would i believe carbomonoxide poisoning and often a one of the causes of end is place build up which can happen in the coronaries as well but sometimes they notice the symptom and the genitals before they do in the corners for such a patient a let say that patient was a young person where black build up in the arteries and brains is not all that likely if there build say in their twenties or thirties a what would be your next step of the interview at that point and what what would you consider would you immediately order labs for that person to try and rule out any kind of am actual hormone level deficiency i certainly would order labs there is some individuals that are very similar and they coming in they have the same symptoms and one individual might have a very very high testosterone and one individual might be a severely hypogene able there o a big difference between the subjective and what the labs look i certainly order labs you also ask them about a if it is situational lot up not you ask them if they have edgy if there a the asks about their habits you've en ask about a porn and masturbation and all these issues and of course that is between the doctor and the patient and decision on what they tell you you can often determine if there is a situational component some people call it is psychogenic e d but i do not love the term psychogenic e d because it kind of put some some blame on the patients a mind but a lot of the time that is the case there is even a test and this is very rarely ordered what it is called a nocturnal penile to lessons i becks is it true that there are periodic erections during sleep gets ye a you basically put a cut to see if you are having a a a normal sized direction during sleep and i believe about ninety person of the time they do that test a they are indeed having erections which would point to this psychogenic origin of whatever challenges their having in terms of sexual interactions you mention porn and masturbation a this topic has come up a bunch of times on this podcast and on other pots have gone on because of the relationship between dopamine a sexual motivation and sexual behavior and have been of the pretty strong stance that well ism not judging corner masturbation it can create a brain wiring situation where males in particular sensibly teach the brain to be aroused by watching other people have sac has supposed to being the first person actor in sexual a interactions in that sense am you know that is more about the brain wiring and nerd plasticity and dopamine but whatare your thoughts on porn and masturbation as they really to hormones man this is a big debate on the inner anna and far m the most a common debates is weather or not masturbation increases or decreases to stosteron and male certainly it will decrease motivation to go fine sexual partners we know this and there mornmore date on this all the ti ism in terms of the effects of pornography in masturbation and here i suppose we need to be a somewhat specific and operationally find what we talk about were talking about porn in masturbation to the point of ejaculation right am because minorstanding is that the ejaculation in an orgasm associate with it causing increase in prolactin which blunts libido for some period of time the duration of that will vary from personal person in circumstance o circumstance but easily all this points of the fact that porn in masturbation can really limit libido in the real world and to me a pornography and the screen is not the real world of screens exist in the real world the real world does not exist in the screen that is an accurate statement and prolactin does have a significant acute increase after a ejaculation it does to some degree after orgasm as well but prolactin acts on the pituitary to inhibit the release of the hormones patient effasate of which each can increase to testosterone this may be one of the cases worth the dose makes the poison and if it is a very frequent habit certainly a daily more than once a day would every detrimental from a hormonal component not even taking to account the the curl wiring the sat i think it is terrific the vase define frequency because this is the problem on the inner net or even in the doctor's office you will see am descriptions about pornography being dangerous for certain things or or detrimental to homos we'll take frequent but what is frequent you are saying daily or multiple times pray would be potentially detrimental to the hormone profile of a male of essentially any age and that is just for masturbation a with planography a with porn use as well it would likely be worse why why is that just as this the sort of doormen uric drive of the stimulus just a really theintense visual stimulus dreaming sensitivity a i think that a using the analogy of a dreaming wave pool it would deepen the pool but not increase your supply of dupemin maybe you describe the opening wave because i think it such a powerful way of thinking about dopamine in what dopamine does in fact have em always credited you in when have done it but have have generally a stolen your analogy of the dopamine wave will because it it is astute the dumping wave pool describes the natural variation of ups and downs in your dopamine or your mode ovation and a in the wave pool defining on how high the peak is you often have a deeper trough you do not want to hi of at pique in addition if your peace is very very high for example a when you are using a many substances a cocaine or imphetamens your dumping can go high you lose almost all the water from the wavepool and in when you crash from that not only is the trout flow you have less dupion in the pool to begin with the duramen receptor is extremely sensitive as is the gala receptor which is an inhibitory receptor whereas dupion as technically a stimulant more related to a drinalan anordrendalin the depth of the pool can change very quick you wont to have that happy medium where you are fairly near the top but you are not near the top that the depth of the pools get to go down if i interpret on that in the contexts of the discussion about libido sex corner masturbation it if somebody has a very intense sexual experience and not not you were not a surly time out intense orgasm were talking about just in you a lot of intense visual very am a lot of intense imagery your auditory imposter both that is going to lead to a situation where doom is going to be depleted afterwards correct a guest on this podcast a before my collegiate stamper doctor on olempkis expert addition talked bit about this the sort of sea sawing i you ere ting about a wave and a crashing out of the water from the wavepool there was a sea sawing from pleasure in pain is going to be a longer and deeper period of lack of pleasure following that and i think a lot of people thing oh well that is gratin on they want the intense experience but if that intense experiences coming from pornography and masturbation or i speos coming from you hidrennalan activities you know life a life risking parlor hanging off the side of a building it inevitably is going to lead to depressive episodes lolabito episodes that follow is that right correct in a similar physiologic way a to withdrawal from stimulants amphetamines now is sex with a partner different because there are many people who are chasing more and more intense experiences with a partner as opposed to through pornography and masturbation and gan here wore tie about all ages and i should always say any time we are talk you about sex with a partner were talking i the the four conditions that i was lay out on the a you win not podcasard that re taking to consensual age appropriate context appropriate species appropriate interactions e and a this is also a case where the use makes the poison if there is a obviously mean all those criteria if they have one preference a that for both of them is a positive experience then that is likely o you are not going beagle to maintain dopamine over a certain threshold for a long period of time there very well may be a crash from that experience as well and the crash may be different in one partner of in the other interesting a down analogy to food o vinic you do not have to serve the banquet meal seven seven nights of the week may be just too is that right and there are other delicious foods out there and yes use that an alert is very reasonable i can not try to be p g thirteen just trying to a i parsimony ocean's razor the ability to describe a lot of things in in in a few words it'd to return to the key things that people should do or i should say the key things that men should do to optimized their harmony we talk about getting some movement getting some sunlight getting quality social connection one way o the other avoid excessively frequent masturbation and you in pornography and for some people zero might be the optimal number and i to coming back for those people for most people interesting i feel fortunate to have grown up prior to the availability of internet pornography have never been a consumer pornography at just not been my thing it but i hear often from mails of all ages about their diction to it there affliction by it it is really a serious issue and that is on o the reasons we ism grateful that you are willing to talk about this and your clinical experience with these patients it'd to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called g one is a vitamin mineral robotic drink that covers all f your foundational nutritional needs have been taking athletic greens since two thousand an twelve am delighted that their sponsoring the podcast there's i start taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athletic greens once ore usually twice a day is that it gets to be the robotics that i need for got health i got is very important it's populated by got microbioda that communicate with the brain the maun system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long term health and those robotics in athletic greens are optimal and vital for macrobiotic health in addition athletic greens contains a number of adaptions vitamins and minerals that make sure that all my foundational nutritional needs are met and it taste right if you would to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock calm slash supermen and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you are on the road in the car on the plain et camera and they will give you a years supply of vitamin d the k too again that is athletic green stock calm slash supermen to get the five free travel packs and the years supply a item and three k to terms of exercise youknow hearts it again it is a double edge sort on the one and it is great to get exercise but i familiar with you in if i train an hour a day your ten minutes of warm up in fifteen minutes to an hour of wait training or fifty minutes to an hour of cardie i feel great specialyif a once a week i take a complete day off the sort of my general casual ism also familiar with when i go out for runs that are excessively long two hour runs or i spend ninety minutes in the him too frequently her to feel gambit everything suffers my sleep starts to sufferer does not matter how much i ye i do not seem to recovered i do not feel well i realize that recovery ability varies between individuals but what you think is a healthy sustainable exercise regimen that any one can follow that will also support their hormone status for really vigorous exercise around three to four times a week is very sustainable over a long period of time on top of that you could add in three or for more instances of less vigorous exercise o case for less virus we you mean youszown two cardie where you can hold a conversation but beyond which you you cannot and for more vigorous you are you are thinking wait training or hit a highintensity internal type train is correct a you can also wait train and have some benefit even at a low to moderate intensity if you think about a went training where you have and it is not necessarily to to the incidents of does which is delayed on set muscle stress but if you wait train lazy or easy from time to time have a see one await tried very heavy from time to time as well because of a more lean body mass growth but a if you wait train the lighter you are going to be able to do it more often and it can still help with the hypertrophy of a college and for example intendant in bigamous here again am but to a perhaps drill into this notion of intensity and light waits because for me some of the most brutal work outs of everyone were in what i would consider a high repetition range fifteen to fifty i she i went up to or again to watch international track and feel championships we went bid it am cameroon raises place i the cameroon hands and he an his trainer put a through a work out that was twenty five to fifty repetitions preset and it was done in circuit and it was brutal it was light ism that is those weights were nothing in some cases it as body weight but the number repetitions was brutal when you say limiting intensity ire you tucking about limiting the number a sets to failure i took him out am a really being kind of lie lazy bear in the him i to do there onto long long rest to that sort of thing ism what it what your thoughts on that as it relates to hormone optimization it'll just mention and then ill let you answer i feel best over all when ism training for ten minute warm ups in about forty five or fifty minutes of wait training where ism pretty lazy between sets two to three minute rest s training somewhere in the six to ten rap range going to failure every once in a while but mostly getting that sort of last rest before when i would thing is failure no force traps that kind of thing and then jogging on the other days nice and easy when i do that i feel fantastic in all other dimensions of life when i train more intensely than that even with light weight faster cabins in lower rest i feel garbage i get a head ache in ornery i everything suffers what a your thoughts on kind of at defining it optimal exercise drag for forms have never measured my hormones and those two different contacts but a have to imagine that its coatis all related when they study the effect of exercise specifically vigorous exercise a one area that is been studied is a vigorous exercise episodes lasting longer than an hour and they usually track it by a rating of perceived exertion which is not perfect and its not extremely factional but it is helpful for clinical science but the take away from that is basically do not it is not hormonally helpful to train especially regularly train vigorously for longer than an hour gets it i ism happy to hear that because sounds for most people that hour of work is really the threshold an this important for people to hear especially a males because i think with all of the incredible examples out there people cam avid yogins people who are training for very long periods of time and leaving a side am all issues of what people are doing in order to optimize a recovery i think an hour a day of exercise is just a great program m a that most any one can follow and beyond an hour you start running into challenges and i the occasional ninety meant or to our work out as none deal but if you start doing that more than once every to months i think your headed for trouble have you seen that in people's blood blood work and in their hormones you ever see people that are just badly over train because hit is training too hard and too often yes when the blood work is particularly bad they're often in a large cleric deposit as well there is a synergistic effect between a cleric deposit even if you are maintaining adequate protein and take you might not be maintaining adequate iron and take or adequate fight of indeed and you are also just literally in a cleric deposit perhaps low cars as well very low free testosterone and they are simultaneously doing a lot of vigorous exercise i often here and ism starting to wonder whether not some of the am quicker to results nutrition tactics things dropping all carbohydrates we i the quicker to results exercise habits starting you to six day a week really intense work outs whether or not in the short run they work because they cause the cosmetic changes the people are seeking but that they really undermine the overall goal which is at least to me to have your hormones maybe not optimize to the you a hundred per cent but to always to be aiming for a hundred per cent and be close to it at every stage of life consistency is key here if you are not consistent then a the law diminish in return certainly applies eighty or ninety per cent of the benefit over many many months is far better than a hundred per cent but only half the time at one thing that have found to be tremendously useful is to finish the work out while i still have energy do not take myself to exhaustion and then ism able to count of tub about the dovekie wave pull ism able the side that into the rest of the day feeling great i ice or am save or bank some of the vigor from the training to bring it into my work but then a get ism not an athlete i get a to think in the speak not to a not to lift waits or to run another composer that is the balance between your sympathetic which is your fight or flight nervous system and your part sympathetic which is your restore digest nervous system there is an anecdote which is likely true that many a let body builders are very part sympathetic besides while they are lifting weights seeming they are lazy and they to eat a lot the lazy bare in the him chin of phenomenon absolutely a but that being said after a very very vigorous work out for example one where your train to failure which body builders and power lifters do all the time you feel the a tiredness or you feel the strain from that heavy a sympathetic activity when you are lifting to heavy weight and it can potentially effect how you feel the rest of the day many people who have a job where that is highly cognitive do not to have an extremely vigorous work out in the morning which is when a lot of people are able to exercise when i exercise early in the morning that is before nine a m i have more energy all day long if i do at mid morning i have experience more of an afternoon crash by some circadian biology in there i walker noticed and have shall seen in my blood work that if i do not get out for a forty five minute jog at least once a week all of my blood profiles suffer in direction than i do not want them to go in particular testosterone and estrogen move in directions that are not conducive to my rolls am it'd to talk about some of the approaches that people can use in order to optimism hormones and these days for better for worse i think for worse younger guys are asking about and using testosterone replacement there be called t art and i just want o frame this out by saying there is no strict cut off for what is t a ta there plenty of people who a blood levels of testosterone and estrogen are in t within the normal reference range and decide to start doing these things course they can limited fertility there bunch of issues even at non quoting u steroidal a performance enhancing dosages am it'd love to frame this out by first defining our terms because one of the challenges on the internes people talk about t a tee then they'll talk about performance in hanging drugs he'll talk about steroids they are all steroids o idol in testosterone western are both steroid hormones but what one considered replacement there be verses what one considers performance an hanging is can a depend right here is my question why in the world why in the world would any male in his teens or twenties worth even thirties whose blood levels of testosterone and estrogen are at the appropriate levels me within the normal reference range why would they take exogenous testosterone given all the negative effects n fertility ism some of the challenges that it can present if the dosages are not quite right et camera why would they do that certainly if they are not been paid for particular endeavor the not making money if there are playing sport chances aether not allowed to do that anyway it is ion the ban substances list to me it just seems a crazy idea am but then again ism of a generation that really has not thought about doing that stuff until people in their forties an fifties we even never is there ever a case for somebody in their twenties or thirties to take testosterone expect if their blood levels are within the three hundred to nine hundred anagrams series ta leader reference range not many cases the reason for any performance and hanging drug whether or not it is a steroid synthetic identical or otherwise a it varies a lot some individuals do it only for cosmetic reasons m even if it can have deleterious effects on a the cosmetic appearance for example of your skin in a long run but a they know everyone has their different reason as far as when does the benefit outweigh the detriment not very often if here a in your twenties certainly a probably almost hardly never there is always air cases calming condom it what not but almost never if you were very young o case for bible inert twenty thirties and beyond forties et camera whose testosterone and estrogen levels are at the appropriate ratios and in within the normal reference range and they feel pretty good right whether madams examine the for feel pretty good as for code for a libido energy recovery et camera and a feeling your least am workable for it for their life style for those people what can they do besides get great sleep train but not too hard or too often et camera et camera what are some of the things in the realm of supplementation that can help them optimize their testosterone an estrogen without suppressing their own indigenous production of tostostron an estrogen let us mention creatine is the first one creatine is interesting because at as multiple different effects at helps with menoasit synthesis it also helps with oxidation stress it can also serve as the back up fuel tank for yourmoticondre kind of holding back up e t p and it does slightly increase total testosterone and it also increases the conversion of testosterone to hydra to testosterone so potentially it is especially useful in a men in the even their teen a years and their twenties you mention the conversion of tostostron to hydro estostron and there is mythology out there that creating can increase hair loss ism guessing because there is at least one study showing that creating can increase the h t hydra tostostron and t is one of the primary harmony that can promote man pattern baldness the question therefore is does cream creatine supplementation increase the rate of hairless theoretically at can but a inn each individual a preventing hairless is a very poor reason o creatine because it is not going to take you too a supra physiologic level it is not going to a increase your androgen to an normal level of binding i feel a this if that was a reason to not take creatine for hairless then any sort sorry you mean hairless is not a reason to avoid taking creatine correct hairless is not a reason to avoid taking creatine m it think of it as just bringing you to what you are am naturally inclined to have if your conversion of testosterone d h t is already high then often creatine does not effect this it just kind of resets your balance between testosterone being a aromatized to estrogen or being five a for abduced d h t it is not going to speed up hairless more than am just naturally be mail does in some individuals it will have no effect in some individuals for whatever reason they have almost no five fora dictate activity hat will return them to natural or normal i see wat i take five grams a day of creatine on a hydrate i do it for the i tissue solemnizing effects for exercise benefits but also for the connive effects i do not know if it is increasing my hair blossom in a got little bit of a sort of a widow's pe tie hairless that is where it is for me am i suppose beard growth associate with the h t too must is that right i it what i learned but then again i have not been in the learn a long time is that because of cane differences in receptors that d she causes hairgrowth on the face and his loss on the had is that right yes and the amount in the sensitivity and density of those receptors is genetically determined and is it true that if your mother's father was bald that you will be bald in the same pattern and if that he was not you will not that is a decent correlation part of the proposed mechanism of this when the several genes and you can actually estrogen's for hairless you do get at decent amount of them from your mother the unique thing you get from your mother that she may have gotten from her father that she got one of the copies from her father is your ex cromasom an the androgen receptrgene is on your excromasom all men got their androgen receptor gene from their mother it is on their ex cromaisom not on the we cromasov correct interesting even though all of the sort of a could not to man mail promoting a genes are on the i cromazon malaria inhibiting et camera interesting o case of five grams a day of creatine for most people should be fine ism beneficial for tissue colonizing o strength a bring water into the muscles and and for cognac the cognac effects and the clinical support greeting i think it is is quite strong at the program predadosage a what other sorts of supplements am can people benefit from we array talked about the omegas and making sure the people are getting enough periotic fiber to to support the gupmacro boom i invite him index a what other supplement base tools i can people consider another woman can loop in with creatine as data in some people are non responders to creatines you can increase that to ten grams or you can use its cousin bate in to help with the men act synthesis and shunting of energy along with that i would put ell carnations which is actually the smallest petite hormones just two emenoacits that are put together it is a it is a hora a interest ism not challenge baptize yen's not chili call it up a peptide it more than a hormone ye i i would not call el carnation hormone but i would call itopenmino a hormone i could a you negro hormone it is to art to define things as transmarers or hormones at some level i agree i ell carnations i ashashould backtrack again auto you recall a what dosage people typically would take if their i creating non responder one to three grams d i ye several versions of creating have data en mixed because it helps with the processing of mathyinine and homosistine if somebody is already taking creatine and likes it in response to it o raise my hand such as myself would adding betaine help or is it redundant with creatine only if their homoassisting as persistently elevated n homossisting as canalize an inflammatory marker that can build up if you are not converting enough of it down the street how would i know just the blood just cancer if you knew your m t a cheddar polymorphism which is basically how you a ad methyl groups to a many things in the body great any side effects abating that people should beware of not that i know o be we look it up and o examine not come great sight for that they will surely list it they just revamped their sight by the way and it was possum before and its platinum now am ell carnations a what are the ways to take ell carnations i know that there is an oral forms of capsule and there is injectables injectables i think you need a prescription is that right correct you new to prescription for the injectables or you so really get a prescription for the injectables for when you inject it a of course at the supervision of your doctor it is usually done intramuscularly it is an aqueous solution it does not have an oil or a carrier oil in it tar tostostron esters to however if you inject it to superficially it is not g to make a rake anything often it just burns if you inject it subcutaneously and it is not u disseminate throughout the body as well ell carnations potentially has localized effects if you inject it if you invest t it oral then it as a very little bile availability maybe only ten per cent but most people are going to be able to get el carnations only or you not in its causal form what are the dose use of el carnations that one needs to invest then if they one to get a benefit because of only ten percent is being absorbed it is pally a lot of el carnations how much should people take prude youshould i recommend a for oral el carnations between one thousand telegrams and up to four or five thousand telegrams wonderful maybe even five grams correct o g up to five grams a day if you are on that much especially if you have a deregulated got microfilm you should be concerned with t ma o which is a potential carcenagine that both carnations and cosine can converting to and you are got microbial a determine how much that happens ut is it true that i can offset any negative effects of alpha g p c a cosine that is an el carnations ism that i take by ingesting garlic is that right there is a compound in garlic called malison i believe it is a all i c in it is also part of the scientific name the genus of a types of garlic and this cannot help decrease the conversion tot man barbering actually slightly decrease the conversion to t man is well ism probably through alteration of the cut microfilm and then just am optimizing your got my chromium can decrease conversion not everyone needs malison but it something that you should certainly consider if you were on a hides ism going to continue to take the six under milligrams of garlic every time i take my el carnations but i am going to skip the barbering gas barbering gives me brutal headaches and makes me crave carbohydrates because it drops my blood sugar it has many other effects including the don phenomenon where it drops your blood sugar when your sleeping and you cannot even realize it i am not a fan of berberine and ism sorry for those of you that are imam not trying to offend any one about frankly if you are being offended by my stands on barbering can maybe we should hae another discussion in any case i indictable a carnations if one can get that through a doctor how much is absorbed in how much should one take almost all of it is absorbed in general you are taking between five hundred telegrams up to you con take a pretty dose up to two thousand telegrams who can what we did not talk about is what el carnations does why should why should some one go through all this is it optimize testosterone is it ism working on the receptor side what what is el carnations doing it is a shuttle i think it is named carnations palatial consume a basically its it just takes new grants from outside dramodicondria and puts them in and also has a unique effect we will not to unique because todalifel actually has is effect as well is that it increases the since of the androgen receptor in the sidoplasan of yourselves even if your energy receptor sensitivity does not change and even if your does not testosterone does not change you will have more tests er on biding to that increased number of receptors does one need to cycle i carnations creatine being no reason to cycle any of those of what other supplements can one use to chin improve forgot profiles an and here i realize were using a very broadbrush because we say improve hormone trophies what are really talking about and for me at least i i think about the subjective stuff do people will feel they are going to have more energy is a consequence of doing these things are they going t have the a more optimized libido are they can have more optimized a recovery from exercise a because i it is not clear to me that taking once testosterone from six hundred to eight hundred is always going to be a good thing especially if estrogen is increase in in parallel that could cause issues it could certainly make things better it could certainly make things worse right o with that back drop a what are some of the other things people can take and will go back to this issue of what really is optimization let us briefly mention invited in d which is also a hormone it is actually astral hormone and have if you have deficient item in d and you replace it then you will optimizer testosterone it's also mention bore on sortie a a very high s h b g bore on can acutely help lower it usually in dose of five to twelve telegrams per day it is not really a sustained effect but a bore on is pleaded in soils and many countries i believe it is very high and soils in grease and turkey eating dates or raisins that are from those arias pattentually have more bore on bore on also meet might be one of the reasons why the reference range for testosterone is much higher in those countries than other countries and just remind people the s h b g sex form mining globular is attaching to the stostromolecule and limiting the amount of called are testosterone that is available to have its in bacon cells doctor peter to was on this pod gaskin fact sitting in that very chair you said that the ideal level of for testosterone and mail should be about two per cent of one's total testosterone date would you agree with that number or disagree ism sure peter would be fine if you sad either two per cent is a good rule thumb usually the reference oranges between about one and four per cent some people do have genetic jolly amorphism in s b g a specific in mutation where they have very low s h b gs also men that have varicose veins in their tests assonate as vesica seals ten to have very high s h b gs that percentage would likeably be less than two per cent just because your a per centare of are t to total t is a little bit above or below two per cent that is o k we just need to figure out the recent why it is how would somebody know if they varicose veins in their testicles especially if their testes are still in attach to their body sometimes it is hard to tell a there is several grades if you have a great three or great four test a vesica seal it has what is called a bag of worms appearance think about if you have just resistance trained or it is a really hot day or re serin very tight fitting clothing then if you feel it and almost feels there's worms in the scrotum the other way is to do the scary visual a bag of worms awe just that ya anyway i think parasites when i hear that but that is not what your friend to your telling mut just the a the the texture the best way for most people to check is to valsalva for a long period of time when you valsalva venue return a well decrease tiny explant valsalva it is bearing down your lifting weight or i having a saw movement where you a swallow and a but e lot o times you can almost see a build up of blood in you are jugular veins is well you have a incrdecreased blood return to the heart and increased a blood in the veins himself o case of vote him indeed three ism getting a time out by him in de three specifically when you say bat him indeed am and then bore on five to twelve milligrams per day am and then what are some of the other things to optimism an testosterone that are in supplement for we count talk about things that effect the terodogenesis cascade we could touch on ton cat ale i know we have talked about that a little bit before soviet ism guesting a number of people probably have not heard that conversation also then as long jack and that regulates several different in times in this sterodigenisis cascade and by that a what you mean if and this is another good thing to bugle think anybody interested in hormonoptimization should understand where where stare all hormones come from the come usually from collected all and they can be shunted off to vide him and very easily that can be shunted off to testosterone or estrogens or progestogens quite easily as well but tons cat helps with the conversion a multiple key steps where you synthesize to stasterone another a e think of it is a coincide or factor an up regulator of these steps is insolent and of one a good rule of them is if you are not expecting as much growth hormone insolent and if one for example lower car diets colonic deficits you are trying to cut body fat or bodyweight then ton cat is going to be theoretically especially powerful what sorts of dosage is of tongue at door recommend your patience anywhere from three hundred to twelve hundred telegrams a day with ton cat you need to be careful with the standardization because and if you are thinking about a general tomcat supplement which is by far the most well studied then a you are looking at the your cominone content which is ay plant compound that is likely the main a active pharmacologic effect that is the compound is having the effect on the body and if you standard is the easy comatose very very high then theoretically your having more effect at iloerdoss i take four hundred telegrams of tonga all pererday i take it early in the day because as a bit of a stimulant effect and if i take it after two pit starts to inhibit my sleep have been taking it for years u and i rather that the effects that it seem subtle but you consisting have never cycled it do you recommend cycling it i do not see any reason to cycle it a there is a there is a reason to cycle some supplements but no reason to cycle tonga my bloodworm tells me that it causes an increase in free testosterone for me and also a slight increase in utilizing hormone for me what are some the other effects on very tormontsat u observed in the bloodworm of your patients taking tonga all ton cat can also slightly increase d g a and if you have a very high es h b g again that is the protein that binds up your antigens and estrogens an extremely important protein the higher your es h b g the more helps d crease it they have studied tong cat in a populations with very normal less h b gs and it does nothing for less h b g interesting does that mind it does nothing for somebody over all somebody has ss h b g that is in the normal range will taking tonight benefit them in any other way yes it it will increase their total and free testosterone got it oke does it is it no a f effects on anything else third common growth hormones i purely in these ester sinless pathways were steroid i should say as synthesis and receptor and modulation pathways there is no direct effect on those pathways however any time you alter your free androgen or free estrogen a particularly one without altering the other it will alter the binding protein that binds thyroid hormones any change you make whether it is natural optimization or hormone replacement you are going to slightly skewer your thyroid hormone profile one common actionable example of this that i see often clinically is a some one starts let say estrogen replacement or testosterone replacement maybe they are taking a i with their testosterone replacement at romantic in visitor correct an rotates an evite which blocks the conversion to estrogen if they are taking testosterone and they have very little estrogen than you're going to decrease the binding protein also in as thick sine binding globular which binds active thyroid hormones if you start a t r t and you either have low aromatic activity or no aromatics activity no conversion to estrogen than your free thyroid hormones will go up even just acutely it usually feedback in ambition which is how the body talks to itself and says we need to make more of this or less of this but acutely there is a not always enough time you are going to have very high fired hormones and you can have tack cardiac which is a fast hart rate where you can feel kind of overly fight or flight due to increase fired hormone activity in the in tissue interesting a case of tingly this s a broad range three hundred to twelve hundred telegrams per day and i realize that the source matters there am what ere some of the other hormones that you prescribed your patients who do not want to go on testosterone replacement therapy we take excess t e or anything that we can talk about fidosia next fidogias interesting because it is a genus of plants vedalia arrests is one of them there is many others that are very interesting that species is likely the most well studied and it will increase l h a a as i would not considerate h mimetic does not really mimic it but it increases the release of utilizing hormone from the pituitaries a hormone that finds to the lading cell to the let receptor kind of h c g does and it will increase the release of testosterone i see i think for people in and familiar with h c g human cryonic anatitropin is easily synthetic aluminizing hormone and lionizing hormone is the hormone release from the pituitary that is going to travel down to the testes to stimulate the production of sperm an testosterone but mainly testosterone is that correct a mostly correct a technically synthetic l his also as little r l h or recommitment l h an h c g can b synthetic but often it is just refine from the ruin of pregnant ladies since the a it since the plesyntimix it that is why it is called chronic amanita trope s where are they getting all this pregnant a woman rein i mean is being there is there a location not that i want to go phonation is e i really they're when merman right master pregnant ladies it is very high donating there urine and then there purifying it and then men are injecting it yes we and that is actually the same for men apostle ladies o first trimester pregnant ladies that is how you can make a non synthetic h c g and then for minitropins which are also known there is a couple of different names for it minnow pure a you have been apostle ladies that have very high l h and effs h and then you refine the ffasation elate o a am moving away from the sources and from ruin a fidogiagrestus what dosages a do you have patience take have herd of a some potential toxicity to the testicular sells there is one study in this is a rats study but you can equate the dose of toxicity in rats in humans they did not give these rats any antioccidents but it increases a couple different a i groin lavatory markers one is g g t or gamiglutamel transferase comes from both the testes and the liver and one is alkali and phosphatase also in as all pros again coming from both areas there are several different ways that you can attenuate this increase and you can also just check to see if you have increased in the rat dose that i quits with humans that had no effect the safe dose was an average of three hundred telegrams a day that would be three hundred telegrams a day in humans is the dosage that did not have toxicity correct and often even if there is toxicity in rats there is not texasany human it is not directly equitable but to be safe i another regimen that i have people take his six hundred telegrams every other day or six hundred telegrams three times a week often money weekday fridge this very interesting and irrelevant because i have been taking fidogia for some period of time m all my markers and and less a indicate that there is no toxicity but have been taking six hundred telegrams per day but have been cycling it for about eight to twelve weeks on and then a few weeks off but i s onto your saying ism thinking may be three times per week or or every other day might be better is at right if you are not gotta get any labs that is certainly rite regimen that you want if you are gin to check your g g t and all phons or even take other things to prevent those from increasing then you can certainly be more aggressive with t you ere fiducial dosing you can increase it quite a bit and it has a dose dependent response in both the activities associate with hyghtestosterone and also just ell hand testosterone the tuna more aggressive regiment would be six hundred telegrams daily for a month and then take one to two weeks off nothing that is more or less would have been doing of terrific in terms of other hormones what are some of the supplements that can support growth hormone i do hormone the a sorry with tissue repair and some cases metabolism in fat loss what are some of the tools nutritional and our supplement based one can do to tap on the a grothormone pathway and and let us lump i g f one in there two since there essentially working along the same dimensions a quiconopsis growthormone is a petite hormone and it is released by the pituitary there is growth hormone releasing hormone and gremlin that stimulate the release there is also peptides that our very analogous to these two things you have that pulsatile secretion of growth hormone in a very fast half life of just minutes and then it increases if one there is both peripheral if one and central if one and i two but no need to get into the specifics there is a happy medium to we your growth hormone is at a adequate level and your if one is an adequate level usually those two r con grunt in most cases we just check an if one and occasional my the binding peptides for i one kind of esse b g that we talked about earlier but a your estimating a free if one is is kind of confusing because all hormone almost all hormones have a binding prolines to help regulate them but often you one a look at free testosterone free esterase all free if under at least estimated free cortosall even and free third hormone but a when you are talking about a growth hormone i f one usually you do not need to do anything top to visit if you are a diabetic then a decision on the typodibedies your i f one and growthormone can be too high specifically and type one diodes your growth human is extremely high but your if one is low if you are in a deregulated state or have pathology i would just talk to your doctor about i f on or growth hormone taking thing taking o men acids before you go to bed could potentially help with growth hormone release just because a most growthormone is released while you sleep have heard that fasting can increase growthhormon and i know there is certain patterns of wait training that can increase growthhormon as some of those regiments in the wait room that increase grothormon have been covered by am doctor gunman french who is a a on a guest on this podcast am ma will a refer people to a that episode for the specific protocaulse's high volume training during those training exercises it usually does it transiently for a period of few hours and it a lot of this i oh one is release by the muscle itself it is not necessarily reached by the liver if one that is released directly due to growth hormone signaling usually the growth hormone comes from the pituitary and binds to the liver where usually has a half life of about a week where the pericline autocrat thing of it as the peripherally acting or acting in the muscles itself which is also helpful a is released and is not as concerning because it is not related to insolent resistance a but it is related to the train itself fasting and growth hormone am is it true that fasting can increase grothormon and maybe as a little a related tangent have heard that limiting food and take for the two hours before going to sleep can increase the pulse of growthormon that one experiences during sleep course everyone gets a pulse of grothormon during sleep but i especially carbohydrate laden meals can am blunt that peak that occurs during sleep quite substantially two questions am was avoiding food in take in the two hours prior to sleep help increase growthormon release maybe it is being overly narcotic maybeopeople need to avoid food in the four hours before sleep but regardless what is the relationship between fasting in growthormen release i find this really interesting fasting certainly potently increases growthhormon release however the and binding to the receptor is less sensitive although fasting does increase growth hormone the genes that are downstream to it both the growthormon genes and pigeon one related a gene transcription activity will not be significantly higher however if you are optimizing the growth hormone that is a released as pulsatile secretion it is helpful to avoid eating for two hours that generalothum is avoid eating about two hours before bed i think that is clinically significant and helpful but fasting otherwise specifically for growthhormonoptimization an some one who already has normal growthhormon signalling is not helpful that is extremely a useful to hear house one of the major reasons why people fast as get that growthormorn in grease but if there am adjusting things on the back end that negate that well then a no such luck a not that i have anything against fasting i do as pseudo internet in fasting most because i preferred fairly regular times of day o case or does tell in there is a lot that people can take in supplement form to improve growthormon what about fiery woman what a it some of the things that people can take or do in order to make sure that their thirty common levels are appropriate you will have a balance of iodine and you will have a good source of dine there is some camps that say you should use a huge hides of iodine and the crotocalls for it and there is some that say you should use just barely enough iodine i believes too hundred micrograms pray but you want a balance one of the things that i see that many people do not talk about when it comes to ion and thyroid is there is compounds known as goederogens a goetrogens and these goetrogens are either good nor evil but there actually kind of a nice check an balance you need more iodine if you consume more goetrogens and some examples of these are some of my favorite from foods cruciferous vegetables bore on is also a goeutrogen higher goetrogens her din ingesting iodine containing salt is useful yes or no iodized salt does prevent goiter but it is not necessarily the ideal form of iodine a good forms of iodine often come from the ocean if you look at a chart of hypofhiradism there is a tendency to have more hypofhiraism the more endear you go trying to eat some cruciferous vegetables each day would be the best hate it improve oratory along with plenty of dine you do not want too much iodine signalling many people are familiar with radio active iodine tablets and that is basically an extremely high amount of dine to block out the a the radio active iodine that comes from after of a uncle melt down or what not we have got creatine ben el carnations with allusion garlic a to offset the t me o it him and three for on tongue fidogia fasting love to talk you about peptides i can imagine a hierarchy irk starts with behaviors no and nutrition behaves of course includes training and limiting stress and all the things we talked about before sunshine at camera and optimize nutrition then we talk abut supplements all the things we just listed off two optimize testosterone end we can get into this but estrogen as well which is important for libido and brain function and tissue function and joint feeling good et camera but then we get into the realm where one might or could consider exocnis hormones get taking a small dose of testosterone are taking a small dose of of g h even if o if that were appropriate and certainly only working if the doctor but in between there is a step of call peptides and of course there are many peptides we have already talked about some of them but when people talk about taking peptides the ones that i hear most often about is a a category that increases g h and i g f one and those to my knowledge go by the rings sirmorellan i promorellan tessamorellan for of a a kit of things that i takin separately or or in commination to increase g h and i g if one but then other people for instance are taking peptides b p c one five seven to trying improve tissue healing in recovery there is a lot of interest in peptides please if you would tell us about what about the safety of peptides and terms of their sourcing and the utility of peptides you knowresist something that people should consider before thinking about hormone replacement should people be weary of these things i am very weary of particular sources that are sold on line that are not clean they contain contaminate and that could be dangerous i really we love your thoughts on peptides i us going to sip back and let you if on peptides but if you could touch on some of the ones that i mention a be most grateful a peptide is just a chain of amino ascites between two and a couple hundred in length i think of peptides as several different categories and the g h ups that you mentioned i would consider those the stands for growth hormone releasing peptide you have two man times the gremlin agonist that or they hit the gremlin receptor and tho at at helps release growth hormone because of that and then also t a g h or h peptides there very similar to growth hormone releasing hormone often they just change a couple o mind acids and it acts that tesamorlan is one of them sir moral is another one and c g c is another common one i believe those are all in the class of g h or h peptides whereas hypomorellan or i but moral which is also nan as in case six seven seven those two are in the class of grain agonists other more a they hit the receptor that gremlin does eyes the other ones hit t g h or h for kept i think of gremlin is making me hungry hungry and angry why would i want to take something thatwould increase grellaner signalling some people are trying to ganewait it also does increase your growth hormone four growth hodman is very low you can consider i bautamoran is a long acting as a long half life also n as in case si seven seven it was well it was studied mostly in growth hormone deficiency and do these people get angry also they can many people report a side effect of anxiety or significant hunger a most people take it in the evening they do not notice that hunger as much it can also greatly increase your blood glue coasts if your insolent resistant or crediabetic gets especially concerning this is one of those raremoments where i hear something and i they and i think okay even though there's this a kit of compounds that can increased i h and i if one based on everything you're telling me maybe just taking g h is the better option for those people because growth harmony at least it is synthetic growtharmon is mimicking and endogen is hormone may not i certainly not taking anything might be the ideal but for those that one increase growth harmony an the not used pharmacology to do that something these peptides are pretty precarious yet cannot depends on the situation if there is a an individual that a struggles with hunger and not eating enough for example a some one who has a very small stomach or they just a have a very low hunger drive sometimes you want more of that erexigenic signaling the hypothalamus you have anerexigentic signaling which has come anorexia and erexigenic signaling which is i call it angry center of the a hypothalamus or the angry enter and if there is it in balance between those two than a perhaps it'd be helpful bitentually theoretically helpful in angered i of which a the incidents of anerexyat men is increasing significantly as you tell me this ism remembering being fourteen or fifteen years old and i would go into the kitchen sometimes and i was hungry i was just obliterate all the food and i do remember be says been very high energy i but having immense amount of energeneral cannot real if it was a angry feeling or not by messing these growth harmony i grew one foot in a single academic year imagine i was at least in part do to growth harmony a in any case am surmerellan is is the peptic that i here most often about a i it madly try o ronovit as researching a book a and decide to take it before sleep on an empty stomach it gave me a tremendous a depth of sleep but that sleep was really truncated which is is her end speak for saying deep but short sleep it'd wake up after very intense dreams i cannot say that help me recover from exercise that much i did not notice any additional fat loss or anything of abandon it it is the for occasional use again this was prescribed by a doctor i i was trying to get the sense of these these peptides in their effects are a somewhat vague and distributed and highly individual is that of fair wooded to describe them part of the problem with the effects of peptides is many people take them in levels that are far above the physiologic range even individuals who are checking their if one while they take am these different g h a peas most of them do not check the dining peptides for example i finding petite one two or three and i they're free i f one level might be significantly different the a a common dose is that people well take these off label for as a supplement are often much greater than their pubic or physiologic range which for me just under score o act that it is pretty precarious main no ism not coming in here is the refer of what anyone should er should not do i strange a gathering distribute information but it have heard for instance that some of companies where people can acquire these things without prescription they those companies are not good at cleaning out the the lippy jolly scare the all ps which can cousin in inflammatory response motherworts these are dirty compounds i and that just sounds risky it just sounds frankly it just sounds really dangerous to me e ps is a common active in many companies that are not pharmacies but there selling things that people often use as human consumption one interesting note about wipe jolly sackwrite as your a got micropyle manually makes lot of of it as well especially prevatella which is a specific species that can have to do with your base lined body temperature your baseline body temperature might also change decision on if you are on a petite that has e pain yikes yikes and yikes but i tend to be pretty conservative i when it comes to taking anything exogenous but i do rely on a many the supplements that we talked about earlier and right do try and optimize the behavioral things and nutritional things a for a long time to case then i leaving peptides behind am we are now i supposed the territory of exodus woman let us say that somebody besides they are not concerned with fertility or they are going to bank sperm or they already have kids or they are going to defer on this issue of wanting have kids my understanding is that nowadays a lot of people are using to stosterown let us not even call replacement terry because some of these people have six hundred seven hundred or even eight hundred anagram are best the leader reads they are not replacing anything that is diminish they're just trying to augment what is already their increase was already there my understanding is that taking g a low dose more frequently is going to be more beneficial than that and of old school way of giving a hundred or even two hundred telegrams in a single injection once every two weeks is that right and and what do you do with your patient let me give your hypothetical somebody comes into your office they am you their blood work an they have am blood levels of lets say six hundred anagrams perdesolier testosterone their estrogen is also in normal range everything else checks out but their complaining of slightly diminish libido slightly poor recovery from work outs may be i reduce a motivation in drive although no major depression and you come to the conclusion that testosterone therapy not replacement but testosterone there be might be a good option to explore what is a typical dosage of range and frequency of administration range that you might consider exploring and some of this depends on the s h b g and free testostrom as well if that same individual had a very high s h b g which again is the binding proline that binds up the testosterone and all antigens and estrogens if it is extremely high and they have a free testosterone of two then they might need a different dose because they need enough testosterone in order to a have a normal u gentle free testosterone but a general normal down range especially for some one starting is around one hundred to one hundred twenty telegrams divided over the course of a week usually either every other day or three times a week occasionally twice a week many people with s h b g a bit higher can get away pretty easily with twice a week this is assuming that the step issipienate or anatase to sixty telegram ejections of testosterone since t per week y very common dosing to hit that hundred and twenty telegrams per week as kind of the typical average erect and i would consider this i ma a physiologic you ganatltose for many people even two hundred telegrams a week is far above the reference range all of this is said with the cannot that testosterone is azoth normally released in a pulsatile manner it is high in the morning low in the evening whereas if you are on a testosterone therapy then a you are going to have a steady state you are testosterone levels gan to be pretty much the same even in the evening and in your experience when patients do that they ism guessing their report the normal consolation of plosive effects you car improve mod improved energy imprueslee an recovery et camera what ire some of the hazards or things that ism can crop up in blood work or just subjectively that i can be warning signs that even a dosage of a hundred and twenty telegrams divided into these two or three dosages per week is too high every organ system in the body this is when you really have to be a at least well versed in every organ system not just the gentle am genital system you have a term monolog prowess achy is very common change lots of different a skin pathologies or even bruising can be related to hormonorplacement harlots is very common to we as well a mental statuschanges it could occasionally it even induces a manic or a bipolar episode because testosterone is also dupomonurgic and then party of angularly not just in the heart but also concerns for microfascular ischemic disease person built up because the estrogen also increases and then a fertility concerns as well and lipid concerns to severely have to be no hematologist dermatologist cardiologist a a lipidologist the whole vineyards another reason or set of reasons rather to a if one is considering using testostrn therapy to really do this in close communication with a really good physician that is a lot to monitor knowing whether no you acting or not as one thing but knowing whether not your eddy elks going up your a be is going up that is a whole other busy and than hes to be done through bloodworm is what ism here correct and if your physician that is managing or describing your a testosterone therapy or your h r t is not well versed in these systems you would want timer her to be part of an inter disciplinary team where they have other experts that can monster those systems i skipped over a sort of still intermediate set of things prescription drugs but maybe talking bout testosterone first was a bit of a mistake on my part because ism aware that there i should think the companies but certainly groups out there that say no wat do not go straight from nothing to supplements to testosterone once your doing a behaviors and optimizing nutrition supplements let us forget peptides instead of going straight to testosterone therapy one idea that many people are pursuing is to ism take the prescription drugs that trigger utilizing hormones o take taking h c g human chronic canatatropin which my understanding as will increase testostrom but also estrogen where they will take things clomaphin am in fact i think there are bunch at companies out there now there ism saying do not take mesotron it shuts downsperomatages is shuts down a testostrom production clomophin is the way to go ism maybe could educate us about the h h c g monotherapy i think it is called where your justmono one just taking c g and clomaphin as a i and or clomaphin as a tool to a reached up hormones quick points on h c g human cryonic cannot tropic a mad wearing especially the first trimester of pregnant it has effects other than dining to the else receptor it also binds to the t c h receptor in the thyroid it sired stimulating hora yes in fact if you look at a molecule of h c g and thirty stimulating hormone they are extremely similar however you need a relatively high dose of h c g to into the t trot after this is the normal mechanism and pregnancy that accounts for the increased need of fyrd homo usually about thirty to forty present that is why if someone has hypothoranism you to increase thirds o thyroid because the to gs not going to be doing to for you a the closed or clomaphin there is too main a i believe it is wisteria isomers and one of them is inclomaphan one of the menu clomophan these two work slightly differently a inclomophan i believe has a faster half life and it is a potentially slightly better tolerated however they were studying it a closet is a very commonly prescribe drug and obviously there is plenty of in clomyphan in a closed however the drug which was entresol a endioro ex hall a did not go all the way through the it approval process despite closed being f t it proved case there is closed which contains clomping but there also because we thing my men form malhormon optimization this episode there are mails out there who want t increase their testosterone and other hormones make grothormon et camera who option not take exegesis us positrons a no cream no pellet no no am ill no indictable sapient but decide to take clmophin a couple times a week my understanding have never done this i would say if i had understanding is that taking clomaphin maybe two fifty kilogram talent us a week is what i hear people are doing will increase what utilizing hormone the serious estrogen receptor subunits could you explain how clomaphin would benefit anyone and is this a good strategy i am hearing that it is been done quite a lot now it will increase testosterone in a dose dependent manner but it has many other pharmocodynamic effects which is the effect of the drug on the body other than its effect on the hypothalamus in the pituitary in the hypothalamus in the pituitary it a does what is called negative feed back in ambition a or it it blocks the action of estrogen it crowds out estrogen from the estrogen receptor on the hypothalamus in the pituitary and what is this objective effect that that would cause sod my understanding and experience of estrogen is tit a if i ever took and i did take a very low dose of an from an taken visitor once and felt terrible she reduce libido joints fell achy that is when i discover that while estrogen is actually really important for your brain function for joint function and for libido and suppressing estrogen for me turn just turned out to be the the wrong idea but my levels indicate that it is within reference range o k why would i want to take something that would increase the activity of an estrogen receptor i just cannot find the rational for that the main rational behind taking a seem is as a very temporary measure that is not going to so press pituitary or hypothermic function if you were testosterone is just drastically low that it is unlikely to recover anyway anyway most of the time it is not clinically useful in m seem should not be prescribed very often certainly not as long term testosterone replacement i ortestostrn optimization in most individuals here is always exceptions to everything but there is five different estrogen and estrogen related receptors there is too man estrogen receptors in closed and every seem has a very unique profile because they selectively inhibit some receptors and some tissues but not other receptors and other tissues for example am closed can inhibit receptors that are any i and it can cause am visual changes blistery vision i especially at higher doses and it also acts in every other tissue the body site effects from clomedand other selective estrogen receptor modifiers are very common ism at least by my mind ism going to pool hem with peptides and say it sounds precarious and am probably not ideal for most people am going back to testosterone therapy than a notice folks have released the replacement part because i think many people are using testosterone therapy without the need to the sort of reference range need to am to replace anything but rather building on what they already have for purposes of increasing vitality et camera going back to that a minorstanding is that taking h c g i several times for week can help maintain spread cynicism fertility even while people are on testosterone but and you now re took about the earlier that there is tremendous variation some people well take a small amount testosterone and just crush their sperm count they just will not make any viable sperm other people can maintain viable sperm production while on testosterone especialyif their teaching taking h c g is that right correct and there is many reasons for this some of this has to do with heat damage to the testes supetentially colt there be could be helpful for that am a ice has colciours we are just a and certainly avoiding most son one eye m stopping the daily hotter can restore fertility and many people i know a number a people that are trying to conceive children that go into the son and those put a cold pack in their shorts or between their legs depending one another wearing shorts are not lam where they will alternate ice in heat in a way that maintains i coolness of the e milieu in which the the sperm live other words i they're cooling i there scrotum a deliberately in order to avoid killing the sperm aches on interesting paper a that said that for every two degree increase in i a temperature of the scrotum there is a twenty per we n decrease in in spermatigenisis and a an viability of sperm and that actually if you look at the difference between people who stand a lot sit lot and drive a lot what you see is a progressive decrease in sperm countlhey because when people are sit sitting there is an increase in temperature and then when they are sitting on the hot seat of the car there is an am or using the the heated seats she kill sperm inter good data on that ye excellent data an anecdote sit as well have had several patients come in for fertility consultations and all we do is no medications no supplements we change there several lifestyle things a an tight fit very tight fitting clothing is another one and soon they have fertility and a they are no longer they they have per whereas before they did not interesting am to talk about some of the dues and do not but we have talked about a lot of use things tat one can do to optimize swormonts maybe we could just do a sort of more rapid fire a cut and e on some of the do not m and maybe throwing some science a where you feel it is appropriate am cannabis marina t h c yes or no it diminishes testosterone levels smoked anabas i would say diminishes tostostron increases prolactin that is a no other canabinoids not particularly harmful c b d a c be not particularly harmful smoked c b d ism not sure what about enable anabas in t h my as far as i know edible cannabis and t h does not significantly increase prolocutor to a point where it would be a destructive of hormones can marina t h c cannabis when every one call it increase ganacamasty of the growth of man breast tissue yes it is certainly can and there is a a pretty good association between smoked t h c and ganicamastia what about a nicotine and testosterone and estrogen another hormones smoked nicotine nicotine is particularly concerning not only for tostostrom but also for estrogen part of it is if you're talking about nicotine from tobacco there is many other carcinogens in it especially if it smoked but nicotine even if it is thud in a dose dependent manner i you can use an extremely small amount of nicotine then it is not as concerning in a longeron but it is avast constructor and am one of the main concerns with it would be a party of vascular disease or even a micro f vascular ischemic disease that can lead tenarro the genera tiptasies select a typodominsha that can be partly do to nicotine if you use nicotine for a very long period of time especially at a hire dose it is a dose dependent effect on your hormone profile is tat also true for nicer and nicotine other nicker nicotine gums at my doses if you can use an extremely low dose of a nicotine gum then theoretically that would be a maintainable it is nock in a overload the nicotenic receptor you have asexual coaling and the colinagic system as one of your a may nervous systems of course and you have muscarenic receptors in nicotine receptors and there is just better ways to optimize your nicotenic receptor activity for example osteal coaling pecursures alpha p c pososital cheering posisital coaling a weak seal colonestres and heaters especially natural one's potentially have a a apart as well and then other alkaloids nicotine is an alkaloid from the tobacco plant there is other plants citrine and the a that genus of plants and that alkaloid is also a nicotine receptor artist am is it true that cycling for too long literally bicycling sitting on a a icy too long can damage the prostate yes it can be very concerning especially if you are seed while cycling especial if your putting a lot of pressure on the perineum your a chorus kind a box where your diaphragm sort of makes the top and your absenseratus make the front in the sides your back muscles make the back and then your pelvic floor makes the bottom of the box which is arguably most important part of your core and that pressure can weaken and evenly tin continents and a impotent we are talking early today in the him about how a heavy legwork acquits dead lifts those kinds of things e lotigives are doing to increase their testosterone done correctly can actually augment and build up the strength of the pelvic floor done incorrectly can actually weaken the pelvic floor and leads all sorts of issues including sexual facts negative sexual facts a how does one go about learning whether or not their movements are being done properly to support pelvic floor or to district pelvic floor a the pelvic floor is a constellation of muscles just any other police system in the body and a for is important if your doing devalsalva maneuver which again is that a you can of bearing down or deep breath where you feel all of your absortyte you can also notice that your pelvic floor is tight as well if you have a history of a can inguinal hernia which is a whole kind of lie connecting the abdominal cavity down through the pelvic floor even the scrotum in some cases in that can be a a sign that a there is weakness in that area and you might have to concentrated on it most or even heavy physiotherapist or a physical therapist specifically target the pelvic floor many exercises in which you valsalva or use your a gluten or legs you can learn to squeeze them and have that mine muscle connection in orders to help build up the pelvic floor and there is other things many people are familiar with eagles that is just one of the many different exercises that can help your pelvic floor mi understanding is that while strangling the pelvic floor is good excessive contraction of the pelvic floor can actually limit blood flow to the pelvic area the penis and forth is is again it is a double ad sort right i man you do not want goes out there to start doing endless number of eagles every day because there aching in a constrict blood flow to that area right there is a and in fact the the erection response is part par sympathetic it is a relaxed induced response right cut for the the reason i chuckle as it it for cause we are talking about things we do not have visuals or charts and and certainly a it is hard to know whether or not i given exercise kegler are going to be good or not good am if it is successive what how many sets and raise a does does it take before it goes from from good to bat is there a kind of general rule of them for people o think about that dimming clearly blood flow to that area's key right for sexual performance and yet when one trains the lags a even walks you are getting blood flow my understanding is this that a commination of wait training to stimulate the positive hormonal and muscular and am connective tissue growth is key drives not overstraining but is casual exercise walking and stretching and the sorts of things that will then return blood flow o that area is that it a overly basic way to think about it or will that suffice i think that is a good what to think about it a i think the main point with eagles is there just one of many different things fur having some pelvic floor pathologies certainly or even just concerned about your pelvic floor do not just a take the advice do eagles an you peace that is not near enough it is just one of the many aspects am o case of going back to the rapid kana and the will come back to this issue of blood float was are some interesting science and protocols there question i have is alcohol does it increase a romataste the ends ism that converts tostostron into surgeon or not and am is there a dose dependence there it is significantly does there is a dose dependence in general i would not recommend more than a three o for no standard drinks a one huge glass of wine is probably five standard drinks but a a say every two weeks if that is consistent with what am a discovered researching a alcohol on episode we did on alcohol that no alcohol is definitely better for all aspects of health an any alcollin anyone that says that well red wine contains these various things well it does not contain enough of those positive things to have a plosive effect but that if people do opt to drink alcohol that two drinks per week and meaning twenty grams of alcohol that is probably two twelveouncebeers or to uniform ounce glasses of wine is going to be the upper limit beyond which you arguing to start seen all sorts of negative of facts the other thing to keep in and with alcoholic as a lot of calories seven kilocalories program almost as much as fat which is nine and then it is also very gala unit at it it can activate inhibitory hero transmission am and that can also effect how many how much a elation envisages released that can also decrease testosterone almost kind of a similar to how opiate can decrease to stostro ism feel very lucky that i do not enjoy ill call never really did you cannot take it or leave it certainly do not sedatives value or anything that which as you just mention can suppress to stostrone you said the word fat ism gin to pick up on that an say in order to optimize hormone production is it important to have some saturated fat in one's diet and what happens on very low fat diets to testosterone estrogen another terror hormones fats interesting because am there is many different beneficial fats it'll make a threes almost every america gets plenty of will make a sixes any developed country really when it comes to saturated fat there is more of a correlation with hormonoptimization if you are eating things with saturated fat you ten to have those are things with more fat soluble fidemends and things that a very neutral dine otherwise but it is not vital in general you want to eliminate any trains fat unless it is transfer from the ruminate there is always an exception to everything right there is healthy trains it will make a three fats which are ism form in the stomach of grass get and finished a luminous but ingesting mostly olive oils maybe notbutters in limited amounts was the very a glory dents but a unless we were try increase their colors which gases or great sorts of cops am small amounts of butter we probably oke be not excessive amount as rarity this fat is perfectly fine collesterall has an interest is a collateral and a general phosphor lipids make the player that is around the sell but collateral is also hormone in it of itself because it binds to the estrogen related receptor alpha si consider that in the estrogen receptor category and that can help with metabolism but also potentially have concerns for cancer an tumor risk when it go back to the prostate and talk you about something that is it gan of in newer emerging trend i know that am you have talk to obit about this in a previous pod cast that a number of men i should say number physicians are prescribing low dose to dalifill also known o seals to their man patients in doses ranges of two point five milligrams to five milligrams pray but not for e reptile dysfunction but rather for improving prostate health and presumably they get sort of boost in terms of blood flow to the gent ilia as well but again not specifically to deal with a erectile to function but to deal with prostate health and blood flow to the prostate is that something that you sometimes often prescribe to your patients and of what age to dalifille's a very underrated medication a the age would kind of depend on the indication to dalifille is also a blood pressure medication it can very slightly decrease blood pressure especially at her doses at overdose is it the ho hi dose would be twenty telegrams not two point five telegrams but consistently it can somewhat effect with the cones in the eye that have to do with red and green sight although if you remove it that affect is refer basically if you do not need really really good red green discrimination you can take her doses but in general i recommend no higher than ten telegrams a day usually just two or five telegrams one a other benefit or other use of to dalifille is that it increases the dignity of the androgen receptor similarly to el carnations it is an interesting benefit another benefit is that if you give it to people with bacteria which is urinating at night in general it will cut the episodes in half it could go from two to one which can make a big difference for your sleep which will second daily make a big difference for your growthfulman an tistostron optimization seems you said two point five to five telegrams prerdas nontypical for these prostate in hanging effects yes and you mention the i potential side effects on adjusting visual perception as a vision n scientist i that rings in my mind but in terms of red green color discrimination ism guessing mess you can be a subject in one of the experiments in my lab where you want to be a fight your pilot chances are you can pretty get away it or less red green color discrimination correct it is not considered clinically significant unless am someone is a commercial pilot right some one's getting there pilot exam that is one of the things we look for i commercial pilot's aside you might one ask your doctor about lo dose to dalifill forsake of enhancing prostate health ism certainly monitor in p a prostate spicibegantigen is important i can give an anecdote there i when i a tried terminal and one of the surprising side effects that was not welcome was a dramatic spike in my prostate spicivegantagen no one could explain to me why that would a happen but when i stoptakin stermoral and it went back to normals is one reason i avoid her moral an at least frequent use of sir moron i a p a should be kept what below levels of you know somewhere between one and four is considered healthy is that right it depends on the age if there is a twenty year old likely between zero and one if there is a forty year of likely between one and three and then if there is an eighty year old it would not be abnormal to have a p we of five and have that be well within the reference range another thing we should mention about p was if you do take a five alfroductas in hitter finasteride or do astride often these will cut your p s a an half if you for example if you have a p s a of six and you start finasterider youtasteride and then you recheck it in six months and its six point five that is a huge concern becausethat is actually doubled glad you brought this up because a i almost overlook the fact that i get a lot of questions about drugs to off set hairless most of those drugs are going to operate through the d h t system the diapers testosterone system for the reasons we talked aby before d receptors being on the scalepan i counting bear growth on the face is it the case that a number of people ting i things prop ta and other things to block d h t or disrupt the d h t pathway are going to experience diminished strive diminished am kind of motivation and general vigor and if are there alternatives topical d h t antagonists that they might use i if they want to keep their hair but not have those negative effects the way that i think about a hair loss is you have your fertilizers also asunder the growth agonist and then you have your anti androgen whether there is a steric or topical there's both but that is the general layman's way to think about hair loss if you are only putting fertilizer in your hair but you have androgenic alipturmal paterbaldness can those hairs will still miniaturize and eventually you will still have loss such a great word miniature it is enough to send anybody off to find a therapeutic and by the way it is difficult to tell if miniaturization happening unless you have magnifying glass you cannot baton you t second the i to now wit the to you are making a joke your same at miniaturization of the hairfolical directs yogi's the carton reverse that miniaturization god's just a fun word to famine just keep saying it h individual has a again we mention the androgen receptor males only have one androgen receptor genus on their euchromosome opinion on how sensitive that androgen receptor is underpin on the incite of the i receptors in the hairfolical you can have a arbitrary threshold and you do not know what the threshold is until you start o have miniaturization and loss of hair but over the threshold the logical will die and eventually the stemsell will leave but under the the threshold euro k every androgen binds to the same androgen receptor there is nothing special about d h t d h t is just a stronger androgen the higher your s h b g things that increase s h b g or beneficial for hair lost prevention because you have less binding of that receptor if you think about hair loss specifically androgenic or male patternbaldness in the terms of that androgen receptor and everything in general binding to it not just d h t but also testosterone it is helpful it is just that d h t is a huge battering ram whereas the other androgen are just light presses on the door got it are some of the topical d h t r scepter antagonist going to be a better choice for people that want to maintain or their hair grow more hair am if they want avoid side effects likely some individuals a benefit from systemic a systemic decrease in d h t for a couple reasons one could be prostate and then one could actually b hypertrophy of the mile barium d h t also disproportionately thickens the ventral for some one on t r t that might be a benefit that is prone to thickening to the ventral at base line however many people that have just a bit of predisposition they can use things that are topical anti androgen a keep conical is one of them affine is actually another one a drinking taffy topical caff a yes ay my hair tends gore pretty fast as it may be but i drink lot i caff into topical caffeine really rubbing coffee on their head it were we are taking caffeine tablets and has not wait you have to explain how this works how do people get affine into the heroic am topical the affine enters the scalp and crowds out somewhat crowds out the aldermen it is a weak effect it is likely just strong enough to be clinically significant usually caffeine is put into formulations with other things veto conosall that are also weak anti androgen of note personal atone can be prescribed topically but is it is absorbed systemically because the size of the molecule unless your doctor specifically prescribes that for you especially as a male do not use topical spronalactone topical fanasteride is also a smaller molecule it is also systemically absorbed but it is not extremely well systemically absorbed if you take topical finasteride and usually your systemic d h t will decrease by about thirty per cent topical do tasted is likely a tiny bit chemically absorbed but its unique because it is half life is much faster at a lower dose topical do astride will not affect your systemic d h t at all and have seen this anecdotally on many people on topical dutasteride therapy you were can to have to get you back on here do an episode all about d h t in hairless in hair growth is gan not a top thy focus on a lot for myself am but that i get a lot of questions about for men and women one thing that we could mention ai got a ton of questions about turmeric and kercuminoids after a last episode ya but it'd reported my own anecdotal experience that taking numeric really crushed my d h t levels and i did not feel good i mad crushed all sorts of a positive feelings of vitality the moment i stop taking numeric tell great again many people report this and a the interesting thing about numeric is most of its beneficial action not all of it some people benefit from systemic a numeric and someway be that can tolerate it well it is actually great for the prostate but most of the action it does n to need to be bile available it acts on the got microfilm you can take tunic and if it is not absorbed some turmerics as put in special formulations my cellar or liosomol or complex but a lot of it as put with black pepper fruit extract which is also in as big peeing which is actually also a five ofrodoctason hitter and it effects riverside drums and many supplement companies put this black pepper fruit extract bite peeing and almost everything some people are on red hidroses and that could also be making most of the effect of people a who do not tolerate numeric well ye i avoid tunic the plague based on that one previous experience was it was clearly numeric that cassette if the negative effect coma soffit everything reverse rapidly and by tapering the black pepper extract i also avoid that the plague base on everything you just said i i want my five for ducts i want my d h t to be optimize simply because minershanding is t h t is the wore powerful androgen n its the one that yes it causes all bit a heiress and have got a few patches here and there but ism killing to live with that ism based on all the other wonderful things that the h t optimization does a quickly mention a few other things one sal palmetto is also a five ofroduxasnhibiter but only a couple of the isoinzimes there is three man isoinzimes and a lot of the problem is that you are inhibiting a couple of the is invites but not the other one finasteride inhibits one and two dutastride actually inhibits all three and a finasterite inhibits the is inside that is in genital skin but not in the skin throughout the rest of your body a lot of the side effects of finasteride which is loss of sensation and loss of erectile function have to do with the a disconcordence between the sensitivity of the genital skin and a skin again another reason to not destroy five algor ducts and we will devilry get you back on here to talk about d hiding we so to do whole episode about d h t because often when people are think about optimizing hormones specially man males try optimized their hormones they are thinking to stosteron to stouter maybe nowadays they think l a bit more about freetistosteron and maybe they think about estrogen is also being important not to crush estrogen but d h t is at least to my mind the lynch pin of many the things that subjectively people are really focused on libido mote of ton drive et camera have one final question it is just a brief one but many of us have heard that the b p as that a present in in o plastic bottles and even in certain aluminum fans and tallies a difficult word to pronounce but a fun one none the less chalices ism and work by doctorshan o swan has shown that tallied ex a exposure to the us to pregnant mothers in t fuses very likely is negatively impacting sperm counts to testosterone levels and even changing i genitaliasizes for the wo use in males nowadays i saw beautiful lecture that a doctor shanks won did on this when i was in copenhagen and it is very clear that it is negatively impacting the man feed she was also in jorogen's podcast i hope to get er on this podcast however what she could not answer for me was whether not palates and b p as in these things present in plastics and some people in plain tap water are bad for males after they are born and after puberty what are your thoughts on why should just ask you do you drink water out of plastic bottles do you avoid drinking out of cans that are not specifically non b p a containing cans and do you actively avoid tallies my understandings that valleys are most enriched in pesticides and that is why you are seeing dramatic drops an sperm and testactran levels mainly in rural areas where they are dust cropping i do avoid drinking out of fans that a plastics that may have a b p e or bisfenale a in them bispenale a is known to bine to a what i would consider the fifth estrogen receptor estrogen related receptor gamma it it i would i would consider it a zero estrogen lido estrogens are estrogens from plants and in general they are not concerning or clinically significant and zero estrogens are just other estrogens i do avoid a b p e and i also test my water a i you a water testing service and i test it both after its through my water filter and the tap water that my two boys drink almost every day and it is very interesting i only found one micro plastic just a bit over the reference range am was not a terrible tapscore but even in developed countries these are widely variable as far as a putthalates m again very difficult an interesting per to pronounce but i remember learning about these because there is i believe a loss suit i that had to do with mack and cheese and ism this probably five years ago and i was coming up with my list of a each provider that does obstetric has a list what to avoid for the pregnant lady a sketchy belly meats or a high mercury fish swordfish and salmon and actually added process mackancheese to that list interesting thank you for that ism going to extract your statement that you avoid drinking out of plastic bottles when when possible ism gessingou're not periodically attached that if you are dying of thirst you might

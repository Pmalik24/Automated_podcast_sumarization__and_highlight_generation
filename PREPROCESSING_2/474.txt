welcome to the supermen lapotcans a science science space to i manner supermen and ism a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day we are going to talk about science based protocols for sleep mood learning nutrition exercise of various kinds strength and endurance and hypertrophy and we are going to talk about some protocols that relate to creativity we on to talk about behavioral protocols supplement base protocols all science back by quality pure review literature the reason that were holding this episode now is that in the recent previous episodes we have covered some pretty intense and inept topics we have talked about vision and how we see and how to get better at seeing and how to maintain vision we talked about hearing in balance we have talked about chemical sensing and we had a guest episode that covered a lot of information about new and emerging technologies in enrol science as well as mental health that was the interview episode with doctor carl disproof given that we have covered much detailed information in the previous twenty seven episodes of the superman labpodcast i decided that we would hold office hours office hours in the university setting are when students come to the professor's offs were you meet outdoors on campus or in the classerum to review the material and questions from lecture in more detail now unfortunately we do not have the opportunity to meet face to face in real life but none the less you have been sending your questions putting them in the comment section on youtobe et camera and have prepared a number of answers to the questions that have shown up most frequently now in order to provide context and structure to the way that we will address these questions have arrange the science and science base protocols that relate to various aspects of life such as mood exercise sleep waking anxiety creativity et camera into the context of a day selecting the unit of a day in order to deliver this science information and protocols is not a haphazard decision on my part it is actually the case that every cell in our body every organ in our body and our brain is modulated or changes across the twenty four hour day in a very regular and predictable rhythm and it is no coincidence that the earth spins once on its acts every twenty four hours these two things are coordinated by virtue of genes and different prolines and things that are expressed in every cell of your body and selecting the unit of the day is not just a practical one but it is one that is related to our deeper biology you may have heard in my interview episode with doctor called seraph that he himself in order to juggle a tremendous work load a futile clinical practice a lab of forty plus peep a family of five children et camera breaks up his life into units of days and to day we are going to further direct the day as a unit that one can manage and manage extremely well and in fact can optimize we are basically going to talk about how to leverage science passed protocols and when i say science i mean quality pure reviewed science published in excellent journals run to talk about it take that science convert it into specific protocols that break up along the course of a single day and direct certain types of behaviors in order to optimize the various features of life i will couch this in the contact of what i do across a daily twenty for our rhythm that does not mean that you have to follow this schedule at all or even in part it is just by way of example any number of the different things that i describe could be apply to any number of different schedule or frameworks but if there is one truth that applies all of us is that we all have to exist within the context of this twenty for our rhythm that we all possess that is what we will focus on before we begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate for my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cops to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens at lentic greens is an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens an treason i still take athletigreens once or twice to day is that helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which are vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called up microfilm and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essential with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens it get the vitamins i need the minerals i need and the phobics to support my microfilm if you to triathlete greens you can go to athletic green stock come slash supermen and claim a special offer they will give you fie free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin d three k too there are ton of at and ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if we are getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient invited in d three and k too is also important because it regulates things carvascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic greenstockom slash suberin to claim the special offer of the free travel packs and the year supply of vitamin d three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar have talk many times before on this podcast about the key role of hydration and electrolytes for nerve sell function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues in organ systems of the body if we have soda magnesium in potassium present in the preparations all of those cells function properly and all our bodily system can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and dehydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise are mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that you are getting the preparations of electrolytes if you to try element you can go to drink element that is element dot calm slash huberment and you'll get a free element sample pack with your purchase they are all delicious again if you want ta try element you can go to element element dot calm slash superman let us talk about how to apply quality pure reviewed science to your day and how to optimize everything from sleep to learning creativity meal timing et camera as i mention earlier ism going to do this in the context of my day and what i typically do however the specific protocols for any number of different things sleep relaxation meal timing exercise et camera any one or all of those could be rearranged to suit your specific needs i am going to tell you what i do from morning until waking and even what i do while i sleep in order to optimize my sleep let us start with getting up in the morning now for me i tend to wake up sometime around six a m six thirty sometimes as late as seven a m i do not typically sleep much slater than seven a m the first thing i do after i wake up as i take the end that is on my night stand and the pat of paper on my night stand and i write down the time in which i woke up now i do sleep with my phone in my room i realize this is considered a sin and has certain hazards associated with it but i put my phone on airplane mode about an hour before i go to sleep and then i set my alarm typical for six thirty a m and some days the alarm wakes me up other days i wake up before the alarm and yes some days the alarm goes off and i hit news a few times and then usually by seven a m i am up and out of bed the reason for writing down what time i wake up is because i want to know that average wake up time that average wake up time in forms what is called my temperature minimum it tells me when my body temperature was lowest the temperature minimum is the time in each twenty four hours cycle that your body temperature is lowest i do not sleep with the thermometer in my mouth or elsewhere and i do not think you should either instead i know that the lowest temperature that my body will be at across the twenty four hour cycle tends to be two hours before my typical wake up time and i want to know that number its called our temperature minimum four somebody that typically wakes up at right a m then your temperature minimum is some time around six a m remember the temperature minimum is a time in the twenty for our cycle i do not care what my actual temperature is i care when my lowest temperature is and i know that that lowest temperature is approximately two hours before my average wake up time i highly recommend that you write down when you wake up or track that in some way that works for you and use that as a reference point to determine your temperature minimum we will return to the temperature minimum and how you can leverage the temperature minimum for several things shifting your clock shifting your circadian sleep schedule and wake schadual also for shifting your eating schedule et camera we will return to that but even if you do not travel even if you do not care about things jetlag even if you sleep fabulously all your round never have a poor night sleep knowing your temperature minimum that time when your temperature is at its lowest point is a valuable thing to know the second thing i do after i wake up is to get into forward ambulation which is just nerd speak for taking a walk i have a dog and as many of he is a bull dog and he does not really to walk especially not in the morning but for humans and for animals there is a phenomenon whereby when we generate our own forward motion forward ambulation visual images pass by us on our eyes called optic flow and for those of you that are low vision are no vision the same phenomenon occurs in the auditory system sounds pass by us in called auditory flow getting into a mode of forward ambulation and especially experiencing visual flow has a powerful effect on the nervous system the effect it has is essentially to quiet or reduce the amount of neural activity in this brain structure called the immigdula a ligula means almond and many of you have probably heard about the amygdala for it is roll in anxiety and fear and threat detection and indeed the imidula is part of the network in the brain that generates feelings of fear and threat and anxiety does a bunch of other things to but that is one of its primary functions there are now at least half a dozen quality papers published inequality pure review journals that show that forward ambulation walking or biking or running and generating optic flow in particular has this incredible property of lowering activity in the emigdula and thereby reducing levels of anxiety there two papers that i to highline in particular that relate to this phenomenon the first one was published in the journal neuron and the title of this paper is whole brain functional ultra sound imaging that just means they've a cool technique to valuate the activity of structures in the brain a cross the entirebrain reveals brain modules for visual motor integration what they found in this study and i should mention the first authors most say this comes from boon rock's group this was work done in mice but i will talk about other species in a moment what they found was essentially that when these mice walk forward and their eyes moved from side to side which is a natural consequence of moving forward call optic flow is flowing past their eyes many brain areas are activated increase in their level of firing but the emigdaland particular reduced its levels offering that is a very interesting finding but it is in mice however another paper i movement intervention enhance is extinction by a migduladeactivation was publish in the the journal of negro science a strong journal and shows that again these i movements these lateral eye movements from side to side reduce it activity levels in this fear slash threat slash anxiety center in the brain the emigdula now those are i movements they did not specifically look at forward ambulation and yet other papers have looked at forward ambulation and we know that forward ambulation walking forward generates the sorts of i movements that cause optic flow and reductions in a might activation for me this process of taking a walk each morning is not about exercise it is not about burning calories it is not about any of that it is really about getting into optic flow and reducing the levels of amygdala activation now i do not have anxiety at least i do not have chronic anxiety or generalized anxiety i tend have a lot of energy but at these points in the morning ism not very energetic sometimes i am ort of shuffling more than ism walking in fact in costellis almost always shuffling in ism almost always try to drag him first thing in the morning but that walk is a particularly important protocol each day because it really serves to push my neurology in the direction that i it to go which is alert but not anxious and is kind of a fine line sometimes especially as events surface throughout the day meals come in texmucs come in get bombarded with the number of things i want to be alert and responsive i want to be able to focus but i do not want to feel anxious or ism reactive to these things the forward ambulation and this optic flow is the way that i insure based on quality purer lieu data that my imigdal activation is slightly suppressed now at the same time i also want the alertness i want alert an focus i do not just want to be sleepy or supersuperrelaxed i want to have a high degree of focus and alertness because ism soon going to me into about of work i need to lean into the day in order to do that i make sure that the walking is done outdoors that might be sort of a doe but many people get up and start moving around their house their apartment and they do not go anywhere and just walking around inside it will generate some optic flow but nothing the sort of optic flow that you can generate in larger environments out of doors environments if you cannot get out doors doing it indoors is perfectly fine but it is not in to have the same magnitude of positive effect now an order to get the alertness i do it out doors because i also want sunlight in my eyes i know many of you have heard me talk about this at museum on various podcast and this podcast but getting sunlight in your eyes first thing in the morning is absolutely vital to mental and physical health it is perhaps the most important thing that any in all of us cannon should do in order to promote metabolic well being promote the positive function of your hormone system get your mental health steering in the right direction the number of reasons for this but before i get into those reasons let me just emphasize what the protocol is the protocol is get out doors i really with no sunglasses if you can do that safely even if there is cloud cover more photons light information are coming through that cloud cover than would be coming from a very bright indoor ball getting out doors is absolutely how long should you do this it is going to depend on the brightness of the environment it is going depend on a number of different factors two minutes would be a minimum ten minutes would be even better and if you can thirty minutes would be fantastic now it is a very bright day or you live in a place were there is bright sunlight clear day on a snowfield you would only need something sixty seconds but most people are not living in no sorts of conditions getting outside for a ten minute walk or a fifteen minute walk will basically in sure that you are getting adequate stimulation of these neurons in the eye that are called the melonopsen intrinsically photosensitive ganglinsells a no that is a mouthful these are neurons that do not care about shapes of objects or the motion of objects these are neurons that convey to the brain that it is daytime and it is time to be alert and it sets in motion a huge number of biological cascades within every cell an organ of your body from your liver to your got to your heart to your brain really sets things down the right path early in the day we experience a natural and healthy bump in a hormone called qartisall corpus all comes from the a eidola that coatis all as i mention is healthy in normal and promotes wakefulness it actually promotes a healthy immune system i know you have heard that stress and cortical destroy the immune system but not the short little pulse of coatis all that you get each morning it is very important that that pulse of cortical arrive early in the day i one emphasize this again it is very important that that pulse of coatis all arrive early in the day and that pulse of coatis all is going to happen once every twenty four hours no matter what it is going to happen and you get to time it how do you time primarily by when you view bright sun light or bright light of another kind and will talk about that in a moment you want that quarters all pushed early if you wake up before the sun comes out it is fine to turn on artificial lights but then you would want to get outside as soon as you can to get this artthis excuse me natural light stimulation of your eyes and it does have to be to your eyes just to really drill down into the details for a moment you do not want to stare directly at the sun or any light that bright that it feels painful if it is if you feel you have to close your eyes or blink please do you don't want a damage retinas the point here is to get the sunlight indirectly it is going to essentially be scattered everywhere through the cloud cover but from looking at as at a flash light directly into that flashlight verses looking at the beam that flashlight generates on the ground that if you are standing in the shade you are going to get less of that sunlight than you are if you are out in an open field this is why the time outside it is going to need to very depending on your particular environment but do your best to do this every day if you miss a day big deal but try not to miss more than one day otherwise your mental and physical health well start to suffer and doing this each day costs nothing it is just time you can combine it with the forward ambulation with the walk and the optic flow that i talked about before and that is what i do each morning to generate a sense of alertness in my body and brain to generate a sense of calm yet alert and that is also what i do with castellan with my bulldog people have asked me do the same mechanisms apply to animals well the reality is many of these mechanisms were actually discovered in animals and then we are tested in humans and verified that they also exist in humans not always sometimes it was the reverse where they were tested first in humans and then brought to animals but indeed your dog your horse i you now i do not n what other animals are out there they need this now if you have a hamster or nocturnal animal the reason why they to run on their wheels at night is because they are nocturnal they do not being in the light light actually causes them to freeze right actually that you are into a aquaria you fish how i say do not overfeed your fish you will kill the fish that is true but guess what the fastest way to kill he fishes to keep the lights on twenty four hours a day they also need circadian say circadian rhythms these twenty four hour rhythms we will do an entire month at some point about pet health but meanwhile get that morning sunlight we now we have a first photo call which is to write down the time of day that you wake up the second protocol is to get take a walk first thing in the morning and the third protocol is woven in with that walk at least for me which is to get that sunlight exposure now if you cannot get sunlight exposure you absolutely cannot i do not necessarily recommend buying one of these dawn alarm lights they they and ism sorry to say this but they are just vastly over price relative to what they are they are be fly upright fly d i instead use i have a pad that is a nine hundred and thirty lucks light pad i think it is design for drawing those are available at a fraction of the cost that a that a morning light a simulator well would provide and yet it is really a bright enough at least for me i tend to put it on my desk while i work each morning here is a principle that you can leverage if you want to be alert view bright lights and make those lights above you they tend or in front of you if you want to go to sleep sooner you do not want to be awake for whatever reason trying to eliminate your exposure to light and this again is not about exposure of the skin to light this is about exposure of your eyes of your curl retinas to light for those of you that are concerned about blue light i want to emphasize that blue light is precisely the wavelength of light that is optimal for stimulating these neurons in your eye which set your circadian rhythms properly you do not want to shield yourself from blue light early in the day or throughout the day or any time you want to be awake fact that could have a number of detrimental consequences fortunately all those consequences are going to be reversible after a short period of time of making shore you do not wear your blue blockers during the day please the time to wear blue blockers if you do is at night and in the evening when you are headed towards sleep my colleague summer hater who is head of the chronobilgo unit at the national institutes a mental health has spoken about this before on my instergram we held in its grandsire and i said summer what you think about blue blockers and he said i do not think that is a good idea at all unless it is really late at night and you are in a bright environment your trying to limit the amount of bright light that that impacts the eyes eliminating specific wavelengths of light in summer's opinion and also in my opinion is not a natural thing for the visual system in the brain to experience some people get headaches while they work on the computer all dey or staring at screens and they get blueblockers thinking that is going to protect them from their headaches however any protection that you get from headaches from blue blockers is going to be minimal in comparison to what really going on there which is that people are viewing devices and screens up close for too many hours throughout the twenty for hour cycle a better remedy would be to step away from that computer from time to time and to make sure the you can look far off into the distance ideally a distance longer than twenty feet your marines and go out on balcony things of that sort take a walk around get into optic flow if your into blue blockers make sure you are only wearing them in the late evening and at night i personally do not wear blue blockers at all i prefer to just control my light viewing behavior by doing this me i do the other form of circadian control which is cute dim the lights and i do that because dimming the lights and setting them lower in the environment sets up the brain and body for sleep much better than simply just wearing some blue light blue blockers souse me and please know if you do wear blue blockers that if the light in your environment is bright enough it does not matter if you are blocking out the blues these sells in the eye will respond to other wavelength of light have no vendetta against the blue blockers and i fully expect the blue blockanise does to come after me with i guess blue blockers but as you do that please understand that the biology points in the direction of get a lot of bright light throughout the day including blue light and at night just limit the total amount of over all light that you are exposed to including from screens then costello and i get back from our walk sometimes that walk was ten minutes sometimes it was sixty minutes depending on how slowly costello is walking that day indeed many mornings ism the guy carrying his bulldog back up the hill my neighbors know me well they know castellan well that they have since stopped pulling over and asking if the dog is toque sometimes they will ask if i more none the less we get back i give him his food i give him is water and i give me my water ism a big believer based on quality pure review data that hydration is essential for mental performance now i confess i do not really light drinking big glasses are big jugs a water first thing in the morning i do not know why but my thirst does intend to kick in first thing you may be different either way i force myself essentially to drink at least sixteen and most days thirty two ounce is a water i also put a little bit of sea salt in the water as many of neurons require ionic flow what that means as neurons need sodium they need magnesium and they need ataskium in order to function we do tend to get dehydrated at night even if the day is not very hot i try in top off or i trying make sure that ism hydrated early in the day before i begin any work i make myself drink this water with a little bit of sea salt how much sea salt if you really want to get detail that you i expose it is about half a teaspoon it is not much that is what i do and i drink that more less room temperature i find that drinking really cold water firstling the day kind cramps up my insides i do not do that at that point i start thinking about and fantasizing about and craving affine but i do not drink that caffeine yet i purposely delay my coffin intake to ninety minutes to a hundred and twenty minutes after i wake up course i know when i wake up cause i wrote it down although it is pretty easy to commit to memory the reason i delay caffeine is because one of the factors that induces a sense of sleepiness is the build up of a decisive or as some people call it adenosine in our system the build up of a decisive accumulates the longer we are awake when i wake up in the morning when you wake up in the morning your decisive levels are likely to be very low however caffeine isn't a define blocker i it is actual a competitive in antagonists for you a fysionatas he sort parks in the receptor that a denying normally would park at and prevents a decisive from acting on that receptor that is why you feel more alert because its essentially blocking the effect of this sleepiness factor that we all create called the devising the reason for delaying affine an take ninety minutes to two hours after waking is i want to make sure that i do not have a late afternoon or even early afternoon crash from caffeine one of the best ways to insure a affine crash is to drink about who caffeine block all those a decisive receptors and then by early late afternoon when that affine starts to wear off and gets dislodge from the receptors a lower level of a decisive is able to create a greater level of sleepiness it took me years to figure this out i use to wake up and i think h i do not want to drink affine too close to bedtime some t start drinking my caffeine really early i let my cortical naturally come up in the morning i avoid drinking affine until about ninety minutes or two hours after waking and when i do that i find that i do not experience the afternoon crash at least i do not experience that crash unless i do something foolish in just far too much food at launch or i sample all night the night before but provided i do not do anything foolish that to laying affine o ninety minutes to two hours optimizes this relationship between a decisive and wakefulness and sleepiness in a way that really provides a nice consistent ark of energy throughout the day and brings energy down as ism headed toward sleep and falling asleep my primary objective early in the day is to get into a mode of being focused bet alert that i can get work on give found that the best way for me to achieve that state is through fasting i do not eat anything until about eleven am or twelve noon ism not absolutely religious about it there are days when it'll have a few brazil nuts or a spoonful or three of main butter for instance but most days ism not doing that ism just not eating anything ism drinking some affine affine source for me is yo a hamate who you settee take er my preferred sources tend to avoid coffee these days casionall have a cup but most often i stick to the tees i drink water as much as i feel i i need to and want to and i also drink my athletic greens which is compatible at least for me with fasting let us talk about why fasting works to create this heighten state of alertness yet calm brain state fasting increases levels of a adrenaline also called epinefron in the brain and body and when our levels of epinefran in a adrenalin are increased we learn better we can focus better there is terrific at to supporting that you do not want epinefran act a adrenaline too high that feels stress and panic you get jittery you cannot focus but in its optimal a age a adrenalin really provides a heightened sense a focus in the ability to in code meaning bring in and retain remember information and since my job is mainly a cerebral one wherein writing grants and working on papers et camera i fast in the early part of the day i mention ingesting things why your your hamate an or in my case athletic greens many people ask in fact there's a whole community in discussion boards et camera and you two comments on the inner net about what breaks a fast in what does not the fact of the matter is that is going to be highly individual because it is going to depend on how sensitive your blood sugar is not and mort more accurately it is going to depend on things your insolent sensitivity for instance if your somebody who gets up in the morning hydrates and goes out for a six mile run you could probably eat a jar of among butter and still be what is called fat fast at your insolent levels will still be very low because even though that is a large volume of main butter even to me and costello that large number of calories come from a source that does not increase blood sugar very much and insolent very much now am not suggesting you do that but what i just described is a vastly different situation than somebody that et their last meal at two a m and that meal was essentially a feast and for that person fasting until ten or eleven a m their blood sugar might still actually be pretty high or even low is such that they might eat one among and it would bump them out of fasting you get the idea it is going to depend on your recent eating history your blood sugar history your gliadin stores et camera if anyone tells you that breaks a fast or that does not that is kind of silly would one grain of sugar break your fast no would an entire tablespoon of sugar break your fast yes you will get a big slipping blood sugar an insolent from that however how long that last how long it breaks or fast will depend on how gliadin to pleaded you are and a number of other factors for me i just keep it fairly simple i and just water coffin from your hamate and guy just and i drink my athletic greens with some lemon juice in it that constitutes my fasting and there are days when i do all those things their days when i do none of those things although most days i would say about three hundred and fifty five days out of the year ism ingesting water coffin an athletic greens during this period of fasting early in the day and that is the period of time when i do my work one interesting fact about our hamate and why yousates is that they increase release of something called g l p one go p one is related to glucagon luccegon is a hormone that you can sort of think about as opposite to insolent and blood sugar s more complex than that but go p one has a couple of positive properties one is it increases lipolysis and mobilization of body fat stores of burning of fat in fact there are n ow a number of clinical trials that are achieving good success and therefore drugs out there only saveable by prescription which mimic got p on and our being used to treat quite successfully certain types of diabetes and obesity ism not diabetic nor am i trying to shed a ton of body fat but i figure as long as ism fasting and as long as i your bamateing why you which i do i their delicious it'll tell you which type i use in a moment ism might as well increase my got pe one because it is probably not as good as getting out in doing some cardie work but none the less if ism fasted increasing grope one in my system man to be alert from the cabin the adrenaline et camera and ism going to be burning body fat while ism doing my work for me it is just in efficient big chemically rational or i should say grounded in quality you chemistry sort of approach your hamate comes in a lot of different forms that a lot of different brands out there et camera i do not have any relationship whatsoever in a business else to any of these brands some of them are very a smoky i just because of something in my genetic make up or i do not know maybe with me some sort of wicromeasome a located a lesion early in life but i do not smoky flavors ism not a a gudacees guy i do not smoky stuff you main love it but i tend to avoid smoky tasting mates instead there is a particular brand that i just found on the internet called anna park i do not know anna i do not know she has a park and i d certainly do not wat anna park is but for me that is the best tasting your mate again i do not have any relationship to them a but it is a fordable in the contact of of your mate and it is the one that i use and i should mention a long lines of affordability and got p one is there is a nice feature of your hamate which is if you put it in a a filter r metal strainer you for a hot water over it and then drink it keep the the leaves the your hamate leaves can be used over and over again it seems that the go p one stimulating aspects of mate actually are enhance with subsequent for over there is something interesting about these teas that my a tophycianato friends tell me allows the the to release more of some of the beneficial compounds by re using the tea leaves now eventually it'll grow mold and other sorts of disgusting things ism you do not really want ta rutatixperement i would we you can use it for a day or two before it starts to go bad but that is a feature that will extend the life of whatever a yeurbamate you happen use if you decide to use it and that certainly what i do next i wont to talk about what ism doing while ism drinking all this your hamate use ism not just sitting there thinking about all the i pe one circulating in my system ism working couple of things for optimizing work space that are grounded in her science and physiology have talked before about the fact that when our eyes are directed upward literally when our eyelids are open now surprise there and when our eyes are directed upward it creates a state of heightened alert s and this has a relationship to the brainstemnerons that create alertness and there control over the muscles of the eye and believe or not the eyelids now it is not the case that if you are absolutely exhausted and you need to feel more alert that looking upward is going to make you feel wide awake although it will help support your levels of alertness the point here is that you can optimize your work station in a physical way that leverages this aspect of the visual system and your level of alertness since most of us want to be awake while were working try in position your screen or your tablet whatever device you happen to be working on at least at eye level an ideally slightly higher if you think about it most people are not doing this most people are looking down at their computer tablet or are angling their eyes at their screen in about thirty degrees that is not going to support heightened states of alertness and optimal attention in fact the opposite relationship between eye position and alertness is also true when we look down when our eyelids are slightly closed intends to decrease our levels of alertness and increase our levels of sleepiness really one emphasize this that there is a by directional or reciprocal relationship between the brain stemmed areas that control alertness and the eyes meaning how alert you are controls how open or close your eyes are no prize there but also that how open and upward directed your eyes are will increase your levels of alertness and if your eyes are pointed downward and your eyelids are hooded their slowly closing costellos are always are you will feel more sleepy especially for somebody who tends to have that midmorning sleepiness or midmorning crash what i do is i have a standing desk but i also prop the computer up such that it is at least at eye level and i have not figured out yet how to develop work station where the computer is above me i think the only way to really do that is actually to tilt one's body back but actually that is not a good idea either they have done studies recording from areas of the brain associate with alertness areas locus serious and the called particular activating system they found is that depending on how reclined you are or upright you are you will decrease with reclining and increase with sitting forward your levels of alertness body posture and whether not your upright or reclining will impact your levels of alertness in the predictable ways and where you position your eyes whether not your eyes a upright to speak looking up or directly forward or looking down will dictate whether or not you are feeling more alert or more sleepy respectively try and arrange of work station or position of your body in your chair or your standing desk whatever it is that allows you to work with the heightened state of alertness this is really really key for me cause i found that when i would sit down not only when my diplexers start to get sore i feel tight in the back et camera but if i was staring down at my screen all day or even for short periods of the day i would start to feel sleepy and i con figure out what was going on i also thought may be i need glass as i do wear readers at night but it was really a problem and simply by getting the screen directly in front of me at i level it is been completely transformation where now at the description of my day and these protocols in which i would do a ninety minute bout of work now why ninety minutes well the brain is going through these ninety minutes called ultradian cycles throughout the entire day and night every ninety minutes we shift over from being very alert to being less alert in the back to let again here is out works with start of one in these ninety minute altradian cycles my brain is not quite engaged in whatever it is ism trying to do an oftentimes i have things jumping into my mind have got distractions at camera it'll talk abut how to deal with those distractions in a moment but i set a timer for ninety minutes and i train get a strong bout of work done inside of that ninety minutes with the full understanding that the entire ninety minutes is not going to be uniform in terms of my ability of focus there will be can a peaks in valleys within that but that ninety minutes is about what the brain can handle in terms of a dedicated effort for high degree of focus some people can push out obit further some people cannot handle more than ten minutes but that is what ism striving toward you be amazed how much you can get done in ninety minutes if you are focus how do you increase that focus and how do you use the the timer feature well you can combine those i use a program called freedom it shuts me out of the internet completely that means no checking the markets no checking social media no checking ah that the news no checking meal none of that i get a dedicated bout of cordon i confess i do not allow myself to go to the restart in that period of time here is it interesting little tit that is grounded in physiology you have a direct normal connection from your flatter to your brainstorm areas that increase alertness this is why when you have to go to the bathroom when you have to urinate it is extremely agitating it it can be very very agitating ism not encouraging you to yet agitated by filling your flatter much and resisting going to the bathroom that you are uncomfortable in camp focus but i generally will just drink liquids and work away and work away and i will not walk away to go to use the bathroom unless i absolutely have to for odd they were talking out this but this is one way in which have learn to fund my attention into whatever it is ism doing because as you all know the moment you sit down to do some serious work and you flip off the internet a of a sudden its as if the phone has a voice it starts calling you its almost as if the restart has a voice but we all are familiar with the fact that if we are focused on something that all that just kind of melts away the goal is to get into what i call the tunnel to really get into a tunnel of quality work the brain loves that state but it is very hard from any of us to access my phone is absolutely off it is not on airplane mote it is absolutely off during this time if have been struggling with that and i confess there are times when for whatever reason something going on in life it is been harder to put away the phone i will sometimes put in my car i used to joke that i used to throw it up on the rue for something that the have done and i suggest people do whatever they need to in order to in self regulate that activity and if your somebody that feels that you absolutely need to be on your phone and on the computer for this work bout or the work that you do that is a different matter altogether this is just simply how i work i will do ninety minutes and i do set of timer and i turn on the program freedom locks me out of the inner net if some one rings that on the door bell ah i will often shout not coming in the doorbell leave it there i mean unless there is an real emergency ism not gin a step away from that work i learned how to do this when i was a graduatestone under different conditionswhere i use to slice brains on what is call t a microtome house to spend time just cutting very thin slices is a belly slicer but for a brain of ah various types of brains and of section through a lot of brains and we had a rule which is that when the blade hits the brain you do not stop pulling even though it is very very slow even of a newcomer am goes off even of a fire alarm goes off now i do not want anyone burning to a crisp because ah they did not step away from their workflow that would be foolish but that is the mentality that have imbedded n myself that there there is nothing more important then what ism doing in that ninety minute block and that is what works for me you can try various other things that is what works for me in addition i use low level white noise this is something that is supported by quality previewed data re cover this on the episode on hearing and balance but it turns out that white noise which is essentially all frequencies of sound ere all frequencies of sound that we can perceive mixed up kind of randomly there is no structure to it turned on at a low volume not with head phones most of the time puts the brain into a state that is optimal for learning and workflow and i cover two papers during that episode one that show that indeed brain air is involved an attention brain air is involved in focus and cognition and memory those are engaged to a greater degree when there is low levels of white noise playing in the background the other paper that is really interesting did brain imaging and show the areas of the brain that are associate with dopamine release her increase by low levels of white noise dopamine release is associated not just with pleasure but with motivation and craving everything about this n ninety minute block from the low levels a white noise to the position of my computer how ism standing where my eyes or position is geared towards putting me in this tunnel of work and i have to say that while it can be a challenge to try and achieve this state in this tunnel of work some days you start to get kind of addicted to it it feels really good it is a work out for the mind and it a is something that as you exit that ninety minutes you really feel you have accomplished a lot because often you have and it is just feels deeply satisfying and ism convince that that is because of the release of neromodulators dopamine and the a group an efferent that is circulating in your system and i want to be clear that ism not perfect about this ninety minutes occasionally i get drawn away occasionally a something will happen or it'll a go use the restaurum or a costello will have a need or somebody will have a need that it'll that i will have to respond to but i really trying achieve this most if not every day that ism alive because for me that work session is kind of holly it is where i where i set up a relationship not just between me and the work that ism doing but between me and my ability to control my own state of mind using these various supports of the white noise et camera but really those supports are peripheral to the fact that ism creating this space ism funneling my brain into a state rather than allowing whatever events and contacts on social media and elsewhere might be occurring in the world that would yank me out of what for me is my purpose and my mission in life which is to do the sorts of work that i do there is a powerful way in which you can place the timing of this ninety minute workout in an optimal way you have access to a very important piece of data that dictates when this bout should start more o less and when it should end that piece of data is your temperature minimum if your somebody who wakes up on average at seven a m well then your temperature minimum is five a m and you can be reasonably sure when ion er store reasonably but you can be reasonably sure that your best work is going to be done anywhere from four to six hours after your temperature minimum for me i tend to wake up around six thirty a m that means my temperature minimum is at four thirty a m you can add five hours to that that means that a ninety minute work bout could fall at nine thirty a m and it would be fairly optimized or i could do it at ten thirty a m or i could do it at eight thirty m somewhere in there i that we cannot say that it is exactly six hours after your temperature minimum you will find it however there is a precise and best time for you to do this ninety minute work about whether not it is five or six hours after your temperature minimum is going to vary from person to person how do i know this how do i know this relationship between temperature minimum and focus cognition well temperature minimum defines the to off that the career as they say of the of your temperature across the twenty f r our cycle and immediately after that your temperature will start to rise that temperature rise is actually what triggers the initial corpus all release that you experience and wakes you up further and then of course that sunlight that your getting is going to further enhance that healthy release of coatis all that corners all will then provide fuel if you will for that increase in temperature and your body will continue to increase in temperature throughout the day toward the afternoon what you are trying to do in this in this idea of optimizing this ninety minute work bout to particular time a day is catch the portion of the steepest slope of that temperature rise now again you are not work walking around with a the thermocouple or an thermometer om in some orifice a your body s you do not have accurate information about temperature but you can make very good guesses about when your body temperature is rising fasts by virtue of that temperature minimum again just to be clear it is a ninety minute work bout that is about what the brain can handle for a very intense work about do understand again that there can be portions of that ninety minute that your brain is flickering in an out focus other portions were going to be entirely focus this entirely normal but when to place that ninety minute work bout when to start it and when to end it will depend on that temperature minimum if you are somebody who wakes up at eight a m each morning your temperature minimum six a m chances are you are going on o start this work bout somewhere around ten a m or eleven a m now some people wake up and feel very alert first thing in the morning they can really do their best work first thing in the morning please if that is you continue to do that leverage that time use that time but if your somebody who struggles to find focus definitely let your physiology and this rise in your body temperature support your efforts to focus rather than trying to do your best work at times of day when your physiology is actually directing your body in your brain toward refocus and towards being more lethargic it just is setting yourself up for success when you trying capture this rising phase of your temperature up until now we have been emphasizing practices that allow you to optimize your level of alertness and your levels of mental focus dato going back to the nineteen nineties supports the idea that physical movement of particular kinds can support brain health and brain function both in the immediate termite in the long term now this is at a profound impact on the field of narrow science but frankly it is also out of profound impact on how i structure my day after have finished a bout of work this ninety minute bout of work i force myself some days other days i want to but i force myself to do some sort of physical exercise that is going to be supportive of my brain health and brain function and organ health and bodily function in general i just briefly want to touch on what the structure of that ex excise looks how it structured within the day and how its structured across the weeks in fact based on the scientific data and what the scientific data say is best or optimal in order to promote longevity of the brain ability to focus as well as cardiovascular health and all the other things that we know exercise supports now there are various forms of physical activity or what we call exercise but those can generally be batched into two categories first is strength and hypertrophy work physical movements that are designed to make you stronger and or make your muscles larger there is also endurance work physical exercise and movements that are design to allow you to do more work over time or to extend the amount of time that you can do work of any kind both physical and mental and we did two full outcasts episodes on the details and the science and the protocols related to these topics we did not episode on the science of strength and hypertrophy of building strength and muscle building and that included a lot of protocols and we did an episode on endurance how to build any one or all of the for types of endurance which are muscular endurance anerobic orbit long distance endurance et camera f you're interested in the specifics of those protocols pile see those episodes however right now i just one to emphicise how the data impact my day and how i structure my day in a way that i can incorporate physical movement in a way that supports brain and health basically after i finish that cognitive work about that ninety minute workout i do some form of physical exercise for about in hour the date all point to the fact that working out hard for longer than an hour can actually be detrimental because of the way that it raises cartes all and cartes all can be a good thing if it is appropriately timed and in the appropriate low levels but you do not want to have your quarts all levels up throughout the day or have big spikes of cartes all repeatedly keeping work outs relatively short can definitely help with that and certainly if you are training hard sixty minutes or less should be more than sufficient and for many people including myself forty five minutes or fifty minutes as probably even more optimal the basic design of this physical exercise is that it be approximately sixty minutes may be sixty placerminas fifteen minutes should be well within the margins of keeping hormonal health proper and not going too long nor making the work out short that it is not beneficial and essentially what the data tell us is that in order to optimize cartyvascular and brain health and other systems of the body we want to exercise at least five days per week i know that seems a lot a it certainly is a lot for certain people some of you you a compulsive exercisers a might gasp at the idea of taking two days off i personally find that taking woful days off for weak is actually a both beneficial to my a exercise training performance as well as a pleasant i those essays but essentially the structure of the exercised regiment that works for sake of supporting health is going be one in which there is a three to two ratio where for a twelve week period or may be ten to twelve weeks three of those five work outs per week emphasis strength and hypertrophy and the other two emphasis in durance then after ten or twelve weeks ones which is over to at ten or twelve week regimen of doing a three to two ratio where your prioritizing endurance work primarily the sorts of work outs that are described in the endurance episode and those protocols and the other two days your focusing on strength and hypertrophy work merely to maintain strength and hypertrophy do not lose the strength and hypertrophy that you have created and there are a lot of data now supporting the fact that maintaining muscular health in bone health is supported by resistance training weight training of various kinds can also be done with body weight if you do not have access to equipment and of course that doing party of vascular endurance work is very beneficial both to the muscles of the body the organs of the body but also to the brain many view of probably heard that down physical exercise of various kinds can support the production of new neurons in the brain frankly those data are specific to research animals as far as we know increases in neuron number are not supported by exercise in humans there is a little bit of data that supports that may be a few neurons might get created by running or weight lifting or things that sort in human beings but there still a host of other reasons to have this hour or per day where one is doing physical exercise and those include increase blood flow to the brain remember the brain is an organ too its the most metabolically to demanding organ in your body and its receiving those metabolic factors its receiving its fuels by way of musculature of blood vessels and calories an pains and things of that sort movement is very crucial to get your brain to function properly movement of various kinds is very important to get your brain to function properly resistance training turns out to be as important as insurance training because of the way that it stimulates the release of particular hormones textually from bones things osteal calling which can positively impact brain function and can support the health of existing neurons as supposed to increasing the number of neurons turns out increasing the number of neurons may not actually be as beneficial as we think it all sounds great more neurons more neurons certainly more neurons is better than fewer neurons and losing turns but incorporating new neurons into existing brain circuitry is ass very challenging for the brain to do i make sure that after that work bout i get this one hour or of exercise five days per week because of the ways that it supports my general health and there are now hundreds of studies supporting the fact that both insurance work end strength to dining or hypertrophy training done commination meaning not necessarily in the same work out but done across the weak is immensely beneficial for the production of things braindrive eutrophic factor for limiting inflammatory seta kinds tell six for promoting anting inflammatory city kinds ill ten provided that exercises of the proper duration and that it is not intents that your actually creating damage to the various systems of the body now where is the threshold between optimal a subthreshold and detrimental this is that this is a complicated a theme if we do not put some structure around it tit is puttalobaa structure round it we always said that about sixty minutes sixty minutes pluserminus fifteen minutes is going to be optimal for all these health benefits what about the structure of the actual workouts well we need to address this issue of intensity a good rule of them based on the literature and i discuss this with doctor andigalpin prior to the strength and hypertrophy in the durance episodes and the literature that is published in quality were ref journals really points to the fact that approximately eighty per cent of the resistance training you do should be resistance training that does not go to what they call failure where you cannot actually move the resistance any more the other twenty per cent can be of the higher intensity to failure type training now with respect to endurance work one can build up endurance without having to log long long mileage or extensive mileage in the cooler or by running notes because there are these other forms of endurance that can build up for instance the salary beds within the muscles building up the capillary beds within the muscles will allow more oxygen utilization within the muscles and thereby will increase your endurance both of the muscles but also will improve brainmetabolism and the way that the heart functions of cardiovascular function that eighty twenty rule of less than failure and work to failure in the resistance exercise regime can be transported or translate to the endurance exercise portion by focusing on that thing that were familiar with which is the burn when were running hard or cycling hard we will experience a kind of burning of the muscles that is associated with thelactate system during the episode en durance pointed out that that burn is not lactic acid contrary to common belief it is not lactic acid it is a social with lactate metabolism in again about eighty per cent of the endurance work should not incorporate that called burn but if twenty per cent of that work or should a approximately twenty per cent of that work does include that called burning sensation that burning sensation actually triggers the activation of release of certain compounds and molecules from plea this brain cell type that supports nor on health and actually that lactate system is its own form of fuel for the brain and there is increasing interest and generating the lactate or pushing past that lactate threshold for small portion twenty per cent or of endurance work in order to support brain health and function what is all this all look as a protocol well as i mention before this three to two ratio maybe you spend a ten weeks or or twelve weeks or focussing mainly on endurance wort three work outs per week on endurance work eighty per cent of those work outs meaning in to per cent the time your below that burn threshold you are not experiencing a burning sensation but that for twenty per cent of it you are that based on the scientific data should support lactate metabolism brain health et camera as well as party of vascular health and oxygenualization all the forms of of endurance that we are aware of and then the other two work outs would involve resistance training again with this eighty twenty split where eight to per cent the work is not to failure and twenty per cent is and then may be after ten twelve weeks you switch where you start emphasizing strength and hypertrophy work for three of the work outs and endurance work for two of the workouts now of course some of you will be able to train six days a week or you will compulsively sing to train seven days a week if you decide to do that please be aware that this coatis all threshold is a real thing for me the three to to ratio works out perfectly cause i woful days off a week when i take those really depends on my schedule and how i am feeling sometimes at two days in row sometimes their interespirs throughout the week but in re viewing the scientific literature for those two episodes of the podcast and in talking to people are really informed in the world of resistance training and endurance training and how that relates to brain health and body health this seems to be the most rational in ground id protocols that is the one that i follow on any given day i finish that work block and i train i do some sort of resistance or endurance training i put those on alternate days or different days rather we have now talked about the ark that stands all the way from waking to a morning bout of focus work to physical training i have not mentioned ingesting anything or nutriance one of the most common questions i get er what should i eat for my brain well am ironically enough a one of the beatings you can do for your brain is do not eat but of course we all have to eat sooner or later and eating is wonderful i absolutely love eating i even enjoy the mere act of chewing but the question of what to eat is an important one as it relates to brain health and brain function before we talk about that i one emphasize that training fast id actually has some immediate and long turn benefits prior to having my habit stamford i was down in sanding at you see sanding and at an appointment the talk instotwu to biological studies had a calling there by the name of such in panda you wrote a wonderful book call the circadian code you runs a serious biology laboratory focussing on metabolism circadian rhythms and forth as well as the effects of fast in machine and his book the circadian code describe how engaging an physicallexercise while fasted can amplify the effects of that exercise not just forsake of increasing the percentage of things body that burned et camera but for cellar health liver health and the health of other organs were possible i do strive to do my work out with out eating anything first however some days ism very very hungry and i do invest water which contains electrolytes that means sodium magnesia potassium for the simple reason that sodium magnesium potassium are required for grants to function properly it is part of the way they generate electrical activity as well investing electrolytes for me can quell hunger this points to a whole other topic we could do another episode on at some point which is many times people think that their blood sugar is low and actually that is not the case a and frankly one would not want their blood sugar to be high you do not want your bloodsugar to lowest you also do not want it to high very low blood sugar is terrible but lowish blood sugar tends to give us a sense of mental clarity and focus relate to this adrenaline as a phenomenon that we talked about earlier in order to be able to focus on exercise or work or anything else you need sufficient electrolytes and many people find that if they simply invest some water with salt may be a ninety nine milligram potassium tablet all a sun they feel very mentally clear and able to do physical work in mental work what i do is prior to this a morning exercise although it is now late morning in this a way ism describing it and typically it does occur late morning howhave some water with either lo may be half teaspoon of peasant with ninety nine milligram potassium tablet or these days ism fond of taking o what is called element elm ant element i learn about this from less freedman's podcassinomany of your familiar with less excellent pardcassicsellent scientist a i do not have any business relationship to element they are not a sponge of the podcast but element is a product that essentially contains electrolyte sodium potassium as well as magnesium mallet which has been shown to offset things chelate on set muscle soreness that former magnesium does not make people drowsy it is not an antibiotic some of the forms a magnesium and antibiotic is just one that reduces anxiety whether not element or whether not u e just putting a titbit of salt in to as some water in investing that prior tor training that can be an excellent way to insure that you are able to complete the physical exercise a even though you have not eaten anything and i confess some days i will eat a lo bit before my work out a just because i cannot seem to resist eating i wantimention the use of stimulants before physical training this has certain benefits and certain drawbacks the benefits are sometimes it can facilitate motivation because things canine can increase the release of dopamine can increase the release of apinepron can reduce that a denizens level in the blood string some people use caffeine before training an ways that benefit them it can also increase autoxidation and and of fatmatabolism things if that is your goal i am not a particular fan of investing stimulants before training because of a whole set of problems associated with most forms of stimulants in the form of energy drinks et camera i am not a fan of energy drinks i did it a decent portion of a previous episode on food and mood on energy drinks and some of the detrimental things they contain rather i try and train simply by investing the caffeine sources i mention before are you a mate some electrolytes some water occasionally it'll have an espresso or cup of coffee before i train and on rare occasions i should exorcise rare occasions if i really need help increasing my motivation or i decide i want o push extremely hard i will in jest something alpha p c alpha g p c supports the release of a demodulator called a seat cosine three hundred telegrams of alpha g p c has been shown to increase physical performance but also connive performance some people might not be interested in investing anything to improve their physical performance or anything at all but they might be addressing how they can improve connive performance and focus and alpha g p c is a non stimulant way to approach that again defiling check with your doctor before on taking anything or stopping to take anything but alpha p c has been shown in various studies to improve connive performance and in people who have agurlay connive decline it there have been some positive benefits reported in quality pure revs journals if you want explore those references please go to examine to calm go please put in alpha g p c go to the human affect matrix and there you can find details of those studies references to pom went et camera let us talk about food timing first as i mention i eat my first meal some time around noon pluserminus an hour for the reasons we have discussed the volume of food is also important if you eat a large volume of anything because it diverts blood to your got you will feel lethargic and you will have less blood going to your brain at seems a simple and trivial fact but if you want to be able to think you cannot invest large volumes of anything into your got the discussion about what foods give you energy is kind of moot if you eat enormous volumes of that food now the volumes are going to depend on you and your needs an your activity levels am going to discuss what i do in terms of food content but i am not going toiscust food volume i a sort of know where that mostly full eighty percent full line is and i usually eat all bit past that frankly and ism able to maintain a decent degree of alertness into the afternoon and that is my goal and i think that is the goal of most people to not work out in the morning or do some work and then just collapse into a so lumber that lasts all afternoon but to be able to generate alert calm focustates throughout the day for lunch i do emphasize slightly lower carbohydrate or low carbohydrate an take for the simple reason that a adrenaline and dopamine and the associate nauromodulators are going to support alertness for me i fast up until about noon then i eat lunch that consists of some sort of proline thing a some meat or some chicken or some satin and some vegetables et camera and if have exercised previously which i do as i mention five days a week then i will ingest some starches all ingestion red or breadscuves me or rice or oatmeal and butter an nuts and things that i will consume the various food groups as they say but i will keep the total amount of carbohydrate a little bit on the low side or if i have not trained i will not have any carbohydrate at all not because ism biogenic not because in intercarbohydrate not because ism on a pure carnivore die far from it but because starches cause the release of ceretonan in the brain and lend themselves to a state of sleepiness now i should mention that about twenty five percent of individuals have genes that income for enzymes that allow them to eat large amounts of carbohydrate and not suffer from this lethargy this can sedation from carbohydrates but i do not have that gene and for me eating a non is meal that is not enormous but is decent in size but that is mainly proline healthy fats and lowish carbohydrates are no carbohydrates is what allows me to achieve heightened states of alertness throughout the day which is what i need for my purposes just knowing that meats and nuts support alertness provided pony too much of them that vegetables are healthy for us and there for should eat them and i happen to them as well and that carbohydrates ten to have a kind of seed to quality to them that should help you and a guide your food choices in an intelligent way that is grounded in the scientific literature as it relates to alertness now what about components of foods that are not about alertness but are about mood we did entire episode on mood and food and its very clear based on now dozens of studies that in getting sufficient levels of omega three phatiacis is going to support healthy mood and even can act as an anti represents more than a dozen studies have shown that in getting at least one thousand milligrams per day of the e p a form of essential phatiaid is as effective as prescription an ti depressants in relieving depression and if your somebody who requires prescription into depressing prosaic aloft et camera it can allow people to take lower doses of those medications which in many cases is a positive thing or a good thing to do because of the side that profiles that many of those trugs carry i find these data remarkably compelling and here we have a food or a substance from food that can improve our mood and our sense of well being and it does that by way of increasing certain demodulators in the brain in particular dopamine but also some other related nor modulators if you are eating fatty salmon regularly if you are eating chill regularly meaning if your a a wail if you are a investing foods that ten to have a lot of o megatheres you probably do not need to supplement with o mega three most people are not investing sufficient levels of a mega threes and ism certainly one of those people despite an effort to eat good foods and whole foods at camera and process foods i have made the choice to invest at least a thousand milligrams pray of e pe i do that in the form of fish and e p a d oh a a commination fish oil but the but the threshold of a thousand milligrams is not a thousand milligrams of fish oil it is a thousand milligrams of e p a now for those of you that do not want to consume fish oils and preferred to get your megatheres from non animal sources there are non animal sources various forms of ally at camera you can just look that up on line and you should be able to find that there also a number of foods that include these essential mega threes we did an episode on food and mood where i going to more detail than you could ever want on that as well as a some additional recommendations we also id an episode on theroid function this horror it is important for metabolism and that pointed to the importance of getting sufficient iodine which you should naturally get from the salts your investing provided your investing enough salt ism not somebody who eats a lot i help but or see what although i do not mind the taste es he weed i do not invest it regularly but investing sufficient selenium or illinium has been shown to be important for proper theroid production theroid function which is why i tend to eat a few brazil nuts each day typically with my lunch or sometimes before my work out does not really matter the point is that the volume the amount the content and indeed the ratios of proline do vat to carbohydrates are going to impact how you feel and they are going to impact your brain health and of course the timing we know that allowing periods of twelve hours or more each twenty four hour cycle where you are not investing anything is beneficial for your brain and body health that is with such am panda and his colleagues work has shown over and over again in these quality studies when people ask me you what should i eat for my brain more often than not it is really a question of how your structuring your day when your eating for the first time how long you a allowing yourself to fast each twenty for hour cycle and also whether not you are getting sufficient o megatheres whether not you are getting sufficient illinium to support things theroid function which has an impact both on the anabolism of the body but also the metabolism in the brain and when i say metabolism i do not just mean burning energy actually mean the rebuilding of things in the episode on growth hormone and thiderat hormone we talked about how metabolism means not just the break down of fats and carbohydrates but also the building up the repair of muscle tissue the repair of bone the reenforcing of bone end the repair and the build up of brain tissue and those are the things that i emphasize because they are strongly supported by the scientific data done in mice study is done in humans and basically there is a lot of big chemical evidence that supports everything that i just described along the lines of health and well being i be remiss if i did not mention hormones hormones have broad effects on the body in brain we did an entire month on hormones if you want to hereabout any of those hormones in detail we talked about teststron and optimizing testosterone estrogen et camera the sex steroid hormones which include testosterone and estrogen which your course are present in varying ratios but in both mend and women and in kids they are manufactured from collestral we hear about collestral is this terrible thing but they actually made from celestial and if you do not get sufficient levels of colestrall that can be problematic for your hormones and that can be problematic for your brain in your body health without going into too much detail it'll just point to a couple things that i do that at least from my blood work and from my subjective experience have been very beneficial for me that some of you might want to consider first of all i am not shy about my love for butter i will eat pats of butter directly i believe tat people are going to eat cheese without a cracker i will eat butter without a cracker butter is high in collestral i do not eat a ton of it but at least for me and for my lipid profiles its fine butter has celestial which is a precursor to the sectored hormones and men and women need testosterone and estrogen in order to feel good and to be able to think you do not want your estrogen too low or your testosterone too low i eat butter in order to insure that i get sufficient celestial butter also has some other things that are beneficial various small fatiacids that are that are interesting on in terms of their effects on metabolism et camera you can look those up a benefits of butter but again volume is important you cannot overdo it costello insanely loves butter as well along the lines of hormones and testosterone get a lot of questions about this i think because a lot of on line communities are sort of obsessed with testosterone and i just one to emphasize that yes having sufficient levels of testosterone is vitally important for brain function and having sufficient levels of estrogen willallow your brain to actually function it turns out that estrogen is one of the main ways in which the brain maintains longevity and maintains its ability to think we should all be seeking optimal testosterone levels for ourselves both teststron and estrogen and many of the things that we have discastup until now morning sunlight exercise fasting those can support testosterone an estrogen in meaningful and positive ways i get a lot of questions about hormonoptimization we did an entire month on this topic we did entire episode on testosterone and estrogen optimization s one of briefly high light two things that could be relevant and then if you want more details please go see that episode the first is that testaostron can exert its various functions only in its unbound form free testosterone we all make a particular binding proving called sexhormon dining globular that as senctilly binds up testostrn prevents it from be free the sounds a terrible thing but actually a good thing because it allows testosterone be transported to the various tissues including the brain where can it exert its various functions for those that have lower than desired levels of testosterone or too much sexhormon mininglobulane it turns out that four hundred milligrams pray of something called forgot all which is a form of ginseng can actually help increase levels of free testosterone many people experience a positive subjective effect and some objective affects as well meaning increases in free teststron when they do blood analysis their some day on that not a ton in the preview literature and again always approach these with a sense of of caution and defiling actor doctor if you want to learn more about that you can go to examined to calm there is there is a lot of on information their listed about that the other compound that is relevant both to men and women or i should say people that are trying to optimize testosterone end or estrogen is fidogia pidgin arrests is a avian herb that increases that levels of what called utilizing hormone utilizing hormone is a hormone that is released from the hypothalamus within the brain that travels to the gonads either the overs are the testis to stimulate the release of estrogen or testosterone and pfidogia arrests has been shown all best an a limited number of studies to increase levels of lionizing hormone and thereby levels of testosterone in estrogen an ways that a some people find beneficial just one to mention those two and again if you want a lot more information about hormonoptimization pile see the episodes on hormonoptimization a key aspect to the midday meal if you want that meal to benefit you is to take a brief walk afterwards it turns out that brief walks of five to thirty minutes after ingesting food can accelerate metabolism and actually can accelerate and improve neutron utilization just essentially the same as metabolism but none the less that something that i do after i finish my nun meal i do force myself t o stand up and go outside and take a brief walk that also gets may get into optic flow it also has another benefit which is that i am giving my brain end thereby my body more information about light and time a day which is always better than less information about light and time a day much of our circadian rhythm and our health rhythms and all of our connive rhythms et camera or supported by our cells knowing where they are in time and light is the primary zit paper the that is german for timekeeper is the primary way in which the body learns information or about what function should be turned on in what function should be turned off getting that morning light pulse within also leaving the house or apartment or work place in getting out for a few minutes after lunch is beneficial for metabolism beneficial for neutral utilization end beneficial for all the organs and tissues of the body because your getting that outside light exposure now i to shift our attention toward science supported protocols that increase the effectiveness and our performance in everything and by everything i mean sleep i mean physical performance i mean mental performance an less anxiety all the things truly all the things and that is something called non sleep deep rest non sleep deep rest or enemy are is an acronym that i coin as an umbrella term to encompass many protocols that all have been shown in one form or another to support better brain and body function ow these protocols have names that you've heard before things meditation things yoganedra and things hypnosis all of these pprotocalls and these activities however share something in common which is they involve a deliberate and directed shift in one state and the shift tends to be toward a state of deeper relaxation we certainly do not have time now to dissect out the literature on all of these there is ample literature i should say there is robust and ample literature supporting the fact that a regular meditation practice is beneficial but meditation itself has many forms transcidential meditation loving kindness meditation third meditation walking meditation yogonedra as a practice i have talked about many times before which involves simply lying down it does not alive any movement no down dogs are up dogs or anything it dis involves lying on your back and doing some specific long fecal breathing their lot of yoganeter scripts out there that are quite good but there is one amnesty are tight protocol that has been shown by the greatest number of scientific studies to promote not just states of deep relaxation noxious states of heightened focus but also to accelerate plasticity in learning within the brain and that is hypnosis and have become increasingly excited and interested in hypnosis as a tool and not just a tool of any kind but a tool that really can be directed toward particular goals and outcomes and i think that is really what sets hypnosis a part as an antiar non sleep breath protocol from things naps or things yoganedra or things meditation and i certainly believe and understand the meditation naps in yoganedric can be directed toward less anxiety et camera but hypnosis is unique in that it is very directed the essence of hypnosis is for the person you to guide your brain toward a particular outcome or change i to point out a particular resource is a completely zerocost resource which is revert doc come that is r e we e r i dot come revery dot come o see is a website where there are link to an a that is available in apple and android this is a hypnosis a but this is anxious any hypnosis aphis is a hypnosis a that contains multiple hypnosis protocols that are all back by very high quality science the science was done by my colleague and our associateure of psychiatry at stamped school of medicine that davits eagle is responsible for that work ism not associated with that scientific work they have examine what brain areas get activated during hypnosis what the outcomes are for various hypnosis protocols and within revert you will find hypnosis protocols for enhancing your hocus in hanging creativity reducing pain getting better t sleeping reducing anxiety most of these are about ten or fifteen minutes long some of them are extremely brief one minute long they have a one minute hypnosis that you can do those one minute hypnosiscripts work best if you have been doing the ten and fifteen minute ones regularly or semi regularly it is a really wonderful resource for which there is a lot of pure reviewed published data one study i to emphasize in particular is gang fatal j i a an g that is a reference you can fine on the revery dot come website under our research and the title of this paper is brain activity and functional inactivity associate with hypnosis and it as published in the journal cerebral cortex what this paper essentially shows is that specific arias of our brain that involved in executive function which is associate with our ability to hocus as well as what is called the default mode network which is sort of the way that your brain idols does your brained t idol at an it a level of high anxiety or calm as well as activation of a brain a called the insula that is i an s gala the insoles extremely interesting hypnosis has been shown to activate the insole which can enhance our sense of interception our sense of internal state which might sound a annoying thing you do not want of be thinking about your heart bead or your breathing but what is really interesting about hypnosis is that it increases tries the brain the responsible for deep relaxation hocus and self awareness this interception simultaneously and the ts very unusual compared to other states any other states of any time have made it a practise a daily practise in fact that after lunch an after this walk i do a brief ten minute hypnosis script because of what i found is that in contrast to naps and in contrast to other forms of nasty are it really allows me to enter a state of deep relaxation but also to then exit that state in a very focus and deliberate way that allows me to lean into my afternoon in an alert way in a way that i can function and do mental work and interact with people et camera there is no brain fog there is no grogginess and i want emphasize that the hypnosis that ism referring to here and that revert provides is not stage hypnosis's is not you being program to squawk a chicken or do anything against your will this is you teaching your brain how to access these focus relaxed in terroceptive states this is also an extremely valuable aspect to hypnosis because it can increase plasticity the brains ability to change in response to experience it is essentially opening up pathways that allow you to change your brain in the ways that you want and it is very directed toward particular outcomes i am an as you can probably tell i am very enthusiastic about hypnosis as an optimal and the are protocol and i do that every single day there are days that i do not manage to do it for whatever reason i forget or a interference for female or et camera but that is essentially how i enter my early afternoon i do this post lunch post walk and testy are in the form of a revery hypnosis again a completely a zero cost resource to you their excellent data all those data a can be found on the revery site and you also learn a lot more about hypnosis and what sorts of hypnosis protocols might be optimal for you few are looking for a science back o zero cost very effective tool for getting better at focusing better at sleeping better at all the things that i believe people want i do believe that is the the best tool that one can access at this point time then after i hypnosis usually give costillill scratch behind the ear and then i make sure that i hydrate hydration again is vitally important for brain function a it is vitally important for all bodily functions and i often forget to do it have just sort of linked the drinking of water a to my hypnosis practise as soon as ism done i hydrate and then i tend to focus on another work about this would be for me some time around two thirty or three o'clock in the afternoon when normally i would be quite sleepy and passing out however the protocol of shifting my morning cabin to ninety minutes two hours after waking as well as the use of this hypnosis protocol has really allowed me to move through the afternoon in a way that i do not experience that dip in energy ever since a while i felon asleep or kind of out of it but have been a really pleasantly surprised at the extent to which one can avoid that afternoon dip if you do certain things properly prior to the arrival of two or three p m now if you are a napper and you an a nap no big deal a naps can be wonderfully beneficial here are the rules are found napping according to the sleep science stamford has an excellent sleep clinic i consulted with jamesightsir a my colleague in the a standard sleep laboratory as well as a nap walker out at berley whose name i am sure most of you are familiar with wrote this wonderful book why we sleep naps should be ninety minutes or less and twenty minute naps are fine but not longer than ninety minutes and there essentially two varieties of people people for whom napping interferes with falling asleep later that night and staying asleep and people for whom the nap does not interfere you have to decide who you are and if you are somebody who can nap and not have any trouble falling sleep and staying asleep later that night well by all means nap just make it ninety minutes or last again these ninety minutes cycles are really a vital constraint that we should all obey if it is ninety one minutes do not worry you will not dissolve into a puddle of tears but if your starting to sleep for an hour or more in the afternoon that can be problematic if you are somebody who can nap for ten twenty minutes that is probably better than getting a full nine minutes cycle unless you did not get enough sleep the night before but you really have to figure out what is right for you there is a lot of variety there but that is essentially what the science says now whether r not you nap or whether not you do not nap a key protocol for sleep health and wakefulness and metabolism and hormone health is viewing light in the afternoon here is the reason for doing this as we progress into the evening hours there is a phenomenon were our get a our eyes become very sensitive to light such that if we view bright lights or even not bright lights between the hours of ten p m and four a m that is strongly disruptive very disruptive for our dopamine production it can really scrub our sleep and it is actually been shown in data from avid person's lab at brown university one the foremost circadian biology laboratories as well as seem or tars laboratory at the national institutes a mental health that viewing bright light or even not bright light between these hours of eleven p m and four a m or even ten p m an for a m can destruct learning in memory can destruct the immune system and can destruct mood in very long lasting ways there are ways to offset that however what i call your net flies in ovulation those of you that to stay up late on the tablet or computer or watching nap flicks getting a little bit of afternoon light in your eyes somewhat counter intuitively can prevent this disruption of bright light later in the evening at least some t what do i mean by that well if you view light as the sun is starting to go down if you step outside around four p m five p m again what time exactly will depend on time of year and where you are located on our planet but as the sun starts to head down you do not necessarily are to see the sunset and be lovely if you could sun sets are beautiful but if you can get outside and see the sun is it arcs down or if you cannot see the sun directly get some sunlight in your eyes in the afternoon hours o may be four p m is and do that for twenty thirty minutes may be reading outside or taking a walk i walk the dog again that is my protocol in order to get that evening light what it does is it lower the sensitivity of your retina in the late evening hours which allows you to buffer yourself against the negative effects of bright light later at night now it will not allow you to blast your eyes with bright light you still need to dim the lights in the evening but there is a very nice study that was publish in scientific reports that illustrates that if one does this if you go outside and view sunlight in the evening hours for anywhere from five to thirty minutes and i realize that people have a range of of constraints on their schedule but from five to thirty minutes what happens is that your melotonean rhythm stays appropriate now we have not talk too much about melotoneand but melatonin is a hormone that is inhibited by light it is actually prevented by light and melatonin is the hormone tat allows you to fall asleep easily now ism not talking about supplementing megaton and ism talking about melatonin that you naturally produce from your panel the protocol is very simple get outside in the afternoon or evening for ten to thirty minutes take your sun glasses off get some bright light get some natural light in your eyes if you cannot do that probably better to just stay with standard artificial lights inside do not crank them up but just start to dim them again this would be a time to avoid blue blockers people are popping on blue blockers at four o'clock in the afternoon cause your worried that blue light is going to interrupt your sleep well you're making your eyes more sensitive to any light that you might see later in the evening blue light or otherwise get that afternoon light what you will probably notice is that the optimal protocols for optimizing your brain and body health and performance and sleep et camera are actually really simple but just because their simple does not mean that they are not powerful in fact they are very powerful because they leverage the most powerful technology that exists which is your nervous system now we always think about technologies as devices and indeed therefore some wonderful devices out there some people are really into tracking their sleep and their sleep time fear into that grate that is not something that i personally do although i keep telling myself that i i should do that there are devices that can control brainwaves and things of that sort but what we are talking about to day are really basic things that we can all do that can steer our neurology and are biology in the directions that are going to support work fly that are going to sport hormones that are going to support brain function this afternoon light viewing is yet another example of leveraging a technology that you were born with and that you will die with and the you will have every day in between in order to tweak the hormones of your system in this case the hormone melatonin that its released at the appropriate times and not at the wrong times because we know that when hormones and systems of the body are well alined with the twenty four hours schedule beautiful things happen and when they are missilined terrible things happen sometimes those terrible things are subtle at first but destructing your circadian rhythms is really bad for every system in your body getting it right and as you can tell getting t right does not take much can really serve to quotinquo optimize you and i say optimize it me puts you into a better mood over all better state for learning et camera get that afternoonlight as well at some point in the evening i eat that thing that we call dinner and while it feel sort of strange to talk about my dinner the reason i want to talk about my dinner and what i eat for dinner is that for me dinner of course is about eating i will mention again i love eating but also about optimizing the transition to sleep and sleep obviously i eat foods that i enjoy i am not one of these people that will eat anything or avoid eating anything simply to a benefit a from that i do enjoy food very very much and my dinner generally is comprised of things that are going support rest and deep sleep and that means starch carbohydrates it is absolutely clear that one of the major ways that we can increase ceratonan which helps in the transition to sleep is by ingesting starch carbohydrates now i realize that starch carbohydrates our kind of a demonized term nowadays neurons anti cars but we really should distinguish between refine sugars and complex carbohydrates and we did an episode about this we talked about how refine sugars disrupt not just metabolism but they actually disrupt some of the neurons in the gut that sense fatiacids and monoacid from fats and prolines but those same neurons can actually respond to sugar and create a situation where you actually start craving more sugar because those neurons in your gut communicate via nerve pathway for your physinatos i call the vagus nerve a and allow cluster of neurons call the nodose ganglia and o d o si anodes angles or rite next to year of the corner of your jaw and contriver the activation in the release of dopamine your brain which basically makes you crave more sugar independent of how something tastes when i see carbohydrates what i really mean as a starch carbohydrates a non refine sugars and in the episode aba t food and mood and metabolism as well i reference to really spectacular lecture by doctor robot rustic whose a pediatric anger chronologist that you cseiacaf u see sand francisco absorb a spectacular talk you can find it on you too easily where he talks about the science of refine sugars and this is not in any kind of conspiracy or paranoid way this is really the medical and scientific literature my dinner is carbohydrates and some proline may be some chicken office or something that may be some eggs er sometimes just post or just rice and vegetables and that is because i enjoy those foods but also because i want to increase the amount of ceratonan in my brain that i can actually fall sleep that night many people who are on lowcarbohydrate diets struggle with falling and staying asleep and that is because it is hard to achieve heighten levels of ceratonan which are necessary to enter sleep i should also mention that melatonin and ceratonan fall in the same pathway they are related a hormone's and neuromodulators w will not go into their biosynthesis now but sickly what retaking about is a system that is bracing us towards rest in relaxation as oppose to wakefulness you might ask well cant i just take ceratonan cannot i just take five ah type or a precursor to ceretonan or tryptophan and indeed you can however many people including myself find that when they supplement with ceratonan in the evening or at night that can cause problems in the architecture or the structure of sleep can cause a lot of people including me to fall asleep very fast sleep very deeply for three or four hours and then wake up and have a terrible time falling back asleep and that effect at least for me as a can last several days its really destructive i do not to supplement with anything that is directly dopamine or a recurs are to dopamine at any time or directly ceratonan or a precursor to ceretonan rather there are other things that can enhance the transition to sleep safely which we will talk about in a few minutes but the evening meal consists largely of carbohydrates for that specific purpose of generating a sense of calm and of course carbohydrates are delicious and because i am doing physical training and presumably you are as well i hope you are cause it beneficial to one's health that is also going to replenish my lichen stores which is one of the primary fuel sources for moving one's muscles and moving round and doing exercise as well as for the brain and for cognate function low carbohydrates a throughout the twenty four hour period are not something that are attractive to me i realize tat some people will do much better on a low carbohydrate or even erogenic diet but a for me and i do believe for most people creating a situation of may be fasting and then low care or no care diets for states of alertness and focus at one portion of the day and then investing starch carbohydrates forsake of indue sing rest an relaxation is a at least scientific rationally based proposal it is grounded in real narrow chemistry it is grounded in things that we can point to and say ah this food substance this thing can support my brain not directly because it some magic substance that can make all my anurans ah extremely robust but rather it is going to support sleep which is perhaps the foundation of all mental and physical health in fact we can point to sleep as the primary way in which we can insure our over all health including our brain health let us talk about sleep and how to access sleep how to fall asleep easily and how to make sure that the sleep we have is of sufficient duration and quality one way to do that is to leverage the drop in temperature that is necessary to fall and stay asleep they mention earlier in the early parts of the day after waking our body temperature is rising and that continues throughout the day and then some time late in the afternoon our temperature peas and then it starts to drop that drop in temperature of one to three degrees is vitally important for us to be able to fall asleep easily one way that we can decrease our transition time into sleep is to accelerate that drop in temperature an one way to accelerate that drop in temperature somewhat counter intuitively is to use hot baths hot showers or if you have access to one sand now this is counter intuitive because you would say hell hot baths of its can a heat me out but actually if you are to get into a sand or hot shower hot bath and then get out your body is going to engage particular mechanisms for cooling itself off the are going to allow you to drop your temperature more quickly and fall asleep more easily this is why many people find that falling asleep after a nice hot shower bath or sand is really really easy and really terrific it sort of a natural state that follows hot bathsanas and showers how would you do this well we did an entire episode on this topic is well the use of sand for sake of growthormon release if you wan at check that out in all the details you can look at the episode on growthormon you will experience a growthormon release from sand hot bath and hot shower provided they are done for sufficient duration and sufficiently high temperature for all the details of that please go to that episode it is all laid out there it is all time stamp its all caption in english and punish et camera but basically what we are talking about is twenty minutes in the sand or if your one of those folks whose really chasing growthormon release you cut do twenty minutes then get out of the sand for ten minutes and just cool off at room temperature and they get back into the sand then get out and then shower or dry often and he to bed shorter about sand will work also the longer bouts of sand cooling sand cooling have been shown to lead to huge increases in growthormon and growthormono course is involved both in muscle growth but also growth in metabolism of all tissues fatmatabolism and repair very yous tissue it is not just about growth you hear growthhorm when you think hypertrophy but the enhancement of metabolism and health in repairing a number of tissues that is one way you can leverage heat told the transition to sleep by the ways in which exposure to heat actually cools off your body now let us talk about actually getting to sleep and let us talk about behavioral protocols first it is absolutely true that keeping the room very dark is beneficial some people and la myself have thin eyelids and it does not take much light to wake up the brain and body keeping a room very dark is essential the other thing is keeping the room cool you've probably heard this before keep the room cool get under warm blankets but rarely is it discuss why keeping the room cool is useful the reason keeping the room cool is useful for getting into and staying asleep is that throughout the night there are phases of sleep where you are paralyze called remsleep that is a healthy paralysis presume is you cannot act out your dreams but there are portions of the night where you can move and one of the more important movements that you do in the middle f the night is put your hand out or your foot out or you take your face out from under the covers as a means to cool yourself and you do this while you are asleep if you are in a cool room you can put yourself under the blankets to stay warm and then if you want to cool off you can simply remove a limb or you can toss the covers off entirely however if you are in a room that is too warm it is very hard to cool off you would need a bucket of ice water or to get up and turn on the air conditioning or something n that sort or turn on the fan it is a simple but non trivial way and which we can improve our entrance to sleep and staying asleep keep the room cool or cold and get under warm blankets and if you don't understand more about why putting a hand out or a foot out is valuable for cooling i did an episode on the roll of cooling in something called heat dumping or bringing heat into the body through the palms the face in the bottoms of the feet you eave got these portals these am radiators if you will that allow us to bring heat into the body and to dump heat i do not y go into the details now to that episode is entitled supercharge your exercise with cold is based on work that was done by crap seller's lab at stamford university absolutely in credible data showing that the proper use of palmer cooling the palms or the upper half of the face or the bots of the feet can vastly i may vastly increase the volume of of exercise that one can do and still recover from the exercise and derive benefits from it but this method of cooling for exercise s grounded in a basic physiological function of our palms the bolts of our feet and our face which is to dump heat or to allow cool to pass into the body that is why in the middle of the night as long as you are not in red sleep if you get too warm you put your foot out or you put your arms out your actually allowing cooling of the body through what are called alas a trio venous astemoseses the technical name that are in the palms the upper half of the face in the bombs of the keep and that is a very efficient way to cool off your body you do that subconscious sleep now there are things that one can take to enhance the transition to sleep i am not a fin of melatonin for enhancing the transition to sleep for couplereasons one dosages of melatonin are far too high and most supplements melatonin can have some negative effects on the sexstorid harmony testosterone an estrogen that is a serious concern third melatonins roll during purity or round purity is to suppress the onset of purity that is concerning i do not know that people should be taking this harmonist has all these other effects the other reason is that megaton will aid the transition to sleep but it will not keep you asleep in many people that take megaton and find that they fall asleep more quickstep but then they wake up unable to fall back sleep three compounds that count be very beneficial for aiding the transition to sleep and for which there are wide safety margins although pleased you check with your physician before taking anything a specific forms of magnesium something called apigenin and thiamine magnesium comes in many forms magnesium palate has been shown to improve recovery from for muscles for instance magnesium citrate is an excellent laxative for instance magnesium three inmate that t h r to and at three inmate and magnesium by alienate have transporters that allow them to cross the blood rain barrier more readily than other forms of magnesium and there within the brain they promote the release of a nor transmitter called gab which is an inhibitory her transmitter which shuts off the forebrain to some extent does not shut off completely but it essentially shuts down thinking rumination planning and an what we call executive function for many people taking three hundred to four hundred milligrams of magnesium by alienate or magnesium three inmate and there on referring to the elemental magnesium for you a fasionatos many people find that doing that thirty to sixty minutes before sleep can aid them in falling sleep can really help them fall asleep faster an stay asleep some people however achieve some a gastrointestinal discomfort from magnesium and therefore should avoid it magnesium three naan and magnesium by alienate for many people work however and when coupled with apigenin and thiamine provide a sort of synergy or a sleep costal that seems to be very effective in aiding the transition to sleep apigenin is the substance that's found in chamomile and fifty milligrams of apigenin take in thirty minutes before sleep can act as at another way to shut off the forebrain and reduce rumination reduce anxiety in allow people to fall and stay asleep i did a podcast with doctor dark a rose she is on excellent pod cast that a highly recommend you check out covers a number of different health scientific and other subjects and she is a patio nurse science orifice scientists et camera i she is a big fan of apigenan as m in and then the third compound is thiamine t h e a and i and e thiamine is a compound that and also increase gala but also increases activation of something called chloride channels chloric channels are another way in which neurons turn themselves off or turning each other off not turn each other off in n the way they typically hear that turns me off but turn them off in shut them down lower their lower their levels of activity magnesium three into by alienate apigenan and thiamine in commination can be very effective for waiting the transition o sleep and i realize that not everyone wants to take supplements i certainly am not pushing any of these i i would hope that everybody be able to fall asleep easily and stay asleep for the duration of time that they want without any supplemental help but i do think it is important to point out some things that lie somewhere between doing nothing and taking prescription drugs because many of the prescription drugs associated with sleep and you all know what those are carry other side effects they can a create bad dreams o often very disturbing dreams they can be addictive or at least habit forming they can create grogginess in the morning somewhere safer than others is a variety of them out there but for those that want to explore supplements and how they can impact sleep this commination of about three hundred four hundred milligrams of magnesium three in actor or by alienate fifty milligrams of apigenan and a hundred to two hundred milligrams of thiamine alone or in commination have been a beneficial to many people and there excellent studies to support those statements again i suggest you go to examine not common look up the human effect metrics for each of those compounds and you can explore them one of the more interesting aspects to magnesium three in ate and by alienate is that it seems to have some aura protective effects as well tare not many studies on it but the few studies that are there point to the fact that magnesium three in ate magnesium by alienate can also support neuron health and neuron longevity was just an added bones in my opinion and what if you wake up in the middle of the night this is a very common currents and therefore two general themes around waking up in the mill the night that one can use tools to counteract the first theme is if your somebody who is tired in the evenings and you can a pushing yourself to stay awake you're going to the party rare pushing yourself to study or work when in fact you would to get into bed at eight thirty or nine and then your falling a sleep round ten thirty eleven and waking up at two thirty or three in the morning you cannot fall back to sleep chances are that your melatonin pulse was initiated early in the night that a megaton impulse started probably around eight thirty or nine but your staying up your battling that melatonin and then some time around two thirty or three in the morn in that melatonin is no longer present at sufficiently high levels in your bloodstream and your waking up you are getting your morning coatis all pulse shifted into those we hours of the morning you may not this advice but one of the things that you can do to oasis that is to simply go to bed earlier by going to bed earlier you are going to get the longer duration of sleep but i realize that there are social reasons and work related reasons why going to bed at eight thirty or nine is not necessarily beneficial to your life in that case you might be one of the rare individuals for whom getting a little bit more bright light in the evening could be a good thing this would be around the hours of seven or eight p m and in that way causing that pulse in melatonin to be delayed because again light inhibits melatonin now the other thing is many people wake up in the mill the night because of anxiety or because they effuse the restaurum it is perfectly find to flip on the lights but keep the lights dim but if you flip on those lights try and flip them off as soon as possible and trying get back into bed and if you have trouble falling asleep again and you absolutely need to sleep that is where these enemy are these non sleep deep rest protocols can really be beneficial even though the on the anas the non sleep part might make you think that ah they will prevent you from falling asleep rather than trying to fight your mind trying to fight anxiety which is always a terrible thing to do i we say it is very hard to control the mind with the mind look to the body and that is what enemy a scripts do things eogonedra even the a sleep hypnosis done in the middle the night if you wake up and want to fall back to sleep often times will help you fall back to sleep immediately and if they do not they will least put your brain and body into a state of deep relaxation that more closely mimics the sleep state that you ought to be in then the awake ruminating stressing about the fact that you are not sleeping state if you wake up in the mill the night really try and get back to sleep and if you cannot do that by doing for instance long exile breathing which can work you some other tool of the body to shift the mind and the tools that ism recommending are of the non sleep deep rest variety now we have essentially travelled around the clock to speak from the time where one wakes up until the time they start working until the time they exercise ye lunch do an nasty are had to sleep get to sleep may be wake up get back to sleep et camera i want to emphasize that although people schedules very most people are doing more than one or to work bouts per day and indeed ism doing more than one or two workouts per day i really emphasize that morning ninety minute work block because i think most people would agree that there is a portion of each day an which we need to do the hardest thing or the most important thing or the thing that demands the most of our cognitive self i position that early in the day and opposition everything around that in order to ensure that it happens and that it happens with the highest degree of efficiency and yes i make sure that t happens every day and that brings about two other important points first of all we do have this thing called weak ends and a i tend to take one day off per week not both a much to the dismay of people in my life and costello but none the less there is some thing called weak and drift which is that we can be very regimented on a money or a tuesday and then even if we are good about maintaining a schedule whenceday thursday fridge et camera most of less i would hope would alter their schedule somewhat on the week ends in order to recover and get some additional rest and i not emphasize i absolutely do that i take one day per week where i go full costello where i essentially do nothing in a structured way at least if i have my way ism not making any plans ism completely free to explore what i want to do and when i want to do it that is not the way life works out oftentimes their social engagements an other things that get in the way or that i enjoy and that breaks up the day but i do take rest i do not think that one has to follow the same schedule every single day however i do think there are few things that people should do every single day if possible and those are get morning sunlight because if you do not your circadian rhythms and your health et camera and your mood are going to start to drift and to try and get sleep on a regular basis and of course some of the greatest of things in life happen after ten p m and some of those even involve sleepless nights of various kinds i certainly do not want to discourage people from having a social life or from having a robust party life if that is your thing or ah for enjoying life and because that is certainly one of the main a things that we should all be pursuing is to enjoy life the only point i want to make about sleep is that if you happen to stay up late it still best to get up at your regular wake up time it is a very simple solution to a problem that a lot of people have which is they stay up till two or three in the morning and then they tend to sleep late and then intends to destruct their rhythm try on most days and most nights to wake up at more less the same time and try to go to sleep at more or less the same time in fact i was talking to mat walker about this recently and he was also surprize to see these new data and i was surprise to see these new data that emphasize that if you get a poor nights sleep or if you up late the previous night for good reasons many people feel they just want to go to bed early the next night but it turns out that is not the best thing to do for your immediate and long turn health try and stay up to the point where you would normally stay up and then get to sleep go to bed a couple hours earlier its pinacano kill you but try to not go to bed for instance that six p m because you are up the entire night before that can really be disruptive the other thing i wan to emphasize is that even though that morning ninety minute work block is vital of course there is a second work block and in fact i described one in the afternoon after the ones years for me that is revery hypnosis there is a ninety minute work block in which i drop in again in a no internet connection no phone kind of way to complete some work that is important to me combine that is just three hours of focus work which may not seem a lock but if you were to dissect your day and cold of look at the ark and structure of your day it'd be willing to bet that if we added up the total period of time in which you were in what calnuwport would called deep work really focus dedicated work that it would probably amount to about three or four hours if you can squeeze in another nineteen ate work block or if you can get four nineteen use work blocks will then more power to you but i think most people find that one or two of these really deep focus nineteen t work blocks are about what one schedule and even mind can handle and of course throughout the day there are other things happening outside of those nineteen at work blocks ism checking my texmessages ism checking my male ism responding to various demands i working attending to life while have carved some boundaries or delineates sane boundaries around those work blocks and ism certain that if you do too you will benefit from them they are certainly not the only periods of time each day in which i or i believe other people should be trying to learn ore trying to focus and i want emphasize that even though my job is to discover knowledge and distribute knowledge because ism a scientists i realize that ninety minute work blocks of the sort that ism describing may not apply specifically to the kinds of work you do if you are an artists or a sculptor where you build furniture or whatever it is that you happen to you teach children or they teach you whatever it happens to be of course please adapt and modify what have described to day in ways that best serve you and your schedule what have tried to do is provide you a picture of the twenty four hours schedule that i follow and why i do certain things at particular times and why i do those particular things endive really tried to emphasize the scientific rater nail behind those things the pure reviewed data in some cases have pointed out the specific papers in other cases have referred to large bodies of work that support these practices when i say large bodies of work ism a big fan of looking to the scientific literature and asking where is the center of mass for a particular topic for instance where is there fifty or a hundred or a thousand papers that for instance support morning light viewing in order to optimize melatonin secretion later that in the day court is all secretion early in the day mood metabolism et camera if one wore to put into pub me light metabolism and mood you would literally get tens of thousands maybeven hundreds of thousands of studies when i say the center of mass what have really tried to do is examine the literature and figure out where there is a a sort of a directive protocol that emerges from all these various studies that used dyunow in some cases animals in many cases humans and explore different what we call dependent variables some studies were looking at effects on bloodsugar other on mood i hope that makes clear why the rational behind what i provided to day if your learning from the podcast and enjoying it please support

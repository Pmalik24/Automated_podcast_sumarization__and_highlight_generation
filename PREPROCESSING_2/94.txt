war in israel continues as more updates are flowing out an getting information on nearly a minute by minute basis at the fond a bring to you what i have as it comes in overnight bodies more than fifteen hundred terrace ad ben found inside of israel borders it was unclear at the very beginning on on fridge night sturdy to was unclear exactly showman terrace had entered israel to beginning there ware a lot of talks about few dozen it turns out that it was at least fifteen hundred terrace who ad broke in through the israel border fence surrounding the got strip and the way that they did this was sophisticated it was obviously back by on it takes tremendous sophistication do it they did israel had built this twenty foot high border fence around the got trips considered well nigh impermeable it had touch censers it had drones it had all sorts of material around it that made it very difficult to breach apparently comas came up with way to do it in in technologically sophisticated fashion they cobra attacks these drones of their own to blow up the actual censer towers they then drove bulldozers through the fence and fifteen hundred terrace at a minimum broke into the state of israel and promptly engaged in the worst massacre of news since the polices the numbers as of this moment are approaching one thousand dead news probably an access of one thousand dead news at this point this was not a military operation many real sense of the treat military is where inset's ruin natives were literally driving up to different is rally villages these are not settlements when here settlement settlements typical for t people who are in the west bank to dantimaria it is completely different scission these are people were just living in villages living in kibbutzim they re very close to the gossip border these noises drove up they literally just more down civilians kidnaped civilians brought them back to the goes trip according to the times of israel the israel defense forces that it hid finally regain control over its suddenly porisbord with the gozistrip on tuesday morning seventy to hours after common terra blew through sections of barrier and launched invasion that is all one thousand israelies slaughtered or kidnap as israel continues to grapple with the enormity of saturdays massacres and military was formally notifying hoses families that t e loved ones were being holding goa air force plans bombarded wide waves of the strip morenmore video is emerging at this point of exactly how terra broke in to the various kibbutzim and and various towns that are surrounding the got trip that known as the gosh envelope here for example is avidin of comas terra who ambush people as they were attempting to drive in to one of these one of these kibbutzim the standing outside the fence as you can see in this par titular video and ta there waiting for some one to approach this this thick iron fence thing ma attempting to crawl underneath and then you will see that they're going to ambush car as it drives up and allaligate and alias the gate to to open they then proceeded to go in to this particular area and murder as many news as they could when most horrifying discoveries yesterday is over a hundred dead bodies in one of these acubusima place called kibutzbari you can see that the car arrives door the the gape begins to open he derris come and the murder the civilians they shoot them and tam and then they break in to the a the kits this is have said is what bat terrorism looks is what evil looks they came to murder i have friends where down there at the the border of of the gosh trip right now in some of these places sterol is he not that the running rough shod through the area my m my my friends we are down at the border our sending me video one of the pieces of idiot that was sent to me for my friend shows one of the comose trucks it was a still laden with guns in ammunition in the back here is little bit of the vidiallo narrated for you you see the is a a a terror truck you see that it is still laden with guns and ammunition backs of guns said ammunition on the ground there arabia writings o those those arabia writings or pamphlets distributed by comes about the atomic rules of war talk about what you can do to women what you can do to children and and all of the rest the pictures they've now emerged from krauts sorry are absolutely horrifying as you ambition over a hundred dead people found in just that one krauts alone which makes that the second grate sight of death in israel they the first grated sight of death an israel a what a was the the massacre at this e i m electron dance music music festival he was berry in southern israel they found more than one hundred bodies there and a again the the pictures are horrifying stacks and stacks of body back body backs of children in here is a picture of of what it looks when you have to body bag a small tried because this is what this is what they do that is ay baby it is being body based an into by a a state worker in israel it is that is not the only small body back there their other children in body bags right there because this is the worst that humanity has to offer that o from as is they are the worst that humanity has to offer the situation there is bad that because parents and chilldrene' killed together and because the bodies were in many cases mutilated or obliterated beyond recognition israel has been using dean to match up babies here is a tracings to fox news explaining the answers will come the light in in becoming days n some cases there enter set up here in israel for families where they can give names an even gan eh and wen you watch the gravely praised at night you we sense of parents show me up to t it is a it is difficult yah but the parent show me up to the get hair of the kit a to the authorities s if the can match the a bodies ya just r ism that say the situation over in israel again more and more videos emerging and there will be soon i am sure fresh videos atrocities committed by comas a they are they're the navies your time in some ways they are worse than the natives which is nearly impossible to say about any human being thenasi's mechanized murder comes openly celebrates it when the when the allies were approaching near the end of world word too the patsies attempted to cover up their o atrocities in this particular case they celebrated put it on social media and candies to their children fire guns in the are while celebrating it here is am some footage of of what looks when your these at this footage that was from the electronic dance music festival that was taking place near the goober commas terra were literally standing on the road waiting for people to drive up an the they were just shooting them here is video from dash cam a a o one of those situations hes are people attempting to escape the masker this happening at the plant electronic dance festival you see home derris literally just standing out in the middle of the road and as this person slows down hes just going to start firing through the wind shield and the in continuing to fire on the car and till the car i end being put out of commission everyone inside presumably murdered more body canvidio has has emerged also and look to any terrors that is mind an enormous number of terrace everyone inside that car is obviously dead at this point in the videos crashes and this is body canvidio of comas entering cut boots t cissufim this is a them shooting a dog a dog attempts to protect the citizens and they the they kill the dog and then they proceed to walk into the rest o the cubits and murder everyone you they go through the a refrigerators obvious the make sure the they have slaked their thirst and then they set fire to the to the cubits the purpose of setting fire to the cubits is to drive all of the civilians out from their homes where the can then shoot them in the streets this is this is what comas is understand anybody who ran now is claiming moral equivalent anybody who is claiming both side t as manybodywho is closing for a sees furor part o the problem the par the problem this is who your standing for these are the people you are pretending are worthy of having a conversation with these are those people this is who they are there showing it to you they filmed these videos they put these virus hotline this footage was not put on line by forces there are anticamas it is were put on by camps this is part and parcel of what they are what they want what they do there is more dashboard camera footage a am commas murdering people here is comas they were u there people who are in a shelter underground comas figures out their people in the shelter and they promptly throw grenade directly into these shelter underground can see there's come terrorist was standing there ye he pulls the grenade pin throws it into the shelter to kill everybody inside presumably that and then when pop we run out they a they on them down we see these the worse sene since the hollicostorges these the routines since the holicosprages then we bring u the the issue of the hostages there now it is unclear humming hostages are being held at this point we know that some people whore considered to be hostages are are now dad the washington post yesterday broke video showing that many of the hostages never made at to fossa you can see this is out woman and a an middle age people or elderly people that hostage number one hostage omer to another woman these up just people who are supposedly being kidnapped is hostage number four hostage number the these are these are middle age for elderly people and then as comastripes way you can see their bodies stacked on the group i because cams has shop them before taking off for the gossistrip those were not hostages they were just murder victims there is people where massacred for the crime of breathing and being news the m pictures of hostages are now emerging the the to days can be filled with awful video because comas has threatened and presume will make good on its threats to behead hostages in return for israel retaliating against comas attempting to depose mamas from its vicious tyranny in in the gossisrip apparently schools in israel are telling parents to remove tie to and histogram as from their children phones because videos of hostages begging for their lives are soon going to be released by mamas instheir asking this is what coastal the the torture people in the murder them and then they attempt put it on the the phones of the children of israel is is what they attempt to do and it is hard to describe scum of the earth that there are no the are no words in english for t they really are not i here is a picture of one of the hostages who is being held one of the things the you'll notice here are the sand bags i here the sandbags underneath the hostage and those sandbags say the people of japan and for free distribution for palsinian refuges because a that that is the way that that aid typically works in the gossistrip mamas the hundreds million dollars the media's poured into that area that has been going for hamate pay for rockets and pay for terrorist equipments and to equip it is tears and a and now to take that rain use it whatever there using for and reuse the bags the tack par money of japan a reuse those bags for sandbags that they can use a in to em to commit acts of evil is one of the people who is awaiting his death for certain here is one israel mother describing her kidnap children entire families were kidnapped frendamic mind michaelisenburg who a tack s yo in israel has talked about the facts that that other people that the are members of his company the have had entire families cousins who were taking away families with multiple children takin to the gnosis strip presumably to be murdered or already dad here is one mother explaining o her her children wore kidnapped she her sister was cinnappes with the children she somehow escaped and here to us describing the situation ego t she thins hidden the closet a baa tear is broke in my house lone we hid in the closet an putitsuitede they blew ted the door eta butimcherfuma our neighbor was murdered they took me out of the closet yosianclab ts e to the houses living room he betesetnegie and they brought the neighbor's towheads i shall that behave mentolega en e from that moment they moved us between cecoheis hold be houses the the are all around there is destruction ruins in blood they shut ben a baitzdec an the a shall is fore and a half months e ma give been almost for it they shifted us from hose the house idiot bed cut ismecho all the time there is on fire imsofi de bet blood everywhere soft they're burning down the houses burning cars asimetie made the be then they took me yo ten and the feds outside it get the boot then let us to the sense around the boots a be den the mi there is a home offense omeiaecataza and we started moving toward gaze an we e did main cut is the me the kids in the terraces e quit quit the tams comedian kept telling me go quick quick all the while gone fire i get going cross the order e give mabdimatefami ma tan god was one one of the terrorists shoulders anthem sept screaming he wanted down i shall was on me and those of those people are all on being held captive right now meanwhile i say mamas is threatening to execute all of those civilians do not worry is to say it is distrust a cycle of violence do not you see it is just moral equivalence it us moral equivalence ill come ass to threatening to execute all of those civilian hostages even the andiron cooper of signal when struggling to speak after ins rale women made a heroin clay for her kidnap children again i these are these are mothers who are crying out because their children have been stolen from them and take into the got ta struck where they are presumably to be murdered or terrace will hide behind them and understand that if is real goes in and tries to kill comma's terrace in these children eye that is solely the fault of comas when you hide behind a child that makes you a coward it makes you a a piece of human de bra ye your the worst that they they there again i very rarely struggle for words there there are no words for these kinds atrocities and here is me other begging for her her children me a we a eaeaean a a o of to you know that is a andiron cooper being unable to respond as any normal human being wood this is what commasays this what evil is sing he as evil is old is in jerusulen corse big toss am his not just issued in you threaten carvings going hostages can you talk about that som after thirty years of attempting to negotiate with palistonian terrorist and after thirty years of making concessions to them and after fifteen years of handing over the entire gosistrip to the tender mercies of compass and giving them eight and pretending that there is a peace process and pretending to these people were anything but human tear the leadership of comas the staffing of commas the the government of commas this is the result this is the result evil must be eradicated it cannot be dealt with it cannot be negotiated with there cannot be a sense fire these people have to be driven six feet under they need to be dead taxis the only solution to true evil and ta the world is finding that out to day israel finding that out to day as well obviously the funerals were being held throughout the state of israel again a thousand dead in the state of israel this numbers that there horrible enough not a thousand dad in in one day is horrible enough in locations all over israel i i always hesitate to do proportionality in terms of numbers because again on human life is he human life but just to suggest the impacts on the state of israel of those sorts of numbers proportionality is sometimes useful a thousand news murdered in one day in israel in a country that has ben nine million jaws remember the the united states to america has about three hundred forty million people to to trying do that math what you are really talking about is approximately thirty six thousand people if they were killed in a day in the united states in multiplications around around the united states it is it is the greatest catastrophe for jaws have mentioned before since the holiness without without any sort of doubt om but compass was not finished as the as funerals we are taking place for people what ben killed virtually a huge number the people are young people israel a very young country the elderly work at nap the elderly wore killed but a huge number of these people are children or at the very least they are young people seventeen eighteen nineteen ears old many the people serving the military a israel the drought begins when you are when you are seventeeneighten yearsael on the m rockets were be it were being fired overhead as they were attempting to bury their dead this is this o the way that compass operates that is by the way is what it towns when the a when the rockets go off the sirens go off and i ever made ducts for cover i know for my friends who are where there right now the several are going off all over israelthe begging off in the north because cables will get to unjust a moment has been threatening to come into the war on israel northern word which e the worst mistake never made i the the rockets been fired into ashkalon into shot these recites that are there near the coast in israel or on the coast in israel just north of the gassaborder in fired inland tor bechemash the sirens gone off in jerusalem which is actually a significant of distance from the gossip strip i am my inlays are a in israel right now and my inlays were in whats called the mama the mamadesay is a safe room that basically has no windows the there in israel the stocking safe room on sturdy for eleven hours that that is not rarity that is very very normal under circumstances this and unless you believe that there palestonian moderates wo are ready to negotiate lest you believe that the palcinan authority is different in any market way from commander that vaccinias logic had is different any market way i here is just reminder that the the same people who did what they did witherite a commas were considered the world's peace partners for israel for decades here is the angry mitten talking with a former pialospokes person the plastic liberation organization which was laser argot's terror group that's then legitimized by the world and turned into legitimate group call the palcinian authority they refuse comment on passion in terrorism on comasterrism the of course they do because they been complicit in that terrorism for for decades at this point to react to this that from hemastow to taken to execute passages won t women n children the elderly we are taken from their hones if they're any were i avatar ante this is the this is the penis that i do not this the this is poi is power political contact this is an just car this is acthaan occupation that is on an a for fifty six years wat what a is rally's er ciao o er contact a the pass forty hours is what ascidians have been living through over the course of the past fifty six years but does that was extraordinary lag out of their hones of all ages were not talking about military people wee tween that civilians children an elderly people men and women and taking them to gas and feigning to execute them a after hate a istoinis son ma main waste camantadetisisin a you a told different place what a you want people to understand is what lie the assist she is the goitre you wat the fifty cries the of the into monsters its justifying you justifying is behaviors monstrous as it is up to you don den it of course it is up to you to condemn it the of course up to you to content it of course it is you you been working can in gloicomma for years ye the palsinian authority uses america tamper money to funterrorism in defiance of the tail of forsake which is america legislation barring pain an authority from doing that palcinan authorities still has actual rewards for terrors families they sign check to terrors families of maybe who is the editor of the jerusalem post ye he is now treating out the stories from it is southern israel get worst by the hour a woman found murdered with the feudist next to her still attached to its umbilical cord in elderly woman's an elderly woman found to pull o blood her body riddled with bulled holes entire families found burned to death in their homes the cot right now at this hour there is constant earache i in tell of eve i tell of vet of course is the is the most populous city in israel a comas has been beheading babies a this is tab the atrocities are are extraordinary kip wit is far ora which is quarter mile from the gossip boarder i is still an active scene because come of booby traps the entire area and again there reports that that compass literally beheaded babies they have found the bodies of a forty babies apparently is than they eve now found the bodies of forty babies that that is breaking news right at this moment a that they eve found the bodies of forty babies that comas beheaded and comes be headed this is tam this is its is who they are when people show you how evil they are then a ism norm not sure what exactly its supposed to be said beyond that anybody pretending that there is moral equivalence i have set it again also said said i said before said again any one pretending moral equivalence is in emissary o falsehood is a lie is a layer and anyone who pretends that israel has bending anything remotely this with regard to the called occupation is a layer as well israel does not be had babies israel is not drag what women back to its side of the border and hold them hostage after raping them and murdering them i mean that the is not this is not what they ancient no one does this no one does this except for the world's most evil people come and its supporters and a there is blood on the hands of people who have spent the last twenty thirty years defending terrorism in the called name of peas israel is now responded benjamin is nowwho the priminister of israel he says that israel is not in themiddle of an an operation israel is in fact at war which of course israel israel is it war we did not want the sword it was force upon us in the most brutal and savage way but theta's well did not start the for israel with finished once the jewfish people were stateless once he jewfish people were defenseless no longer comaswel understand and by a packing us they have made em i stake of historic proportions we will exact place hat will be remembered by them and israel other enemies for that case to compete savage a fact the comas repeated against in his i is relies an mind bogle flattering families in their homes mailing hundreds of young people and not tor staple kidnapping scores of women children and elderly even bollocks of ens homage is upon bun and executed children they are savages there is no modern compare there there is no come there is no come i and homes for its parts at has suppose are around the world as you will see because evil never sleeps thankfully neither does the justice of of god ism israel has taken measures already its first measure was to cut off the waterman electricity to the gossips trip one of the reasons for this as you do not provide actual resources to your enemies the o the other thing is that israel is attempting to move civilians out of many of these areas when you cut off the water and power that is an inducement to civilian populations to move out of these areas israel has been sending text messages to civilians in the gossestrip telling them to get out israel has been letting every one know the radio via whatever methods they can if you are civilians should get out of the area them telling hem to move toward the southern words war the raft crossing with egypt egypt for its part doing great humanitarian work has decided not to open that border and allow any of those refugees to enter into egypt just remember whenever you here about the supposed atrocities perpetrated by theisrailies understand the air world has refused for seventy plus years to take in any palistinian refugees they have instead decided to use them as political too the civilians in gaze who by the way voted for comas into thousand six to then seven and commas enjoys still significant popular support in the gossips trip by every valblepole those civilians israel is taking care not to kill them as much cares they possibly can tactic an inducing people to move away from the most populated areas of the gossip strip and toward less populous areas o the bosses try move toward the south move toward less military occupied areas and they are be encourage the civilians by comas to state precisely where they are s that if israel kills comas members they also are can be forced to kill civilians which is a war crime the entire purpose of the guinea conventions is to keep people in uniform to keep soldier soldiers terrorism is by definition in act of a atrocity that involves in the wolves civilians if you hide behind a civilian you are the person responsible for the death of that civilian and this to komastas comas literally located its military headbutts at the bottom of they hospital this is what they are they locate there their headquarters in mosques they they hide weapon cashes cashes in in churches and maquis specificallies that if israel has to blow those things up then they can claim that it some sort of human rice volition this is what they do they understand how the western press pleas this garbage they understand the western press pretends that there is some sort of moral equivalence between a comas terrorist driving in to a boots and beheading a child and israel attempting to misnames civilian casualties in the gosestrip and failing because comas is hiding behind children commands blame for both of those civilian casualties comes es actively encouraging people not to move from these areas right now you see bomstropping on gaze understand israel i mean have seen video of it i have see i literally know this far fact israel has called off strikes malta over the course last thirty years count uncounted strikes israel has called off because there are civilians in the area israel can not be held hostage by the ability of comas to use civilians as human shields ceres what look extra an israel is bombing gaze one o the things that fascinating about the videos what you will see in secondary explosions secondary explosions only emerge if there is a weapons cash underneath thivildins because israel et the building the will be an explosion and then there will be an incendiary that sets off the rest the weapons cash explosives underneath the building can see that clearly in the initials this one to israel hits the building and then as began snvidia the secondary explosions the secondary explosions our result of weapons being hidden beneath the ground which is again what done the palsinian authority commas is lunacy how this is what they do the israel defenceminister yesterday talked about a seize on gosh this of course was seized upon by the left laying to playing that this a human prized violation know this called the siege when you breathe middle of a war you do not continue to supply electricity and water to the people who have just murdered one thousand your citizens if you do your a fool heresraelof gala ties the defense minister in israel the a debit the we are inpeseia complete siege goes they'll be no electricity e fun e e field everything will be closed beast animals on weirdly that is correct that is obviously correct raping women beheading children human animals is is a press description the question now is how far this conflict is going to broaden the united states did something excellent yesterday we moved in aircraft carrier into the mediterranean off the coast of lebanon and essentially threatened that cabala should not make the wrong decision of opening up ta second front against israel in the middle of this commissar the aroneaback tarry group in the gosestrip costal is the aroniaback tarry group in the north of israel on southern border of lebanon they've turned the roads of the middle east about into an absolute trashy because this what iron was apron is a cancer and they have they've now permeated there their cancerous tentacles around he little east cobalt is a heavily armed terror group they hae at least a hundred and fifty thousand very sophisticated rock is pointed the state of israel should they get into the war israel l will be forced to unleash the full might and power of just air force america also trying to this way husband from getting intone war largely because america has a very strong intrust in this not broadening into a regional war because if israel is forced to face down lebanon in the north humble on the north syria in its in its northeast and then prism baron it self this going t clay very very quickly an israel is prepared to take all those steps if it falls under attack from those borers america is using piece through strength here as well it should according to barons the us announced the decision on the strike group which includes an aircraft carrier another worships on sundae a day after comossmilitant's launchpad on precedent an multiprong attack on israel southern flank israel hasbelat have traded on fire this weep t they have stopped short of the devastating fullscale war they fought into thousand secs again israel is stretched thin israel is not a large country and if israel is forced to it the one thing israel dos have i the air superiority israel has not used tits their superior where you being from goa is targeted strikes if if cosblaget tin those will not be targeted strikes if csbalagetsan israel lawn will unleash the a sixteens and the the southern border of lebanon will be a park glad because there not can have any other choice the when when you are militarily stretched to your limits at that point survival is the only thing the matters and you cannot be stretched to the point where you have a two front war in which it is your job too to try and separate the wheat from the chaff in themiddle of an existential crisis that that second front in lebanon i think is unlikely to open specifically because of this there is talk about casually getting more heavily involved ism there's been a few on men who've been attempting to sinful trade in the north again i think that is more as an attempt to draw resources north in israel and away from the gossip strip at i do not think that cusbela wants a full shall war if they did as they say would be the worst mistake never made that the the great ironing the situation is that for both commas and husballaw the the great in sure of their own survival is the fact that israel is technologically sophisticated that the the the only reason that compasses existed to this point is because their rockets did not work it is because random was sufficient well when they edged around that and killed the thousand is rally civilians at that point the gloves are off and israel is going to have to engage in a long protracted slog through the gossestrip attempting to avoids killing casualties as best they can and the less had better get ready for ugly images coming out of gaze all the fault of compass it is a tragedy when ant gases civilian is killed and that is the fault of compass it is the fault of compass and the the medias attempt to draw moral aquilentrishall undoubtedly be leisure of the course he next forty eight seventy two hours is disgusting is disgusting the is the difference between the man who is trying to protect his child another man put disown child in front of him in order to murder the other man's child comas is the latter and israel is the former the washington posted out con firm reports that ran was in fact behind this attack the waster vernal reported tat yesterday the bide administration in a pathetic attempt to cover its on ass for it is prior negotiations with with the cranial regime and its turn over of billions of dollars to the arrange regime try to pretend the iron was not involve clearly it was this is too technologically sophisticated and compass never would launch anything this we vat cranial permission considering their client state of the cranial government according to the washington post where son's precise all and saturday's violence remain unclear the assault reflected baron's years long ambitions surround israel both legions of paramilitary fighters armed with increasingly sophisticate a weapon systems capable of striking deep inside the jewfish state compass the gestates talstinian militants organization that lead the attack has historically maintained to grieve in dependence from maharani but in recent years comes has benefited from mass i the infusions of cranial cash as wheels technical help for manufacturing rockets an drones with advanced guidon systems some of which occurred in camps outside of gas in fact there is information merging that in fossa they bit an entire fake is daily town and they would been stage in prep for something this for quite some time current in former intelligence official save the assault bore hommarks of radian support and noted the officials in tavern have boasted publicly about the huge sums in military aid provided to comas in recent years will less thing boughten out i think unlikely to broken out further from where it is inlet unless cusballa makes a crucial is stake here ism but suffice it to say that now that this is happened no ho moss associated person anywhere on earth should feel safe seals a very long history of killing its enemies in furlong places and israel will not sleep until the leaders of commoserdad and that they should not presentment that being in canaries any sort of protection for the meanwhile the e u has reverse in announcement that it made suspending aid the palstinians originally when this cabin they came out and they said that they would reverse aid to the palstinians they would not be giving them hundreds of millings of dollars for even terrorism and the e u has been extraordinarily supportive of palistinian terrorism for a significant period of time flying in officials to pretend that there is moral equivalence to pretend that was all about israel called occupation of the gosestrip despite the fact that again the gastric has not had a jewfish foot on it since sudausan and see a since sturdy according tabes he news support of the twenty seven nation block for israel had been steadfast including that the country had every right within international lot defend itself in the war with comose now they have reversed themselves he said there will be no suspension of payments the u for policy chief person in lose brow criticized the e u in sitting the suspension of payments would have damaged you interest in the region and would have only further embolden terra yes it is it clearly giving the money is the is the way to to dissuade terrorists the e says been the biggest owner to the palistinians has been advocating for years for the two state approach that is completely dad at this point it is that because you cannot have two state solution in which one of the states once to eradicate out of existence the other state israel handed land over if any resources over again it is it is worth noting here that israel was providing free waternelectricity to the gosh strip for years on end germany is not suspending humanitarian add provides separately the international non governmental organization and the can leave it to the europeans to continue funding terror groups throughout the region meanwhile the in human rites council observed a moments of silence for the death of palistinian civilians because the in is as i had said before the most coly of international politics they are despicable and vile and they are filled with islamic an is lost countries let support the death of news to her is the human rites council which again includes such wonderful players in human rights as pakistan in the sudan and hon and there observing a women as silence not for the loss of one thousand news but for the loss of palistinians there is a needful egypt steps to in so thereelizition f theratusetetdeminition of the pelisinian people and also achieving a justest solution on the border of tune fourth nineteen sixty seven with east juruslem as the capital of the state of elastin recall an all parties exercises restraint and all the human rites obligations re request observing one minute silence for the lalsoinussen lives including women children and e deli it is also anocasionto remember victims of decide of for occupation in the occupied elastin tetra idequessual sustain for on minute to on those victims is morally equivalent sonsofbitches i mean some of the worst people on farther you and his jest garbage the bin garbage since the beginning the are even more garbage now we will get to a more of the bad guises in one second because there rallies held all around the world in favor of the in favor of comas o first but credit were creditors do the leaders of france truly italy up an yours release joint statement will to day we press him ma crown of france canceler shows of germany or mister many of italy or mister soon of the aka and present biting of the united states express our steadfast and united supports to the state of israel and our unequivocal condemnation of comas and its appalling acts of terrorism we make clear that the terrace actions of mass have no just fiction to legitimacy and must be universally condemned there is never any justification for terrorism in recent days the world is watch an horror as comes terrace master families in their home slaughter over two hundred young people en joying a music festival and kidnap t elderly women children and entire families are now being held as hostages our countries will support israel in out efforts to defend itself and its people against such a atrocities we further emphasize this not a women frenzy party hostile to israel to exploit these attacks to seek advantage all us recognize legitimate aspirations of pasting an people an support equal measures of justice and freedom for israilies and palistonins alike but make no mistake cams does not represent those aspirations and it offers nothing for the palstnian people other than more terror and bloodshed i mean obviously igruwat that i wish that a lot palstinians agreed with that considering ha the elected comas and comes continued to rule the gossestript continuously since so talent see over the coming days we remain united and to ordinate together is allies and as common friends over israel to ensure israel able to defend itself an ultimately set the conditions for a peaceful and integrated middle east region that of course is not the go of the re on rich soon the priminister of the united king do he give speech yesterday thous quite excellent here he was yesterday i wanted to come here to night to stand with you to time with you in this hour of grief as we on the victims of an ugly o born act of terror to time with you in this hour of prayer as we think of those held hostage and your friends an love long taking refuge in boy shelter a risking their lives on the fronton and perhaps above all i wanted to come here to night to stand with you in solidarity and sails our me as the primeness through of this country i am unequivocal the people the support homes a fully responsible to this appalling attack they are not militance they are not freedom fines they are terror than of course is true and moral clarity is necessary at this point in time considering how much lack there has been for decades at this point in in the city of onion there is a mass valley and favor of commander some of the foot end yesterday cmasigan has called for mas rallies all over the world in favor of their terrors atrocities you see masses of people who are who are waving palcinian compass flags very large group of people walkingthroug n beat you should remember and if you live in a major western city thatheye are people who actively favor compass live in your city i many of them many of them on which a should say something about immigration palsy generally at the kidney opera house a kidney tried to pay tributes to the state of israel by shining blue and white lights on the cine opera house instead a bonchoem pro comas terror supporters showed up by the hundreds with palsinian flags and they began chanting gas the news just in case you in case you are unaware of their actual agenda in case you thought on know these i just people we are looking for a bible to sate solution there they are shouting gas the news that is that the city opera house sir if you have let these people into your country an i would recommend that you make provisions o for your own safety e is a these tire terrscores they are flying right there some them look the flying isle flags notice that they are to shouting anything about his relies they are shouting they're shouting out the news because again antisianism is a cheap cover for hatred of news and the wish to destroy as many news as possible and kill them and meanwhile on the america domestic political front the america people's vast ignorance of these subjects is demonstrating it self in polling data there been kept ignorant something fall them kept ignorant by media that lies routinely about moral equivalence there is also an enormous political movement in the united states that is far to the left and a and supports terrorism in ways both soft and hard a new you got pole asks very simple question do you think that compass is deliberately striking is rally civilians not actively avoiding striking is rally svillianareas are a tempting to avoid striking is rally civilian areas fifty three per cent of america say that comes deliberately striking civilian areas thirteen per cent say that they're not actively avoiding striking is rally csvillianareas six per cent only say that that they're tempting to avoid striking is rallysvillianairs while this is not a question the is up for to bate they are clearly deliberately striking s is remain that that is the entire story here they literally went in to towns and murdered babies this is what they did there is to a u that should be one hundredpercent question fifty three per cent say that's for their doing thirteen percents hell lite kind of doing it s by accident moral less thirteen present six per cent said that they are actually trying not to kill is rally civilians which is amazing because they somehow landed on killing a thousand of them and that twenty eight per cent if they're not shore twenty percent butt where those statistics begin to go insane is in the age brackets and this the reflection of politics young people in america have been twisted and speed by the educational system in the media into believing absolute lies and falsehoods absolute egregious lies an i moral e falsehoods in the group eighteen to twenty nine only thirty two per cent of america said that comas was deliberately striking as rely cilianareas twenty one per cent said that they were not actively avoiding striking usually civilianareas eleven per cent said they were attempting to avoid striking scaly civilianareas thirty five per cents of the were onshore only one third of people eighteen twenty nine could say the commissar targeting civilians that is a blot on the media because the media are lies and they been lying for years drawing moral equivalence between people o are murderers and terrorist and genital maniacs and people attempting to protect their own children and to avoids villain casualties on the other side by the way when you loo to pulling numbers on the other side do you think israel is deliberately striking palistnian civilian areas twenty nine per cent a yes not actively avoiding striking palistinin civilianareas nineteen per cent say yes attempting to avoid striking palistinan civilianareas only twenty per cents ay yes israel it has a long standing policy it is called taharatanechic they put their own soldiers at risk in order do not strike civilians when you look at the age break down there and if you ta political break down this is insane the political break down suggests per cent of democrats who believe that israel is deliberately striking palistinian civilianareas they want kilcivilians is their idea thirty four per cent of democrats that's a plurality of democrats say that israel deliberately striking palistinianareas only thirteen per cent that says that israel attempting to avoid striking civilianareas the democratic party is in a state of moral collapse it has been n a state of moral collapse for a very long time he can stay cult every one to say about the republican party i have my hon criticisms that have mad very apparent over the course of my entire career their inability their stupidity their fractiousness the fact that they cannot seem to put together two in two but the fact is that the re publican party bays at least understands basic politics thirty two per cent say that israel is attempting to avoid striking palistinian civilian areas a plurality precisely the revers among democrats just amazing stuff amazing stuff there from from democrats in the b and and young people that that that is going extremely while and and of worse a lot of that is led by some of our most intellectually luminous members of congress people elfin oar do hater extraordinary she in the homascocas continued to do their best to stand for terrorists ehanomar tweeted out gods is two plus milia population are mostly children who live under blockade in what israel own former intelligence chief is called in open or prison the overwhelming majority live in poverty manysuff for life long in psychological and physical drama lemming points out of the point gaze has been entirely governed by commas since two thousand and six any time the palistinians wish to actually engage indecent governments they can they have not thy have instead decided to direct all money all resources not at building up their own society but at targeting news understand that goa has a massive stage problem the massive in fact the western aid authorities of a tempted to send in pipes the can build better sewage systems and fossa those sewage pipes were then used by mamas in order to generate rockets there re purpose and turn into rocket tubes but of course it is israel fault despite the fact a again no news living in the gossesstrip ehinomaur continues along these lines just as we honor the humanity of the hundreds of innocent frailly civilians o nine america where killed this weekend we must honor the humanity of the innocent palstinian civilian who have been killed and whose lives are up ended i feel horrible for those people as well which israel does which is why israel trying notskilles people an compass is perfectly happy to station all of its rockets right behind department buildings palstinian residence of let bank have scarcely better lives than eosins with the routine destruction of their ancestral homes destruction the crops and violence talk by meatball propagandist nonsense it really is routine destruction of their ancestral homes the palsinian population in the called wetback has risen by millions by millions i should point out at this point that when she says that there's no better living standard and judo an maria the west bank of israel which again is largely governed the palsonian authority genitals governed by the palstinian authority he born is govern by the palstinian authority i these these areas ore governed by palstinians if you have failed to grow your on economy that would be that that is your fault you have the ability to actually elect people and put people an power or not going to steel all of the money laser about by the end of his lives worth hundreds of millions of dollars macho basworth hundreds of millions of dollars to this point but i still even in spite of that i should point out that in the gasastrip the get proper capita is eighthundred seven six dollars in the west bank for palstnians living in the called wlessbankhud antimaria almost two thousand dollars and is rally grabs is rally grabs the go p procapida among is rally grabs the g peeper capital israel is almost sixty days dollars for is rally arbs it is a multiple yet there is a reason why israel grabs are not clamoring to get in to palstnian governed areas every single pole of his rally grabs twenty per cent the population o israel are arab and muscle every single pollshows they do not israel and also nobody wants to leave government makes a rather larger which is a liar and she propagandastelhin alarm and she is a protester stay and this is what she does meanwhile our colleges in universities continued to turn out the worst colombia lawscull put out there usual pathetic statements it put out a a statements that basically was a bunch of mushmouth according to the washington for beacon a the dean of colombia local sultan lest release o statement on money whitewashing the worst terrace attack in is rally history lament quit be violence that erupted in israel and gosh up just erupted did it volcano is erupted was not heros who broke the offense in the murder babies and catnapped women n in raped them and then murdered them and thevidio that i showed yesterday of the israel woman or the chisecia german woman who is at a man's festival was raped murdered than paraded through the streets of fossa that him that was just in eruption of violent just happen the violence that erupted in israel and pasta's pass to week an is nothing short of tragic said lesser i know many in our community have ben effected but directly an infect indirectly there's no mention of antisemitism or news i by the way the antisemitism that that the dean of the columbialossial cares about is that at one point a fhlostico is found in abathram and this should tell you what you need to know about far left views of antisemitism in the united states if significantly more deeply worried in some areas of the far last in the united states or even in the traditional left of reunited states about asuastoka on a bathroom door that they are worried about the murder of one thousand news in israel because they have somehow created the psychological distance to believe that if a jaw gets lurdan israel not because there dues because there is daily and thus it does not matter ell that that is going to come all to a crashing halt right now and it should come to a crashing all the a lot of eyes that are being open they have never actually wanted to see evil in now are being forced to see evil because this is evil in our time jonathan greebladhave had not a lot of hind words for jonathan green bad on the show he is the head of the anti defamation league as maybe we can half ago i did an en actual twitter space with plan musk very critical of the antidefamation leak i think that is at jonathan has done a lot of very progressive work whet he use excellent on prison b s yesterday morning when he was confronted with the propagandism and lies of the america last attempting to recapitulate this conflict to some sort of moral equivalent between two quarrelling sides as supposed to the greatest mass terror attack i in in modern just history l i am sad and cope trying to cope it'll belongs i am angry i am angry with the world that aloud the dehumanization of israilies and sanitizes the terrorism of comose i must say i love this show and i love this network but eve got to ask who is rioting the scrips mamas the people who did this they are not fighters shonathan they are not militants non looking right at the camera they are terrorist it is a barbarian who rapes and brutalizes women who tar kills children in front of their parents look when we say all this was an escalation it was found to happen i am sorry this was a massacre that was preplanned this was not destined to happen it is not normal to shoot tea turn in the back hundreds of them i just think goes get the story right in all these pictures of missiles or the roll in gas please talk to the israel mothers and fathers who lost their children an good for jonathan green black but yet at sins tot a mean beseem from doing its worst again you wonder why the america people are very very ignorant about the sort of sup particular young people in people on left the answer is because they are people in the media o want them to be ignorant here for example was mason be c suggesting that actually the best way to get hostages back would be for israel to take news out of the out of their homes injured antimaria use i worked amazing and goa there were amazing an got there's they re moved some six thousand news from their homes in the godstript turned over commons and fifteen years later this is what you have and the solution on must and be see of course you should live in fewer places the i mean if yous do not in to be killed obviously thy should live in fewer places in fact if you ware not just go directly to it maybe you should be alive that is this a really easy way prevent them from being killed but certainly we should remove them from their homes in references to terrorist who behead babies and kidnap women to rape them probably that great solution prison beset just all the wisest people if you are thinking that far hadnithin that smart and getting to a palistoday and stay bhecommons more difficult ah because of all the i early hoist than the asked that support i thin an instar i thanking t a they a national commit a condemns them how do you do that does this make my i railrethink that or do they just double down well i was hoping is real were thinking that a the the common oar minister at ya i which best substantially to the right of him include people who ware very much for new a the real a thesis daily or and for landing sent lets into variety an art o the we forbad it it possible for there to be a continuous palisade instate ah and rolling that bath belle s ism sorry continuous mucins territorially connected there will never be a continuous palistinian state because the goa strip is on the left corner of israel and the sudan maria are is over here of you want a contiguous palistonian stay they reading non contiguous israel obviously these couple are foolsthey do not know anything tho not care about anything for them the easiest thing it is the you do not moral cowards do moral coward always take the it aline it is the easiest thing to do the easiest thing to do in any situation just take the moron all i just wish everybody loved each other all i just wish they are a piece ah if only these people would just come together and get around their conflicts and that avoids you that that allows you to avoid the implications evil until it is smash you directly in the face and even then it turns out that there is a comfort in blindness tere'san absolute comfort and blindness it is much easier on a moral of si do not know anything about this i take no sides i do not know the i do not take any side ism not important well and e went when you see babies being beheaded you cannot take sides if you cannot take sides you're a quizzing if you cannot take sides you are part of the problem it is evil not you take sides when one side is murdering babies and the other side is attempting to defend them that it is not the same thing the notion that the real tragedy heres the death of the piece precessed its a damned pathetic and dark joke it really is the pecepros has been decades since the paliconian authority decided to turn down every available offer from nineteen ninety four onward to actually establish a palistonian state and decided instead at they would set up full funding mechanisms for terrorism there are streets named after terrorists actual people just murdered people are restaurants in the west bank the goa strip is a terror haven obviously but again the easiest thing if your inkstand beseersananal well there is more lea it is all new ones there is many shades of gray many shades of gray here to see when people bad babies next to their mothers that is clearly here is emisand be sees allevelsy engaging in some complexity what is that you are watching for in the next twenty four twentyeight hours i i i have to say a been rick have have sad it very clearly you have got a look around quarters on this one there emotions are rutting high their lot of people who are pretty sure that they know the right thing to do in the moment and a lot of that feels punishment and retribution there are mass of consequences to getting this one wrong oh well ye gives look round cornus be wise elegant do not you see there math be consequences to you non killing all the cherish on beheaded babies that is the that we be have to be very cut really to really got pinpoints on this one alebelshi all the wise men say all the wise men say that is on the moral cowardice the moral cowardice is how the west eyes by the way through moral cowardice because those consequences will come home moral cowardice at home leases to surrender on every front this not just to manner of what happens in a place israel israel has always been a canary in the comics that yous are always carrying the coalmine in the sort of stuff but i e society that loses its moral compass to the extent that there is new ones and complexity to people for beheading babies that is not a society that is destined to live that is not in as as aseity that can that can withstand any sort of pressure at all a collapses inward at the first sign of conflict i speaking of what your see an an amassed s he heres a moral equivalent uppercut from these jokers publications day after day time after time am these wise non stop and it seems a then nation a government is not waiting to a to to bring any piece to the region it is conflicting for me because on how people's there an incident silence of be involved in but at the same time it is the side we know what other twit of they have do you condemn what mama what as they have t inside an israel to is really civilians fa dead and there are hostages us en the most i sister beta most they anon tan this some work that has got the us t when we are tote that just what is the loss of of on livings project in all since you have conte seventies i that that is more than to under of ton an the for the one one thousand six hundred and t an dhotis tench on compounds of being wot out thesis crime committed by is land what ten more tragic what equally tragic is the blindness and the distress of the world very sinful putitican savings booked if we see have cousin nail i kingdom be loss is look do not understood mat peoples the a for how the sophistication on the new on do not you see the change is range o h cons ere protesting the i called judicial reforms would be protesting israel in humane treatment of the paw listinians who live under is really occupation but that is just not something that is happening o yet youould expect says alygelsi that a that these rallies or protesting traditional formation be out protesting in favor of common that is that is what you expect if your complex like libels i you wonder why a again the media a disgusting they are truly discussing the someday discussing members the media not all of them obviously some of them seek truth some of them occasionally stumble upon the the not seeking it and then you have the motivated actors or more interested in this own judo sophistication and a moral equivalence than anything else for the part of the united states far john curly the antsy spokes person ism again there there is a wilful blindness that as taken place because people the inner she of foreign policy is very very strong a john hurry fully advent that commas i has killed america that america are currently being held hostage were also very very closely aaccordinating with is really officials about the safest of america citizens was sadly know that a few have been kill a we also know that there are many more that on accounted for we do not know where they are we do not o condition and and nothing's more sports us in their sakegans security we get ta they lashed up with his really officials on that is well that som that is a america are n harm's way only the bid administration lasting america were in harms waythey just left them in afghanistan john cry says by the way goby n still believes in the two state solution which clearly is the solution here you need it u need c compass was the governing power it is not even a terror group in the traditional sense that had no governing power it has governing power was below in lebanon has governing power passing authors t derris could has governing power is touchy hot has governing power the part of a coalition government in the wetback but says the emit an but says this america a two state solutions is clearly clearly that is the answer give them terror in control as the we t amazing in gaze is the the two states solution off the table now suddenly tilt about progeterations as it is is is quite ut all the president still believes ain the promise of he two states solution ain peace an justice a for these rally people as well as for the palistinian people and the president knows that famous does not speak for the palistinian people he does not the do not speak for all the palimony people on all their aspirations in the united states there will continue to be a support for a viable two state solution which the president still believes is possible have contioname to just leadership give a quessononot on all sides here to stop of thievery second have a question who does because they say that fine what is assume for example that common is actually a dictatorship what is a some that the man the were elected it two thousand sixty thousand seven what is a soon the inditatorship who is the who exactly what is renegotiate with who is the other party at the table the pain an authority by the way has not had that they have not held an election since what two thousand n two thousand eight thousand nine when was manhood about last elected machmooabass was last elected as the leader o the pausing an authority which is the governing party in a gudantomary in two thousand five two thousand s is he is now cur can his currently serving the eighteenth year before your term but who exactly is ersposto negotiate with this italic that the blinders on these people the unbelievable blinders on these people it is just absolutely insane far the bye administration's provided the sports israel that is necessary but here is how the worm turns israel on to have to do what it have to do never protected citizenry it is non in tike a women tactic a few days in tie weeks is re on to have to go in the probably gan have to anna the gossips trip meeting take full military control of the possess trip because they tried at the other way and did not got amazing the rolegan have set up to militrizezon that broadens the amounts of space between the is daily areas and the placing in t arab areas in the gossisstrip that is probably what is can to happen here long term because there are no other answers and no one has provided any other answers because there is no other negotiating party israel by the way has tried to hand control of the gossesstrip over to egypt not egypt said ah not interested israel has tried to handle her control of paulistinian arab areas injured aansomaria to join you know jordan said hello jordan at hello strongly they murdered twenty thousand paulistinians way back in the seventies during black september an then expelled the rest into the lebanon men it is for people who do not know the the history of the region the notion that that israel has primary response behold for a group of people have been rejected by egypt jordan and lebanon among others is a is pretty amazing but din the end israel gan o have o do it have to do do defends own citizens because israel is a sovereign country stink america a southern country and we here in america have to defend our own citizens america never stand for anything this imagine that the people whore crossing the southern border right now we are all armed to the teeth and were going to cannon village is killing thirty thousand america do you think that the border with mexico would currently be controlled by a by no one or do mouthing the america military would be in there you think the a mean government would even be would oven be functional how do you think that would go we in any case israel on to have to d what it have to do and watch as the media who are already moral cowards turn their fire on the people who just watch their babies be headed i by terror groups because that is that is what will happen and you need remember these images the ones that commossitself as putting at there be mortgages over the coming days and the moral equivalency ladies will begin their work ouphe remember again sometimes it is just a matter of good and sometimes it is just a matter of evil con not finish with them one good story of the day this one has gone ball it is say it is pretty amazing story i there is a m a couple from the southern town of o hakim an that is a town that is he located a few a few kilometers inland from from the gossips strip it was really hard i have a a friend who lives here his brother lives over there and who's waiting for the entire today holiday to find out whether his brother as of dozens people slaughtered in faking but there is one oman whose name is ravel rather in english and a she is she spoke to the media about what happened to her when these terrorist entered offakim the couple both of their sons are police officers and they were taking captive in their own home and t a apparently rather said to her husband she said if we die will die together the terra told the couple that they weregoingto become matters they threaten to kill them and i then security eventually arrived the idea arrived in and killed every butt the story here is is is rather amazing apparently the cops they arrived and they were then in negotiations with the terrors supposedly security forces realized their being shot out from the building the first plan of asthma to throw grenade into the house kill the terra but as they were doing that there being told that they were actual news who are still in the house they open negotiations the terra were demanding food and water oral said quit i could seethe were angry i asked them if they were hungry i prepared them coffee and cookies avid her husbands said she drove them crazy she kept asking if they want something i as ravel worked to distract the captors the terra began to sing songs by these really singer your barques apparently again is really cultures even taken you by a terrace outside the building their police offer son e qatar described the lay out of the home to count her terrorism forces in preparation for reaching and rescue the officers got right up to the entrance of the home during the negotiations one o the terrace use to tables to make shift barricade holding a can grenade over race head having removed the pin another sad the top the stairs aiming a gun at the police apparently during the negotiations the police signaled to ravel not to given and finest event give any indication that a that she was related to any the peoplewere outside but apparently she a she was asked by the police outside they could see her they asked her how many terrace were in there and she held up her hand to her far in a usual movement with her fingers spread to say that they were five and she told the terrace the chid to rub her head the whole time apparently she just offering them food she is offering them cookies and she's offering them coffee and the basic idea she said i was given the e coffee and and cookies because hungry people are angry people and they we apparently easily all sitting in the room i eating their cookies when the police broke in and killed everyone and killed all the bags apparently according to harsh had we are very close to the terrace we were save her husbands had i jumped on to my wife shots came over us right by my head i do not know his survived when rescuers entered the home an explosivevice was set off at instead one of them the rest of the force kept going and freed all of the apparent hostages on the pictures from the home are filled the bullet holes and a and pockmarks an all the rash again an amazing story out of a out of ofokim well as as i said yesterday thoughts prayers resources should be directed toward the state of israel and toward the news who are going into harms way the members of the army who are going into harm's way many of whom require resources refer to the description into days show on you tube for directions to links if you wish to give charity or if you wish to help out the the dead here w ill be avenged they will be avenged they must be avenged there is a phrase in here that we use to describe the m what we hope happens to those who spill blood this way sea shemyu mom woman which means a may god avenge their blood and as rabbi mayor sol offtrack points out draws on a bunch of different biblical verse is paralleling a thirteenth century rare known as afharachemim which commemorates people a whore killed in serums at that time the the god of israel does not sleep he is not slumber the revenge will be taken for the dead a the an anybody who who cannot see moral clarity at this point in time i do not believe you i actually do not believe you i think the they are ulterior motives to play whether it is your own suit of sophistication or whether you have baser and darker ulterior motives if you again if you cannot draw the distinction people beheading babies and people tempting to protect babies i do not know i do not now what to tell you but this conflict is not going to go away not not to day not to morrow not for a while and be strong and of good cheer because a the west is going to win an israel reghtnown as the emissary of the west against these a pieces of human debris

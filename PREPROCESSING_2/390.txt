welcome to the hubermanlaponpence a scents science space to s for i may druhubermen and am a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day we are discussing supplements we more specifically a rational guide to supplementation now to be forthright i want to tell you that i am not a fan of the word supplements because it stems from this idea that all supplements are somehow food supplements or designed to compensate for what one could otherwise get from food and that simply not the case many supplements are compounds that are extremely efficacious for instance for enhancing sleep or for enhancing hormone function or for enhancing focus and many of those compounds are simply not found in food or are not found in enough abundance in food to have the desired effect now that raises the issue as to whether or not these compounds are good to take safe to take and whether or not they are actually beneficial for us and the short answer is that everything else supplements can either be good for us or dangerous for us depending on dosage forcing et camera but more importantly we need to think about supplements and a rational guide to supplementation as taking into account a number of different factors and we need to set aside the idea that all non prescription compounds that fall under this umbrella term supplements are simply things that could be extracted from food but most people do not either in just enough for those foods or pay a nut f attention to their diet in order to obtain them in fact during to days episode i am going to give you a number of different very specific questions that you can answer in order to decide whether not you should be taking any called supplements or not and whether or not you should be taking one type of supplement or another type of supplement more or less than the other am also going to discuss safety of course and i will discuss cost because obviously monetary cost is a serious consideration for most if not everybody considering the use of supplements during to days episode i will also discuss which specific supplements are opplemal for achieving specific end points such as improve sleep such as improved focus and such as improved hormone function among other things i plan to cover the full range of what are referred to is supplements including called foundational supplements that are design to act as a sort of insurance policy against any deficiencies that might exist within your diet all the way up to very targeted outcome supplementing compounds that is compounds that are non prescription that are designed to achieve very specific and points such as enhanced focus over the next for to six hours of physical work or mental work on and forth and to cover everything in between that as well and i promise to cover how supplements interact with other things such as behavioral tools prescription drugs when supplements might be a good alternative to prescription drugs when they might not be a good alternative to prescription drugs when supplements can serve as an augment to already excellent nutrition and prescript ion protocols and every feature of supplements as it relates to mental health physical health and performance by the end of to day's episode you should be armed with a number of different questions as they mention before that will allow you to develop the most biologically effective and cost effective supplement regiment for you and of course i want going knowledge that for some people the total amount or dosages of a given supplement or supplements that you might need to take could be zero there are such individuals but that many people caninfact arrive tremendous benefit from supplements in a way that can be more cost effective than trying to obtain the same non prescription nutrients from food as behead into today's conversation i want to emphasize something very important not just as it relates to supplements but as it relates to all aspects of mental health physical health and performance and that is i take the stands that behavioral tools that is specific actions that we take and specific actions that we avoid form the foundation of mental health physical health and performance things viewing morning sunlight and exercise are behavioral tools they do not require the ingestion of anything within the realm of behavioral tools there are also some dots or do not that can greatly enchants our mental health physical health and performance such as avoiding bright light exposure to your eyes between the hours of ten p m and form or avoiding caffeine too late in the afternoon because even if you can fall a sleep after investing canine an the late afternoon we know it disrupts the architecture of your sleep in ways that greatly diminish your mental health physical health and pe romance the following day form instance behavioral tools form the foundational layer of all tools for mental health physical health and performance second to that i would say the next layer is in fact nutrition no amount of supplementation or non prescription compounds or prescription compounds for that matter canceler compensate for poor nutrition at least not for very long i this is a key point even though many supplements are not simply food supplements because they are not designed to compensate for anything that you could otherwise get from food that is not to say that you can live on supplements and i suppose you could live on was propene and fish oil a capsule and vitamin cap souls or tablets for a short while but before long you either on suffer from border a to the axenthy do ant to go back to food or some other deficiency would show up i think it is the rare individual that trees o survive entirely on food supplements and things of that sort most everybody and i would hope everybody is paying attention to their nutrition i would place behavioral tools us and do knots as layer one the deepest layer the bed rock of all mental health physical health an performance on top of that i would place nutrition and of course that is going to mean different things to different people with the understanding that there is a huge array of different food choices and nutritional programs nutrition is fundamentally important for micronutrient for storage of energy in the form of gliadin fats and phosorcretin stores and forth but also for obtaining basic neutrino sidemen minerals and micro entrance ices we have got behavioral tools nutritional tools then on top of that i would place what is typically called supplementation although to day ism trying to expand that word to include notorious things at compensate for food deficiencies or that are layered on top of food as a way to enhance the mount of nutria's that you could get from food but as i mention before compounds that are non prescription that can be for a variety of different purposes and many of which are not available food i you place supplementation write on top of nutrition then pass that i would a prescription drugs obviously prescribed from a board certified my can serve of very vital purpose in the treatment or augmentation of mental health physical health and performance cold some people do in fact need prescription anatto presence other people do not some people do in fact need prescription drugs for attention dephisat hyperactivity disorder or sleep relate disorders on and forth the whole is of weather not there is in over prescription epidemic or not om is a separate conversation for a separate podcast i would argue that many prescription drugs do in fact save lives this includes the category prescription drugs related to stations and cardiovascular health related to any number of different things even sleep disorders and insomnia archalepsy and forth that said there are many instances in which people can either reduce their dosages of prescription compounds or can replace those prescription compounds with quality behavioral tools nutrition and supplementation but there are many instances in which prescription drugs are the only route by which people can achieve the mental health physical health and performance cols that they wish to achieve i would place that as the fourth layer in the stack of layers directed towards mental health physical health and performance just to list off again i fundamentally believe that behaviors dues and do not form the foundation of mental health physical health performance next in line would be nutrition that is the specific foods we eat the amount that we eat the comminations of foods that we eat in a given sitting and the timing in which we eat our food then on top of that i would place supplementation the topic of to day's episode and finally prescription drugs s in of course all of these things interact in important in and interesting ways many of which interactions we will discuss during to day's podcast as we drill into the topic of supplementation developing a rational supplementation protocol and one that is most biologically and count effective before moving further into to day's episode i want to emphasize at very i portent point which is that i am not a physician that is ism not a cognition i do not prescribe anything nor am i going to do that today ism a professor i review the research literature i describe tools gleaned from the resent literature and developed from the research literature i profess many things but i do not prescribe anything in i think its vitally important that any time you are thinking of adding or subtracting any behavioral protocols nutritional protocols supplementation base protocols and certainly prescription drug base protocols for whatever purpose that you consult a trusted word certified physician that is absolutely essential i do not say that merely to protect me i mainly say that to protect you the most important aspect of to day's episode is not going to be that you discover one particular supplements or category of supplements or blend of supplements that is going to transform your mental health physical health and performance no the purpose of to day's episode is for you to understand where you have needs that can be met by supplementation better than any other approach and most importantly how to think about supplementation that is how to think about the different categories of supplements that are out there and how those interact with your nutrition and your behaviors that you can maximize your immediate and long term health what i mean by this is that we have this word supplements or supplementation but that means many many different things it means vitamins it means minerals it means adapters most people probably only manor what an adaptation really is and in fact many people talking about adaptagens never actually define what an adaptation is or ts design for or the fact that many adaptagens are also used for other purposes to day's discussion is really about you learning how to think about supplementation the same way you would learn to think about nutrition or exercise or anything related to brain and body health for that matter in a way that lets you navigate this vast space that we call supplementation and develop protocols that are optimal for you and indeed it may be the case that the ideal dosage of a given supplement for you is zero milligrams for instance if i ask you are you sleeping deeply and enough each night do you feel rested throughout the day may be need a short nap and that is it or may bayou do not and you say yes i feel great i sleep great i wake up feeling great i only need a short nap or no nap during the day to feel rested throughout the day well then there is really no discussion about sleep supplementation to be had between you and me however if you are not sleeping well then a big discussion opens up as to what the reasons are as it relate to nutrition or when your exercising our investing caffeine in other words no discussion about supplementation can be had in vacuum rather discussions about supplementation need to be considered in a larger contact today you can a learn how to place the discussion and thin king about supplementation in a larger context anything about how specific supplement that is specific ingredients and commendations of ingredients can indeed be used to buffer and support your over all health end lead you to specific health and performance outcomes before we begin i t emphasis that this podcast is separate for my teaching in research roll at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is element elements is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar now salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the sells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called neurons in fact in order for your neurons to function properly all three electrolytes need to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to deposits in cognitive and physical performances element contains a science back electrolyte ratio of one thousand milligrams that one gram of sodium two under milligrams of potassium and sixty milligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if have been sweating lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element doc come slash supermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that drink element el event doctor slash supermen let us talk about supplements and supplementation and how to develop a rational supplementation regimen one of the things that is really emerged over the last twenty years is that supplements and there ism referring to non prescription compounds design to augment nutrition prescription drugs and behavioral protocols have emerged as a main stay within the health and wellness but also the medical communities that are focussed on developing mental health physical health and performance for their patients and their athletes and for the everyday person especially what ism saying is that twenty years ago a discussion about supplements would mainly take place within the niche communities of health food stores or of particular athletes but nowadays i think almost everyone is familiar with the fact that yes indeed there are standard sidemen supplements but that there are also supplements such as vitemend three which are designed to make sure that people have a certain amounts of hormones in their blood stream because they might not be getting enough sunshine although it'll be very clear over and over throughout this episode that there is no pill replacement for sunshine nor is there a pill replacement or food replacement for that matter for exercise or for social connection or for sleep or for simply getting smarter again there is no pill that is going to replace excellent behavioral protocols in fact a physician friend of mine has a great saying that i think everybody should keep in mind as we wade into this conversation which is that better living through chemistry still requires better living i think that is a very important phrase to keep in mine when thinking about the optimal supplementation or prescription drug protocol for you what is an ideal supplementation protocol well i think what we need to do is to take a step back and ask what are different supplements designed to do for instance there are foundational supplements these are supplements that are designed to establish a foundation or provide insurance along with your nutritional intake to insure that your getting all the things that you need in order to have a basic level of mental health physical health and opportunity for optimal performance now this is the one category of supplements for which i think it is appropriate and in fact advantageous to have multiple ingredients in a given supplement throughout the rest of to day's discussion i am going to talk about the advantage of mainly focusing on taking single ingredient formulations for a variety of reasons but when it comes to foundational supplements what were mainly talking about are supplements that contain vitamins and minerals that are designed to compensate for any deficiencies you might have from diet or from lack of adequate diet how would such a lack of vitamin and mineral and take arise well for instance if your somebody that practises intermittent fasting or other components of fasting or four somebody who does not get enough fitments and minerals from vegetables and fruits and grains and meats well then taking a supplement that can act as a insurance policy against any vitamin mineral deficiencies in many ways can be advantageous although i will talk about some of the a safety concerns in just a few minutes now i want to acknowledge that as soon as we talk about vitenmen mineral supplements the skeptics immediately raise their hands and say all that vitamin and mineral supplements do is give you very expensive urine and there the skeptics are referring to the fact the reality that when you invest high levels of water soluble vehement o think vitamin sea and some of the other vitamins that indeed you will excrete them in your urine however it is also the case that many people are not getting enough of the water soluble fitments from their foods and it is also the case that many people are and it is also the case that investing higher than needed amounts of most water soluble not elements provided those levels are not exceedingly high is or at least we should say can be safe and again this is provided that the levels that their investing are not exceedingly high the typical vitemand mineral supplement is indeed going to cover any gaps are deficiencies that might arise in the water soluble vitamins from your food and take but the reality is that most people are getting enough of the water soluble fitments from their food if they are paying attention to a couple of things and those things are very simple to lay out regardless of whether or not are a vegan of vegetarian a more traditional omnivore eating from both animal based and plant base sources grains et camera or even if you are in the pure carnivore or strict i guess it is call the liondietwords just meat and salt regardless of what typo nutrition you follow you will get fitments an minerals but you will get more or fewer of them depending on the nutritional program you follow and of course depending on how often and how much you eat that is a sort of obvious most people who take a vitamin mineral supplement will indeed excrete a lot of the water soluble vitamins they will retain the fat soluble fitments and there again the skeptics will raise their hands and say you do not want to take high levels of fat soluble fitments because they will be stored in your system potentially to levels that are dangerous again provided that vitamin mineral supplements are not taking in excess it is unlikely that you're going to have such a build up of the fat soluble fitments in your system that they are going to be a problem that raises a very specific question that you need task do you want to take a vitamin mineral supplement well the answer to that will be highly individual but you really just need to address two things first of all is the cost within the range that you can afford and want to pay oftentimes these viteminmineral supplements can be quite inexpensive but some of them can be quite expensive and you can see the full range of ones that are pennies per day all the way up to many dollars are tens of dollars per day because of what are reported to be variations in quality an sourcing and forth ism not aware of any real differences between the quality of the water soluble and fat soluble vitamins found in the less expensivverses the more expensive vitamin mineral supplements more typically the cost scales with the dosages of these different fitments in minerals and as would probably be expected the more expensive to obtain and source elements and minerals tend to be in lower quantities in the less expensive versions of vitamin mineral supplements that this kind of obvious you need to ask yourself can you afford it financially and then you need to ask yourself are you able to regularly invest enough foods with enough variety to cover your vitamin mineral needs just from food and for some people the answer is going to be an immediate yes they are careful to get enough of the foods that allow them to obtain their vitamin an mineral quota and for other individuals the answer will be no i would say for people that are extremely physically and or mentally active and for people that perhaps are fallowing a intermittent fasting schedule they are not investing a lot of food in general or restricting their food intake to specific times of day will then a viteminmineral supplement likely make sense for them however it is going o be very important to invest that vitamin mineral supplement with food and ideally early in the day that can set up a obit of a challenge for the intermittent faster who are restriction their feeding window to late in the day why do i say this will many of the water soluble fitments in particular the bee vitamins need to be invested with food because otherwise they can cause some stomach upset and again there is arrange the are some people myself can take be fitments on an empty stomach an feel fine other people feel really lousy when they take be vitamins there re few other things that will talk about later ism namely zinc and coins i cute that really should also be taken with food but the best time to take a item in mineral supplement is with food and i believe that if you are going to take a vitamin mineral supplement that you want to take it with food and you do not want to take dosages of fitments and minerals from supplements that are exceedingly high for a couple of reasons one is the build up of fat soluble vitementsthat we talked about before the other reason is that when people tend to take very high levels of vitamins and minerals from supplements they tend to spend less time and focus on making sure that their optimizing their nutrition or at least trying to get their nutrition right what do i mean by getting their nutrition right well i think regardless of weather not your kept omnivore carnivore vegan or any other nutritional plan the key thing is to get most that is about seventy five to eighty per cent of your foods or more from non process or menially process sources i think there is agreement across the board that most people should avoid highly process foods holy process foods are gig to be foods with very long ingredient lists that have very long shelf lives this often includes snack foods it does include snack foods ships et camera pastries that conoid on the shelf along time but it also includes things catsups an number of different other foods that have many many ingredients preservatives most people would do well to avoid those kinds of foods and focus most of their intake on things that are non process of these would be things fruits and vegetables you knows that the non process foods will tend to have very short shelf life or require refrigeration an some cases such as meat eggs et camera or minimal process foods such as not rice and bills and process beans and things of that sort beans oftentimes can be completely on processes well of course this is too general categories process and mainly process that should make up about eighty per cent or more of your food in take four goal is health an obtaining adequate amounts of vitamins andminerals the sell all foundational supplements include of course vitamin and mineral supplements but has expanded over the last debate or more to also include supplements that have vitamins and minerals but also things digestive enzymes and again here we have an example where indeed you can get digestive enzymes from foods for instance eating a bit of papa or even a a bit of pine apple can assist in the digestion of certain aspects of macrinutians because these are naturally occurring enzymes that help digest things carbohydrates fats and prolines and there are other food base sources of enzymes your welcome to look those up on line if just put food base sources of enzymes and you'll find those but nowadays s a lot of the foundational supplements will include pap pan or they willinclude different li pass or any time you her the word tastes by the way t means a at engine mananzim design to break down or to catalo some sort of reaction biology and a nutrition in particular you can finds foundational supplements that include vitamins and minerals and digestive enzymes and nowadays more and more the quality foundational supplements are also including things adaptagens and here the name adaptagens the sort of vague and it indeed has no specific operational definition this is something really important understand about supplementation is that companies and indeed podcast can talk about adaptagens without actually defining what in adaptation is in an operational way when we say operational what we mean is definition that every one in a given arena or space research for instance can agree on that when we talk about the adaptagenic effects of a given compound where all talking about the same things well foundational supplements nowadays include fitments minerals digestive enzymes and the call the daptagens and the adaptagens broadly speaking are thought to improve the body in brains of bill ability to buffer against various stresses these can be things herbs ashuogonda that are designed to reduce cortesall levels and that sense ashogonda is in adaptagen but ashrogonda has other effects related to hormonaugmentation in both the testosterone and estrogen and may been the third paths will talk about the solicit later when we talk about supplements for hormone augmentation foundational supplements has really expanded to include a lot of different categories of nutrients and micronutrient vitamins and minerals digestive engine design to achieve a broad spectrum of a facts again this is the one category of supplementation where i think it makes sense to explore mouth ingredient formulations and the other thing that is often included in these called foundational supplements or probiatics or prebiotics which are design to agent and support the call got microfilm the got microfilm is the collection of trillions of little mycobacteria that exist in all of us they mainly exist in the mucus membrane lined tissues of the body that would be our nasal passages your mouth the vagina the urethra and the got the whole way from your mouth all the way out the other end noxious your stomach trillions of bacteria live there trillions of mycobacteria also live on your skin in fact every time you shake one's hand your exchanging mycobacteria these mycobacteria often are healthy for us good for us they support a huge number of positive biological functions but there are other mycobacteria that live in our gut and elsewhere on those mucusline tissues that can be disadvantageous for us that can harm our health growing idea o these days based on a number of different laboratories work including the laboratory of my upstairs neighbor at stamford doctor just sonumberg who is been agent on this podcast is that having a great diversity a range of microbioda at the as they called micro boom microbioda and these mycobacteria are all century referring to the same thing the microbus as the whole collection of these mycobacteria but having a lot of different called species of these mycobacteria is known to be advantageous for immune system function hormone function it supports the called got brain acts that is i portent for a number of things including mood and motivation actually supports thupproduction of our transmitters in the brain and body that can help to be motivated elevated mood support the general function of neurons well not surprisingly there are ways to support the got microfilm in their ways to harm the got microbial referred to the podcast episode we did with just in sonoberg con find that it superman labdocom if you want to learn all the different ways you can support your got microfilm but forsake of to day's discussion i want emphasized that some of those methods of supporting the got microfilm are through the direct conjunction of particular foods and their two categories of foods that if your getting enough of them it is likely that you are got microfilm is diverse and is going to support all those important functions i just listed off and other functions as well the two forces of got mi gobioid supporting foods are low sugar fermented food these would be things sour can kimchi a grgreekyogar again low sugar grekyogar om comboucha in particular as a drink a things keeper there are bunch of other varieties of tormented foods different cultures at different fermented food japan's not is a another source of of ferment that is very good for the gomicrobiom and work from just in sonenberg lab and close by labs at tampered school medicine have shown that if people in jest for servings to day of these low sugar fermented foods it greatly improves the function of the gotmicrobiom and in particular enhances the function of the immune system and it reduces the called in flamatome it reduces inflammation in the brain and body in the ways that are helpful and effective for brain and body that is mental half physical heath in performance there are ways to support your gotmicrobiom strictly from food but ichicome has no surprise that most people are not investing for serving to day of fermented foods hopefully there getting en of fiber especially periotic fiber which is one other way to support the got microfilm although the studies from just in sononberg s lab point to the fact that fiber in take itself was not directly supportive of the gtmicrobiom in everybody it was in some individuals but not in others in some had no effect and in other individuals it actually made the category or i should say the a ray of inflamatome markers worse it actually led to more inflammation that s not to say that fibers bad in fact in the episode that we did with doctor lane north he discuss the many benefits of g ting end fire there are letter reasons why people should get enough fire in their diet but at least for supporting the got microfilm for servings to day of lost sugar tormented foods seems to be the best way to support the got microfilm through the intake of nutrition again most people are not achieving that and therefore these foundational supplements that can be just videmenmen mineral supplements or cold be vitemenan mineral supplements plus digestive enzymes or both of those things plus adaptions now also tend to include prebiotics and probioics that are designed to support the proliferation and maintenance of enough got microbioda in order to support the got microfilm and the got brain axis now because of the importance of the got microbiuman because most people are not getting enough support for the got microfilm in the form of low sugar tormented foods and periotic fire from their diet i think perhaps one of the most essential foundational supplements irrespective of whether not it includes vitamins and minerals adaptations and digestive enzymes is some way to support the got microfilm now this gets into a whole dimension of of categories of robotic and robotic capsule and one needs to be very careful there i do one to say that most of the erotic and robotic capsule that you can buy for shall are very expensive the best ones are going to be refrigerator to require refrigeration just as do any good low sugar tormented foods by the way for instance pickles are a low sugar tormented food that can support the got microfilm but if your buying pickles from the section and of the grocery somewhere they the pickles are not refrigerated well then you are not going to get the got microfilm supporting effects from those pickles for funny or even having this conversation tucking up pickles but the reality as they can greatly enhance the microbiota if you are getting pickles that are and require refrigeration and include the brine which is the the liquid arum them the same is true for sourcrot nonrofragerade souercrut is not going to support your gotmicrobium it will supply some other things perhaps but is not on support your go microbiment has to be the refrigerate diversions for the reason that most people are not getting enough food based support for the got microfilm and because of the importance of the got microbus one of the key categories of foundational supplements are supplements that create support for the microfilm through prebiotics or robotics again they tend to be the refrigerated varieties of the ones that are actually going to work those also ten to be very expensive and there are some evidence that taking excessive amounts of prebiotics and robotics that is typical of these causal forms of robotics and robotics if they are taken on going not for short periods of time but if there taken on going can lead to some issues brain fall there is a nice literature on this that and a growing one at that my suggestion is that if people are going to take supplements to support the mi crobiom that those supplements include low enough levels that is small enough amounts of robotics and robotics that you do not start to venture into the realm of brain hog and some of the other issues that can be associated with taking too much robotic and robotic in the form of supplements it'd to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called a g one is a vitamin mineral robotic drink that covers all f your foundational nutritional needs have been taking athletic green since two thousand and twelve some delighted that their sponsoring the pod cast the reason i started taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athletic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets to be the robotics that i need for got health our god is very important its populated by up microbioda that communicate with the brain the maun system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long turn health and those probiotis an athletic greens are optimal and vital for macrobiotic health in addition athletic greens contains a number of adaptagens vitamins and minerals that make sure that all my foundational nutritional needs are met and it taste gripe if you to triathlete greens you can go to athletic green stock come slash supermen and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you are on the road in the car on the plain et camera and they give you a year supply of vitamin d the k too again that athletic green dock come slash supermen to get the five free travel packs and the year supply of vitamin the ka to the other category foundational supplements are those adaptagens that we mentioned earlier adaptions again being a very poorly define category but these are typically micro nutrients herbs sometimes they go into the mushroom category in these are non a psychedelic mushrooms that provide either some offering to the star system by reducing cortical typically or that are thought to or known to based on research studies to enhance things blood flow to the brain or to enhance some aspect of connive function by way of enhancing negro transmitter function this category of called adaptions is an important one will get back to the kilobit later the reason i mention it now is that it is indeed hard to get the called adaptions in sufficient concentrations from food based sources have to assume that most people are not out there collecting chose mushroom or the ashuagon to herbs and then combining them with their salads their foods and that is why this adaptation category fits into foundational now this opens up the category of foundational supplements that are broad spectrum that is that include vitamins and minerals that have digestive enzymes that have adaptions and that also have prebiotics and robotics at the appropriate dosages this is one reason why am a big fan of supplements athletic greens which is many if a sponge or this podcast and does really nicely cover all f these categories of foundational nutrition but i do one to emphasize that this is not a way to focus on athletic green specifically there are other categories and brands of excellent foundational nutritional supplements that cover these categories of vitamins and minerals robotics robotics digestive end times an adaptagens it just happens that that athletic greens is the one that i discovered and that works best for me and that many people find works really well for them this is why when people approach me and they ask me as they often do very very often do i should say if ism only going to take one supplement what supplement should i take rather than just give them one specify cancer i actually ask them three questions first question i ask them is how well are you sleeping at night are you getting enough sleep are you waking up feeling rested because if they are not that opens up a whole different set of interactions that we need to have and discussions around what sorts of things they need to do and possibly take in order to get their sleep right because sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance we will have that discussion a obit later in this episode the second question i ask them is how is your nutrition that is are you eating regularly have you found the commination of macro nutrients or which diet is right for you do you think you are getting enough sidemen minerals has your digestion we have that conversation and then the third thing that i ask which is extremely important is what is your budget because if somebody has ten dollars a month total to spend on supplements verses a thousand dollars a month to spend on supplements total well then there is a different set of conversations to be had as to what supplements they should take now once those three questions have been answered assuming that somebody is able to spend about a hundred dollars or more on supplements per month then my recommendation is that they not focus on any specific supplements directed toward sleep or toward focus or hormonaugmentation but rather that they focus on buffering and enhancing their foundational nutrition adaptagens robotics robotics and digestive end times because of the simple fact that if they do that they are going to raise the tide on all the biological an organ systems that are going lead to enhanced mental health physical health and performance including sleep this is one reason why if people say well if i can only take one supplement what should i take i say well what is your budget if they say they can meet that hundred dollar threshold per month then my recommendation would be athletic greens or something it or that they invest the time and energy to go find the various comminations of fitments and minerals and robotics and prepiotics and adaptions and forth in individual components that they can then take in commination in order to meet their foundational needs but most people are not interested in doing all that homework and leg work to figure out exactly what the dosages are that is one reason why indeed i have taken athletic greens since two thousand twelve i it it makes me feel better i have more energy i sleep better my digestion is certainly better in its supports tie to my croci i do that for that reason but again i want to emphasize that there are other great sources of all the relevant things within those foundational formulas that athletic greens contains it certainly not the only route to covering your foundational health needs there are other ways to do that now if somebody has a budget lower than a hundred dollars per month to spend on foundational supplementation well then their couple of discussions to be had now if the amount of money that they have to devote to foundational supplementation is zero of course respect that and then it becomes a discussion about what sorts of foods and patterns of foodie take are going to best support their mental health physical health and performance now if somebody has somewhere between zero dollars and fifty dollars to spend on supplementation forsake of this thing were calling foundational health per month well then a different category of supplement discussion arises and will have that in a moment but the sort of close the conversation on foundational supplementation end that means many different things its fitments and minerals sometimes that one vehement an mineral supplement it means digestive enzymes that could be its own supplement or in foundation in sidemen meals it means often not always adaptagens things oshuagonda different on plant base and mushroom based formulations that can buffer stress and provide other brain anybody support and it often although not always but should i believe include the robotics and robotics or anything that supports healthy got my crobiom once again i think a broad spectrum supplement that has many many ingredients of high quality that covers all these bases is going to be the best rout to insuring foundational supplementation is covered and i do think that should be the starting place for any and all supplementation regiments it'll see that once again i think covering your foundational needs in the realm of fitments minerals probation digestive en times and adaptions is going to give you the most benefit by cost and the most benefit across the board in terms of brain embody systems that is going to allow you to feel better over all sleep better over all focus better over all and support all the different systems in your brain anybody that are gin allow you to be at your best will of course also paying careful attention to your nutrition because you simply cannot abandon nutrition again better living through chemistry still requires better living now that we have hade that discussion about foundational supplementation and again highlighting the fact that that is the one category of supplementation where mouth ingredient formulations make the most sense it'd to now shift our attention to single ingredient formulation supplements that are designed to achieve specific and points and here again rather than focus on specific ingredients and supplements to achieve specific i points because we have done that already in episodes relate to sleep and focus et camera it'd to take a step back and focus on them larger theme of to day's episode which is how to think about supplementation in a rational cost effective in biologically effective way for each of these categories and the three categories that i am going to cover or sleep hormone support and cognitive enhancement and focus cognomen henchmen in focus being the final third category let us talk about sleep and the rational approach to thinking about supplementation for sleep as i mentioned earlier in this episode and on many previous episodes of this podcast sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance you might be somebody who can do in all night or and feel okay the next day or maybe even great but most everybody once they start to have minimal sleep for one or two nights in the form a broken sleep poor sleep not enough sleep or sleeping at the wrong time of night there is such a thing or day they start to suffer their mood starts to suffer their cognitive clarity and performance tarts to suffer there mental health can suffer severely and physical performance definitely suffers hormone suffer everything suffers cover sleep when people are sleeping well that is deeply end en enough eighty for send of the nights of their life mental health physical health and performance all flourish and i think most people start to be almost amazed at how well they are doing in various domains of life that previous sly they might have struggled with sleep is fundamental it's that is to established when thing about supplementation for sleep we need to ask ourselves a number of important question first of all you should ask yourself how well that is how deeply and how much you sleeping per night assuming your somebody who can fall asleep easily stay sleep through the night wake up feeling relatively rested may be little groggy and then can move about your day with plenty of energy and focus you are not falling asleep in class or it were or behind the wheel where's a passenger on public transportation well then your probably getting enough sleep and by the way it is perfectly normal to require anywhere from a ten minute to a ninety minute nap in the afternoon for some people if you are not a napper no beg deal it is known that naps can disrupt night time sleep but provided that there early enough in the day if you take a nap and you are still able to fall asleep at night then naps are fine for you if you are somebody who does not naps as you wake up groggy or grumpy which often happens to certain people then do not nap you certainly do not need to nap but if you are feeling energetic throughout the day chances are your getting enough sleep at night but there are people of course who are struggling with sleep either falling asleep staying asleep or there not feeling alert enough during the day or all of the above and then tot make sense to step back and take a look at what supplementation can provide if you are one of those people who is not sleeping enough or well enough at night that you are suffering during the day in whatever way mild to severe their two questions you should ask yourself first of all are you in getting caffeine after to p m if the answer is yes you want to limit or eliminate caffeine after two p m may be en push it back to noon or earlier i know that can be excruciating for some folks but i can really help with your ability to fall and stay asleep at night second thing is most people would do well to avoid food within the two hours prior to bedtime but of course you do not one to be hungry that you cannot fall asleep those are the a nutrition an behavioral tools that everyone needs to consider if you are not in jesting affine two p m or onwards and you are not eating excessively immediately prior to bedtime or within the two hours prior to bedtime and you are not hungry when you go to sleep well then there are certain supplements that can support your sleep and were talked about these in the perfect sleep episode and in the episode with our gets expert mat walker from university calfornia barely end in the master your sleep episode and we have a tool kit for sleep you can acts us zero cost by going herein lapdog caiman going to the men you go t new slitter n find that tool kit you sign up for other free tool kits it but the point here is not to go systematically through each of the supplements that is beneficial or has been shown to be beneficial for sleep but rather to a dress specific aspects of sleep that can suffer and why and how certain patterns of supplementation can support or alleviate those pain points if for instance your somebody who falls asleep just fine but wakes up in the middle the night around two or three a m or any time for that matter and has trouble falling back asleep their two categories of supplements that you might want to consider the first is moan coital typically taken as nine hundred milligrams of mayo an city moan coital can help short in the amount of time that it takes to fall back asleep if you wake up in the mill the night moan coital has other beneficial uses as well for mood at camera if you to see many of the different effects that have ben explore in the scientific literature from moon coital you can go to examine dock comments and excellent sit locust for in social but for all supplements for that matter talks but the human effect ma tricks that is the different affects of different supplement compounds on different aspects of hormone brain and body health where the evidence is strong where the evidence is weak has link to studies and on again its examined commamazing website wonderful website provided such a rich resource for me an for you many many other people other people who wake up in the mill the night wake up because their dreams are very intense or they were having dreams that were vivid that suddenly they were jolted from their dreams those people would do well to avoid certain supplements in a women it'll talk about the value of a supplement called fheanine for falling asleep but fheanine which typically is taken in dosages anywhere from one hundred milligrams to four hundred milligrams depending on body wait and experience and what you find to be most effective for you minimally effective for you well the inion can be great for many people but for people who have excessively vivid dreams those excessively vivid dreams can lead to immediate waking and sometimes a limit of anxiety upon waking in the middle the night some people who wake up in the mile the night jolted mentally and physically out of sleep because of their intense dreams would do well to avoid thespian supplementation takes about this a bit before but and something that i think a lot of night time middle of the night wakes might be familiar with and would want to take into consideration now for those of you that are not waking up in the mill the night or not having excessively vivid dreams but are having trouble falling asleep two supplements in particular have been shown to be effective for shortening the transition time to sleep in allowing people to casino sleep more readily and those are magnesium three inmate which is interchangeable with magnesium bissglicenate magnesium disc licente and magnesium three inmate both have transporter systems that allow them to readily cross the blurring barrier and they lead to a mild form of drowsiness mild in the sense that is not going to prevent you from operating motor vehicle or kind of any on conditions under emergency that might arise in the middle the night or if they did arise in they'll night you still be able to function as none sleeping pill but people who take those often find that their transition time into sleep is much faster in their sleep is also much deeper incidentally those supplements also thought to be useful for cognitive support and euro protection although there's less data on that is that is for falling sleep that is one category either magnesium magnesium three name or bisclicin it would be interchangeable for assisting the transition time into sleep and then the other settlement is alien and a p i g e an in apigenan which is a derived of camumeal give talked about this in various podcast before also acts as a bit of a anxiety lowering compound which is essential prior to sleep for people to essentially turn off their thinking or to be able to reduce the amount of ruminating and problem solving and future anticipation tat their doing which is a requirement for falling asleep what is the rational approach to supplementing in a way that allows you to fall asleep more quickly and stay asleep well would you immediately take magnesium three name an apigenan together for that depends if you have the budget and you just simply one a fall asleep quicker and you do not care which of those two ingredients going to be more effective for you for then you could try one for instance magnesium three inmate and try it for perhaps a week and see how that affects your latency to sleep time that is sow quickly fall asleep or you try apigenan in the first week or you could combine them both or you could try magnesium three name for week than switch to only appigenan for a week and evaluate which one works better for you if neither works for you i do recommend trying the commination together again this is just the way that any s dentist would design an experiment to try and understand which variables that is which ingredients are most effective for the result that you want as appose to just lumping them together andtaking them that said a lot of people want excellent sleep badly that they just say ogham just going to take magnesium three name man take up again and omen to tike thiamine if my dreams are too vivid and ism waking up the mill the night from excessively vivid dreams it'll drop the thiamine and many people actually derive great benefit from that approach but because today were talking about the most rational cost effective and biologically effective approach to supplementation if you are not sleeping as well as you would to or if you want to explore what sleeping even more deeply might do for your mental heal physical health an performance will then to make sense to think about the various supplements for falling asleep verses remaining asleep what to include what not to include and to do that systematically and again i think one week's time of taking something provided it does not induce any negative effects right if something induces a negative effect i recommend ceasing taking it immediately but if something does not produce any negative effects than i think you want to try a single ingredient formulation for about a week while not varying anything else not changing anything else in your over all protocols of nutrition or supplementation it is impossible to clamp everything perfectly from week to week but you do not change anything else dramatically and just add that supplement for a given week see how it benefits your sleep may be add in a secrets second supplement if you or rather swap and try a different supplement for a week and then see what works best and see if the commination works even better now i acknowledge that what i just described is exceedingly basic but it is something that i do not think most people do most people either decide they have the budget and the interest in just improving their sleep across the board and they do not care what ingredient is providing the maximum benefit or they simply try something and decide oh well it did not work for meet ism not on a try anything else supplements do not work for me or magnesium does not work for me or am i woke up in the mill the right from vivid dreams and that is because they are taking more of a shock in approach without teasing out the different variables in fact t if there's an overriding theme of to day's conversation it is really about learning how to icily variables in the realm of supplementation because once you do that and once you start to develop that intuitions or sensitivity of sorts to how different ingredients impact you it is an enormously powerful stands to have because you are going to keep your costs limited you are also going to find the things that work particularly poorly for you and more importantly the things that work particularly well for you toward your goes any discussion about supplementation for sleep i feel has to include a discussion about melatonin have talked about melatonin before or numerous podcast mine and others and i will say once again i am not a ghana melatonin for a couple of reasons maltose's a hormone known to induce sleepiness but not keep us asleep often tins people take platonic and fall deeply sleep and then awake up and have trouble falling back of sleep the other reason is that melatonin supplements almost always include levels of melatonin or mounts a melatonin that far far exceed the normal biological levels are called indigenous levels of melatonin that we would normally produce and yes it is true that as we age would produce less melatonin but melatonin as a hormone also impacts other hormone systems in particular the reproductive hormone access to someone estrogen et camera just not to say that you have been taking megaton for some period of time that you have destructed your fertility or those hormone axis but it is possible that you have disrupted them some what and it is very clear that melatonin can impact not just sleep but other systems in the brain and body it can be useful for jet lag and for occasional use but there also i want to a voice a message of caution there have been studies exploring the dosages of melatonin contained in various supplements and whether or not what is listed on the bottle matches what is actually contained in those formulations and despite those formulations coming from quite reliable cotanquote or thought to be reliable sources was found that these supplements contain anywhere from fifteen per cent of what is thought to be or is told to be in those supplements or many times more melatonin than is listed on the bottle the damaging does not seem to be consistent with what is often tested on the bottle this is even true within some of the more reputable brands that is of of real concern we need ta highline melatonin as perhaps something that is only used occasionally you want to talk about dosages for melatonin use for jet lag at camera go to examine dot come there some excellent om references to studies there just put melatonin in the search function instill you everything you need to know about melatonin but now you known my stance on melatonin one question i often get about supplementation for sleep is does it create a dependency that is an excellent question to ask think most people worry about even fear relying on something heavily that if they did not have it for whatever reason that they could not sleep in my experience there is no problem falling and staying asleep in the absence of a supplement for sleep even if you have been taking that supplement for sleep consistently sevendays a week for months and months may be e years on end i confess that i occasionally fall asleep having not taken my presleep supplements and i happen to take magnesium three and high thing and apagenan i also take a inositol o it greatly enhances my sleep and there bedights when i fall asleep not having taken any of those things and have slept fine that said if i were to explore multiple nights of trying to sleep without that supplementation i find that my sleep is not as good ism still able to fall asleep but the depth of my sleep and the duration of my sleep is not as good as when i am supplementing i think that is refreshing news at least to me that there is not a dependence on these supplements in order to be able to fall asleep it is not the same sort of dependence that people experience from things sleeping pills that said any compound any compound can create a placebo type of fact where we think we need something in order to achieve a certain effect i we had a guest on this podcast some time ago i doctor allycrome was a professor at stamford and works on these mind set effects belief effects and placebo effects and placebo effects can be very real a and in some sense dove tail with any conversation about dependence meaning if you are somebody who loves your sleep supplements and sleeps great with them and one night you discover you do not have them or you cannot access em for whatever reason that can create a lowly bit of an anxiety around the idea that owing in their absence you are not going to be able to sleep and that is a sort of a placebo effect in reverse if you will because what it suggests is that there is a emotional a a cognitive association with taking these things that allows you to sleep well i would highly recommend that people explore this issue of dependency and placebo effects for sleep supplements on their own and under conditions in which there is nothing pressing the next day that is you don't have every presentation et camera what i recommend is that every two weeks or may be every month or take one night off completely from all your sleep supplements or leave out one sleep supplement try to understand to what extent you might have established a dependency either real or placebo based on these sleep supplements and again i suggest doing this on perhaps a fridge night that it is a weekend the next days you do not have to work if perhaps you do not sleep well think what you will find is what most people find and that is in the absence of taking your supplement stack for sleep one night you are stolen a sleep just fine now does that mean that these supplements are not actually working under normal conditions where you are taking them each night no what this means is that many of these things magnesium in particular can build up in the body and brain in a way that can be beneficial and what probably explains the fact that you can still sleep if you miss a night of taking them is that the neural circuits that are involved in turning off thinking or not thinking and infilling asleep those neural circuits undergo what is called plasticity in other words if you get better at falling in staying a sleep over time even if you got better at that through the assistance or with the assistance of some supplement or commination of supplements well then those circuits are still going to function just fine even in the absence of not taking the supplements just ones we will get back into this conversation a habit later when we talk about cognitive enhancement in focus the same stor my there where indeed there are things that people can take in stimulant form and and non stimulant form that can enhance cognivability in focus but that does not mean that you become dependent on those that you cannot focus unless you take them this has been shown multiple times over again to answer the question is there a dependency established by taking supplements for sleep the short answer is now with the cobyacht that placebo effects and belief effects are always going to be at play whether not you talking about supplementation prescription drugs or even behavior o protocols for that matter the next category of supplementation that ad to talk about is hormone support improving or called optimizing your hormones is a critical aspect of mental health physical health and performance we have done multiple episodes about hormones in clouding testosterone and estrogen for both men and women and for people of different ages v also had episodes on fired hormone growth hormone and on you can find all those that hubris labor coming fact you can go to the superman labor come web sit there is a search function we can just put in a keycard and it will take you to all the episodes and specific time points where that topic happens to be covered now hormone health is such an important topic to discuss in the contacts of supplementation because indeed there are compounds that are non prescription base supplements that can improve hormone function again any time we are discussing a particular aspect of mental health physical health or performance we need to start with a mention of the few behavioral tools nutrition base tools or at least some top contour coverage of those in a way that frames up the discussion about supplementation appropriately in the contacts of hormone support an augmentation en optimization if you are not getting adequate calories from high quality sources hormones testosterone and estrogen will super this is one of the reasons why women will stop having their periods if they are not ingesting enough calories this is one of the reasons why testosterone levels will drop if people are not ingesting enough calories in fact on the episode with expert guest and medical doctor peteratea he described how sex hormone dining globular this is a approaching that is present in males and females that binds to testosterone and other hormones and prevents it from being in its free form which is the more active form well insolent which of course has going to increase after the ingestion of carbohydrates in particular insolent actually inhibits or reducesexhormon dining globular this means is that for you intermittent faster or people that are ingesting very few carbohydrates or a very low blood locos or perhaps are taking things met former or barbering which is a supplement based a approach to reducing blood glucose well your sex hormone dining globular is going to increase dramatically conversely if you are eating enough calories in the form of foods that allow your insolent to be a bit hirer not excessively high we hope but it a bit higher well then sex hormomonin globular will go down and are testostrom will go up the discussion about hormones support and augmentation has to include some nod board or understanding the fact that nutrition and the way that nutrition impacts hormones and the way that hormone such as insolent in pact other hormones such as are testosterone that all has to be acknowledge that is not the topic of to day's discussion but it is important that i remind everybody that nutrition matters for general hormone status it is also important t remember that behaviors matter for hormone status getting morning sunlight increases cortical levels coatis all levels are very important to have elevated early in the day for focus and alertness and from function and to make sure that cortex all levels are lo at night and thereby levels of growth hormone and testosterone which is secreted mainly in the early morning can be elevated at night and in the early morning getting morning sunlight getting strenuous exercise in the form of both party of vascular exercise but also relatively short meaning an hour or less bouts of intense resistance training a few times per week can also dramatically actor hormone trophies in fact in the episode that we did with doctor drunken french again you find that episode at human labdanum he describe a very strenuous but still brief two day a week photo call of using resistance training specifically to increase teststron and fretestostron and growthormon and on nutrition matters exercise matters when it comes to increasing supporting or augmenting different hormones and that is just the discussion about testosterone fretestostron and estrogen there's also the vast discussion about third horn at camera again we covered all those topics and previous episodes but once those behavioral tools are in place once your doing the right things and your avoiding the wrong things doing the right things to support your demons and avoiding the things that diminish hormones in the ways that can be detrimental once your nutrition is in place to support your demons then it make sense to turn and consider what supplements can support hormones but i do believe that you want to get your behaviors and your nutrition correct before you stare thinking about supplementation for hormones gan it'll repeat that get your nutrition and your behaviors correct forsake of hormones and for other health purposes before you start thinking about supplementation for hormones and certainly before you starting about prescription base approaches to improving hormones once all of those other elements are in place the supplements that make sense in terms of augmenting hormones come in two forms one are broad band support for multiple hormones and then the others are supplements that are behind to increase when some cases decrease specify i hormones are hormone pathways let us consider each of those in tandem there are are certain supplements things shikari for instance something from iridic medicine which may mainly a has the act of ingredient pelvic acid which is known to for instance increase things effisate physical stimulating hormone which in women is going to increase certain aspects of growth hence the name physical stimulating hormone a its onto stimulate certain aspects of fertility its pro fertile and in males can make for more sperm production or more motile sperm effisagees also going to indirectly increase testastronan males its known to increase libido in both males and females things shikari can indeed augment multiple hormones and support multiple hormone systems generally in the direction of pro fertility pro libido and increasing estrogen and testastrum now there are other supplements such as ashuaganda that also fall into this category of affecting multiple hormones aschuagonda is a very potent supplement in terms of refusing cortical levels it has also been shown to increase testastron levels but probably indirectly and that is because cortical an testastron sort of exists on a sea saw in terms of pathways there are separate pathways but those pathways interact enough that when cortical is lowered in general testastron tends to increase now it is important that wit certain hormones ashwaganda that you do not take them for more than two weeks at a time at dosages if you want to know more of the specifics around ashuaganda and how long to take it how to calculate et camera pile see our episode on master stress please also see the examined o cobweb site and put in ashuagonda it will get into some of that description but shikari ashuaganda and things for instance el carnations a supplement that we often discuss in terms of fertility because it can indeed improve servers motility and quality and equality its pro fertile compound but it also impacts o various mightacondreal pathway its having a more indirect effect on hormones there are many other compounds present and available supplements that are purported to be pro hormone support in particular for testastronor estrogen fertility and libido there is a description for instance of things macho root macho root can increase libido its found to be particularly effective in women but in men as well and in all people who are suffering from lowered libido due to intake of eyes arise selective craton and retake in hitters for whatever reason ecessorizer used to treat seedy other used to treat depression any number of different things make root can be in many instance is effective in increasing libido it does that however through augmentation of dooming related pathways and some of the hormone pathways upstream of teststron and e estrogen the reports that macaw increases testastron a are somewhat scant and a littlest weak to be honest it is having these indirect effects that may impact testastron downstream cannot put mama alongside aschuoganda alongside trilogy as supplements that a impactimultiblormon pathways toward increase libido increase fertility increase testastronor estrogen likely through indirect pathways now with all that said to provide some examples of supplements that work more directly on specific hormone pathways aimed at achieving more specific goals such as elevated testastron or elevated free testastron or elevated growth hormone for that matter and elevated thirorthormon it'd to talk about growth hormone first because it is shy a pretty short discussion first of all the best way to augment growth hormone is to get quality deep sleep especially the sleep that occurs in the first three or four hours of the night is when growth hormone is released and it is going to be beneficial to avoid colorific take in the two hours preceding sleep again do not go to bed hungry that you wake up an hour or an hour and halfhlater or you have trouble falling asleep but avoiding food intake in the to hours prior to sleep and certainly avoiding alcohol and cannabis is going to facilitate growth hormone release in the first hours of sleep many people use intermit fasting or even longer periods of fasting to increase growth hormone one of the interesting things i learn from an expert guest doctor calgelette whose a medical doctor on this podcast is that indeed while lengthier fasts or intermitting fasting can increase growthormon levels very substantially it has indirect effects on the genetic pathways and the receptors for growth hormone that actually are detrimental for the function of growth hormone avoiding food for the two hours prior to bedtime is a good idea if you avoid food for longer that is just going to assist even more certainly is not going to hurt in terms of growth hormone release but extended fast specifically for the purpose of increasing growth hormone are not really logical when you look at the broader effects of extended fast that is not to say that extended fasting is not appropriate for some people it can be in certain instances or that intermittent fasted call time orsterctiv feeding is not beneficial for some people it can be here ism only referring to the effects or this case the lack of effects of intermittent fasting time restricted feeding on growth hormone specifically now in terms of supplements to increase growth hormone there are very few supplements thathave been shown to augment this pathway there is some idea that argentine supplementation prior to bedtime can further elevate levels of growth hormone especially when fasted that literature is rather weak to be honest i ensure you to go to examined to come if you on applause those particular studies really these things that increase growth hormone very potently fall outside the realm of supplementation they include exercise again look at the drunken french episode or in the file you let episode on optimizing hormones fin males and particular but this also pertains the females that avoiding food two hours prior to bedtime really can boost growth hormone significantly in sleep beyond what it would be otherwise but it is really only once you get into the realm of prescription compounds things peptides sarmorellan ah which increase chief on and growth hormone things growthormon itself by prescription o if and only if its prescribed by a doctor of course and is safe for you that is when you start getting into really a significant increases in growth hormone not a lot of supplements out there to increase growth hormone potently now it is a different story when you start thinking about in talking about testosterone and free testosterone and utilizing hormone aluminizing hormone is released from the pituitary which is this gland not far from the roof of your mouth and it is near by neighbor the hypothalamus is a collection of neurons that sits above the roof of your mouth and talks to the pituitary talks to it through neural connections and hormone base connections there is a hormone called g n r h ganatitrop an releasing hormone that is released from the hypothalamus into the pituitary its stimulates the release of utilizing hormone or l h which than travels in the blood stream to impact multiple tissues in the body but mainly the very an females in the testes an males to stimulate estrogen production and testosterone production there are supplements that can potently increase g and r h and or utilizing a hormone and then indirectly increase testosterone and estrogen and i was to remind people teststron an estrogen are present in both males and females and both are important for things libido muscle growth and on lot of people think that oh in males you not having very high testosterone and low estrogen is actually ideal it is actually not ideal if you want keep your libido anything that lowers your estrogen too far is going to refuse your libido you don't want estrogen too high but you also do not want it too low supplements that can tickle this pathway or actually can act as a bit more of a directed hammer on this lionizing hormone pathway may also i pagan or h a things fidogia agrastus this is in herb that have talks about before in the podcast that when taken at dosages of six hundermelegrams per day many people not all report elevated levels of libido elevated sperm production elevated testosterone in some cases elevated estrogen a bunch of hormone's down stream of utilizing hormone now are you going to be a fidogiograstus responder or a nonresponder there simply no way to know except by trying it if you are going to go down this rout there two very important considerations first of all there is a fairly extensive literature on the fact that fidogiagrastus can be toxic t o testicular cells and perhaps other cells when taken at very high dosages obeying the particular dosages of fidge arrests that are recommended on various product labels and cycling fidogia agrees can be important some people need to cycle it eight weeks on two weeks off other people of for twelve weeks on a month off i know a youfeol who have taken it continuously with no issues but i do want to suggest caution when taking fidge arrests the cautionary notes are stay within the recommended dosage ranges you can go lower but certainly do not go higher and i think it is wise to cycle every eight weeks or to come off it for two weeks and then going back on if that is your choice if you feel it benefited you we taking it for twelve week periods of time and then cycling off for full month before repeating again the best way to know whether or not fidogia or any of these other supplements is impacting your hormone levels in the direction that you want and not impacting your hormone levels or other aspects of your bialguastha you do not want is from a blood test there is simply no better tool to a valuate whether or not these supplements are working to support your hormones in the ways that you want and not causing issues except to take a blood test this podcast has inside tractor as a sponsor that can do in home blood taste and give you blood panels there are other sources of blood tests that are quite good as well of course and in the first episode of the human labpodcast that i did with doctor calgolett again a medical doctor expert in hormones diobedis and veryusother aspects of medicine he described and it is time stamped how to stand the best probability of getting your insurance to cover a blood test how to talk your doctor about getting a hormone panel and on s it'll refer you to that episode for that but blood tests are going to be very important i recommend taking them before adding in any supplement to increase hormones of any kind or decrease hormones of any kind for that matter and then again after about for to eight weeks of taking that particular supplement in order to evaluate whether not at worked and whether not it had any negative effects that you would to avoid i also want to remind people of the dosage conversation the we had earlier just because there is a recommended dosage of fidogia arrests of say six hundred milligrams per day first of all that is not an invitation to take twice as much and expect twice the passive effects that is not a good approach especially with something fidogia arrests which can at dosages be toxic but it is also important to perhaps consider taking a lower dosage and being how that affects your hormones that approach requires a bit more patience i know most people or thing i want the effect and i want it now but i think it is very important when thinking about exercise on nutrition or supplementation to really play the long game to think about what is going to work for you in the immediate end in the long term and to ease into any kind of supplement regiment for instance by t taking one thing at a time varying one supplement out an one supplement in starting at minimal effective dose and build up your protocols over a year or several years it really can be beneficial i can say for myself i started exploring the supplement space and taking different supplements in different commination and alone valuating which one's worked and did not work for me some were absolve dreadful for me i have tons of stories about supplement fails some of which were just kind of innocuous the meaning they were waste o money which is not nocuous but at least it was in detrimental to my health other supplements which fortunately do not exist on the market any more a i think actually a were quite dangerous and i feel lucky that i did not experience even greater negative effects from them other supplements have been tremendously useful for me an for other people for things sleep and hormones support focus and on fidogia grasses is a good example of a supplement that is known to have potent effects but you need to approach it with the appropriate a i would say respect for the fact that the dosage ranges in which it works a have to be kept pretty narrow without causing issues it does increase utilizing hormone and thereby testosterone an estrogen if your somebody who already excessively high in one or the other it is going o be very hard to just direct it to only testosterone only estrogen now the topic of to day's episode is not about fidogia aggresses per say i highlight it because it is one of the more potent supplements forsake of hormone augmentation but it is still fairly broad band it is a little more specific then something trilogy but it is still fairly broad band in terms of hitting multiple and point hormones teststron an estrogen and may be some other hormones as well there are other supplements in particular forgot all which is known to for instance increase libido whether not it does that by way of augmenting dopamine related pathways or testosterone pathways still is in clear it is known to increase free testosterone by reducing sexhormonbining globules tongaali can be beneficial both for men and for women in dosages anywhere from two hundred milligrams to six hundred milligrams per day there i would say scale according to body size although start with the minimum amount and find the minimal effective dose for you again blood work is going to be the most effective way to determine what is working are not working at the level of objective numbers but subjective experience matters too if you take it at four hundred milligrams for four weeks and you do not notice any effect you might try t at six under milligrams but not higher and if you still do not see an effect will then does not appear to have worked for you other people experienced dramatic effects from things fidogia and tongaali why would that be the case well you look to the scientific leisure what you find is that the studies that report the biggest effects of any supplement usually start with a population that somehow diminished or back on its heels in one particular dimension for instance people that are hypoganatl that are not making enough testosterone or free testosterone infant or levels are very very low their subclinical off range in terms of the sharks below the normal well those people when they take supplements tonga all fidogia tend to experience greater effects because there starting from a lower level than people who perhaps are close to the optima levels achieved through either we genetics exercise nutrition or some combination of those that's an important thing to think about these are called floor effects and sealing effects sealing effects are for instance if an individual already has very high testastron an free testastron and they take a supplement to increase it further they might not see any increase whereas somebody who sits more in the middle to low range stands to experience of much greater increase in fact one individual i know who took tonga all admittedly on my recommendation his testastron was initially very low and he was having a number of different symptoms he did blood work he that is how he knew it was low and he then took tongaali and fidogia in commination is he decide he just wanted results that he did not care which what which thing was going to given the results any experience big increases in testosterone this would be a not free but total testastron of he experience as much as six hundred anagrams protest leader increase from where he was before which is very dramatic was a near tripling of where his a testosterone has started off to where he ended up i do not know if he is ever done the experiment of removing fidogiar forgot to find out which one it was and this is why many people just take them in combination and if you have the budget for it in you are interesting just finding what works but not isolating what works at the level single ingredients that would be the preach i recommend however again i think most people do well to fibrous which specific ingredients are gin a work best for them by isolating the variables the way of described repeatedly throughout this episode to my knowledge tongaali does not need to be cycled may need don't have to take periods of time off from it should note that the effects of tongaali can take a obit longer to experience perhaps bloodworm should be done get to twelve weeks after initiating the tonga all protocol a supposed to earlier and it does seem to have sort of cumulative effects on libido and that points to the likelihood that its having someimpacktd on curl pathways as supposed to hormone pathway common pathways can be slow but in general curl pathways are the ones that are going to explain slow rising shifts in any kind of physical or mental aspect that then remain stable over time the exact effects of tongaali and where meaning where they arise in the brainbody are not known i will provide a link to a really beautiful reviewarticle that covers the literature on tonganali this came out fairly recently that i have reviewed with a number of other eddies in a medical ere medicine related poetasters it is a really nice review or providing to that gives a survey of tonal what people are discovering what they finding wat the are not finding and forth as a final note on supplements for hormone augmentation and supplementation one it make a brief mention of something specifically related to female health which is of course the menstrual cycle and across the menstrual cycle different hormones a present dent levels logical stimuli hormone is very high during the socle follicular phase right and then you have your audial phase we have an entire episode coming up about female hormones and hormone health that will cover this we also covered a obit of this in the other episodes on o tustostron an estrogen but the point i to make now is that for women they should fully expect that certain supplements not all but certain supplements because of the way they impact different hormones would have different effects may been opposite effects at different phases of the menstrual cycle and for that reason i believe it is especially important to have tight control over dosage and individual ingredients in your supplement regiment for instance of your somebody who take shelogi and i know many women who take trilogy or tonga all for instance or mama and you find that it really serves you well that is it provides the mental and physical benefits that you want an enjoy at certain phases of your menstrual cycle but at other phases of your menstrual cycle it feels too much or it actually construct to give you negative mental or physical effects will then obviously having control over those specific ingredients is going to be extremely important that you can titrate the dosage or increase the dosage as the case may be or cease taking those things entirely at certain phases of your menstrual cycle let us not say that some women cannot just continuously take these supplements throughout their menstrual cycle some can but some find that that makes them very in comfortable or that they would do well to alter different ingredients the different phases of their cycle again the speaks to the critical important of single ingredient control dosage control and the ability to cease taking individual or multiple ingredients according to the backdrop of your health generally and obviously the menstrual cycle is a profound shift in the hormone and thus the entirebobiological and psychological flu that exist in the body and of course there is the issue of birth control and whether not people are taking hormone basebirth control certain forms of hormonbates birth control and women involve tonically elevating that means consistently elevating estrogen that certainly going to reduce the fluctuations and thus the probability that certain horns and hormone pathways will change across the menstrual cycle but not eliminate altogether also there is the key issue of fertility in both males and females one important note even tough this is not an episode about fertility were can to have one soon but the important point about fertility is that there are supplements not just shelly but there are supplements and supplement protocols such as a carnations and particular indictable el carnations which does require prescription at least in the debut also only ingested carnations that can improve sperm health and motility and g health motility i mentioned that earlier but if couples are trying to conceive it is important that if you are going to take something that is a supplement directed toward sperm and or egg health that you also consider how that interfaces with some of the other hormone base compounds that is prescription drugs that you may be taking this is true for people who are doing via in be troferalization or not again that entire discussion will be handled in our episode on fertility and on female hormone health and we already did the episode with doctor calumet on man hormone health optimization the next category of supplementation that it'd to address is supplements related to cognitive and enhancement and focus and here there are a number of very useful strategies that one could take i to divide this conversation into to general categories of supplements to address cognate of enhancement in focus the first category are supplements that increase energy by way of stimulant properties the most obvious of these is affine affine is of course a molecule that can increase levels of alertness it also can increase levels of focus provided that dosages are in the appropriate range the appropriate range in most cases going to be one to three telegrams for kilograms bodyweight take in thirty minutes or before any kind of mental or pays kcal endeavor we did not entire episode about waffle where you can learn lots of facts about affine how best to utilize waffle and indeed it'll just give you a few of those now turns out that if your regular affine user you can still derive the cognitive enhancing and focus enhancing effects of affine if you invest affine every day but if you were to take two days off from affine completely and right now i hear all the kaffinatics out there o just wont of cringing at the idea and then take affine in the thirty minutes prior to some especially important event physical or mental event were really need to focus and be able to sustain that focus for long periods of time it would have an even greater effect than it normally would but since most people are taking affine in a kind of on going regular way i just one emphasize that it still has pro cognitive and pro focus a facts even of its taken every day or even multiple times pray again a cautionary note do not drink fine too late in the day past two pimp an really start to impede a your sleep at night even if you can fall sleep at night the architecture of that sleep is not going to be great if your investing affine in the preceding eight to ten and even twelve hours and that actually raises another ten genital but still important points ism going to make it n then get back to supplements which is the best cognitive an cancer that you will ever take is a really good night sleep of sufficient duration o ka sleep is going to be the betroth of your ability to focus and remember things in fact its during sleep that neral connections remodel cold negro plasticity basically not when you try your learning but it is when you consolidate and reinforce learning and a number of other things that relate to conniving enhancement in focus your thing of course is that your going to need to have sufficient levels of nutrition you do not want to be overly hungry or it is going to be hard to focus nor do you want to be overloaded with calories or a volume of food or have your blood locos to be high that it is going to make you sleepy there is a reason why when discussing stars and the called autonomic nervous system that the phrase rest and digest comes into play rest and digest as the name implies relates to the back that when we have a lot of food in are got it tends to make us sleepy in other words it s hard for us to focus and it is hard for us to maintain cognivittention and remember things et camera there bunch of behaviourable tools for enhancing focus did entire episode on enhancing focus it does touch on supplementation again can find lines to that in all formats at humeral labia cam we also have a news letter related to this topic also at german labdanum at zero cost with all of that said and in particular the highlight about sleep being the best way to enhance your connive abilities and focus any time ere having a discussion about supplements for enhancing cognivability in focus a major category of those supplements is going to fall in to the stimulant category and that is going to include most often affine although there are other sources of stimulants nock in a touch on those for the moment just talk about affine when people hear affine they think a while i can just drink caffeine indeed that is a great source of affine as carbamate i would caution people to am if you use your hamate for whatever purpose affine or otherwise that you avoid the smoked versions of yeurbomate am the are carsonagenic that is the smoked versions or carcinogenic an and to i consume the non smoked a varieties am instead the importuning to understand about affine is that while it can be ingested in the form of a drink or an energy drink to your coffee it can also be ingested as a pure supplement that is the are affine supplements and i know a number of people including a very very prominent pod master whose name i will not mention who drinks erbaltea but takes a one hundred to three hundred telegram tablet of coffin with the verbally in that case it is no longer verbally it is caffeinated verbally when you take affine in pill form it tends to have a much more potent and long lasting effect than when you take affine in the form of coffee or tea it is actually a world apart in terms of it is effects and if you have not experience this before i it might be something that you want to explore it might not be something you want to explore in particular your somebody who experiences anxiety or panic attacks be very careful with your in take of affine again see the episode of the superman papayas all about affine for more on that but it is the case that even hundred milligrams of kafir in tablet form i suppose it could be in basil forms well but in its pure form leads to much greater enhancement of alertness and focus then does often the comparable amount or even twice the amount of canine contained in coffee or t now why would that be has a lot to do with the other things that are in coffee and t here ism not encouraging people to become reliant on fine capsule or on cain tablets but if you want to increase alertness and focus fine is a potent way to do that it works the other category of stimulant that can work in terms of enhancing alertness in focus are going to be things that increase a derenolan in some other way or epineferan as it also call the delay pin deferent same thing in some other way that are going to tuchun to or agent the called adronergic and adrenalin systems and there are things yo combine and different forms of yohimbine alfaohimbine om their multiple forms of these things now i would go to examined to calm to explore the different forms of ohimbine about ten twenty years ago yohimbine was marketed primarily as a prolibido and pro rectal agent turns out it has very low efficacy for both of those things but there are certain forms of yohimbine that act as stimulants that a effective and are separate from those claims and pathways one particular form is called ala yohimbine it sometimes goes by the name rawolsin and that spelled a a u u o l e c i an e again that alfayohimbne and it is used as a stimulant often to also promote fatless and alertness have to say that it is a very potent an somewhat am precarious supplement some people experience a lot of anxiety on it that could also be because they tend to take it am on either an empty stomach or in commination with subcoloric diets it is a it sort of getting out on the edge of things that o for some people can work not well for other people am they might actually find it to be a very effective stimulant in general in terms of supplement based approaches to increase cognitive function and focus coffin either in coffee or t form or in tablet or capsid form but at lower dosages than you would find in ccoffeean t i think his actually reasonable way to explore stimulant based approaches enhancing cognitive function and focus i mention all that not because i think that you probably already did not know that coffin can enhance alertness and focus most people already know that and i acknowledge that but rather as a contrast point for the other supplement based approach for increasing cognac function and focus which is to increase certain narrow transmitter pathways that are not stimulant based for instances along p c which is essentially a cosine done acid the pathways relate to the neurmodulator a cental coming and can enhance focus a dosages of anywhere from three hundred to six hundred milligrams people experience heighten levels of focus for sake of mental work or physical work the half life of alpha p c is about for to six hours its relatively short lasting although you would not necessarily want to take it right before bed i do not recommend that it is not a stimulant it tends to enhance focus by augmenting a set coming and a seat coaling pathways specifically now it does create a little bit of an increase in alertness some people actually perceive it subjectively as an increase in overall stimulation but it is different than a fine type stimulant for instance three hundred milligrams to six under milligrams of alpha p c taken alone will allow people to be more focus but does intend to make people feel jittery or over stimulated similarly five hundred milligrams to a thousand milligrams or somewhere in between of something a tyrosine which is an monoacid precursor to dopamine a different neuromodulator taken alone or in conjunction with again i believe in separating these things out by product but you suppose you could take alpha p c and altiracine together if you had already try them separately in decide they worked well for you they decided combine them what people tend to experiences that the colinergic stimulation from alpha p c and the dopomenergic stimulation from all triazine or simply tyrosine alone or alpha p c alone leads to increase levels of focus without the con of overall feelings of stimulant based alertness that one would experience with fine and indeed or i should say of course there are products out there and there are people out there that combine all three of these things together warned alpha p c and altirasine a and while ism not suggesting that is a good or a bad thing i would suggests that any time you start to explore the cognitive enhancing effects and the focus enhancing effects of any supplement that you ask which ones are stimulant soferenc as fine and alpha himbiane which ones tend to tap moreinton demodulator systems alpha p c and altirasine and to separate those out conceptually because whereas things alpha o limbic in fine will mostly serve the roll of increasing levels of alertness but not tightening your focus things alpha p c and altirasine tend to serve the roll of less elevation and alertness but more tightening of focus and this of course is why people often stack these and take them in commination but thing it is o very important distinction that most people are not aware of and ism not here to tell you that the stimulant based approach or the demodulator based approach is better or worse they are simply different from one another although i will say that i think it is important to explore them separately if indeed youregong to explore any of them be for you would start to combine them in a single formula again individual ingredients ore going be the way to go interns a figuring out what is best for you if anything some people may find that even the slightest bit of canine or even the slightest bit of alpha p c real tracing just places them into a state of mind and or body that just uncomfortable and not compatible with the kind of work that they want to do whereas other people our to myself regularly rely on taking three hundred milligrams of alpha p c it turns out more than that and of does not work for me or or it tends to send my mine down a pathway that i do not to be in for a sake of convey work but i will routinely take three hundred milligrams of alpha p c prior to some connive work or prior to a work out i do often combine that with some canine not in capsid or oil form but rather in the form of cup of coffee or your borate and it turns out that for me just by way of example eltirasine o something that works very powerfully to elevate my level of focus but that i tend to crash pretty hard afterward and i tend to air away from eltirasene but some people tolerate it really well and actually really it i rely on something else for dopamine augmentation which is on female epilating which i the obit more short lasting again i arrived at these protocols for myself by mixing in matching but mostly by trying individual ingredients alone before dining them into any in a sort of cocktail before taking them before a work out or before a cognitive work bout and i suggest that you explore them in the same way because that is going to deliver you to the best possible protocols for you which only you can determine and then of course there is a category of supplements that can support cognitive function and focus but that also touch on other general functions related to brain and body half such as metabolic health mood et camera and the one that comes to mind here are the omega three fatiacids have talked a lot about a mama three fadiacids that are available in the form of foods thou for instance fatiocian fish on their certain plant base sources for these as well tern allies and things of that sort touch on this in the episodes on depression that have done but this topic mainly comes up around the issue of fish oil fish oil capsids and liquid and this is a discussion i think is worth having early on in the episode we talk about foundational nutrition and supplements that include a bunch of different ingredients we touch on the idea that some people might have the budget to take one such a product or any number of different products that combine all those ingredients i should say that for those that are interested in taking a supplement but have a lower budget than would allow for taking one of those a general categories of of supplements we talked about earlier for foundational nutrition that combines everything fitments minerals probation prubatics abdaptugens digestive ends on s i do think that there is a category of supplements that can greatly enhance the probability of offsetting depression and maybe even improve mood directly r indirectly there's evidence for what am about to tell you within the scientific literature and or offset the amount of into to present medication the people need to take that also been demonstrated and improve metabolic function party of vascular function and also enhance our ability to do focus work and here ism referring to the called mega three essential fatiacids an protrude the omega three form of the essential fatiacids there is now a lot of data showing that investing one to three grams of e p a in particular in the form of either visit of capsules or liquid can be beneficial for a number of different aspects of brain and body health and can enhance focus and cognaivability this is a specially true in developing brains and there's actually an extensive date out of a laboratory universe of californium manta barber talking about how mothers who supplement omega three is in particular the e p as although they also need to get the d a chi that leads to greater brainweights and health of offspring is something will defy explore in if couture episode likely with an expert guest who doing that work in that laboratory at you c santabarbara the point here is that if somebody has a limited budget to purchase supplements and cannot afford a foundational supplement and the sort that we take about earlier athletic greens or similar but they do have a budget that would allow them to purchase a high quality omega three fatiacid facial that and to invest it in quantity sufficient enough to get above that one gram of e p a per day again this is really important if you look at the product labels you'll often see fifteen hundred or sixteen hundred a milligrams of essential fatiacids but the key is you get above that one gram of e p a per day threshold than as highest three grams per day we had a guest on this podcast doctor rondo iatric who takes anywhere from i believe three of four maybe even more grahams of e p a per day for variety of reasons including some of the reasons were discussing now before we move on to discussing some of the more global themes related to developing a rational supplementation protocol i do want to touch on this vast category of supplementation that includes food based or food mimic type supplements this would be for instance way prolines a or milk prolines or egprotinese or plant prolines that is a discussion that in an of itself deserves an entire episode if you want understand which types of proline and source of prolines are going to be the most available the best for proline synthesis for recovery from exercise building muscle et camera it'd to refer you to a segment within the episode the did with doctor lane north where he talks about total proline needs per day it is a bout one graham per pound of bodyweight per day for most people although there some variation depending on activity et camera and the quality of sourcing of those various prolines is extremely important and that of course leads to a discussion about the quality and type of proline that would present in a supplement a way proline supplement are casino which is a milk proline base supplement that discussion is segmented in timestamped in the episode hi do with them you can finale supermen labor come the ashy pointed to some interesting data on potato proline as perhaps being a great plant base substitute for those that do not want to take abase proline but the fact that abase prolines can be very useful for getting too and above a proline threshold for all sorts of reasons not just muscle building although it is great for that but for other purposes as well and that is but one category of food based or food mimic type supplements there are for instance branch chinameno acids there are for instance green tea supplements there is a huge landscape of this far too much for us to get into in any kind of reasonable detail but i do on acknowledge that those all exist the anything to understand is that while they can serve a great roll in providing replacement for meals that you perhaps could not have consumed otherwise and while they often are very convenient because you can drink as suppose to eat your galleries i think that most people would agree that getting some significant fraction of nutrition from whole foods is going to be useful for a variety of reasons in particular the fire that comes along with it the bulk of the food that tends to make us feel sated and of course am the fact that a lot of fitments and minerals and other things that are contained within foods as well as essential fatiacids in foods animal base prolines are not going to be presides in most if not all of those can a food mimic type powders and replacements for food another point is this question about age related effects for instance should kids be taking supplements well i mention earlier that there some evidence that making sure that kids are getting enough o mama three fatiacids can be beneficial they certainly could get those from food base sources just look up on line food base sources of a megathere fadiacids and peas and you will see lists there some people choose to supplement on top of that a in particular in kids that are developing very quickly regardless of whether or not their consuming enough peas from food some parents choose to supplement on top of that i am personally not a fan of children taking melatonin for the reason that milestone is already chronically elevated in kids and there's a growing body of literature that milestone and supplementation in kids can be potentially harmful i soft want a create alarm among those who already been taking it or giving it to their kids or that gave it to their kids in the pass but i do think that melton in particular should be approached with a lot of caution especially for kids and then of course there is the issue of whether not all these other supplements that we have discuss whether or not kids can take them safely and again it is highly individual i would say y that for the supplements that relate to hormone augmentation and support unless your physician aboard certified eddy specifically recommends them i would strongly suggest avoiding intake of those things until at least after puberty and probably in to the lateens and early twenties because the body and brain are still developing and hormone systems are still active even though puberty may happen between ages eleven in fourteen or even fifteen puberty can be a long lasting event with a long taper and tail on it you onto be cautious about am augmenting hormones am in young people through the use of supplementation unless a physician is working very closely with you or rather you with them and then in ages of say twenty two years old twenty four and older i do not see any reason why people who are in their fifties or sixties would have any different protocols than people in their thirties and forties except perhaps in the domain of cognitive enhancement where it might make sense again might provided it can be done safely and with the consult of a physician it might be beneficial for people who are approaching their later years to consider increasing dosages or the variety of things and approaches that they take for cognitive enhancement because age read cognitive decline is a reality there is no person that escapes that the question is whether not the slope of that decline is very steep or very shallow and of course his is an opportunity for me to raise the point that i made much earlier and that it'll make over and over again because it really is the most important point to to days discussion which is that behaviors both exercise sleep making sure that your relationship to light getting sufficient sunlight early in the day and throughout the day if you can and limiting your viewing of bright artificial light in the late evening and e specially between the hours of ten am an for am things of that sort all the dues and do not and of course cardiovascular exercise and resistance training exercise and may bee flexibility training exercise topics were covered extensively on this podcast and for which we will soon have a special series erring with doctor and gain that gets into a lot of detail and protocol development that you can all employ all of that needs to be done at every age certainly passpuberty in order to maximize cognitive function in order to maximize party of vascular function in order to maximize focus and every aspect that we really all stand to and want to enhance when we think about supplementation again get your sleep right do that by getting your relationship to light right get your exercise right quality social connection right and then ofcorsers that landscape of nutrition the we talked about extensively earlier in for which we have other episodes that really dive deep including that episode or i should say in particular that episode with doctor lane north where we really took a full survey of the landscape of nutrition everything from propene needs sideman's minerals fiber microbiomits a deep deep discussion with a l to of action will take always if you're curious about nutrition and in particular to your a vegan or vegetarian or carnivore base but even for the more common omnivores such as myself i found that to be an incredible learning journey thanks to doctor lane north to much on useful knowledge in that episode if you want to learn more about nutrition the behavioral tools the nutritional tools are really going to serve as the primary to layers upon which your supplementation protocols are going to rest and again i want emphasize that your supplementation protocol may be zero supplements it could include no supplements whatsoever and that would be perfectly fine provided that yours sleeping as well as you want to a need to you are able to focus and work as well as you want to need to you are able to perform physically as well as you want to need to an you feel that your hormones and related functions are where you want them however for most people who are doing most everything right they want to explore how they can make things their sleep their focus there hormone function even better and that where supplementation makes a lot of sense and when i say makes a lot of sense i mean it makes a lot of sense to explore in a rational and regimented way their couple of big themes that we talked about a few times during to day's podcast to reiterate now because they are crucial to developing a rational supplementation protocol the most important of which is unless we are talking about foundational nutritional support that is coverage of sidemen minerals digestive enzymes robotics prebiatics and adaptions we should really be focusing on single ingredient formulations foundational supplements that include all those things i just listed off all combined in one supplement are fine i simply do not see any other practical or reasonable way to get each in every one of those things through single ingredient formulations however when you want a start thinking about and actually practically exploring as supplementation for sleep or form on health or cognifunction the single ingredient formulations are going give you the most power and control they are going to make sure that you can find the minimal effective doses that you can rule out things that are not effective for you or that may be detrimental for you in whatever fashion and it is not just about cost effectiveness it is also about a riving at small kits or cocktails of supplements that you can really manage in work with that you are not dependent on but that you really feel can augment the various aspects of your health that are important to you that is really what to day's episode is about even though we had coverage of specific supplements and their functions in these different domains of mental and physical health and performance to day's episode as really geared toward giving you resources and a frame work to think about how to approach supplementation how to navigate sticking points and pain points and supplementation how to get the most out of your supplementation regimen without spending an excessive amount of money and if you do not have finances to allow for a lot of exploration of supplements how to narrow in on the most effective supple ends the most quickly and derive all the benefits that you can from them and as a final point that is redundant with a few of the themes we talked about to day but that i do not think i ever really explicitly stated is that while the word supplement makes it sound these compounds a something just to add on too or compensate for deficiencies in nutrition or other areas of your life many of them are actually quite potent compounds these are potent non prescription molecules that really can move the needle in terms of durability to think more clearly sleep better support your hormone function but as always they are just one element within an ego system of other factors such as your behaviors which includes son dots such as your nutrition maybe even such as prescription drugs that you also might happen to be taking or hoping to be taking less of or ism removing completely again that has to be done in discussion with physicians if yore going to do it at all but the real point here is that what we call supplements are actually a powerful gear within a larger system aimed at each in every one of us customizing

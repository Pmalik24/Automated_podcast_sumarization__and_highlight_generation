welcome to the superman science sciencetaceto i major supermen and o professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day we are going to be discussing by polar disorder often called by polar depression by polar depression is a condition in which people undergo massive shifts in their energy their perception and their mood however it is very important to note that the shifts in mood energy and perception are all maladaptive they can often cause tremendous damage to the person suffering from by polar disorder and tremendous damage to the people in their lives today we are going to parse the biology that leads to the shifts in mood energy and perception and we are going to talk about the various treatments that exist some of those treatments have been around for a very long time and indeed one of those treatments lithium has an incredible back story about its discovery and in understanding how lithium works and some of the ways in which it does not work well it reveals a tremendous amount about how the brain works normally in all individuals that is a miraculous story that i look fora to sharing with you as we go forward in this discussion about by polar disorder one everyone to kep in mind that it is a very severe condition in fact people suffering from by polar disorder are at twenty to thirty times greater risk of suicide to day is a serious discussion and it certainly one in which people who are suffering from manic by polar disorder or who no people that are suffering for man an by polar disorder can benefit from however for those of you that might know people or who themselves suffer from major depression we will also be talking about important treatment developments for major depression major depression is a very common thing for many people in fact most people will suffer from depression of some sort at some point in their life although not necessarily a major depressive episode and yet major depression is very common you soon learn up to twenty per cent of people will suffer from major depression today is discussion will encompass all of that and it will also encompass basic brain mechanisms of negro plasticity the brainsability to change in response to experience both for good and for worse and you will learn a lot about the basic biology of how the bring regulates mood energy and perception before we dive into the discussion about man if by polar disorder i want a highlight some recent findings in an aria totally separate from mental health that i think are really important for everyone to know about this is a paper published in the journal sell which is a sell press journal and excellent journal infant one of the three apex journals for those of either curious papers published in the journal nature science and sell are considered the sort of superior standby cup and envy a championships of publision and this paper entitled an interurban neral circuit for appetite suppression illustrates a very important principle that i think everyone should know about and that is the principle of called parallel pathways parallel pathways as the name suggests are pathways they could be curl pathways or hormonal pathways ere otherwise that operate independently of one another to accomplish a common goal and what this paper really shows is that there is a set of peptides in the body and the peptide them referring to to day is called gel p one glucagon peptide one and some related peptides have talked about these on the podcast before for two reasons first of all i may big a proponent and consumer of carbamate carbamate is a t that can promote the release of glucagon peptide one and there are also new prescription drugs that are now hitting the market and for which there really impressive clinical trials for diabetes and obesity that are essentially glucagon peptide one stimulator they stimulate the release of that or they are in fact a synthetic version of glucagon peptide one what is glucagon peptide one it is a peptide which is a small little proline that can dramatically suppress appetite that is why these drugs are being explored and are showing quite impressive results for things treatment of type diabetes and other forms of diabetes as well as obesity they lead to weight loss now in terms of the carbamate stimulation of glucagon peptide one that is can to be a much lower amount of glucagon peptide one that is released from drinking carbamate as opposed to say taking a drug that stimulates gel p one or taken drug that is gel p one none the less should also point out that carbamate comes in a bunch of different forms there is some concern about certain smoky flavored forms of carbamate being carsonagenic that is why i avoid those forms of yerbamte but for me carbamate is one of the preferred sources of canine for me i likethwate taste it does provide that sort of cabin kick that i to have early in the day for focus and for work and for exercise and yet i actively avoid the smoked varieties of carbamate because of the potential carsonagenic effects of the smoked varieties glucagon peptide one as i mention earlier can suppress appetite but what this paper shows is it does that by at least to mechanisms through parallel pathways what this paper shows is that glucagon peptide one action receptors in the body in a portion of the nervous system called the enteric nervous system e and t e a icy an ceric nervous system this is a compose of your nervous system that you do not really have control over its autonomic or automatic grope one binds to what are called intestinofugal enteric neurons you do not need to know the name but those neurons do two things first of all they causesome gut distension they actually make you feel full this is incredible rite a peptide not actual physical food but a peptide that stimulates neurons that cause changes in the called merchant receptors of the gut of the interim nervous system and make people feel full it can lead to actually mild or i suppose if levels of grope one are very high to major gut distension i i think that the levels of goop one that would come from drinking your hamate and hopefully from appropriate damaging of the synthetic forms of goop one or drugs that stimulate grope one would cause mild not major got distension cause major got distension would be uncomfortable go p one is acting the level of gut to increase got distension and by way of a pathway that goes from the gut up to the hypothalamus this low cluster of neurons about the size of a marble that sits above the rumor your mouth is also suppressing appetite through brain mechanisms this is really beautiful right you have a petite a small little proline that is released in the gut and that release within the gut causes got distension which makes you feel full and by way of neral stimulation of the hypothalamus also activates neral pathways within the brain that trigger satiny the feeling of having had enough food to me got one is both impressive and important why because the recent category of drugs that is now hitting the market seems to a just obisior can help people with weight loss in order to help their health and it is doing by at least two mechanisms one is within the brain and the other is within the gut and communication through the called got brain acts because again these entercnerons are communicating to the brain the hypothalamus by way of this what is called the sympathy pastor spinal reticular hypothalamic pathway you absolve do not need to know all of that that is a mouthful that is enough to make your mouthful distended but at the same time things carbamate and ism sure there a other compounds out there is well but certainly carbamate can stimulate the release of goop one for those of you that are looking for some mild appetite suppression and want to accomplish that while also investing machine your hamate might be a good option for that and just know that it is operating through two mechanisms on the body through mouth got distension to make you feel full and on the brain you increase tetidior make you feel less hungry and then for everybody not just those that are interested in appetite suppression i think it is important to understand that these parallel pathways are fundamental to how we are organized another good example this would be when we are excited by something positive or negative to be stressful or were positively aroused there is a parallel activation of repiner and a adrenaline both from your adrenals and from an are in the brain called the locus cerulius again and again we see this in biology and in narrow science that your brain in your body are acting in concert there acting together through mechanisms that either are independent separately in the brain and separately in the body but directed towards a common goal or through communication between brain and body and almost always that communication is going to be by directional body to brain and brain to body i think these results are really interesting and really important for sake of weight loss for sake of appetite suppression and just generally for the way that they illustrate this very important theme of the way that we are constructed at a biological level which is parallel pathways before we begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate for my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my destroy effort to bring zero cost consumer information about science and sizes related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens athletic greens is an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athletic greens once or twice o day is that t helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which our vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called got microfilm and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essential with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens i get the vitamins i need the minerals i need and the phobics to support my microfilm if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock come slash

function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium and potassium present in the preparation all of those cells function properly and all our bodily system can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and of hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the

again if you want a try element you can go to element element dot come slash supermen let us talk about by polar disorder and today ism going to refer to by polar disorder interchangeably with bipolar depression although as you will soon learn not every one with by polar disorder necessarily goes through highs and lows there is a subset of people who suffer from by polar disorder who experience the manic phases the highly elevated mood and energy and then drop down to called base line they do not necessarily go down into a depressive state they often will return to a somewhat normal state in fact we will talk about the percentage of time that people by polar disorder tend to be symptom free manic or depressed in the contacts of the different categories of by polar disorder but as we weighed into this topic that is by polar disorder on give you little bit of the background statistics to anchor us in just how serious and prevalent by polar disorder is by polar disorder impacts about one per cent of people that might seem a small percentage yo you thing about a room of a hundred people that means that at least one of them is very likely to have by polar disorder and as i mentioned earlier in the introduction by popular disorder is very serious it has a twenty to thirty per cent greater incidents of suicide than the general population which is first of all extremely tragic and extremely concerning any one that thinks they might have by polar disorder or who know some one with bipolar disorder should be especially vigilant about this and will talk about some of the on or signs and risk factors age of on set at camera as we move forward one percent of people have by polar disorder the typical age of onset is anywhere from twenty to twenty five years old although it can be much earlier and the earlier the onset of a by polar episode which we will define in a few minutes the earlier the onset of that episode the higher likelihood that the by polar disorder s going to be a stable feature of that persons psychology going feared and yet i also want to point out that there are some very good treatments for by polar disorder that those people could still benefit from there are basically two kinds of by polar disorder referred to as by polar one and by polar too let us just talk about by polar one first by polar one is characterized by a fairly extended period of mania what is mania manias a period of very elevated mood energy intractability impulsivity and some other symptomatology that will talk about going forward but this manic episode is extreme this is a condition in which the energy lift the mood lift and the order impulsivity and actions in words of the person suffering for man by polar disorder are very noticeable and very extreme now a key thing however is that it is not always noticeable to the person suffering from it that they are in this mode sometimes they recognize that sometimes they do not but it is always highly recognizable to other people that the person suffering for manic by play disorder is not other people let us talk about b i popular one in a obit more depth one of the key clinical criteria or diagnostic criteria for by polar one is that a person suffer from these manic episodes or display these manic episodes for seven days or more that turns out to be very key the stability of that manic episode for seven days or more turns out to be very important and for those seven days the person is in an elevated mood expansive thought all day every day for those several days now there are lot of reasons why somebody could be in a manic mode it does not necessarily mean that somebody has by polar disorder in fact some one could be in a manic mode for seven days or more and still not be diagnosed with by polar disorder why well there are other things that can create manic episodes things dramatic brain injury things seizure things various prescription drugs or elicit drugs things emphedemine and cocaine that is not the same as by polar disorder even though from a symptomatology perspective they might look even identical let us think about these symptoms and the diagnostic criteria that a psychiatric would use in order to ask whether not someone is manic because they have manic by pillar disorder or whether not that person is manic for some other reason such as dramatic brain injurealis at drugs et camera typically a person would be brought into a clinic or a person would bring themselves to a clinic or meet with the psychiatric it seems more likely that they would be directed toward a psychiatrists because oftentimes people who are in a manic episode just simply will not have the perspective where the foresight to bring themselves into the clinic and the psychiatric is going to start to a valuate for a couple of different things but first of all what their going to try and figure out is whether not the person has at least three of the following symptoms the first symptom is intractability is the person distractablar they going from one thing to the next people who rein a manic episode will e talking about a pen and then they will be talking about something they saw the other day and then somethingthey want a purchase and the a place that can a travel to et camera but they are also very prone to any stimulus within the room meaning a bell could go off for thy cut be sound out the holy an the orient to that and then the orient to the cognition and then their orient something in their pocket there they are all over the place you could think of this a little bit eighty eighty or attention dephisite disorder but it is very extreme highly intractable highly impulsive impulsivity relates to actions the person my be fidgeting with something and then they might try and leave the room or om the person might if they were out in the real world somebody might notice that the person is going an purchasing multiples of something that would be unusual for someone to purchase soferancs as i happen to know some one whose a expose had by dollar disorder and their expose went out and bought ten plus air friars right i mean i think unless your restaurant that is using a lot of air friars the idea that you would need more than one or two air fries om might just seem a little bit out of the norm and that impulsivity can be it purchasing it can be on other things as well con be booking no twelve international trips in one afternoon or going in buying three cars et camera impulsivity the other is grandiosity people who have man by polar disorder who are in a manic episode will often display words of or actions of grandiosity and keep in mind these are not lies in the sense that the person is in lying in order to trying pull one over on anybody these are actual beliefs that the person comes to have about their grandiose position in the world or grandiose opportunities or potential in the world typical forms of grandiosity and manic episodes would be that the person suddenly decides that they are going to into pulpit surprise a they are the person selected to win a police surprised token or right a novel that afternoon and there can a winipolit surprise that year which is for less a delusion of grandeur right the idea that some one could do that in one afternoon i suppose it is possible in the realm of all possibilities but its extremely unlikely other forms of grandiosity that often present themselves in people suffering from a manic episode would be that there gan a run for president or that they are the person that they believe is selected by the citizens of a given country or by the universe to be the president of that country or to be present of the universe right it sounds ridiculous but those sorts of delusions of grandiosity a one condition that often presents itself or one set of symptoms that presents itself flight of ideas are also typical of manic episodes this is a obit intractability but this would be people talking extensively about one thing and then switching and talking extensively about something else would be as if i was doing this podcast talkingabout manic by dollar disorder than suddenly switching to idea and then to deliberate cold exposure and then to o the roll of sugar and its impact on the brain at camera essentially a random selection of the different topics that exist in science all of which i happen to be very interested in and curious about but just as we have episodes of the podcast that are about one or two topics and we focus on those in a fairly narrow trench of discussion somebody who has a flight of ideas would be jumping between categories and topics a in a kind of pseudo random way they might take off down a path of one thing and then switch to another without any transition or with transitions that that do not have any logical structure to them the other aspect of man if by pillar disorder that often presents itself in the manic episodes are agitation people feeling extremely physically agitated lot of shaking and moving about on this can venture into the realm of paranoia but a lot of agitation a difficulty sitting down and being still a difficulty and just looking feeling and acting calm and then another condition is no sleep and when i say no sleep i mean no sleep or very minimal see up as incredible as it sounds people who are in a manic episode can often go seven days or more with zero sleep and a key feature of this zero sleep is that they are not troubled by it they are not think sing oh ism suffering from insomnia i really really want to sleep sometimes that is the case but more often than not they are simply not sleeping their staying up twenty four hours than another twenty four hours at just continues from entire week again inconceivable to those of us that do not suffer from manic episodes can only imagine how pulled apart most of us would feel under those conditions and yet they are just going and going and going with no sleep up all hours shopping talking running doing all sorts of different things in the categories of other symptoms the we talked about before and it does not bother them that they are not sleeping and then the last sort of category of symptoms that the psychotrisis a valuating for and seeing if they present is rapid pressured speech the rapid pressured speech is something that when you hear it you recognize that this is somebody tat most seems to be hitting you a speech machine done fire it is coming at you coming out you coming at you and there really no room for conversation they're not offering any opportunity for a back and forth or if there is a back and further might ask you how you feel about something than you start well they we then then come to the then then they gan a hit you with another berate or a paragraph of of information or of of just speech that pseudo random we have got intractability impulsivity grandiosity flight of ideas agitation no sleep and rapid pressured speech for some one to be diagnosed as in a manic episode they do not have to be engaging in or displaying all of those symptoms they do however need to present at least three of those symptoms and then in order to meet the condition of bipolar one they have to be presenting those three symptoms for at least seven days it could be longer but at least seven days now this seems pretty straightforward right at one level the way to i describe this in the way that it exist in the clinical picture you could think well this should be pretty easy to diagnose and yet there is a complication there are a challenge there because the psychactris again has to determine that these manic episodes are not due to something other then by polar disorder for instance again it could be tube we dramatic brain injury could be seizures or mess or other sorts of drugs critical steroids which are often prescribe for a number of immune conditions or for wound healing can also cause manic episodes they have to determine that everything that is happening meets the creature i described before three out of seven of these symptom categories for seven days or more and that it cannot be better explained by something else going on in that persons life or immediate medical history that is very important now the other challenge and this is something that is can to come up again and again today not just in the description of the biology of bipolar disorder but also the description of different treatments i n treatment approaches is that typically when somebody is sitting in front of a psychiatrist in particular for the first time those two people are interacting the psychiatric is just getting one snap shot of the person at that moment i said the person could be on day one of a manic episode the person might be on day six of a manic episode the person could be transitioning out of a manic episode or the person could be suffering from a commination of manic episode where because of the impulsivity by polar disorder they went out and used e least drugs they also used cocaine the psychiatric has a serious challenge the psychiatric has to determine based on a conversation right the assistant a blood test this is not a measurement thy can take on a scale or with a bile marker they have to use language a conversation with somebody who by all accounts as pretty impaired at conversation to determine whether or not their suffering from a manic episode that is the consequence of by polar disorder you can imagine this in the real world as somebody says well how long has it been since you slept and the person starts to answer oh the other day i went down to the the basement i was gin an get something out of the the refrigerator i thought i might take a nap and then all send there talking about something completely different they might not even have an anode the psychiatric has to be a really good detective a benevolent detective but a detective none the less in determining whether or not these symptoms have existed for seven days or more and whether not they meet the it least three could be more but at least three of the criteria of symptom categories i talked about before now assuming that they do assuming that the patient meets those criteria they are likely to be diagnose with bipolar one now bipolar one disorder means there having these extended manic episode seven days or more but it does not necessarily mean that they are dropping into a depressive episode as well this is a common is conception about by polar disorder because as it is often called by polar disorder is referred to as by polar depression and yet many people with by polar disorder do not necessarily experience the deep depressive episodes many of them do but many of them do not somebody can truly be diagnose accurately with by polar one even though their only experiencing manic episodes and then dropping down to baseline manic episode than dropping down to baseline that is very important t understand now the second category of by polar disorder is by polar too be p too or by polar disorder too is somewhat different than by polar disorder one first of all it is characterized most often by the presence of both manic episodes mania and depressive episodes or what is referred to as hypomania now any time in biology or in medicine you hear hypo is the opposite of my mirror one were got normal hyper and hypo hypomania is a somewhat suppressed level of mania this is not going to be as extreme as the mania that we typically think of and yet the hypo can be due to the duration not the intensity of mania that is right hypomania can mean a lessened intensity of mania but it can also be used to refer to a shorter duration of mania in fact that is one of the key criteria for by polar two by polar two is often diagnosed on the basis of the presence of manic episodes that are lasting four days or even less some one with b p two might have four days of this increased energy older acted activity their irritable their euphoric they are not sleeping et camera but it is only lasting for about four days or they could be having longer extended periods of mania but they are hypo manic episodes they're not quite as intent the pressured speech is in quite as pressured the impulsivity is not quite as severe et camera et camera the other aspect of by polar two is one that i a mention briefly a moment ago which is that it is often associated with the drops into the depressive episode people are going from manic episodes for four days or less than their dropping into a depression going back to normal manic again i do want to point out however that people who have by polar one can indeed go from manic episodes to severe what we call major depression they can oscillate a sign wave really hyghiges really low loads ain very important to understand in terms of understanding both by polar one and by polar to is that it is not always a sign wave this is really important in in something that a frankly i did not know until i start researching the ps episode and talking to some psychiatric p i should mention have talk to several bortcertified pcsychitris in preparation for this episode it'll give some references to them and infant some of them are going to be coming on the podcast as guess in the future for more inept discussion about by polar and other a psychiatric disorders but all the psychiatric i spoke to confirmed what the other was saying which was that the way that by polar disorder can present can very tremendously between individuals one person might go from very hi hides that last seven days or more to very low lows bouts of depression major depression that collect two weeks or more other people are rapid cycling by way of yo three days manic three days normal three days man and then dropping into three days depression you want tho race that picture in your mind that manic by polar disorder is this sign wave this cycling up and down between mania and depression it can take a lot of different forms and again this is a serious challenge for the psychiatric to diagnose people because of that fact that their only getting a snap shot of the person unless they known them for some time in a working with them for some time but this is also especially important for those of you that either have by polar depression or suspect that you might or that no some one with by polar depression or suspect somebody might have by polar depression a c by play disorder because if you are noticing that somebody is very manic and then normal well that is a very different picture than somebody who is going from very manic to very deep bouts of depression the very manic to deep bouts of depression is easier to recognize because of the extremes of those highs and lots now this might seem somewhat obvious to all of you as i describe it and yet it is very important as a frankly a citizen of the planet who knows other human beings to keep an eye out for these manic episodes because again whether not its four days or last or whether not at seven days or more these manic episodes really are the the defining criteria of by polar disorder a c by polar depression there are couple other key features about by polar one and by polar two that can allow us to get better inside into whether not somebody has by polar one or by polar to and that is the per centare of time that people with by polar one verses by polar to spend in a manic state a depressed state or a symptom free state this is also important to discuss because it turns out that people with genuine diagnose by polar one or by dollar two are often symptom free which again can make it difficult for a says people that know them or for people that are treating people with by polar disorder to identify whether not somebody is in a manic episode or depressive episode r whether not they are headed into a manic or depressive episode the numbers on this have been studied from a paper actually two papers a first author judo j u d d at all published of some years ago twenty years ago but the day to hold up really nicely over time is were both publishing of journal america medical association psychiatry dogma psychiatry i superb journal and thistly people who have by polar one on average spend about fifty per cents shy fifty three per cent was tat was the number that was eventually converse upon but about fifty per cent of their time symptom free that is interesting right somebody who has genuine by polar one disorder can spend as much as half of their life symptom free sleeping normally speaking normally et camera about thirty two per cent of the time depressed and when we say depress we mean major depression severe challenges with waking up at two or three in the morning and having trouble falling back o sleep that is one of the defining characteristics of depression or sleeping far too much having hard time getting out of bed in the morning suppressed piso a suppress libido suppress motivation all the general symptoms of major depression which will talk about lo bit more later and in an upcoming episode about major depression in particular and then about fifteen per cent of their time in this kind of manic state or mixed manic state where they are showing long against seven days or more bouts of sleeplessness irritability pressured speech grandiosity et camera contrast that with peoplewho have by poor to disorder who are spending about half of their time in a depressed state that is interesting people would by polar to disorder while not always displaying depressed states or oscillations between maniac hypomania and depress states they tend to be in the dear less state more often and again this is major depression this sin just a little bit of a low this is a serious depression of their nervous system their mood and as we say their affect their outlook on life and that is one of the key distinguishing features of major depression is that people's outlook on life becomes very diminished in the sent that they do not see a future you asked them about how is work going how relationships on it is not just that they feel that that is going poorly they really feel as if there is no opportunity for those things to improve those people would by polar too tend to be symptom free about forty five per cent the time again that these are averages about forty five per cent of the time it is considerable mount of the time and they tend to be in the hypomania states only about four or five per cent of the time again the grocery for be pe two by polar too is these four days or less of mania or hypomania but only four per cent of the time or five per cent the time is a small enough sliver of the pi that is these people's existence that you could imagine why it would be easy for them or other people to overlook the fact that they have by poor disorder and not major depression think about it this is a person who or i should a collection people who are spending but half of their time depressed close to half forty five per cent there time symptom free and then about five per cent if their time in a hypomania state either shortened bouts of a high intensity mania or hypo mania that is of reduced intensity one of thereasons that i mention these per centares of time spent in a symptom free depressed manic or hypomania state is because one of my major rolls for to day's episode is that it will increase awareness of whether not you or somebody could be to worker could be family member et camera might be suffering from by polar one or by polar two i think it is fair to say that if somebody is suffering from by polar one that is likely to be revealed or to reveal itself be four too long because of the fact that people have these extended periods of maniac mania such an extreme state not just for the person whose experiencing it but the way that it presents such a extreme and out of the ordinary but by polar too you can imagine could really duck under the had are of our awareness and you could imagine that we might just think somebody is low or depressed especially that per contents the self medicate with alcohol or other substances we might think out whether drinking more than often t more than usual souse me or there spending more time alone and isolating but then when there their hypomania state that might actually present as normal to us because they were in such a depress state before it is very important that we dial up our awareness t we cave tumor antenna to the possibility that people out there who might appear depressed or that we have not heard from i an while might actually be suffering from by polar to disorder before we move into a inept discussion about the different kinds of treatments for by polar disorder to touch on just a few additional aspects of what bipolar disorder can do in terms of its negative c sequences and also talk about some of the inherited risk that is the genetic factors and the environmental factors that can con tribute to by polar disorder in terms of the the burden the the very real emotional and occupational and educational burden that can occur for somebody with by play disorder that is actually ben study there's a measure of this it is called global burden which is defined as the years lost in engaging a normal life due to some disability that disability could be cancer that disability in this cases by polar disorder and basically the way this sort of study is done is that through question airs i should they quite in depth questioners there is a probing for whether not somebody has lost to consecutive weeks or more of interest in normal activities now for people who have depression that is a kind of straightforward thing to a drassright of you as somebody when was last time you age or when was he last time that you when a few days without food or lost interest in in relationships or work or sex or things that sort and they answer and you can figure out the amount of time that the essentially been withdrawn from normal levels of activity for them with by polar disorder what it turns out is that the global burden of having by polar one and even by polar to is massive in fact having by polar disorder sits as one of the highest risk factors for being in the top ten of all categories of disabilities leading to global burden put in plain english what that means is having by polar one or by polar do disorder is extremely debilitating it really slows down one's life trajectory unless its treated properly now the other aspect of by polar disorder is its heritability and this gets into a little bit of some tricky science related to inheritability verses the genetic contribution of a given disease that might sound the same thing you think of a genes relate to heritability heritability relates to genes but of course everything about the way they nervous system works and functions and expresses itself healthy or otherwise is an interaction between our gens and our environment and typically the way these studies are done is you address what is the risk of somebody having a given condition in the general population we talked about that before by polar disorders a a one per cent of the world's population compare that to people who have only major depression this would be repeated bouts of two weeks are more of serious depression not just low mood or something due to a life lost but major depression which is ten to seventeen per cent of people have major depression ora they they suffer from major depressive disorder compared to by polar disorder which again is one per cent now you can address how much of the one per cent of by polar disorder that exists is due to genes verses environment in a somewhat exact way this is never in exact science and the way that this is typically done is to look at concordance that is the likelihood that two identical twins will both have a given condition as opposed to to fraternal twins which have if more different genes than identical twins of course and than two siblings who have similar genes of course but less similar than identical of fraternal twins and on and forth we basely do is you valuate the probability that two people in the general population who are completely on related will have the same condition verses two people in the in the general population who are very related identical twins and what you find is that in identical twins if one identical twin has true major depression or major depressive disorder there is a twenty to forty five per cent chance that their identical twin will also have major depressive disorder now that tells you right there that it cannot all be genes that is not a gene for major depression per say or if it is a gene that what a collection of genes that those genes are also subject to environmental influences either prenatal within the womb or after children are born now the large range there of twenty to forty five per cent could be the to any number of things it could be experimental meaning the techniques that were used in experiments it could be due to a regional differences mi if one part of the world verse another a lot of different factors a right now we probably ton delvintall shout at some point will probably do an episode all about the genetics of nervous system heritability and heritability of features in mental health et camera but we can compare major depression and the heritability or the genetic concordant between identical twins in major depression by polar disorder and ask if one twin of an identical twin pair has m by polar depression what is the likelihood that the other twin will have it and t turns out that number is much higher its forty to seventy per cent likelihood or probability that if one twin has by polar disorder that their identical twin will also have by poor disorder again the total incidents of by polar distort in the general population is much lower than it is for major depressions one per cent for by polar verses ten to seventeen per cent for major depression but the genetic component is much higher forty to seventy per cent for by polar disorder verses twenty to forty five per cent for major depression a know m throwing a lot of numbers a out there a but basically what this means is that researches have been able to take those numbers and filter them through a number of different risk factors that are related to early development ask questions if two twins were raised separately or together or in one part of the world verses another or hat a two parent household verses one parent household you no i value it a lot of different variables but they were able to discover and this has ben shown again and again is that the genetic contribution to by polar disorder is very very high the at is the heritability of by polar disorder is eighty five per cent case again i want to be really clear what this means the total occurrence in the general population fairly low still serious one per cent but fairly low compared to other things major depression however if some one has by polar disorder it is very likely that they inherited some gene or sets of genes or more accurately a susceptibility within their genes to environmental influences that can trigger by polar disorder there a lot of different ways to discuss and to conceptualize heritability i one to be very careful with the way that ism wording this what this means is that people with by polar disorder very likely have a gene or more typically its going to be a set of genes that creates a susceptibility for by polar disorder to present itself now what environmental factors trigger or increase that susceptibility is not entirely clear this always seems to center back on to the same sets of things early life stress tram at camera certainly those are going to exacerbate the likelihood that someone who has a genetic propensity for by polar disorder will express that by polar disorder in its full array of symtomology but eighty five per cent while very very high is not one hundred per cent again eighty five per cent while a very high number for heritability is not one hundred percent what that means is that there is no single gene or identify gene cluster for by polar disorder the reason i keep drilling into this over n over is that i think we can confidently say that if some one has by polar disorder that there was something in their genetic lineage that led to that or that very likely led to that and yet it is not i color or some other physical feature which we can actually due the the direct sit is call mendellian genetics and figure out whether or not somebody directly inherited that gene from one parent or the other parent the take away here is that if you have an certainly identical twin or fraternal twin or a sibling or apparent or even a cousin or an uncle that has by polar disorder in particular by polar one well then union to be on the lookout for by polar disorder perhaps in yourself and for the family members of that person my go within this episode up until now has been to provide a clear and detail picture of by polar disorder and its various forms before we start to talk about treatments for by polar disorder and some of the neural circuit basis for by polar disorder wont to make sure that i distinguish by polar disorder from border line personality disorder we will do in entire episode or may be even several episodes about borderline personality disorder borderline personality disorder can indeed present itself in ways that resemble by polar disorder entice offers but there some key distinctions that need to be made because it turns out that by polar disorder and borderline personality disorder are quite distinct in terms of their defining criteria the key distinction between somebody with borderline personality disorder and by polar disorder is that in borderline personality disorder there can be episodes that can resemble mania or hypomania periods of flights of ideas or where people are spending money excessively or are sexually promiscuous in ways that seem manic or could even be a little ate manic or a lot manic and yet more often than not there is an environmental trigger for those manic episodes that is distinctly different from by polar disorder where the person will have manic episodes without any need for a trigger there does not need to be a call from some one saying hey let us go on vacation together or there something coming up this fridge that is really exciting or lets enter a relationship together of one form or another the person with by polar disorder will have episodes of mania or episodes of major depression without any need for an external stimulus or environmental trigger but the person with borderline personality disorder almost always again there is never an always in ability and psychiatry but almost always is going to exhibit flights of mania or depressive episodes or other types of mood ships that are dramatic and maladaptive in response to things that are coming in through the external environments or relationships of some kind in fact one of the defining characteristics of borderline personality disorder is the thing that is referred to as splitting a good example of splitting in the person with borderline personality disorder is that they will feel that they absolutely adore you and want to spend all their time with you and just think the world of you you can do no wrong in in fact they genuinely can feel that way and can genuinely think that way about you and then for whatever reason it could be a perception of something that you did or something that you said or suspicion that your thinking something about them they can suddenly shift or split their emotions and what is called move you from a good object or a can do no wrong object to a bad object they will suddenly decide that you are cheating on them or that you are bemean to them or that you are insulting them or that something that you are doing is in violation to their self worth their well being et camera and that can send them down a pathway of being very angry very depressed at camera as the describe the contour of a person with borderline personality disorder as somebody who splits very suddenly in response to some environmental trigger real or perceived there is the risk of course that it makes the person with borderline personalities order sound a bad person that their very volatile and while they can be volatile i want to be very careful to point out that the person with borderline personality disorder is also suffering in this contact while those sorts of relationship ps with people with borderline personality disorder whether not their romantic relations or familial or coworkers et camera can be very challenge can be very high friction because of the good object bad object shifts at camera it is by directional meaning the person with borderline personality disorder as you can imagine is also going through a lot of suffering at one moment they feel as if someone is wonderful and can do no wrong to them and they want to be strongly affiliated with them and then in the next moment they feel as if that person is attacking them through their actions or even through their non actions again we will return to borderline personality disorder in a separate episode it is a serious disorder both for the person that has it and for people around them fortunately there are some emerging treatments that are showing promise and it is a fairly common disorder but important that we distinguish borderline personality disorder from by polar disorder mostly on the basis of this need for a trigger again in by polar disorder there is no need for a trigger to create a manic episode or major depressive episode they just happen were they can just happen whereas in borderline personality is disorder almost always there is an external trigger or a perception that something happened in the environment or that somebody is behaving a certain way that dramatically shifts the person with borderline personality disorder from one mode to the next as we move into our discussion about the treatments for and curl circuits underlying by polar disorder i wanted just nail down one more key point this is a very brief point but it is perhaps the most in portent point which is the hides and lows or we should say the hives these manic episodes and sometimes loads cause again not everybody with by polar disorder one or two suffers from depressive episodes sometimes yes sometimes no in particular by polar too yes but people with by polar one can have extreme manic episodes and then just return to normal as you recall well those extreme lows and or extreme hides of people with by polar disorder impact their lives in very negative ways this is essential and it is something that we are going to return to a little but later when we talk about their relationship between by polar disorder and creativity because it turns out that there is a quite strong association there one that would almost leads you to believe that being by polar can be beneficial and certain contacts and yet on whole having by polar disorder is extremely detrimental and challenging to the persons suffering from it and it something that we want to keep in mind as we think about treatments and the underline biology now id to talk about some of the treatments for by polar disorder and in the discussion of those treatments there is an absolutely incredible history of the discovery of one particular treatment that still shows great success in many patients although some people cannot take it for reasons that will talk about and in the description of the discovery of this treatment for by polar disorder it also reveals to us that sometimes treatments come to the profession of medicine and through science in ways that precede the discovery of the underlying biology that is right every once in a while some one will discover a treatment for disease without any understanding about the underlying biological basis of that disease and in fact that is the case for by polar disorder and the treatment that we are referring to is lithium lithium as some of is on the periodic table of elements it is indeed a naturally occurring substance it actually arrived on earth by way of star dust yes we are talking about star dust on this podcast but if you to learn more about the origins of lithium and how lithium arrived here on earth for its discovery and applications in psychiatry there is a beautiful talk that exists on you token will provide a linkthis in the shoot captions the describes the history of lithium in terms of its interplanetary travels and arrival on earth this as my tack delivered by a physicist whose expert in quant mechanics and is expert in lithium and it is a just wonderful talk that i can refer you to less on the biologist that talk but certainly a lot about lithium as an elements of for those of nerves me that love to know how things came to be here on the planet in one former another all ensure you to take a brief listen to that talk we are going to discuss lithium in the contacts of its applications for treatment of by polar disorder n the discovery of lithium as a treatment for by polar disorder is truly a miraculous story that i think everyone should know the key player in this story is a physician by the lasting ked he was an australia physician and had has a very interesting story in his own right made was an australia psychiatrist or australia psychiatrist who also was a soldier and during world war to after the fall of single port o japan he became a prisoner of war and he was a prisoner of war from nineteen forty two until nineteen forty five he had some time for observation and during his imprisonment he observed some of his fellow images as going through pretty wild vacillations in mood and energy essentially going from manic episodes to depressed episodes or from manic to normal episodes and for one reason or another we do not know why because i can't find any report is to why he hypothesized this but he hypothesized that there was some build up of some chemical in these people's brains that then they would urinate out and that urinating out of whatever chemical was in there would allow them to be more relaxed than not manic in other words made hypothesized that there is a build up of chemical in certain people's brains that makes the manic and they urinate that chemical out eventually he got out of this prison as we as we mention in nineteen forty five and he started doing experiments in addition to being patients in his clinical what he did is he started to take urine from people who exhibited mana and urge from people who were not manic and he took that urine and he would inject it into guinea pigs as an experimental model and his general observation was that there was something in the urine that was indeed making the guinea pigs more manic if they were injected with urine from a manic patient the exact measures that he was taking these guinea pigs was not exactly clear this is at it time or in urine science when he could a this sort of report things aliment more subjectively although there were still numbers and statistics toilet more of a was studies and and descriptions but turns out that even though that all seems a love but loose it led to some incredible and still important a discoveries fir psychiatric health what he figured out was that the urine from manic patient seemed to be more toxic for these guinea pigs and he also knew that there are two toxic substances in urine eureka and uric acid he was able to separate the urea and uric acid from people with mana and patients that did not have mania and he figured out that the urea was the same in both these mentally man patients and the nomadic patients it did not seem that urea was the compound that was creating these manic episodes or related to manic episodes or held the toxicity instead he focused on the uric acid now in order to put the uric acid into solution that he could inject it into these guinea pigs he had to try number of different compounds in order to diluted it just happens that and schemes will be familiar with this but there is certain things that just do not go into solution easily you put the powder in a a vile you had some water or a saline or another solution mix it up in the powder stayed suspended in there just dozen it dozen actually a ever become a clear liquid that you can inject in order to try injecting different strains of uric acid he ended up using lithium to assist in the dilution and lithium worked what he basically was doing again for schemes sis he was taking uric acid he was adding lithium and making a solution of lithium rate this is a lot of details but this is important because what he eventually found is that when he deluded the uric acid with lithium an created lithium rate lithium rate could actually calm down these guinea pigs that were injected with the toxicurea he also found that lithium urge had a generally calming effect on these guinea pigs now we are really often crazy territory i were talking about urine from patients that separating out urea and uric acid were adding lithium to the uric acid were injecting this in the guinea pigs is getting pretty wild and pretty weird but this is medicine and from time to time this is medicine and science cade was a good scientist in addition to being a good physician and by good scientists i mean that he did control experiments here he was injecting lithium rate into animals and began effect but he knew that that solution of lithium rate contained racist the arc acid but it also contained lithium and he quite appropriately asked may be the lithium alone is having this calming effect on these guinea pigs and indeed that was the case when he did the proper control experiment and injected only lithium solution into these guinea pigs they calm down from there he in sort of nineteen forty style medicine of this would not happen now he very quickly moved from that animal model into human patients and started injecting human patients with lithium or providing lithium only to those patients and lowland behold found an absolutely profound and positive effect of lithium in reducing symptoms of mania and as all good physician sinned misdo he wrote up his results and he wrote it up in a paper entitled lithium faults in the treatment of psychotic excitement at back than that din call it mania they call it psychotic excitement this is a paper that was published september third nineteen forty nine in the medical journal of australia we will provide a link to this study is now a classic study in the field of psychiatry it is a really wonderful paper to read and actually i encourage people even if your not a scientist or cognition to just take a quick look at the second page in this paper that were made available to you where he describes each of the various case studies or the individuals that he looked at am ism not on to readthese in detail now cause it would take a lot of unnecessary time but things am case seven m c aged forty years old re suffering from medic recurrent maniac this episode he been excited restless and violent for over two months and was interfering often that had be confined to a single room during the day writes this is very debilitating what we now know to be by polar depression a he commence taking lithium citrate twenty grains that is a a measure of of the amount of lithium three times a day in four days he was distinctly quieter and by february thirteenth nineteen forty nine appeared practically normal he continued well and on february twentieth nineteen forty nine that dose of citrate was reduced to ten grains et center et camera he left the hospital there are numerous descriptions of this sort within this paper including some descriptions of patients that did not see such success and including some descriptions of patients that suffered from some negative side effects that is important point out as well but is an absolutely wonderful paper and it is an absolutely wonderful voyage into the history of psychiatry write down to the discussion where in just three short paragraphs cade really lays out the case for why lithium is such a important discovery in the treatment of what at that time they were calling psychotic excitement in what we now know to be managed by polar depression lithium i should mention has a number of important features but it also a number of important side effects that need to be considered first of all it does have a certain toxicity and levels of lithium in the blood need to be money extremely carefully it is not the sort of thing that people can just take it a given dose and every patient responds the same there is a lot of oversight in a lot of blood tests that have to be done especially in the first three months of lithium treatment i should mention that lithium treatment is still used to some great degree of success in many not all people suffering but from by polar depression or by polar disorder rather but there a number of important things that happened between nineteen forty nine and present day that prevented lithium from reaching patients that really needed it and that all can be summarized in two or three short sentences basically by virtue of the fact that lithium is a naturally occurring element it could not be patented and as a consequence of that there was not a lot of potential profit for drug companies to produce lithium in fact still to this day its very low cost and still to this day no one really owns the patent for lithium in its purest form that made it unattractive it turns out that the extra in the united states did not allow lithium to be used as a treatment for manic by polar disorder until nineteen seventy s were ting bat full twenty one years from the publication of this paper by can in the medical journal of australia showing quite beautifully the great potential and use of lithium for quelling the symptoms by polar disorder until the first patients in the united states were starting to access lithium regularly and nowadays of course lithium is available but still not able to be patented cause its element omer three on the periodic table its naturally occurring it is not literally falling down from the stars as star dust and going into piliform but rather can be synthesized a in laboratories a but it is available it does show not only great potential in many patients but great application in many patients despite its side effects lithium really stands as this an golden example of a treatment that works at least in many individuals prior to an understanding of the biological basis of the disease for which that treatment is needed now with that said scientistic citations have been quite rigorous in thing to understand why and how lithium works in order to understand the why and how of by polar disorder this is the way that proper medicine and science is done even if there is an excellent treatment for something it is important understand why that treatment works because first of all not everyone responds to that treatment second of all scientist end positions understand that just because we have one treatment that works if it as any side affects at all there is the possibility for better treatments it is not just about trying to by pass a drug that does not make much money for drug companies i know a lot of people think in those terms that thin go well there is this continued search for better treatments for by polar disorder even thong lithium works because lithium does not allow drug companies to make much money that is not really the case the fact of the matter is is that the toxicity some of the other issues that are created with lithium the fact that people need the on going blood testing et camera really stimulates the need really an urgent need for new and better treatments for by polar disorder and only by understanding how lithium works that the cellar level at the nerd circuit level et camera do we really stand to find those new discoveries if you were to do a literature search on the actions and mechanisms of lithium in terms of how it can calm people down and reduce their manic episodes you would find an enormous array of papers literally thousands of scientific studies in animals and in humans which for instance we will tell you that lithium treatment will increase called b d and f brain derived eutrophic factor bean f is often talked about in the contexts of neuron plasticity the brain and nervous systems ability to change in response to experience and indeed it does seem that investing lithium increases brain f bean f is what we call permissive for neuron plasticity it does not create specific changes in the brain meaning it is not going to make your memory better or your coordination better or your emotional state better person what bean f does is it permits the neurons the nerve cells and their connections in the brain to be more likely to change if the proper environmental conditions are met that is brain f creates a kind of buoyancy to neuron plasticity it opens the gates to serow plasticity lithium does increase bedpan f will talk about why that is important in the contexts of the nerd circuits involved with by pillar disorder in a few minutes it also seems to be a potent anti in inflammatory now inflammation is one of those words that thrown around extensively nowadays especially on social media and especially as it relates to any health condition is inflammation inflammation inflammation always seems to be discussed in the contacts of inflammation being bad but i do want to point out that inflammation is a natural adaptive response to physical injury to a cellar organ or tissue of any kind inflammation is the basis by which adaptations occur to exercise for instance you were to weight train and use a heavier than normal weights and ado a set to failure or create some little microterrs in the muscle that are healthy in the sense that they would great adaptations and make that muscle stronger may be en grow that muscle there is an inflammatory response associated with that that is critical to the positive adaptations inflammation is not always bad although excessive or as we a runaway in inflammation is bad lithium seems to be able to suppress inflammation and importantly it can suppress inflammation in curl tissues and within the brain in particular that is important and we re turn to that and why its important in a little bit the other thing about lithium is that lithium is euro protective that is it can prevent neurons from dying under certain conditions why would neurons die while there are letter reasons why neurons can die there can be a physical insult to the name can get hit really hard in the head a bullet thengod forbid can i enter the skull and kill neurons or letter reasons why neurons can die euro protection is a situation in which i neuron is given some sort of chemical or physical resiliency that allows it to suffer an insult and yet bounce back it is very similar to the way that we thinkabout psychological resiliency her protection is an ability for neurons to be better able to handle stress of different kinds in particular excitotocticity there is a phenomenon in by polar disorder and a lot of other psychiatric conditions in which hyper activity of certain brain areas actually starts to kill off neurons hyper activity does not always do this but it turns out that if certain brain circuits are too active for too long some of the chemicals associate with neuronal activity things calcium and euro transmitters glutamate can actually kill the very neurons that are active it seems that lithium can prevent some of that nurotocticity now this turns out to be particularly important for this discussion about by polar disorder and the nurse circuit basis of by polar disorder because if we are to take a step back and ask what s different in the brains of people with by polar disorder there are some very interesting answers that start to emerge there are basically to man curl circuits that our present in normal individuals are i say normal i say that respectfully to the people with by poor disorder by referring to people who do not suffer from manic episodes are romantic depression there are circuits that are present in people with by polar disorder end in people that do not suffer from by polar disorder both of those circuits do the same thing in both sets of individuals and yet in people with by polar disorder there seems to be an atrophy or a removal of certain curl connections over time that leads to a situation in which people with by polar disorder become very poor at registering their own internal state in particular their emotional states and their somatic states what referring to here is something called interception have talked about this orbit on the superman lapodcasts before but there r two modes of perception perception of course is a attention to something that is happening in our environment or to us nor within our body extereception is literally an attention to things that are happening beyond the confines of our skin seeing that persons face over there or seeing that color of leaf over the ere or hearing a sound over to my left that is exterroception perception of things beyond the confines of one skin then there is interception which is perception of things that are happening internally might twofold does my gut feel how o how faster my heart beating some people can measure that quite accurately just by thinking about it other people cant how happy am i how sad am i how energetic am i how lethargic am i et camera et camera we are always existing in a balance between exterreception and interception but as it turns out people with by polar disorder over time and especially into the second and third decade of having by polar disorder seem to have progressively diminished levels of interception and that very likely is important in their inability to register for instance that while they are talking at an excessive rate or they have not slept in five or even ten days or they have not eaten in a long period of time this atrophy of curl circuits for interception is starting to emerge as one of the defining curl circuit characteristics or underpinnings of by polar now i bridge to this conversation about neral circuits from the statement that lithium can protect against some of the nurotoxic effects of curl circuits being very active now this can get alibi complicated but i promise ism gong to make it clear for any of yow that are watching and ore listening they reality is that people with by polar depression very likely have a hyperactivity that is an increased level of activity in certain circuits within the brain early in the expression of their disease and that typical as i mention earlier sets in around the early twenties although sometimes t that can be even earlier in the teens and forth but that hyperactivity we think leads to a toxicity an excytotoicity of certain elements of the curl circuits that are responsible for interception in other words the overuse of certain circuits can lead to a diminishing an atrophy or even a death of certain elements within those circuits and it appears that lithium through its anti lavatory and nurse protective effects and through its ability to increase begin a very likely protects us against some of that atrophy of those circuits for interception this is isn't the case in which people with by polar have a curl circuit or lack of oral circus and people without by polar are the opposite this is a case in which everyone more or less starts out the same but it seems that there is a hyperactivity of certain curl circuits in people with by polar disorder that over time actually causes those circuits to diminish now this is very important because some of the more recent longitudinal studies doing brain imaging on people with by polar disorder and those without and doing that over time in patient starting as early as their teens but into their twenties and thirties reveals just that that there can be hyperactivity of circuits early on but then hypo reduced activity of the one very same circuits at a time five or ten years later again this speaks to the complicated nature by polar disorder and the complicated nature of psychiatry and linking specific psychiatric disorders to nerd circuits in general because if you have a situation in which in one disease less just iletioust of hypothesize here for second that forinsence in certain forms of schizophrenia there is elevated dopamine and were we to just reduce the amount of dooming that they would receive relief from those skits chronic symptoms or that is all pretty straightforward on the face of it but and the situation of by polar disorder what we are talking about as hyper activity too much activity leading to hyperactivity through death of those very circuits and now you can especially appreciate why when the patient shows up to the psychiatrist or when the psychiatric shows up to the nation in the total course of their disease is going to be very important and then layer on top of that the complexity the fact that the very defining characteristic of by polar disorder is that there are oscillations in mood now we been to think about treatments notorious for the manic episodes but also treatments for the depressive episodes and that is in fact what psychiatrist do turns out that they apply different treatments are comminations of treatments for patients that are in manic episodes verses deprefice of episodes and they have to infer all that from discussions again just exchange of words depending on when that person walked into their office where they are in terms of manic episodes no symptomatology or depressive symptomatology and whether r not they have had that psymptomology for an extended period of time and then just to make the situation even more complicated the very circuits that atrophy that start to wan and disappear in people with by polar disorder are the circuits for interception for understanding of what is going on in one's own body you can imagine if you sit down and ask somebody well how long of has a licence you slept that person may genuinely not know or if you ask the very depressed person how depressed are you that person may not be able to articulate that fortunately their r solutions to this and the solution is that more often than not the accurate understanding of whether not someone has by polar depression or not and what stage of the illness they might be in or not is going to depend on the reports of people around them and not the patient themselves hence the importance of having a rather detailed and admittedly are rather intense discussion about the symptomatology of by polar disorder that you can have an understanding of the people around you and have an eye and an ear to whether or not those people might be suffering from by polar and if at what stage of the disease they might happen to be at now i to talk a little bit more about what is known about the nerd circuits that lead to the manic states as well as the depressive states but mainly the manic states of by polar disorder we already discussed the fact that in perception registering of one's own internal emotions and bodily states is diminished in people of by polar disorder but we have not really talked o bout the neural circuits the are responsible for that lack of recognition for that reason it'd to point out of paper this is a fairly recent paper just came out this year buts an excellent one looking at the changes over time in neral circuitry in people with genetic risk for by polar disorder and in particular in young people and studies of this sort are rare but are exceedingly important because of the fact that they track individuals over time the title of this paper is longituneral changes in structural connectivity in young people at genetic risk for by polar disorder we will provide a link to the study in the shoot captions there a lot of data in this paper on in particular nor imaging data and it is quite extensive in terms of analyzing the called conic comics you portly heard of genomics which is the analysis of genes and there om display in different individuals or different animals et camera you aprodeomics which is the display of or the existence of different propenes of comic is a big thing now in science you can throw comics behind anything in it and becomes its own wicapedia page which means it becomes its own thing to speak i say that only partially ingest none the less conic comics is the analysis of connections between different neurons and neural circuit elements and what this paper really showed by analyzing the conic comics of nil circuits in the brains of many different people with different categories of and onset of and severity of by polar disorder as well as controls in different age groups et camera is that people who are of particularly high risk for having by polar disorder or that have full blown by polar disorder have deficits and actually reductions in the amount of inactivity between what are called a partial brain regions and the limbic system now the lyric system have talked about before in this podcast if you are not familiar with it all explain what it is in a moment its simply a collection of brain structures not one brain structure but a collection of brain structures that generally a responsible for shifting the overall state that were in from states of more relaxed and come to states of more alert and focus the limbic system is intimately related to the called autonomic nervous system which regulates are sleep wake cycles and a number of other things our digestion et camera a level o hunger and on and on the limbic system is really in a volume control or as nerve scientists to say a kind of gain control on the overall level or amplitude of alertness or calmness in fact it were very very calm we are sleep or even more calm we can be in a coma if we are very alert we can be wide awake and ready to work and run et camera or if we are very very very alert by way of limbic autonomic interactions will then we can be in anxiety we can be in full blown panic attack or we can be in mania we can have much energy that we feel we do not need to sleep and in fact disruptions in the circuitry really seems to be what is going on in people who have by polar disorder now if disruptions in the circuitry our present in the lamb system that does not as usually mean that the limbic system is at fault because the way that neral circuits work is that different granaries are talking to one another through electrical chemical signaling and they are regulating one another and wat this paper really tells us is that their elements within the partial lobe which is a and of a section of the brain that sits off to the side s not really off the side but in nerinatomical a coming later the partial lobe is connected in two ways by directionally bridal lab is connecting the limbic system and limbic system is connecting to bridal lobe and in people with by polar disorder seems that the partial lobe is able to exert less top down control that is less suppression of certain elements of the limbic system which at least right now is leading researches to the hypothesize that the limbic system is sort of raving at higher levels is calling our am nor cars are conned lining at times and for durations that are inappropriate or at least abnormal we have two major sets of neral circuit deficits or changes in people by polar their lack of internal awareness is reduced and that turns out to be by way of neral structures the insula which is a brain region that is connected in a very direct way to our some maticensory correct to the part of our correct that register is how we feel literally sense of touch and internal state those circuits scums me those for those pelican a just bump the microphone excuse me those circuits are disrupted in people with by polar and the lowdown control the kind of accelerator and break on our overall levels of energy are also disrupted now that is all fine and good because well it is true at least according to what the data at this point in time tell us there may be new discoveries to come but that all seems to be the case but it does not tell us how to modulate or changed that circuitry it also does and tell us how something lithium canactually benefit a large number of patients or how a good number of the other treatments for by polar disorder which will talk about going forward can benefit patients with by polar it a pears that lithium is exerting its positive effects on by polar depression treatment it least in part by preventing the loss of certain neral circuits namely the nerd circuits for interception and the top down control over the limbic system now turns out the by examining lithium effects at it even more reductionists level we can gain really important insight into what is going on in by polar depression and some of the other treatments for by polar depression including behavioral treatments things transcurneal magnetic stimulation and even some of the more natural or called neutrosutical treatments include in things hydro make athresupplementation which we are going to talk about extensively now in order to understand what we are going to talk about next its important that everybody understand a key concept of euro plasticity and this is a key concept regardless of whether not one is talking about by polar depression in fact its sone the i think everybody every citizen of earth should know about and that is called home static plasticity homeostatic plasticity is a particular form of negro plasticity in which if a curl circuit is overactive for a period of time there are changes that occur at the cellar level that lead to a balance or a homeostatic regulation of that circuit that is no longer overactive conversely if a curl circuit is underactive for a period of time certain changes happen within the cells of that circuit to ramp up their activity or make them more likely to be active and whether not a curl circuit and the neurons within it become more active or less active in the contacts of homeostatic plasticity largely depends on one mechanism and it is a beautiful mechanism that ill make very clear tea right now even if you do not have a background in biology neurons communicate with one another by releasing called euro transmitters which are just chemicals those our transmitters are vomited out there not actually vomit but there spit out into the called synaptic cleft often called the snaps the snaps a just ta little gap between neurons and when they are released into the snaps they do not just stay there they actually park or bind to receptors on what is all the postsonaptic neuron and depending on how many receptors they bind to and how many receptors are available et camera they can have a greater or less or effect on the possonaptic neuron this scenario of narrow transmitters being released into synapses than binding to receptors on postonaptic neurons and influencing the electrical excitability of those posonaptic neurons it central to not just the treatment aby polar disorder but to all treatments of all psychiatric conditions and indeed to things nuropatic pain as well for example the called s s are prosaic loft and others et camera stands for selective ceretonan retake inhibiter what does that mean well ceretonan is a narrow transmitters chin nuromogeler that is released into the snaps and then the s s i the selective ceretonan retake inhibiter allows more of that ceretonan to sit within the snaps for longer wright its a retake inhibiter prevents retake by the presynaptic neuron and that ceretonan therefore can park in or doc in the receptors as it is called of the posonaptic neuron in greater numbers and have a greater impact on that posonaptic turn the drugs that are used to treat depression or other things of that sort things esessorise work by changing the availability of nauru transmitter in the snaps other things m a o inhibitors monoacid ox's inhibitors work a different way they inhibit the ends on any time you hear a s e and apologies very likely an sign which breaks things down m a o inhibitors prevent the break down not the retake but the break down of narrow transmitter and therefore allow more narrow transmitter to be available in the snaps and influence the posonaptic cell homeostatic plasticity is a form of narrow plasticity in which over all circuits can become much more excitable or much less excitable by the addition of more receptors in the posonaptic neuron or by the removal of more receptors from the posonaptic neuron and the way this happens is just beautiful it was first discovered in the visual system and the person primarily responsible for the discovery of homeostatic plasticity although the are several is a one by the name of genaturgiono she is a professor at branding university in what the turgiono laboratory showed was that for instance if we are in the dark for a long period of time literally when were not seen much for long period of time there is an increase in the number of receptors in the posonaptic neurons that a smaller amount of light and excitability within the visual system can lead to greater amounts of activity in the visual system conversely if there is an overactivity or an increase in an activity in the visual system for some period of time then a number of receptors in the posonaptic neuron are removed from that posonaptic neuron surface making any narrow transmitter that is available only able to bind the receptors that are left and have less of an influence on tho cells in other words keeping a circuit in called home static balance in a particular range of excitability now while that is a mouthful and an earful and a conceptual no e conceptual is a word but in any case that is a lot think about but all you need to know is that if a marry circus is very active for a period of time in normal individuals there will be a reduction in the amount of activity by way of removing receptors that by narrow transmit or whereas if a marry circuit is very quiet its not activated for a period of time may be or your leg is in a cast for instance and you are not activating your quadroceptic calves very much well when that cast comes off sure the muscle might be atrophied but the nerves that connect that muscle are actually in a position to influence that muscle even more once you start using that muscle or those muscles because whatever narrow transmitter is released now has the opportunity to bind to more receptors in that case in muscle or in the case of bring circuits in posonaptic neurons homeostatic plastisiis is beautiful balancing mechanism that makes sure that marry circuits are never too active nor to quiet for too long and in a beautiful display of how treatments can lead to a better understanding a biology which can lead to the discovery of even better treatments lithium and another compound which will talk about etamine seem to exert their actions largely through effects on homeostatic narrow plasticity this a wonderful paper that describes all the integrity of this certainly most people listening on guessing are not going to be interested in all this detail but for those of you that you are and you ant a deal deep into this this paper was published in neuron express journal excellent journal its title targeting homeostatic plasticity for the treatment of mood disorders and there is one particular figure in this paper that all just described to you in which measurements were made from neurons and the number of receptors in those turns it is done somewhat indirectly through a method that a detail the hero scientists are familiar with basically what it measures is how excited a given neuron is electrically excited a given neuron is to a given amount of negro transmitter o cases that the amount of her transmitter that is vomited on to a neuron is essentially kept constant and than the response of the posanaptic neuron is measured it can be of one level or higher or lower depending on homeostatic plasticity and what this paper shows and what is been shown over and over again is that when neurons are exposed to lithium for a period of time there is a reduction in the excitability of the postonaptic neuron that is neurons within the brain become less excitable over time if lithium is present whereas redefine which is now a common fix approved at least in the u s its approved for the treatment of major depression redefine does the opposite redefine seems to increase the number of receptors in the posonaptic neuron and lead to greater levels of excitability an electrical activity within neural circuits to a given fixed amount of euro transmitter this is superinteresting because what it means is that lithium is causing circuits to be less active redefines is causing circuits to be more active and we know from excellent clinical data now that ketene seems to be a very effective treatment for major depression and for the major depressive episodes of people that suffer from by polar depression that includes these major depressive episodes of two weeks or longer of suppress mood appetite sleep issues et camera now the anything about redefine that is often not discussed is that while its effects are very potent they are transient one major drawback to redefine therapy for depression is that it has to be done repeatedly and how repeatedly or how often rather depends of course on a discussion between the psychiatric and the patient this is not something to a cowboy on your own i know that a and many of you a probably familiar with the fact that redefine also is abused recreational it is a called n m d a and methyl d aspirate receptor antagonist it blocks the very receptor that is responsible for curl plasticity for changes in neural circuits it also changes excitability neurons as i just describes redefine is a very potent chemical that has been shown over and over again and is now f tie approved for the treatment of major depression but its effects seem to be transient lithium as i describe earlier seems to reduce the manic episodes or the intensity of manic episodes in symptomatology and people with by polar disorder doing that through nauru protection protecting neural circuits from dying away that initially are overactive in that over activity causing cite toxicity blocks that excite of toxicity we believe and it seems to do that in part by diminishing the amount of activity in those circuits this is a beautiful mechanistic story and it is the sort of story that you love to have for a great number of psychiatric illnesses and fortunately we have for by polar disorder overactivity of a given circuit eventualleads in eurnarro toxicity souse me lithium is preventing that naurotoxicity by reducing the number of receptors in certain elements within tho circuits called homeostatic scaling its down regulating the number of receptors leading to less excitability and preventing we think excite toxicity and in that sense you can see exactly why its important to get lithium treatment in their early for people with by polar disorder redefine as a treatment for major depression seems to be effective but transient and you can also see why it would be importantnotchuss to reduce the manic episodes for people of by polar disorder but also treat the depressive episodes this is a key feature of the treatment for by poor depression and for by polar disorder there needs to be treatment both of the mania and of the depressive episodes if their present and fortunately there are excellent drugs to do that and i should mention that redefine and lithium are just two of the drugs within the kit the psychiatric o have access to their many things a lansopines and a number of different is including closopine closopine as an anti psychotic which is commonly prescribed to as a sedative in some cases that allows people in manic episodes to sleep its a classically described as called dopamine receptor for antagonist although it does other things as well closopine has a number of sideffect features related to white blood cell and things of that sort that require careful monitoring there are an enormous number now literally dozens and dozens of different drugs each design to target either the manic phase the depressive phase or some what we call acute sort of early phases verses on going treatments this is a vast policy of drug treatments that really should be navigated i should say absolutely should be navigated by a word certified psychiatrist and of course in close discussion with both the person suffering from by polar disorder but also ideally the family members of the person suffering by from by polar disorder but i think at least up until now were focus on the two major pathways for treatment lithium and redefine and we talked about i lithium in examine work that the working on opposite ends of the homeostatic scaling we talked a bit about the c kits that are involved in generating what we think are the manic symptomologe and the lack of interception why people can just persist in staying awake awake awake not eating et camera now you have in mind how all that is put together and i think you have in mind some of the well demonstrated treatments for the different component parts of by polar disorder which now ism hoping you are alive well version based on our early early discussion of what constitutes by polar one and by polar to now i would to also talk about some of the not typical therapeutics for by polar disorder and also point to the things that have been tried and failed for successful treatment of by polar disorder because some of those things are often talked about and suggested is special an online communes and while it is not clear that any of them are particularly hazardous on their own although some of them do carry some hazards i do think it is important because of the critical time sensitive nature by polar disorder and the urgency of getting treatments early to try and prevent some of the longerlasting neral circuit changes that if people can avoid some of the less effective or demonstrated to be ineffective treatments that they stand to combat by polar disorder much more successfully first of all a see point about drug therapies versus non drug therapies are talk therapies without question drug therapies are going to be most effective when done also with talk therapies and we'll talk about which talk therapies have been demonstrated to be most effective there is some argument about what ism about to say next but in general most psychiatric will tell you at certainly the ones have spoken to have told me that talk therapy on its own is rarely if ever effective for by polar depression and by polar disorder wither gods b p one or b p to assist the reality of it yon contrast that with our discussion about obsessive compulsive disorder which we talk about a few episodes go you have not seen that episode if an inept that episode all about used and offensive compulsive personality disorder there it seems that drug therapies and talk therapies can be done independently or in commination it's expected combine drug and talk therapies are more effective there than either one alone but there pretty impressive effects of talk thrave alone provided that they a initiated the right time and is the right form of talk therapy that is of d but in terms of by polar disorder it really seems that the drug therapies are necessary at least in most all cases that said talk therapies are terrific agent are support for those drug therapies and sometimes can allow people to take lower doses of those drug therapies which turns out to be important because of the side affect profiles of a lot of drug therapies and sometimes the cost as well i guess we can think of costs as another side affectoreally there are both established and more novel forms of talk therapy being used again in concert w drug treatments for by polar disorder cognac behavioraltherapy is the one that seems to be best at least by way of the statistics and papers that exist s also the one that is been explored the most one of the reasons why it is often conceded the most popular or effective is cause its also been a round longer it been explored the most cognac behavioral therapy in general is a progressive exposure of the patient in a very controlled way in a chemical setting to some of the triggers or the conditions that would exacerbate by polar disorder now earlier i said borderline personality disorder has all these triggers and triggered elements from the external environment whereas by polar visor does not and that still true but it is the case that somebody with by polar can have worse symptoms if life conditions get worse or more stressful bologna behavioraltherapy in the discussion about and sometimes the direct exposure to a anxiety provoking elements of life can be very helpful for adjusting the responses to those otherwise triggering events and sometimes making the drug treatments more effective even at lower doses there are also forms of therapy including family focus therapy which is especially important in terms of by polar disorder because family members provided that they are not themselves in a manic episode due to the close heritability of by polar disorder but family members can often be excellent windows into whether not somebody is doing well or poorly or severing toward or is emerging from a manic or depressive episode because they understand that person they have a lot of data i could be purely subjective data but they have a lot of exposure to how long or well somebody's been sleeping or eating et camera family focus therapy involves other members of the person suffering from by polar disorder's family as well as conversations about family members in a way that helps patients with by polar disorder navigate not just through manic episodes into pressie episodes but start to learn to predict what are the conditions psychological physical and otherwise that can trigger by polar episodes and then there is a category of therapy called interpersonal and social rhythm therapy this is deserving of its own entire a episode really interpersonal and social rhythmtherapy i sort of an expansion on family focus therapy although its distinct in certain ways as well and really focuses on how people are relating to others in their life and in the work place and in the school environment and also within the family et camera and i should say that a over all theme that is emerging in psychiatry in psychology is to start wherever possible to incorporate more of the social aspects in the interpersonal aspects in other words locust talking to an examining a patient as one biological system one nervous system one set of chemicals and one life but rather a set of chemicals normal circuits and a life that is imbedded in the chemicals and naval circuits and lives of other people a just by way f example you can imagine that if somebody is in a very healthy relationship or a very abusive relationship that that is going to strongly impact the outcomes of manic episodes you can imagine that if the financial situation is one in which people can recover from manic episodes i do mention this earlier but i should have forgive me that oftentimes people who are in manic episode will go out and spend immense amounts of money that they simply cannot afford to lose and then the depressive episodes that in many cases follow are made far worse by the financial anxiety in the financial stress that results from those manic episodes of spending et camera and then of course this carries over to of sexual promiscuity where people i might be dealing with on wanted pregnancy or stirs or a very fractured interpersonal dynamics with existing or new relationships mind you can imagine how these manic episodes as well as the depress of episodes can really wake out into an enormous amount of destruction which brings us act to the initial criteria of pi an a pi to is that these manic episodes are not a good thing these depressive episodes are not a good thing they create the sense of euphoria in the person experiencing mania or they create the sense that anything is possible but at the end of the day and actually every day these episodes are quite maledict if they really destroy people's lives and its not just the life of the person that suffering from bipolar disorder and hence cognac behavioral therapy family focus therapy an interpersonal and social rhythm therapies are the primary three talctherapes that are most often combined with drug therapies in order to try in really reduce the harm it is really all about harm reduction from manic episodes and depressive episodes one very exciting in emerging treatment that does show great promise and in some cases great outcomes for by pillar disorder is believe it are not electric shock therapy electric shock therapy may sound barbaric and in fact it tends to look barbarian though this is done in the controlled setting of a hospital any view of seen one for of the cucu'sness the final scene or near final scene in that move was jackniclsin with the or a by protector in his mouth and o getting electric shock therapist its as the am the name a suggestidty of inducing a global seizure either low level or grand mall type seizure in the patients brain and nervous system in might rascal why why would one want to do that well turns out that this is a well established and in many cases very effective treatment for major depression electric shock therapy is generally used for treatment resistant depressions to the are people that have no positive response or on going positive response to drug therapies or other trapes electric show therapy is thought to work primarily by stimulating the massive and of indiscriminate release of things ceratonan dopamine a seetocolling in a huge variety y of neurmodulators as well as things b d an f rain drive atrophic factor which than allows neral plasticity to take place again beating up being permissive for neral plasticity the problem with e c t is that it is really only useful for treatment resistant depression it does not actually target the manic aspects of by poler a depression and by polar disorder but none the less is used when drug treatments do not work some of the negatives of electric show therapy am or elective convulsive therapy e c t is the is the proper acres and and way its described is that it is quite invasive rite this is something that a you need to go the hospital for and oftentimes their some a impatient care required after the electric convulsive therapy it is a fairly high cost especially for those that do not have insurance and of course it requires in cassia for most people that is not con be a problem but o for many people that could be a problem and there is often some associated memory lost and the memory lost the invasive nature of e c t and the cost oftentimes rule out e c t for most patients and that is why its or of a late stage or kind of last resort type thing for treatment resistant depression nowadays examine type therapies don repeatedly or other treatments for instance transcranial magnetic stimulation which is basically non invade of its a coil that is placed on the outside of the cull a skull souse me and we can more awful accurately refer to it as repetitive or a t ms repetitive transtranial magnetic stimulation transcraniamanic stimulation is a tool that allows researchers an citations to reduce the amount of activity in specific neural circuits o they can act target the magnetic field to particular neral circuits to reduce activity in those neural circuits again it is minimally invasive it has been shown to be effective in both increasing neral plasticity in positive ways as well as reducing depressive episodes and in a few instances in reducing the amplitude or the intensity of manic episodes in people with by dollar disorder the problem is its still a very early technique there are not a lot of clinics and labs doing it on trying to see more advertisements literally commercial clinics that are advertising a a tames or tams i incurs you to approach those clinics with caution ism of the mind that if those clinics are not either closely or may be vindistantly associated with a research institution thatsurally up on the latest of our tames o you be wise to at least do your research it and a explore talk to other patients who have done these treatments but certainly in universe hospitals and in clinical settings and research settings a tames is being used as a way to for instance reduce the activity of certain limbic circuitry's that people are just over all less excitable in manic or to activate because it can also be used for activation now certaineral circuits activate for instance the partial in puts the top down control over the limbic system this is all happening right now we have e c t repetitive teams or a t mas and then as i mention earlier redefine therapies most of those are targeted toward the depressive aspects of manic depression for people with by polar disorder that does not include depression those are going to be less effective but over all it is going to be the talktherapies of the sort that we that we discussed earlier or a moment ago plus drug treatments almost always lithium will be explored plus treatments for the depressive episodes in particular if those depressive episodes are present nowadays there's a lot of excitement about sylicibon which is a psychedelic in the us sylicibon is still illegal it is not legal meaning you can get in a lot of trouble for possessing it certainly for selling its et camera but slice and is being explored as a clinical therapy in certain laboratory settings in particular at johnshopkins school of medicine its being explored in human patients for the treatment of major depression for a one de i believe as well but certainly for major depression and for eating disorders and it seems from the initial wave of publications from that work done by the incredible matter johns or doctor father johns who has a guessed on this podcast before also been on the tempers podcast hes been on the laces freedman podcast doctor matter johns came on this podcassis talk about some of the work of scylicibon for the treatment of depression very impressive results there and as you can imagine very impressive results for the major depressive episodes for by polar however at least to my knowledge again to my knowledge there have not been any controlled clinical trials exploring sylicibon for the mania associated with by polar disorder if someone out there is a ware of those clinical trials please let me know it'll do an update in a future podcast but right now no knowledge from me about sylicibe an clinical trials for the manic component of by polar disorder the number people are probably also going to wonder about whether or not cannabis or medical marowana is useful for by polar disorder to address this i look to some a previous lectures and some clinicians at stamford psychiatry a this cession was asked of them and as it turns out cannabis does not seem to be effective for the treatment of the manic phases of by polar disorder or for the treatment of the major depressive component the only treatment perhaps or i should thy the only situation perhaps in which it might be useful this is what was relaid to me is that it may help with sleep in certain people that are having trouble within sonic though nowadays its far more common for people in manic episodes to be prescribe things trazodone or other benzol benzodoazopines in order to try and get sleep within the manic episodes and benzodiazopines and trazidon at camera work largely through the called gabasystem this is a negro transmitter that cause is reductions in excitability of anurans a hence why its being used to try and calm people down and allow them to sleep during their manic episodes not a lot or essentially no data s reporting the use of anabasis for the treatment of by polar disorder per say nor data supporting the use of sylicibon for the treatment of by polar disorder per see but i realize as i as i say that that there are going to be a number of people that may have had positive or negative experiences with anabas or sylicibon as they relate to by polar disorder please a if you are willing are comfortable put that if your comfortable into the comment section on you to and of course if you are aware of any studies on anabas or sylicibon showing positive outcomes for the treatment by per disorder a please a provide links or moment ideas to those that i love to arouse those studies there are two natural pathic or i should say nutrition supplement based approaches to by polar visor they get talked about a lot and one of them shows some interesting promise or effectiveness even in a limited contact before marching into this description of these two compounds in fact before even mentioning these two compounds i do want to emphasize what is been said and written about over and over again and what was relay to me from expert psychiatric it is not wise to rely purely on talc therapy or on natural approaches to the treatment of by polar disorder given the intensity of the disorder and the high propensity for suicide risk and people with by polar disorder it is a chemical and nerd circuit disruption and it needs to be dealt with head on through the appropriate chemistry and prescription drug approaches from aboard certified psychiatrist i do not say this to protect me i say this truly to protect those who either suffer from or think they may suffer from by polar disorder if some one who you think might suffer from by polar disorder now all that is not to say that there are not useful lifestyle interventions that can support people with by polar disorder i just briefly want to mention those and again of lifting the statements ism about to make from some excellent on line lectures from psychiatric at stamped and elsewhere which essentially say that of course of course of course getting better sleep getting adequate exercise getting proper nutrition having quality healthy social interactions even getting regular sunlight in the day and avoiding bright light at night all of those things are going to braid together to support the nervous system and the psyche of somebody with by polar disorder but they brad together to port the psyche and the her chemistry in the nerd circuits of anybody in everybody they have generally a modulatory affect that is they're indirectly shifting the likelihood that somebody might have an episode or the intensity of an episode in particular the depressive episodes r i you can imagine ow someone whose heading into a depressive episode may be there on a lower amount of medication or they have not yet medicated for the depressive episode of by polar and now there making sure or their families make can sure that they're getting exercise sunshine eating correctly social engagement camera of course it makes perfect sense why they would have perhaps a shallower drop into depression or may be an offset at oppressive episode that said mostly if not all people would by polar disorder are likely to need some sort of drug theropeantervention in order to help them lifestyle factors are always important in all individuals though suffering from psychiatric conditions or not but in some conditions of the mind in body those little interventions can have a greater effect an offsetting symptoms whereas in by polar disorder i think its naive and in fact wrong to say that liestala interventions alone are going to prevent especially the extreme forms of mania and depression again by poo disorder being serious and carrying such high suicide risk which is have to point this out again and again now with that said there are two substances generally found as supplements although the re other sources of them as well including within nutritional sources that have been shown least in some studies to be pretty effective in a busting these symptoms of by polar disorder and those two things are inositol and megathere fatiacits now in inositol is a compound that is taken for variety of reasons something we talked about n the podcast before i personally take a inositol not because i have by polar disorder invented and lucky that i do not have by polar disorder but i take a inositol an nine hundred milligrams of moan coital every third night or in order to improve my sleep its something i have added to my sleep staccato something i found greatly enhances the depth and quality of my sleep and if i wake up in the mill the night to use the bath room et camera its greatly enhanced my ability to fall back a sleep when i want to go back to sleep it also seems to have if fairly potent anti anxiety effect during the day and the disgust in our episode about obsessive compulsive disorder innocitl has been used at my dosages can i shows a myoinoctol has been used at my dosages in a levels of even ten eighteen grams those are massive dosages by the way to deal with certain symptoms of one d to limited success and i should mention that my dosages of ten or eighteen grams of a inositol can cause a lot of gastric discomfort et camera if you want to learn more about in inositol in its various uses i encourage you to go to examine not come where there is the called human effect metrics and that human effects made tricks will describe the many places in which myoanocito and other forms of inositol have been she shown to be effective in for instance reducing anxiety enhancing sleep and on and on myonocitol is important because my myonocitol and we can just inositol is related to called second messenger pathways in d only get two deepen o second messenger pathways but when certain substances bine on or transmitters to a receptor on a sell surface oftentimes those receptors themselves will open and allow the passage of ions and other things into a cell oftentimes they will engage what are called second messenger systems that is they will trigger mechanisms within the cell to then go do other things this is probably something we should get into in real detail in a future episode for those whoso that really want a cured out on cell cell signalling which is a a favorite topic of mine in any case in nocitall is related to a number of called second messenger systems this hand off or this and of a stimulating of of changes within a cell that can inspire changes in what is called membrane fluidity can actually make the membranes of cells the outside fence around a cell which is made up of fatty stuff it can change the fluidity meaning how readily things can float around in the membrane we know we think of cells is very rigid there is a cell there is a neuron or there is a in mine cell but actually those cells have a fatty outside in particular neurons have a fatty outside it is a thin fatty outside as called the cell membrane and things are floating around in that cell membrane but it is kind fellow that has not quite fixed and things receptors moving into the snaps or moving out of the scenes for home astatic plasticity things a the ability for certain genes to be turned on and a cell or not turned on can depend a lot on things that are happening in that cell membrane and how readily things move around in the cell membrane one way to think about this whole picture of membrane fluidity is that just imagine that every one of your cells has this layer its kind of a gelatinous layer and their lots of little rafts floating around and there but those rafts or able to move more quickly from one place to another or get more stuck an one place or another depending on howlet that fellow is in nocitall and lithium and as will talk about next megathere fat acids seem to change the fluidity of those membranes in other words they allow things to move in and out of those membranes more readily or not and this is no surprise given that those membranes are made out of fatty stuff in particular the membranes of neurons are called a a lipid player its two layers of fat o a by means to lipid fat and megathere fat acids of the sort that are found in certain fish and that fattish in particular and that are found in fish oil cod liver oil et camera megathere fat acids when we invest them are use for a lot of different things but they can be readily incorporated into pathways or directly incorporated into cell membranes changing the way those cell membranes work and if those cell membranes are the cell membranes of neurons changing the way the neurons work the ability for fish oil and in particular the omega three fat acids which codein varieties e p a an d a oh a ill talk not that n moment have been explored at relatively dosages for their ability to offset some of the effects of mania and to offset the effects of depressive episodes in by polar disorder and actually the date of there are pretty impressive although although they are varied meaning you will find several studies an a'llmention o few that found no effect of megathere supplementation through fischoil usually its capsized fish oil although fischoil can also retain taken caves me in liquid form oftentimes taking liquid form as the more costifficient way to do it taking in capsid form is the more palatable way to do it because fish of for a lot of you does not taste good but none the less there are several studies that have shown that supplementing with fish oil or a megathere gadoids at levels of for instance four grahams per day for a period of time this is a study that we will link in the show notes this is murphy at all two thous and twelve this is a fat fadiosid supplementation of seventy per cent e p a to d a oh actually worse can symptoms of mania over a period of about sixteen weeks which on the face of it makes it seem of a megathere fadiosid supplementation very likely to not be good for by polar disorder and yet that was the manic phase when one looks at some of the other studies overmegathree fadiosid supplementation there is for instance a study collision nineteen ninety nine this is a much higher dosage supplementation with omegathr fadiosid this is a nine point six grahams of fish olive per day for four months and that actually greatly reduced symptoms a by polar depression compared to the control group which received olive oil old oils of different form of fatmono an pastry fat but does not contain as much of the megathere fadiosids and forth nine point nine point six grahams of fish oil per day over four months as a lot of fishbowl to be insulting on a given day this was a double blind a study this was only carried out i should mention in thirty subjects but it was males and females and the age range was pretty broad and were from eighteen all the way up to sixty for years of age which is important given this r logentutinal or changes over time that one season by play disorder here's the major take away supplementing with hypos megatheres does seem to be beneficial for a good number of people with by polar disorder however again i on a highlight however it should not be viewed as the only treatment approach for by polar disorder this goes backsword of saying before about the essential need in most every case for high potency prescription drug treatments prescribed board certified cychatris for by poor disorder however o megathere supplementation does seem to improve er reduced the depressive symptoms in the major depressive episodes a by polar and there are couple studies an willing to these in the show notes as we've that show that it may even improve some of the manic episodes as well mean no it reduces some of the manic symptoms now i say all this from a place of great caution because i know especially for listeners of this poachers a lot of interest in the behavioral tools the supplement base tools an nutrition tools that can support by polar disorder but i do not think i can over emphasize enough that especially for by polar disorder in the great risk of suicide and suffering and in appropriate spending i should say maladaptive spending and impulsivity that is associate with by polar disorder that its hard to imaginissnera in which just talk therapy and fish oil an hostile interventions are going to completethe a suppress or treat by polar disorder people with by polar disorder really need to consider the full picture of treatments the drug treatments the talk therapy treatments and lifestyle treatments and neutrasutical or we can say supplement based treatment such as or megathere supplementation as a full and necessary picture for dealing with their illness i be remisshowever if i did not emphasize that the megathere diacid supplementation is very interesting pocosin terms of the subjective effects people saying they feel less depressed are able to sleep better or make in some reduction and manic symptoms is equally been of really good brain imaging to try and understand howmegathre diacid treatments are actually changing the brains and neral circuits of people with by polar and i will put a reference to this this is a paper that was published in theamerican journal sycaatry it is entitled megathere diacid treatment and tea two whole brain relaxation times in by polar disorder i do not have the opportunity to go into a lot of detail right now about what tea two holbrain relaxation times are but basically when people go in to a smart or f functional smart scanter manage remiss excuse me magnetic resonance imaging scanner what their getting essential as a pulses of magnetic fields and the way that brain structures and neral activity can be evaluated has a lot to do with the sort of spinning or not the sort of acid with the the spinning and the relaxation times of different different elements literally the protons and electrons within than neuron it gets really a detailed there and the relaxation time is essentially looking t how quickly some of that spinning returns to rest and in particular the fact that the relaxation times are different for quits that is liquid verses lipid fatty verses other components of brain tissue and basically what the study shows is that the membrane of neurons within the brains of these people with by polar disorder showed more fluidity more ability of things to move in and around the membrane which we know as an important component of neral plasticity in by polar subjects that were treated with megathere antacids as compared to by polar subjects that did not receive o megathere fatiacids and formally this study also include a healthy comparison group where they could ass initially find that people with by polar discord who supplemented with megatheres had changes tat the cellar level end the curl circuit level that brought there brains and nerd circuits closer to that of the healthy comparison subjects while i do not want to point to megathere facias supplementation as the be all end all of treatment for by polar disorder certainly it is not it does have a strong mechanistic basis for impossible support of neral circuitry of nerd plasticity and in particular the ability of make changes in sell membranes that are very reminiscent of some of the curl circuit changes and changes in mumbling fluidity that are seen with lithium treatment and other known prescription drug treatments that have been establish now for decades to be very effective for by polar disorder what that says is that omegathry supplementation while not the only intervention that one should consider is something to consider and talk about with your doctor and it is operating in powerful ways its not just that its changing for incense were gotmicrobium which is powerful but is indirect to the brain it does seem to be having direct effects on neurons and curl circuits before we begin to conclude our discussion about by polar disorder when i talk a little bit about misword disorder and this is a theme that does not jisrelate to by polar disorder but other psychiatric disorders swell and when we think of a disorder we think of something that is really detrimental to us something that really impairs our ability to function and work in school and relationships and really starts to pull down our health status in a variety of ways and certainly by polar disorder meats those criteria however there is this idea that things by polar disorder even things skisofrenian some cases are responsible for some of the creative aspects or the creative works that have been observed and carried out by human beings for many centuries and believe it or not there are good data to support the fact that certain aspects of mania are associated with creativity now we are long overdo for an episode about creativity its nerd circuit basis its chemical basis here on the human ladpodcast and certainly we will have that conversation but in the meantime i to just briefly touch upon this idea that certain occupations are associated with a higher incidents of by polar depression and in fact it is been explored at a research level really there are data pointed the fact that certain individuals of certain occupations tend to be more creative and that creativity is associated with again associate this is an causal its associate correlated with higher levels or incidents of by polar depression and may be even other forms of depression this is a study looking at mood disorders in eminent individuals these are people that are not just good at what they do but are exceptional at what they do and explored the percentage of people in given professions with either depression or mania and this was actually a data set glean from more than a thousand twentieth century westerners based on their biographies that were reviewed by other people it is bit of an indirect measurement this is not in psychiatric data this is data dresses a these are data that were compiled from self reports or from reads of self reports and they explored a number of different profession for instance they looked at people in the military or people who were professional athletes or natural scientists or social scientists of people who occupied positions in public office sir were musical performers artists non fiction writers poetry et camera there are lot of professions here a i will post this or you post a link to it in the show captions for you to peruse but it'll just give you a cense of the extremes on this craft because they're very interesting turns out that if you were to look at the profession or i should say among the professions they looked at in this study cause they did not look at all professions those in the military and those who are professional athletes or had jobs in the social or natural sciences had the of those there was the lower percentage of those that had depression or mania and some cases those who are professional athletes didn't seem to have there was no incidents of man at least in this data set whereas at the opposite extreme the graph those that were poets these are eminent individuals people that were exceptional poets exceptional fiction writers exceptional artists or non fiction writers will they are especially for the poets you find that as many as ninety per cent of these very successful poets had either depression or mania sees ninety per cent that is incredible contrast that with military where it is as few as ten per cent or professional athletes were its as few as twenty per renting for the professional athletes as i mention before none of them had mania does this mean that being a poet will make you manic or depressed will first of all let us look at the poetry category it turns out that seventy five per cent of these eminent poets these highly accomplished poets had major depression whereas only about twenty per cent of those poets had manic episodes again it is not that being a poet is going to give mania certainly were not saying that not that being a poet is going to give you depression but it turns out that people with depression and people of depression and mania seem to gravitate towards poetry or at least are very successful at poetry again associative correlative no causal relationship here but it is really striking to see how the creative occupations poetry fiction art nonfiction writing even though non fiction writings about nonfiction still creative music composition theater much higher incidents of things maniac in fact for the people in thee a the actors even though the overall occurrence of depression and mania is lower than that in poets the fraction of those individuals that have mania is exceedingly high it is about thirty percent of those that they looked at who are actors have man manic episodes or have full blown mania ism referring to these data because first o i find them incredibly interesting right up until now we have been talking bout by polar disorder and other mood disorders for their maladaptive effects and again their extremely maladaptive much much higher instance of of suicide et camera but we be wrong to say that certain aspects of manic episodes do not lend themselves well to creativity or that certain aspects of major depression do not lend themselves well to creativity or to the performing arts or to poetry that said in no warship or form do i believe that being depressed is a good thing er that being manic is a good thing again we return to the basic foundational criteria for by polar disorder major depression which is that the pressured speech the not sleeping the incredible increases in energy and the flights of ideas are generally not going to lead or i think its fair to say are not going to lead to good places in fact often lead to bad places but we would also be wrong if we did not consider the fact that there is a somewhat inextricable relationship between mania and creativity and it could be that hypomania or brief periods of mania may be e an hour day or thirty minutes a day of composing or writing poetry may be even some of the lows that we feel right some of the sadness some of the grief some of the nostalgia that we feel provided that it is not pathologic if that it is not persistent for the four or seven days that are diagnostic of by polar two and by polar one disorder respectively well then we can start to view emotional states as something that can actually lend themselves to positive outcomes and may been to creativity and to improved occupations is important that we have a wants to view of what sadness verses depression verses major depression are it is important that we distinguish between being erratic being very energized and full blown by polar disorder and i raises for another reason as well nowadays its very common to hear people saying ah that person is used well on the episode about used that i did a few weeks back the confined if you at superman label to come in that episode i pointed out that used obsessive compulsive disorder is very maladaptive or right i think its number seven as i recall on the list of debilitating diseases all diseases in terms of lost time at work suffering relationships et camera it is really serious conduit ton and yet we often here ow that person is obsessive and as i pointed out there is obsessive compulsive personality disorder and then there is obsessive compulsive tendencies which actually benefit people but that is distinct from obsessive compulsive disorder as a clinically diagnose thing similarly we hear that oh somebody is being by polar or they are all over the place there by polar well that is a very subjective and a and of label that people give one another in passing more and more often ism hearing this and yet by polar disorder wether not beeps one or be too are extremely maladaptive and extremely associated with his suicide risk while ism not here to police people ism not certainly not the word police or the woman cloture police i do think that whether not you refer to people as o c d or is by polar it see er that is up to you it is not my place to say but i do think it is importing that all of us understand that these psychiatric conditions carry with them tremendous maladaptive weight to day we have really done a deep dive into by polar disorder and to both the manic and the depressive components that are present or can be present an by polar disorder and the different forms of by polar disorder and some of the major treatments for by polar disorder in particular lithium in its underlying mechanisms and some of the neural circuit and chemical basis and negro plasticity basis of the treatments for by polar disorder in particular homeostatic scaling or homeostatic plasticity all of that of course is relevant by polar disorder and i hope will be useful in your understanding and may been in your pursuit of treatments for by polar depression by polar disorder for you or other people i also hope that it will be useful in your understanding of how brain circuits work in normal conditions or in conditions where there is no disease state or maladaptive conditions hemostatic plasticity is present in all of us membrane fluidity do to how easily things move around in the surface the fat layers on the outside of neurons and the movement of receptors in an atonerons that is present in all of us the influence of megathere fatiacids is central to that discussion as is the discussion about various drug treatments because even if you are not somebody who is taking a drug treatment or who is pursuing a drug treatment for by polar disorder or another psychiatric condition your ceratonan levels your doomed levels your see coming levels all of these play in to what we call your mental and physical health in fact if any of you are interested in the various categories of neuromodulators and tools to adjust those naromodulators under for standard non disease conditions we did an episode on nor chemicals and how to control them you can find that at superman labdocom along with all other episodes of the german land cast should mention everything is time stamped you can navigate to the specific topics and tools of interest to you and meanwhile i just want to thank all of you for joining me on this voyage through the biology and the treatments for by polar disorder i do hope you found it beneficial both for yourself of and for others i just want to remind people that by polar disorder is an extremely serious condition if you suspect that you have by polar disorder or somebody who does please make sure that you or they talk to a qualified

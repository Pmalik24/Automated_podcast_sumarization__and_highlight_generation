a quick warning there are curse words that are beeped in today's episode of the show if you prefer a beep version you can find that at our weight this america life doth work from w b easy chico it is this america life ism show coal sitting in fire glass late last year i got some not great health news that kinda scared the help o me basically i was diagnose with mild emphasis lung disease and too with their calling small benin nodules one on each lung it is i scar tissue ism trying to focus on the words mild small and benin the cause was not mysterious it'd been a daily cigarette smoker for about thirty five years is to be a pack a day when i was younger sometimes more it'd cut it down to maybe a half or a third of that later on and it'd been meaning to quit for a long time but i just never tried to not really and now it felt i had no choice which before i tell you what happen next i feer i should explain what a huge change that was going to be i was say i started smoking when i was fifteen and started an haling when i was sixteen partly i just wanted to be the people in the brutish teen dramas i was watching on p b s pulling these perfect little white cylinders out of silver cases that snap shut i remember i painted an empty metal bandaged container light blue and kept my salt mental in there puffing at them in my parents drive way and my thirties in forties i was the guy in the find group that i ways had cigarettes it'd smoke during the shortest of walks from this office to the hotel bar across the street it'd smoke after a ten mil training run for a half marathon you smoke in your car some one would ask and it'd say yes what i bought it whenever i imagined myself stranded in the woods or on a life raft in the middle of the ocean the panic i felt was about not having enough cigarettes with me the prospect of stopping for good always felt trying to strand myself on purpose everything in me opposed it the emphysema diagnosis was an early nonmember i figured it'd put off quitting till after christian when i did not have to work for a bit whenever i went too long without smoking my cognition would slow down to where i could barely think remember twenty eighth it'll stop i told myself and started practically counting down the cigarettes i recorded voice my us though a this this one's from remember twenty first a week before quitting day this is one of the lass times i will be sitting here smoking out the window looking at the world trade tower and then i guess going forward a just sit here and a i know thank her something this is how much of a smoker i was i didn't you realize that when you do not smoke you do not a to go and sit by the window but the thing ism really here to tell you about is how i was planning to quit i was going to read a book kind of thee book for people in my situation it is called allay car's easy way to stop smoking you might have heard of it it is sold millions millions of copies pretty famous to a famous people read it and then cell about it on television names skaters of pan it was easy it was perfect and it was all because of the book plan to generous the easy way to stop smoking allay carrot and everybody who reads the book stop an and i stop and to at i i as i had fashion butcher great ting is for your reading the book it to smoke i to y in i of yous li i i i to b telling point he insists you keep smoking while you are reading the book and then when you finish it you stop my method is known as easy boy this is plantar recorded back in two thousand five and it will annal any smoker to quit immediately prominently and actually enjoy the process before you dismissed my plans bear in mind that have been proving them for over twenty years that is we my book goo network of clinics a successful this book is the only thing that is ever given me a shred of hopefulness about stopping smoking it literally always felt impossible in the past and ow here is thesguy saying that not only would i be able to do it but actually be happy about it that is the true measure of success plan car says not just stopping but becoming a happy non smoker could not imagine being happy not smoking i could not imagine that a bunch of words could get some one to stop feeling and incredibly strong urge that words alone could make something that seem impossible actually happen what type of whither was afoot here in this book and all the stories in to days show er about that people kind of casting spells to try to make people completely change their directions in life in some way o and you get to listen to me try to quit smoking stay with us act one the straw that broke job camels back racon not sure about that turtle there is a couple of others here that we act one can i still be a joker and a midnight tower we is when act one the unbearable lighter lessens of being anyway the book is relatively short and really really repeated it he says you have to follow every instruction to the letter and the we it works car says most people who try to convince you not to smoke will tell you the reasons you should went how risks all the money you spend whatever but he says smokers already know all of that if any of that actually worked plantar says you would o quit by now now what he does not stead is the opposite he names all of the reasons you give for smoking all the things you about it or think it is offering you and he carefully explains why every one of those reasons is bonus he describes it as a kind of deprogramming ultimately removing any desire for a cigarette and a lot of the precepts make a lot of sense for instance he says smokers believe that smoking helps them focus and concentrate but he says there just kitting themselves that is just an illusion all smoking does is remove the distraction of nicotine withdraw you only think it is helping you think better there finds of fallacies that he says and smokers perpetuate them without even realizing it is is to brook says smokers claim that the cigarette relaxes them and helps them to handle stressful situations but they also claim that it helps them get going in the morning and that it gives them a boost how can a drug that relaxes you or relieve stress also stimulate you this contradiction illustrates the truth about smoking the cigarette just does not do any of the things we tell our self at dos i should say he distinguish easy way from just going hold turkey or what he calls the will power method those poor souls are not real non smokers he says there just smokers who are not letting himself smoke what kind of life is that whereas if you have no desire to smoke any more you do not need will power you also will not be irritable were depress or gain wait wore any of the things that according to most people make quitting hard also the reported accelerate for will power alone is really low it depends on do you ask but it might be as low as three to five per cent cutting down does not work plantar says cause it just makes every cigarette seem that much more precious it why says to just smoke as you normally would while you read the book also you really wants you to sit with it how is the taste what is it really feel going down into your lungs and do not even get him started on nicotine replacement therapy patch is the gum all that stuff that is going to keep you wanting cigarettes he get into arguments on this point this one on sky t v with some one from a smoking cessation charity tit is not nicketan re place thorny it is picketing amour ace given the picketing the drop there a dick a mi we said body craving nice it is absolute none you get nicking the its seeking he down gradual akin come o is ta youtonin the pro ritiises o picketing the it is not grist then axis nor was o the adverts i it is four times grit four toms grab o the for first ins great then just resin will power line it don't to ora work is el tons get o the nothing ye plantar never had any training in psychology or medicine he says one day he just realized what a nonsmoking is and took things from there start of working with individual clients in the early eighties and group seminars tan the book and ultimately in organization that operates in more than fifty countries around the world for my money his cred was even better than that of a therapist psychiatric he was a smoker for bout as long as i was and much heavier sometimes a hundred cigarettes a day ye tried to quit a lot of times before hitting upon his method at which on he just stopped on a dime if only he figure to doorway sooner plantar died of longans er an two thousand sex he had not been a smoker for about twenty years i to is growing excitement as i read the book i was tarting to beat out my fare of pitting it one point i wrote in a note book plantar is write about the taste it is foul smoke felt bad going down my lungs i think my thinking about smoking has genuinely changed the night before my final day of smoking i felt a kid on christian eve eve sort of thrilled and wishing the day would just hurry up and get here already plantar said this might happen the next night the number twenty seventh i smoke my final cigarette sort of ritual built into the process for summers at i wanted to be outside walking the neighborhood i smoked it may be faster than any cigarette ever knocked the burning ember off the but threw it in somebody is trash can and said out loud good by cigarettes and when i woke up the next day i wanted to cigarette more than i ever remember wanting one first thing in the morning which is not what the book says as suppose to happen no what i did or did not do or what exactly went wrong but suddenly the way felt anything but easy in the book over and over again plantar says some version of the actual physical with drawl from nicotine is a very mild slightly empty in secure feeling it is mild that most smokersdone even notice it throughout their smoking lives have also heard that the physical withdrawal only lasts three days or is it a week or is it three weeks and after that it is merely psychological have heard the individual cravings last anywhere from three to five minutes and than they pass all i can say is in my experience all of this is utter horseshit i do not even understand the concept of individual cravings my case with drawl has meant a constant crazed yearning that varies in tolerability throughout the day this is how hi described it a couple of weeks in it is a world wide ice all of my limbs are phantom limbs is swallowed a live animal much larger than me that promptly died and now i have to walk around with it inside of me soul and all or it is opening all these awful little packages in which there is something i cannot see that painfully stings me and there is no telling how many more i have to open nor for how long it is the thing ism thinking about more than any other thing and more than all of the other things this was on canary thirteenthoke give had of sunsets and nothing makes it better literally nothing makes it better everything makes everything that i do in stead of smoking makes me want o smoke more this is the worst day that of the non smoking that there is been far they what is it were now going into day seventeen ah now i i do not they are hard they are all hard the thing about thinking something is going to be easy is that when it is ultimately not it makes it that much harder yet i cannot do it i must be an idiot then thinking back on some of the passages in the book i felt gaslit my lived experience was being question this is plantar in a brutish takshows sometime in the early its we told about these terrible withdroll your sight is rot all waited it at you we it show me i can say exactly where canary eighteenth three weeks in i had this attack i was on the corner in my neighborhood trying to decide we there would go home go to the bar just the bar and my brain was i were walking about ism for a cigarette ha and i said no we do not do that any more and my brain was you mean itsittime for a cigarette i said no it is not and then it is i was physically punched in the solar plexus with something electric that sent a shock up through my face and has i screams crazy i lion turned working is is how how got well it better get better at some point it got worse have gained wait been drinking more i when a month with no nicotine at all and then gave in and started having a nicotine lowland here and there i have but to a day now which naturally made me litigate everything balancer had said else made me wonder why was not this working for me if it works for many people i start looking for answers and i stumbled across this podcast that was way more revelatory to me about my addiction than anything in the book welcome to the humor man lo can n cut science science pay tone rein n li you might be familiar with anterhummandhe is kind of a hero science rockstar now go as a lab it stamped school of medicines yet where he researches narrow biology an entomology s i do not pirsprid apart from that he is made it a personal mission to explain how your brain and body work you can may be make theater choices or yo do and he has an episode on nicotine which made me feel some one had put their hand on my shoulder looked me in the eye yo and said you he sir yet are not insane the only bases again balancer central premise is that all the thing smokers about smoking in relaxes us and focuses us and gives us a loose carcass that the only thing were feeling is just the withdrawal going away but according to hubourman that is not true at all scientists have been studying the brain chemistry of this for years decades and just to be superbreviated about it here poncestis two hours long nicotine uses up your brain with these three chemicals dopamine you'll beard of dopamine w people think it causes pleasure but it is also the thing that makes you want pleasure strip it motivates you titular makes you good strive pursue i a see o coming which i you never heard us release es you focus i up with ideas sells plus this is were you have a see to calling receptors on your muscles too which huborman says could explain why some people feel more physically relaxed on nicotine virtue after efferent and then apaneferand which you could just call a adrenalin when plantar says the nicotine itself does not give you a boost it gives you a boost the you mow and when you put all of that together we now have a very clear picture reward pathways are turned on attention is turned on alertness is turned on you feel better than you felt a few minutes ago you are blood pressure is up your tartrate is up you are preparedness for thinking is elevated is well and yet your body is somewhat relaxed that is a very interesting state of mind and body interesting because it is somewhat ideal for cognitive work if you are going to sit down and work on a book were you going to sit down and trying figure out a hard math problem ore you going to write a letter that is been really challenging you for you to write or maybe that your really excited to write but that you have been you know slow to get out the door for whatever reason here ism talking about my own habits of predestination that state of being very alert but your body being relaxed is almost if not the optimal state for getting mental work on we are during but one molecule nicotine found in plants this to mates and potatoes and the tobacco plant one molecule that can trigger activation of all the circuits for focus and motivation in one fell that is roar when i don't touch with supermen and we sat down for conversation he said the stuff was obvious to him the first time he smoke o cigarette his fourth same time had his first cup of black coffee i though that i was about as good as it guests until i took it my first drag off a cigarette and then i realize to wow wow wow nicotine just make s everything look a little different if you focus and relaxed i mean that it's a very hard combo for most people do just drop themselves into unfortunately nicotine also has a lot of harmful side effects can strict blood flow and cause hart problems and just to say the whole second half of the podcast is about how in credibly bad tobacco is for you superman does not smoke any more ere use any kind of nicotine i ran him through some of lancers claims about nicotine and he did give me is take on them although warily i have to be careful because i do not want to discourage any one from using a resource this book that could help them move away from in unhealthy practise sir a jerk i do not wan to under mind his his efforts cause i think that the effort is a noble and important one but he says flatcar's right that you can get dependent on nicotine that you do not derive any benefit any more and justsmoke you can feel normal that can happen with any addictive dree but he says there are tons of studies supporting the idea that nicotine helps with focus tresses n and now it does not curbyou stress but it might make you better able to handle street is s cause your more kept up and vigilant if the central premise of the book his food and nicotine can do all of these enjoyable useful things why do you think if you were to conjecture did this wisdom that did not work for me per say work for many people a man you now i just thing about that i i think i know why from a nurse en i look at everything through the lends of biology r much to the discomfort of peoplomost to me a mi can say that the book did a very interesting thing i have to give him credit what he did is he tried to by pass all the deeper biology of dooming a seat of cosine a diction et camera and what he did was he said you have got a forebrain your forebrain can tell itself stories by telling itself stories you can set contact let us tell yourself a story and the story is this withdrawal does not really exist or it exist but nicotine's to that bad ologaven nicotine does not really exist and when you feel on comfortable that is you another words he used the lack of knowledge about the way it really works in the reader to trick the reader into tricking themselves in to by passing what would but we shul be a much more complicated process now for some people and apparently celebrities it worked for them but what if i came along with just the tiniest bit of knowledge to the contrary or what if some one you has it an experience to the contrary well then am you are right back in square one i guess it just does not work for me or there something wrong with me something wrong with me that is what it'd been feeling and that is sort of endemic to the method if it does not work it is cause you did not follow all the instructions hadn't understand part of it read it again or callus or attend the live seminar in one addition of the book plantar writes that if you are thinking ism still craving cigarettes after reading it than quote you are being very stupid how can you claim i want to be a non smoker and then say i want o cigarette that is a contradiction if you say i want to cigarette you are saying i want to be a smoker non smokers do not want to smoke cigarettes you already know what you really want to be stop punishing yourself having this information knowing what nicotine was and h is no longer doing to me was comforting as i was it is not in my imagination i wish it'd known all this before it'd stubbed that it'd had more of a map of the landscape instead of just pretending i was not even on the continent an this was march thirty first the day after i talked with humerment three months in been trying to get test for no ten or fifteen it everything's just a little bit harder since i stop smoking slower ism slower and all forget i mean that supposedly it is good for nicotine is good for working memory meaning we why why did i come into the kitchen again o ye ah and tend even do i no working memory any more and it takes me for ever to do simple things and they are not ass that is not the word for getting dressed but they are not it is it just feels everything feels a little be look at sure ness there been lots of new stories about flatcar's easy way he was interview to ton in the quiet when he was alive and the people took over the organization after him than a lot of press but looking high and low i had not seen anyone question the scientific accuracy of the method even though most of the biology humoral talks about has been known for a little while other ism missing something which happens alive where nobody's ever raised this particular issue with them before you will be think i did exotic count i sat down with johndikin flatcar's successor he is the global o an senior facilitator of easy way now he also took the seminar himself to quiksmoking and says he was enthralled by how well it work t that he quit don't quote hustled and harangued plantar to let him get involved they but id head sometimes or is but john really considers car to be a genius i asked him if they would never talked about brain chemistry when car was alive he said they had although he was not really interested in bison sit you must not know i think he not to really mean says sone of things a i reallything as much i to bring to the she with i myriad get you now we talk to be he would say that he was the world's leading expert on quitting smoking e i you smiling and i at m he he would went sort of as the world's leading expert in quits for self professor worlds leading expert in quitting smoking be be necessarily curious about that staff you thing is busy doing other thing a in terms of i the easy way method i us not be in a pots of he is fifteen or sixteen the re a diction wishes there is the easy way to stop drinking the easy way w e in h to lose weight is one about being addicted your fond lots of things i should say an updated version of the book different from the one i read addresses brain science for the first time but it is very selective and it still claims nobody's ever had any pleasure or benefit from nicotine i started taking john dick through what it'd leave from interhubour men thee research that contradicts gets in the book and that my help explain why for lot of people it is not going to be easy to walk away from smoking when the book says that it that it doesn't physically ad and concentration just scientifically it does ate and consent son an e on you think he is wrong i do not think he r o knows from he is a narrow biology o o care ward i meant not be disrespect for yet he know sure he has a theory hes is e as on run i mean it is based on should bis just wrong s many levels anal ism struggling was tam why is a desperation to prove or i believe the nicotine does something when it does not you've huts much nonsense in my life ism sorry you very nice go sure surely believes what he saying but is absolute nonsense i think that is where we are is understand each the bus ism not looking for positives of picketing you i was just looking for it what what is the mechanism i was just looking for what its a mechanism and when i learned about the different your chemicals that that nicotine e vows in the brain an it just felt that the method was eradicated on a line that my you itinlres you would you tight nicotine for the rest of your life now although and o no i one to well it was not my plan it was not my plan because i is not yo plan why is not you plan es give me these tremendous benefits u strugglewithout it why why would you just tike you rest life i think because there are health dattrmens the nothing things got spicy li with john dick of you get older he you tell me more than once weeks after the fact to say he was still reading from the interview again does not understand why anyone would push back at the allancar easy way method another we have only ever done good in the world he said were that is kicking a cat and why would any one ever suggest there was a benefit to picketing other than may be the tobacco companies a big farm if it was true i could almost live with that if picketing did make it easy for people to come trite non nicketinatics to concentrate i could live with that and i when o o genuine interest to look at the studies you look tat if the wore nonporous to it a ferny it knowledge that but but there on the it is just i guess how can you say there are not when you say that you have not looked at the science when that that it is just not an and that is fine that it is not interesting to you but when it is not interesting to you and you have not really rout about it and allantoid really read about it and how that and how can you say it is not try just e her relevant is not it i don i want to a i would not one t spend too much time discussing whether the moons might out these pretty to no mi i think the his huge dangerous to talk about you no a there might be a benefits to picketing ut is just simply not true is fortune of the book tin work for you already sorry about that and i a wish you would reached out i hop or the time a because it is man to be this complicate it ready dose i reapsyou smoking and o what as you can beau the promocit after the bayou i you a if you think misunderstanding this help you continue smoking just be but u welt thank you for asking i am i think i to said basically the then johndicy says the organization does not make any claims about the successorate of the book for any measurable success they always point to the seminar they give which plantar always said was about ninety per cent effective he base that figure on only about ten per cent of seminar goers taking advantage of the money back guarantee in order to get your money back you have to do the session two additional times for free anyway the companies backed off from that claim in recent years the seminar was put through a couple of randomized controlled trials where it was pitted against methods that offer both behavioral support anformacology nicotine replace went that kind of thing the more recent and bigger of those studies found that nineteen per cent a the plantar people were still quit after six months virus is fifteen per cent of the other group the margin of air that basically means there on par though nineteen per cent success still means that the method did not work for four out of five people in the study johndicy told me he does not thing those studies ore a good reflection of what the results are out in the real world an literally looking through my kitchen window watching police officers smoke on the fire escape of the precinct this is four months in i know kind of wherever you look wherever ye smell there it is a your past it is you broke up with some one who is horrible for you and than you leave your apartment and that person is in every street corner wafting their perfume at you which was and remains intoxicating literally and then you go back to the confines of your apartment and you look out the window and there they are blowing kisses at a brick wall now i cannot tell whether i am talking about the metaphor were the physical reality actually may have stumbled into a really good though kind of worrying explanation as to why ism not in the per gentile whatever it is of flatcar's successtories i talked with a prominent psychiatrist who is had patients that use the method she is familiar with the book her names anna limpkin she runs the addiction medicine duel diagnosis clinic at standard hello what a book called dope nation which is where i lead that nicotine increases dopamine levels by one hundred fifty per cent which is fifty per cent more than sects i call her to talk science but our conversation became a little a therapecession at some points i told her this this thing that happens in the shower when i first turn the water cold at the end makes you feel god after not during and weirdly i do not just crave a cigarette right at that moment it is this very specific sensation ism taking a big if from a glass ash tray that it just emptied but have not washed out yet it is not rose feeling it is a wanting feeling aigrets is it happen immediately when you turn the look feel first feel the pain of the cold water yes o case of that is very interesting there am there is a whole famous series of experiments show told me there were these studies done where they would take a point and get it addicted to some drug by letting it press a lever over and over again to receive that drug but then if you take the drug out of the equation it will venery stop sitting thebuten cause wit is the point then it wanders off to do other things in the cage to amuse itself however if then you take that same animal and you expose it to a painful rootstock the animal will immediately run over to the lever and wildly start pressing in sly to ye is not interesting i suspect that that is what is happening to you that by having cold water am showers what your doing is your shocking your body with a painful stimulus which is then triggering your automatic neurological safety and compensatory mechanism which is to smoke a cigarette well that is wild well ye ye in other words in you have created in a elaborate neurological circuit a round smoking an even months after you have stopped smoking that neurological circuit is still healthy and firing away in response to significance tresses people talk about the the physical addiction to nicotine and the psychological addiction ton nicotine that that sounds physical to me that i mean tit is o ye it is very physical wall this time it'd been focussing on the damage that smoking had done to my lungs thirty five years worth of damage i somehow had not thought in terms of doing that amount of damage to my brain to that will take a long time to repair and sleep ye told me especially given my age i brain is not as plastic as it once was and there is another school of thought she said more depressing one which wonders whether the damage could be far gone i cannot repair it it will always be in the and of state of perpetual neurological withdrawal which might require some kind of intervention and in your case that might look something nicotine replacement therapies for life potentially or life i what what is that for life ye for life and potentially at higher doses than what your currently taking well ye we used to use nicotine replacement therapy just to help people quit but more and more were now using them in the mainnence face where people are just using them four years to decades and again the thinking there is that well the ideal is that with sustained abstinence your brain would heal and you would return to whatever your precooking baseline was but in reality what we see is that some people do not get to that place and that they man meed some form of nicotine to feel and function o cay ism going forward indefinitely we it is possible that have broke my my brain sort of my my my open mean receptors to the point where they are just not gone a returned a normal kind of ye i mean that that is that is possible i mate i do not to you say that your brain is broke but i guess just to think about it little differently just could be that you no longer have the brain plasticity to completely reverse the changes i had to listen back to that part of the interview a few times to fully feel the gumdrop of it i know it is not an official diagnosis or anything even an unofficial one and when a over react but the impact is something when i learned i have lung disease permanent brainchanges and lack of plasticity makes me think of aging which makes me think of dying nicotine replacement for life for the rest of my life how long is thatch to me and still even a messing all of that damage knowing all the havoc that smoking has reed on my body still i wish there was some tomenshon in which i could keep doing it your wondering it is now been seven months and i still oven smoked a cigarette every now and ten i was wake up to it all over again still on doing to talking with analempki confirmed this idea that had been pecking at me since i first read the book plantar says there is only one kind of smoker and that any smoker can find it easy to quit but i talk wit a lot of people who tried the method folks at both worked foreign did it just think there is different kinds of smokers i thin there is a certain kind of smoker me for whom there is a s lot of anger leaking in it it is every hour or a couple of hours we climb up to the roof and fling ourselves off of it as a petulant fuck to being alive after all we started doing this thing when we were kids i fifteen sixteen one of there such a delicious realism to it for some of us is my fifteen year old fingers were still lifting the cigarette up to my fifty one year old lips i cannot think of a lot of other behaviors that are not associated with survival it is even the opposite of survival that i did every day for that long there is a line in one of the additions of the book i have where plantar writes if health happiness and freedom are not enough to inspire you then you have bigger problems than smoking i underline that passage and in the margin i wrote this is possie or a coming up when you wish you knew how and whether to quit some one and then you receive possibly the most well articulated relationship advice of all time that is in a minute from chico public radio when our programmed continues this america life ism show cold sitting in for ire glass today's programmed i cannot quit you baby stories of being on the verge of a big change not wanting to let go and the people who give you that final push we now present act two of our program act too a spoon full of sugar wen we are putting together this we show one of the other producers here thought of this advice column she read years ago where the person writing and was not sure if they should quit a relationship or not it was the column she'll trade used to do called dear sugar here's the letter dear sugar ism in my early twenties have been in a serious relationship with the same guys for six years on and off the off portion taking place when i was younger i have been very distracted and have been second guessing the relationship for a while now but i cannot come to grips with losing this person that seems to be right for me permanently of course that i want o break is hart then again i do not want a settle and have regrets later in live i feel we want different things out of life and we have different interests but i just cannot aside have talk to him about my feelings for the record but o no avail we went on this little break but god now breaks never work basically my biggest fears being alone and never finding any one that measures up it does not help that my closest friends are settling down with their boy friends an her talking about marriage cringe honestly i feel marriage and that kind of commitment represents a loss of personal identity mot her why but i would love your advice sugar please help sincerely scared and confused here is sure start reading her respond dearest scared an confused i lived in onion when i was twenty i was technically homeless and desperately broke but i did not have the papers and america needs to get a job in onion i spent most of my time walking the streets searching for coins that people a drop one day when i was searching for coins a man on a business suit o coach and asked me if i wanted and under the table job three days a week and a major accounting firm that has since collapsed duty corruption sure i said and this is how i became coffee girl one too three coffee girl was my actual job title the one two three was stacked on to communicate the fact that i was responsible for providing coffee and tea to all the accountancy and secretaries who worked on the first three floors of the building it was a harder job than you might think coffee girl and would call as i passed them with my tray often snapping their fingers to draw my attention their way i wore a black skirt over white tights and black fest over a white shirt and i was almost always out o breath band from the elevator i had to race up and down stars in a farewell that ran along the back of the building to get from one floor to the next that farewell was my sanctuary the only place where nobody snap their fingers and called me coffee girl during my breaks it'd walk down to the first floor and go outside and sit on the patch of concrete that edged the building that hows the major accounting firm that is since collapsed due to corruption one day while i was sitting there and old woman came along and asked me where an america i was from i told her and she said that years before she would visited the place in america where ism from we had a nice conversation and each day after that she came along during the time when i was sitting on the patch of concrete and we talked she was not the only person who came to talk to me i was in love with some one at the time in fact i was married to that some one and i was in way over my head at night after i made love to this man i would lie beside him and cry because i knew that i loved him but that i could not bear to stay with him because i was not ready to love only one person yet and i knew that if i left him i would die of a broken heart and i would kill him of a broken heart too and it would be over for me when it came to love because there would never be another person who it'd love as much as i loved him o who loved me as much as he loved me or who was as sweet and sexy and cool and compassionate and good through and through i stayed we looked for coins on the streets of onion together and sometimes he would come and visit me at the major accounting firm that is since collapsed to to corruption while i was on my breaks one day he came while the old woman was there the man i love and the old woman had never come at the same time but i had told him about her and i had told her about him too is this your husband the old woman exclaimed with jubilant recognition when he walked up she shook his hand with both of her hands and they chatted for a few minutes and then she laughed the man i loved was silent for a good while giving the old woman time to walk away and then he looked at me and said was some astonishment she has a bundle on her head she has a bundle on her head i said she has a bundle on her head he said back and then we laughed and laughed and laughed hard it might to this day still be the time i laughed the hardest he was right he was right that old woman all that time all through the conversations we would had as i sat on the concrete path had had an enormous bundle on her head she appeared perfectly normal in every way but this one she wore an impossible threefold tower of ratty old rags and ripped up blankets and towels on top of her head held there by a complicated system of ropes tied beneath her chin and fastened a loops on the shoulders of her raincoat it was a bazaar sight but in all my conversations with my husband about the old woman it'd never mentioned it she has a bundle on her head we shrieked to each other through our laughter on the patch of concert that day but before long i was not laughing any more i was crying i cried and cried and cried as hard as that laughed i cried hard i did not go back to work my job is coffee girl one to three ended right then and there why are you crying asked my husband as he held me because ism hungry i said but it was not true it was true that i was hungry during that time we never had enough money or enough food but it was not the reason i was crying i was crying because there was a bundle on the old woman's head and i had not been able to say that there was and because i knew that that was somehow connected to the fact that i did not want to stay with the man i loved any more but i could not bring myself to acknowledge what was very obvious and very true that was such a long time ago scared and confused but it all came back when i read your letter it made me think that perhaps that moment delivered me here to say this to you you have a bundle on your head sweet pee and though that bundle may be impossible for you to see right now it is entirely visible to me you are not torn you are only just afraid you no longer wished to be in a relationship with your lover even though he is a great guy fear of being a lone is not a good reason to stay leaving this man you have been with for six years will not be easy but you will broke and will he the end of your relationship with him will likely also mark the end of an era of your light in moving into this next era there are going to be things you lose and things you gain trust yourself it sugars golden rule trusting yourself means living out what you already know to be true yours sugar when the pretty she rule it up i the we we story meeting some one else said that she had read the same column and that it was what made her decide to divorce her husband that the same thing heaven with the front of hers read the column left the relationship this won am talking about but a conspell being cast sell told us that of all of the thousands of letters she is gotten in the thirteen years she said the column this is the most common

state's columns now streaming on whole it is called tiny beautiful things our audioversion of this column was produced by dial wo act three tender resignation some times of words that convinced i one to quit a thing are not advice ain't supportive but the just is effective in getting you to let go maybe more this next story's a case that and from producers ta a chase to start this next quitting story i have to take you back a few months to nonmember twenty twenty to election name we ran a story about an election administrator not of people with that job of quit in the last few years because of harassment and death threats from people who believe the last election or last elections fer stolen to this guy not hyper area interment county texts home of fortworth he would never d be driven out by conspiracy theories in fact he would figured out it seemed this rare way to work with them to invite them in there was one example during one election one of the act of his came in to where the votes are tallied and this activist was if i were in charge i would make the walls glass you could see the election marines and where every cable goes header was toque i hear you i told him what about if we re arrange a room the machines are not in this little cabinet under the desk but up where you can see them an you c sot what maybe that would be a start the next election that came back in a runnel's one do walk the room i told him all the machines are on top of the tables you can see the backer against the plaster label what each one of them does this is what you wanted right and he had that moment of coquet will you got me on that one and it is little things that that we keep doing right header gave out his telephone to any one who wanted it there is this one act i is in particular ambry cable she had this channel on telegram about election rid stuff and she posted about hyper a at and she called him all the time she called him on election din at a art o aka at all a say he outing is a not get a the a just a ayes at it the ma e yo look the wat it is we thabegrit ya he an abbey had built up a real relationship even though they did not agree on anything she came by an election mate to hang out and watch everything and ask more questions really seemed to me nothing could deter him from this job the reporter who brought us hider's story natal contraries she talks about herders radical patients with the election conspiracies used to fill his office an election administrators in the rest o the country look to header as a model for transparency openness efficiency the secretary of state of this fact the not a democrat very conservative guy said an italic last year if you were building a photo type for an elections administrator you would just copy header tarsia but an aril sixteenth twenty twenty three hyper released a letter it begins gentlemen please accept this letter as my formal resignation from the position as election administrator for talent county five months after we ran that story header had quit t some people in the county were pretty upset the spoke up at this public meeting one of the people was obey voter fraud activist was always questioning him o a so a i sin he sin in for he wit tin he is trains tan y n in tat a it is also ais n hes o he since he is more not i in era ta i e in m most the ais a thing i i say men for than ne went or first er coney but what happens liter would not talk about it for this story citing his new job he is on this federal election ad visor committee now but here is what we figured out an a lot of this is based on a alias reporting for vote beat it actually all started the night we were down there election mate one of the elections hyper was overseen was for who would be his new boss i position called county judge the guys would be in charge of gerent county the winner was a man named him oar he heavily featured election fraud issues in his campaign claiming that voter fraud his rampant it is not that the twenty twenty election was possibly stolen from trunk it was not liter had dealt with scores of elections skeptics but now one was his boss one o the first things timor did when he got into office a few months ago was set up an election integrity task force we promise during his campaign to investigate election crimes there was a big press conference we cure every one to report actions that they have concerns about whether its at the voting boot whether is writer was not consulted about the task force andwhen the task force was announced he was not there reporter asked if writer was part the task force the was first is made up of investigators and deputies he is a full expect to cooperate with it but he is not part of the task force for son i worth mentioning even if you believed there is a major problem it votofraud which lots of officials in texts doe torrent county got a special shout out in the big twenty twenty election at at the texts dit for running its election smoothly a quit quality trains parent election that was hyper the election integrity task force was one thing they also fought over the budget one he had been approved for hider to buy an expensive attachment for a mail sorting machine but o her would not vote to release the funds for it there was an awkward back and forth at a public meeting with o her questioning him why was this necessary is there is her some other way that is going to save money because that is not saving money no no theater this is not invest went to save money its is an investment to may we we jo o a earlier the son a say money no not i send bat a doing kingdom can come up with a number to sigmenyit whet never dot a get a under fifty dozen dollars back a her one that that is not what i brit its an vestment in a cleaner smolder more efficient operation but is not a case to save one that this is a total wish one this was a real change for hyper the golden boy of texts elections to certain degree what made gerent county election secure efficient and transparent was the pricy election equipment hider was accustomed to getting his request approved hitter's previous boss a republican once told vote beat if area tells us he need something than were going to get it for him around this time hyper and timor met in his office where things clearly did not go well liter mentioned it at the end of his resignation letter it ends judge hare my formula to administer a quality transparent election stands on respect and zero politics compromising on those values is not adoption for men you made it clear in our last meeting that your formula is different this my decision to leave i wish you the best torrent county deserves that you find success i reached out to timer he did not respond but one thing that came out later on a radio show that o hair was on was he did not the way hyper talk to reporters at all that seems a central problem he had with hyper he said some one had given him a public records requests of hider's communications and he did not when he saw in his ten with the press funny that my favorite thing about header it was one guy that got hyper to go after dealing with countless voter fraud act of this over the years hyper and timor had a meeting and then hyper quit or you could say was more than one guy o her had been put an offs by the voters and an election that hyper ad made sure was far hider's last day was fridge may nineteenth airy gave hyper a copy of the federalist papers she inscribed it thank you for your assistance with my current understanding of texts election procedure please take time to relax and i hope you enjoyed perusing these early writings of the founding fathers when we drove away from hider's office that election night and twenty twenty two i felt we had witness this little scene that could be a model for how election's offices could be in the election conspiracy era were the administrator is in the skeptics would be able to if not agree at least to exist through elections hyper running around making surf's workers were getting what they meet while all night long was one woman in a red white an blue dress followed the

you will be able to hear the first fifteen minutes or of this episode and hopefully that will allow you to discern whether not you would to become a premium subscriber without further ado let us get to answering your questions and as always i will strive to be as accurate as possible as thorough as possible and yet as concise as possible the first question is about how too improve sleep in particular how to improve deep sleep that is sometimes called slow wave sleep this was a question the was asked by jack pitched and that got a lot of votes now we have done multiple full length episodes of the superman labpodcast on sleep and tools to improve sleep including the master your sleep episode and perfect your sleep episode as well as a tool kit that is available completely zero cost at superman lady comets a downloadable p d f that lis out the behavioral tools and other tools that you can implement to improve your sleep now jack's question is specifically about how to improve deep sleep he asks i have a sleep analyzer and typically observe that i get a lot of r e m sleep that is rapid eye movement sleep for him he says it is thirty percent of his total sleep is rapid eye movement sleep but he asks my deep sleep is often low around ten per cent and i would to know if there are any science back protocols i can use to specifically increase my deep sleep case for those of you that may not know what is i deep sleep now deep sleep is sometimes refer to a slow wave sleep that is slow wave sleep in deep sleep are sometimes used interchangeably to describe the same thing they are not necessarily the same thing but they fall under the same mechanistic umbrella what is that mechanistic umbrella well when you go to sleep at night you cymbal through a number of different stages of sleep and in the early part of the night would say in the first half of your night or most of your sleep is going to be slow wave deep sleep but then as you transition into the second half of your night more of your sleep will be rapid eye movement sleep that is the typical pattern that is observed when your not disrupting your sleep architecture with things canine and call will talk about cabin and call in a few minutes deep sleep each a slow wave sleep at least for sake of this conversation is vitally important in particular for repair of bodily tissues during deep sleep you secrete growthormon and in fact you secrete growth hormone every night when you go to sleep but most of that growth someone release is restricted to the first half of your sleep night the other feature of deep sleep is that the dreams that occur during deep sleep tend to be of a less emotional nature than the sorts of dreams that one experiences in rapid eye moment sleep just to give a broad top contour of what see sleep a slow wave sleep is really about it tends to occur in the first half of the night it also ours in the second half of the night but in the first half of the night most of your sleep is going to be occupied by deep sleep oh slow wave sleep it is the time when your bodily tissues are repaired in part by release of growth hormone which is involved in metabolism but also preaching synthesis muscle repair repair of all cell types and tissues and during deep sleep your dreams tend to be somewhat mundane sometimes a little bazar but typically not very emotionally loaded that can change if your dealing with a lot of emotionally laid in circumstances in your waking life but in general the sleep and dreams that occur in the first part of the night is deep and it is not terribly emotionally ridden your body also goes through specific patterns of metabolism this relates to recent findings just this last year in which researchers monster the out put of people's breath and the various metabolic factors present in the breath as well as through blood draws basically doing all this while people are asleep in a laboratory and they observed that during the first half of the night while people are in deep sleep their body is actually metabolizing energy very differently than it does in the second half of the night it'll come back to this in a little while this turns out to be very important for establishing your metabolism and the way you regulate insolent and blood glucose during the daytime all of this is to say that getting sufficient deep sleep slowwave sleep is vitally important and jack's asking how he can increase the amount of deep sleep that he is getting because by his sleep tracking method he is observing far less deep sleep than rapid my movement sleep that raises the question of how much deep sleep one should be getting over all in general the goal should be to balance the total amount of slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep across the night however i would not want people to obsess over getting exactly thirty percent rapid eye moment sleep and exactly thirty per cent slow wave sleep your body is much more resilient than that but the close of those two numbers are to one an other the better over all architecture of your sleep and he does not list out exactly how he is measuring his sleep i do want to put in astrict on both the question and the answer i provide by stating that a lot of sleep trackers whether or not they are whoop trackers or oral or whether not you are using a mattrespace or mattress cover brave sleep tracker eight sleep or other is using tartrate and tartrate variability and body movement to estimate or to kind of predict whether or not you are in slow wave sleep a rapid eye movements sleep an notes because during rapid eye movement sleep you tend to be in what is called atonic you ten to be paralyzed you cannot move and during slow wave sleep that is not the case but no matter what the sleep tracking method is if it is a standard commercial sleep tracking method whoop or a eight sleep et camera it is in estimate or a best guess at what stage of sleep you're in whereas when your going a sleep laboratory the sleep laboratory at stamford a university pennsylvania or other of the great sleep laboratories that a out there they are going to use other methods including e e g and e m g these are just acronyms that refer to was to record brain waves that facture are going to trying observe four rapid eye movements beneath the eyelids et camera sleep trackers give you a best guess as to what stage of sleep you are in they are not perfectly accurately none of the commercially available sleep trackers are perfectly accurate we do on it high that o k snow let us answer jack's question directly which is how to increase the total amount of slow wave sleep hill therefore couple ways first of all are the do not and ten we will talk about the us two things that you can do to really destruct your slow wave sleep are to drink alcohol within eight hours prior to bedtime or even at all some people will find that even if they have a glass of wine ore bear with lunch that the amount of slowwave sleep and sometimes even the rapid eye movement sleep that they get at night is reduced and that they are over all sleep architecture is disrupted this has been shown again and again likewise avoiding canine within eight and ideally within twelve hours of bedtime would be preferable and you are not a canine drinker obviousleed don't afterward about this at all but avoiding cabin in take within that eight to twelve hours of bedtime will greatly assist in you getting more slow wave sleep and higher quality rapid eye movement sleep this has been shown again and again and as well avoiding minibus use and made even c b d use within eight to twelve hours of sleep can be very beneficial if your goal is to improve the quality of your sleep now i now a lot of people rely on alcohol cannabis and c b d in order to get into sleep however it is been shown many times in human studies and this was discussed in the podcast episode that we did with the great mat walker who is of professor of tyrosines in psychology it university californium barely in a world expert in sleep and sleep science that n i discuss the research showing that even though alcohol helps you fall asleep even though cannabis can help you fall asleep and even those s b d can help people fall asleep that it does diserrup and in many ways reduce the quality of sleep that one gets that is disappointing news i know for a number the people that rely on canabaseb d er all call to fall asleep but i would encourage you to check out the episodes of the supermen lad podcast that we did about alcohol and about cannabis including some of the health benefits of anabas and certain situations but also some of the detrimental effects of both alcohol in anabas in other situations in reticular for improving slow wave sleep that is actually three major dots avoid coffin alcohol and cannabis's and let us put under the umbrella o cannabis's t h c n c b d in the eight an i really within the twelve hours prior to sleep if your goal is to improve that total amount of slow wave sleep that you are getting and you are over all sleep architecture in addition it is well known that avoiding food in take in the two hours prior to sleep is going to greatly assist in the amount of growth hormone output that you achieve during the early stages of the night and the depth and duration of slow wave sleep now i want to place an astrict on that statement by saying if you go to sleep too hungry it can also disrupt your sleep you are going to have to arrange your eating schedule and your sleeping schadual such that you are not eating too close to bedtime but you are also not going to bed hungry that you cannot fall asleep or that you do not get into deep sleep and stay a sleep i can personally attest to the fact that if ism two hungry i cannot fall asleep now for me most nights ism going to eat dinner some time between six p m and eight p m depending on time of year schaduals what is going on traffic at camera and i tend to go to sleep somewhere between ten p m and eleven p m plusermanis an hour again depending on time of year and what else is going on in life i normally have that buffer of two hours or before going to sleep however there are some nights where even if i eat dinner around seven p m ism quite hungry at nine p m and i want to go to sleep in that case eating a small amount of food ought not to disrupt your slow wave sleep too much but you do want to avoid eating large meals right before going to sleep unless unless completely fasting and not eating something late at night will prevent you from getting into any sleep at all in other words it is better to make sure that you are getting to sleep then it is to avoid food just that you get increase growth hormone output in into slow wave sleep i hope that is clear i have had times in my life where ism working very very hard and i miss dinner or something comes up and i know some people can fall asleep quite easily on an empty stomach have enable to do that and preteclear if ism very exhausted also rely on a handful of supplements to fall asleep each night although have not dependent on them there centimes w i have not been able the access thou supplements and i can still fall asleep but the point is that you do not want to be hungry that you cannot fall asleep and yet in an ideal circumstance especially you are trying to increase the amount of slow wave sleep you would avoid food in the two hours or before going to see if you can avoid food for the three or four hours prior to sleep and still fall and stay asleep easily that is even better forsake of increasing slow wave sleep and growth hormone output now there ore some additional tools for improving slow wave sleep in particular the transitions between slow wave sleep and the other sleep stages because even though as i mentioned earlier the early part of your night is occupied primarily by slowwave sleep all night long you are transitioning from slow wave sleep into an intermediate stage of sleep and then into rapid give movement sleep and then back again is just that in the early part of the night more of that time is going to be occupied by slow wave sleep the two ways to improve slowwave sleep that are well documented in the literature and here we can point to some really nice papers that all a reference in case you want to read further is the first one is entitled exercise improves the quality of slow wave sleep by increasing slow wave stability slow stability has to do with as researchers call at the amount of power present in the different aspects of slow wave sleep this gets a little technical but this is an instance in which they brought subjects into the laboratory they measured brainwaves by we g they had some other measurements as well included subjective measures of sleep and they looked at whether not people were doing exercise or not prior to sleep now when i say prior to sleep mean not within six hours prior to bedtime in fact exercising intensely in the six hours prior to bedtime for many people not all but for many people can disrupt the total amount of slow wave sleep that they get and can also disrupt raided i movement sleep the conditions of the study were pretty straight forward it was a randomize cross over trial basely they had people either sleeping and monitoring their sleep or they had people doing an hour of exercise at sixty per cent of their called via two macks you can look thus up for sixty minutes i get sixty percent of their via two macks that was the intensity breathing pretty hard but not extremely hard if we were going to map that to the called zone zone too cardie being the kind of cardie you can do steady state while holding a conversation this wo be somewhere in the probably zone three or zone for although that is not exactly what sixty per cent of via to macks is going to map to every time think about relatively challenging party of vascular output for sixty minutes and they had them do that at least six hours prior to bedtime and this is an important and they did have the subjects in the study in all conditions abstain from caffein an alcohol that is very important and what they observed was an enhancement of slow wave sleep exercise of this sort turns out to be a very potent form of improving slow wave sleep now i do not know not because the study as far as i know has not been done whether or not doing resistance training or some other type of exercise would have led to the same a fact although have to imagine that if it is moderately intense to intense resistance training provided it is done far enough away from going to sleep it prior to six hours before sleep that one ought to see the same effects a that that was not a condition in the study but it is a very nice study they looked at everything from changes in corody temperature to colonic expenditure they did not see huge changes in a corody temperature changes that could not explain the effect it really appears that the major effect of improving slow wave sleep was due to something in changing the fine structure of the brain waves that a cur during slow wave sleep in fact and this is an important point the subjects in this study did not report subjectively feeling that much better from their sleep see might say well then why what i even want to bother however it is well known that getting sufficient slow wave sleep is important not just for repair excuse me for repair of bodily tissues but also for repair of brain tissues and repair and wash out of debris in the brain and that debris is known to lead to things dementia getting the best quality slow wave sleep is extremely important for body and for brain and getting an hour of exercise that is moderately intense and making sure that you are not doing that exercise within the six hours prior to bedtime and avoiding affine an alcohol certainly within the six hours prior to bedtime but i would say in the eight to twelve hours prior to bedtime would be even better or not drinking alcohol at all or i know there are people out there that do not drink affine at all ism not one of those people but restricting that affine and take to the very early part of the day that has been shown to improve the quality and the over all architecture of sleep and slow waved sleep in particular that is really what the study points to there is another tool that can improve the amount and quality of slow waved sleep that you achieve at night this extra tool that have started using over the last six state months or as many of i believe in getting behaviors right before embracing changes in supplementation or prescription drugs behavioral tools consist of dues and do not and the us and dots for sleep are well documented in the master sleep episode and the protector seep episode and the tool kip for sleep they include getting morning sunlight in your eyes or bright light of other kinds avoiding right light from ten piemtefor i am et center et camera all that information is in the tool kit for sleep and those other full length episodes of the crewman ladpotcast now there are supplements that can greatly improve the depth of your sleep and that can shorten the latency to fall asleep and here i am not referring to melatonin as many of you perhaps already know ism not a fan of monotone and for variety of reasons mainly the fact that most meat tell supplements out there do not actually contain the exact mount of melatonin that is listed on the bottle they contain either much much more or much much less and that melatonin is a potent hormone that has impacts a not just sleep but on other hormone systems as well the supplements that have suggested and that i personally take in order to improve my sleep are magnesium three inmate spelled t h are e o n a t e and interchangeably with that one could use magnesium disc licente i do confer those interchangeable because both cross into cells and across the blood brave barrier in much the same way that makes them better candidates for improving sleep than some of the other forms of magnesium magnesium three ante threonine t h e a n i n e threonine and something called apigenin which is mentally what you find in camomile that is the reason why camomile can make you sleepy a p i g e avian apigenan the dosages for those et camera are described in the to will get for sleep and why some people might want to avoid thiamine it'll just tell you for those of you that have very intend streams or that might sleep walk or have night terrors might wont avoid threonine because it can enhance the a kind of emotional and elaborate nature of dreams other people that all take magnesium three inmate threonine and apogenin as a called sleep stack about thirty a sixty minutes prior to sleep i do not take them during the day there is however another supplement that used in commination with the sleep stack that i just described or alone can greatly enhance the quality of your sleep and in particular people who are following a low carbohydrate diet who have trouble falling and staying asleep seem to benefit from it and that is called in social now a postal comes in different forms but the form that i am referring to here in terms of enhancing slowwave sleep is mix in social there are an enormous number of studies on it social for sake of mental health and forsake of enhancing various aspects of cellar function and force are of improving sleep lectogist dilate one paper title this paper will make it clear what it is about the title of the paper is the impact of mix and coital supplementation on sleep quality in pregnant women randomized double blind placebo controlled study now i just told you the study was carried out on pregnant women but there have been other studies of asocial on other populations and the major take away from the studies is that inositol can improve the quality of sleep and can adjust the architecture of sleep in ways that make it a great candidate for improving the structure and maybe also the duration of slow wave sleep in particular i find that if ism following a lower carbohydrate diet which i do from time to time sometimes have trouble falling asleep or if i eat for to six hours prior to bedtime and i tend to be pretty hungry around bedtime and sometimes if ism exercising very hard if ism working a lot even if i eat dinner around seven and i go to sleep around ten p m i might below bit hungry still at ten p m in that case i find that taking nine hundred milligrams of my an city in addition to the other sleep stack that i just described greatly enhances my ability to fall asleep and to get terrific quality sleep i do monitor my sleep i do that two ways i do that these days with my eight sleep sleep tracker and i use a whoop sleep tracker when i sleep the commination of those two taps into different aspects of sleep tracking hartravery ability movement et camera in a future episode will talk about what are the best devices for one during sleep which have certain advantages and others have disadvantages but i certainly see it in the objective data that is from the sleep tracking data and i also observe subjectively that taking nine hundred milligrams of asocial prior to sleep again thirty to sixty minutes prior to sleep can greatly enhance the ability to fall asleep and for me to stay asleep throughout the night i also noticed another effect which is that if i wake up i the mill the right t use the rest from which i often do i find it much easier to fall back asleep i do not tend to get into ani looping thought and things o that sort in the middle of the night and that may relate to the fact that myoanocita has been studied in many cases for it is roll in controlling anxiety that is for reducing anxiety and that is one of the reasons in fact one of many reasons why people take myoonocitl during the daytime there stays of myonocital for dealing with anxiety for sleep as were discussing now and even for improving fertility in things of that sort in particular in women again nine hundred milligrams of asocial can be a useful tool sixty minutes of exercise as describe previously can be a tool and certainly avoiding caffeine and alcohol is an excellent tool for enhancing the total amount of slow wave sleep jack had a second part to his question he asked is having a high level of rap an we movement sleep any lower level of deep sleep likely to cause any health issues and to be honest it is not really clear that it would cause any specific health issues although if we think about what the specific rolls of slow wave sleep verses rain i movement sleep are again rapid i movement sleep being laden with highly emotional dreams its thought to act as a sort of drama release where people are paralyzed in body and that is a healthy paralysis this called sleep atonic but undergoing some pretty emotional sophist within their dreams and there is a lack of ability for the body to secret to adrenalin during rapid i movement sleep that is thought to be important for emotional repair if you will a during the night id certainly studies where people have been deprived a japan i movement sleep have shown that the ability to manage emotionally during the daytime is reduce ardently if you have reduced rapid my movement sleep for multiple nights that is going to be the case the only copy out to that is that there are certain forms of treating depression that involve specifically depriving people of rapidly movement sleep that's an a whole other story a that was covered in the podcast episode with doctor dollar willies if you want a learn marries why that is the case check out that episode but because slow wave sleep which occurs again during the early part of the night is when growth hormone is released and when there is this periotic wash out of debris within the brain and to some extent within certain tissues of the body you could imagine that reduce slow wave sleep would lead to reduced ability to recover from exercise from injury maybe even relate to the immune system however i am personally not aware of any studies that specifically looked at the ratio of slow waved sleep to rapid eye movement sleep and that focus in particular on reduce slow waved sleep for bodily repair those studies might be out there i was not able to find them if you are able to find them please put them in the a common section and i would love to check out those studies i do not think that one needs to be overly concerned if you are not getting a balance of slow waved sleep to rape eye moment sleep that is perfect however and as i mentioned earlier it would be good to strive to trying balance she amount of slow wave sleep in rapid eye movement sleep across the entire night if you think about it that will also tell you whether it you are getting sufficient total sleep and i do not want open up another set of questions here as i am about to close out in answer to this question but i do often get asked the question whether r not four hours is enough or six hours is is enough or eight hours is enough well it is impossible to know exactly how much sleep each individual person needs and of course each individual person will need a different amount of total sleep depending on the amount of stress and physical strain and various other things there dealing with in their daily waking life however it is generally the case that kids and people that are under going puberty and certainly an early infancy need more sleep than adults to as you age you do in fact need less sleep one good matrix of whether or not you are getting enough sleep is whether not your sleepy during the daytime or not if you are falling a sleep lot during the daytime you are probably not getting enough sleep at night that sort of a do but it is an important dah to pay attention to and for those of us myself that need a twenty or thirty minute nap in the afternoon great that does not necessarily mean you are not getting enough sleep at night of case if you get sleepy enough to wanton in the afternoon that is not in indication necessarily that you are not getting enough sleep at night however if you are only sleeping four or five hours per night it is very hard to imagine that you are getting a balance of slow waved sleep and rapid eye movement sleep once you get into the range of sleeping six to eight hours and certainly a to ten hours per night the probability that you are getting a balance of slow waved sleep in rapid ye movement sleep greatly increases if i ware to throw out a number i would say for most people that is for ninety five per cent of people out there getting at least six hours of sleep per night at least an ideally more seven or eight is going to be the goal however have notice for instance for myself unless ism exercising extremely intense lee or ism going through a lot of emotional or physical stars of my daily life getting six and a half to seven hours of sleep per night allows me to feel really good and refresh throughout the day and that is especially the case if i get that twenty or thirty minute nap in the afternoon or use an start non sleep deep rest i hope that answers your question jack and a there of course ism extending the answer to all others who voted that question er who might be interested in proving their slow wave sleep there some dues there are some dots that i just described i suggest trying various things one by one to see what works best for you you do not nearly need to leap to a doing the sixty minute of exercise plustean inositol et camera however i do encourage every one to avoid alcohol an caffeine within the eight to twelve hours prior to sleep in again if you are not using either of those that would be even better at least interns of sleep architecture thank you for joining for the beginning of this ask me anything episode to hear the full episode and to hear future episodes of these ask me anything sessions plus to receive transcripts of them and transcripts of the superman labpodcast standard channel and premium tools not released anywhere else please go to superman labdodcom slash premium just to remind you why we launch the superman labpodcast premium channel truly twofold first of all it is to raise support for the standard superman labpodcast channel which of course will still be continued to be released every money in full length we are not going to change the format or anything about the standard humeral labpodcast and to fund research in particular research done on human being not animal models but on human beings which having we all agrees a species that we are most interested in and we are going to specifically fund research that is aim toward developing further protocols for mental health physical health and performance and those protocols will be distributed through all channels not just the premium channel but through all chance humeral lapocast and other media channels s the idea here is to give you information to your burning questions in depth and allow you the opportunity to support the kind of research that provides that whose kinds of answers in the first place now in especially exciting feature the premium channel is that the tiny foundation has generously offered to do a dollar for dollar match on all funds raised for research through the premium channel this is a terrific way that they are going to amplify whatever funds come in through the premium channel to further support research for science and science related tools for mental health physical health and performance if you to sign up for the auburn lab premium channel again there is a cost of ten dollars per month or you can pay one hundred dollars up front for the entire year that will give you access to all the mas you can ask questions and get answers to your questions and you will of course get anew to all the questions that other people ask as well there will also be some premium content such as transcripts of the a m as and various transcripts and protocols of superman podcast episodes not found elsewhere and again you will be supporting research for mental health physical health and performance you can sign up

when he wants to explain to people what his life is these days when he sometimes tells this story on lection night and twenty sixteen he says he went to a bar got a seat near t t order a beer i started making small talk and i turn to the guide to my right and i said did you vote and from there he went into a long explanation about some shadow government ideas and and er voting makes a difference and a probably ten minutes into what he was talking about mas shootings and then eventually sandyhook sandyhook of course where gunman killed twenty children on first crate as well a seven adults is than om stranger than star telling penny this particular story about sandyhook he thou the whole shooting was fake it had to be fake he said cause one of those first graters also shoot up as a victim in a second mass shooting all the we ever in pakistan in the corners of the inter net where people trade sandhog conspiracy stories this is a key piece of evidence that sandyhook was not real curs a was real what happened a pakistan was in reality about two years after sandyhook the than gun down more than a hundred kids there and there a public vigil and at the public vigil probably as a sign of solidarity with other kids who had died in school shootings corners had this photo of a boy from sandyhook smiling in way a spider man shirt under a cuorterya jack very cower sandhog deniers saw that in the coverage and they pounced did he die twice did he die at all to the guide the bar with penny is rattling throughout this packastanstaff and then as penny explained one my to workers meeting meek the i mentions the kid's name no a poster i an't really need to hear much more than that just needed to shut him down me finally to i took out my drivers licence i said look for your talking to show some respect the boy in the photo was penne son no he was six when he died we he sure he connected it instantly and an he just became more agitated very anger at one outside may he had a cigarette came back yield at me some more o my god how much do they pay you how can you do this here right to his believe i was the villain he behave this man at the bar pretty much redefine everything about the way when he lives his life where he lives how he lives he runs in to these boxers in person and pretty much every day on mine they think the government his paid him millions played the part of a grieving dad and never minds penny is the sick one no is never even his kid in the person who has populated these theories more than anybody his alerts ones he runs the whilst info wars and who push these theories this radio show is you to bedims onions made his name right after nine eleven fomenting the idea that nine eleven was an attack frustrated by our own government e sandyhook one said many times that he did not believe the shooting was real shade how e she than fair completely far withactors in mi vet ma factor i couldn't believe it at first i do they had actors the clearly but i thought they killed real kite an yo so how bold they are the they clearly us actors hes claimed that the government or some shadowy goal forces the ones who hired these actors he an the other hookers call them crisis actors as this whole alternate world that is his right next to the real one the makes miserable parents penny but o most parents in that situation penne decided to go all action hereon on the boxer is in on alexjohns action hero i will do what needs to get done to defend my family damn the consequences penny is resourceful his dogged he does not give up in this world that we living of hoaxers and tools he has marked out a path that i think few of us would every one intake but it is confamazing to hear what it entails did any show we have penni stop and then we have a story from river john reason were he also tries to entangle where this alternate boxer world and and the real one began d be easy chico is this america life o mir glass stay with us a guan down the rabbit hoe so very bet the transformation of penny passer was put together by meek meek i say there is some cordwoods into day's program that we have beeped for this podcast version of the show if you prefer a beepedversion it is at our inside heresmiki the first time tennis became aware of any conspiracy thirties about sandyhuk was about a month after the shooting he bent on a media black out trying to get through nosh's funeral and taking care of his two young girls they were also at the elementary school that morning and one of them was now's twin sister she hid in a separate class room but one day tennis finally felt ready to go on line by the news guggled son's name and for first coming of ans berth result an the fans e and it is just completely discussing in just over thirty days this whole world had been invented and one of the central pieces of it involved pennies wife in papers hands were dissecting this one interview she did on my ant it was with wanders cooper just days after now's funeral would ye want people to know boo he last running and playing with i siblings in in the maple bats and fire flies and e loves eating inside of oil copies and he played the video gang side adnasan ierstany use to tell his the siblings that he a that he managed to tacofactr yes that he was going to split his time as an a dust the thing manakin taco factory and be an ascent the comments on line were gross and flimsy why didn't she sound water why would she put on lipstick if she was really grieving and was not she too old to be the mam of the six behold kid they were convinced that something was up how ore you holding up o in am i most e time ism ism a not i think every by way out there he relates the fact of howling it ties we in a ban i this a land an you watch every oft o son and eve hart be e an it ties nine months to created human being and i takes sins for n a a fifteen to take that away from the surface of the earth this reference to guns was another ahamoment for conspiracy terra some of them started digging into verynetsly looked up her maiden name and then said hay look at this there is as swims diplomat who has her exact same name in even fishier this diplomat once went to an arms control summit at the united nations maybe there the same person maybe she is one of those legs goblins trying to make guns like bad president mama can repeal the second amendment suddenly every real sentiment veryneek shared about not was getting reinterpreted as lines from a sinister script they were here an they matter they all had families an they matter and the kicker that seniti for these conspiracy therms andiron cooper's nose there is this moment when the tip of his not disappears because of a digital glitch in the video what see an end says was normal interference that happens with a live slight feed its just a couple seconds but hovers would not let it go they said did it is green ran or blue scan whatever that was a far interview in heroic was a purchasepent of a fake stage to see in an interview that conspiracy fury was all over you too and it was all over you tho would knows image have talk to parents who lost his and other masshootings and they have all been blind sided by online harassment from conspiracy theorists the crisis actor claim is common now he is a tacks usually star almost immediately after victims are i deed in the media and parents who go on ten and talk about gun control veryneat they get at the worse sandy hooks when this really took off tfanilyes get stocks fending off all this crazy hate by themselves there just art that many resources for the he cause down forcemeat still has not figured out how to deal with no sober harassment and the tat companies art much help son those families just try to ignore the conspiracy theories and hope they'll eventually go away and that is what deny did for a while his life was a wrack but after about a year and a half they were still at it and he could not let it go any more i realize that i the grieving requires a coyness in a silence and all of this material was a distraction for me and it was noise and i needed to handle that noise that i could have the silence and come that i needed there is a poor love of penny with his arm wrapped around nah he is got a water's moustache and he is kneeling on a trampling with his soft smile it spring and nah has all this big brown hair fat cheeks hes snuggling his whole body into penny's class penny's got tons of family photos these tost of them in and online memorial he made for nah right after he died the sandy hook denim is downloaded them and re purpose them into cruel means wrote fake across now's face the a picture of his headstone and photo shopped under his name is not buried here lots of his daughters were circulating to he could not just leave them out throughout the web with the tools penny got consumed with making about how to take control f the situation had track not and his family from all this the garnet did not scare him it was actually his comfortsone he ran his own eyeteeth business the was not the kind of guy who star out and complained about how something did not work he was a guy who fix staff you me to find what the problems and then find what your solution is and tins tar canning closure to that solution's tat dustup otherwise the problem is overwhelming and then you just want some one else to fix it for you me you have the tract down where you can make a difference and get closer to thing less broken there was one other thing that made penny especially qualified to deal with the conspiracy theories h use to enjoy those theories in self the classic fun once big but sickness merry fifty one ass a faking the moonlanding wick what is the fun of it i it is spending your disbelief it is sitting down and watching infection all be and then looking at the wood if and it is is just fun especially if there is no price to pay in your life in his now cost to that way of thinking that it is just a game sometimes he even listened to ale's ones in his car and in fact just a month after the shootings when penny first saw those things on ales one's web sight he tried to reach out he fad a general infowarsy melldrass and shot him off this message ale and very disappointed to see how many people are directing more anger at families that lost their children in newton accusing us of being actors have not we had our share of pain and suffering i used to enjoy the seen to our shows now i feel that your type of show created these hateful people and they need to be sealed in exclamation point about an hour later he heard back from one's staff and they responded with we eve not supported the trisector clam we insisted it is a true vent not this was not true ones did spread the crisis actor theory it was on his web side at the time and he started t lying about it a lot that seen at interview with veryneiqu he talked about it all the time us we have got bit of mansion grouper we have clear blood spring out there he is not there in the foursquare we have got people clearly coming up and n an laughing in the doing the sat crying we have clearly got people where each actors playing different parts of different people give let gutted tan dotingly there is a over to there's actors the manipulating they ben caught lying and the were pee planning before it an rolled out with it what deny wanted was a one on one conversation with ones but it did not happen therware few males after that ask met prove that ism really who i am and for of leading on to it get me mocha penny did not want that he is very private and very reserved a behind the scene's kind of guide he is careful when he talks things no combat that is off the accord for do i have to talk about my personal life that came up all the time during our interview one of the groundsill he gave is that i had to run his coats past him and his lair because he is worried about his own safety if his words were is construed also he is firing some of the conspiracy therein quire we agreed to his terms and in the end he did not ask me to add it any of his quote but he did request that we remove one personal detail and we did now a year and a half after he reached out talc ones he decided to try a new tactic he go directly to clones is followers and the other sandy hook conspiracy there's bi think he his approach was ism going to make them see the light this is veryneiqu she an penny separated when the shooting happens but were still a very much in each others lives they decided to start releasing documents about not report cards schoolphotos even disclose helps deaf certificate which was a difficult decision that we made but figured after a while a providing this this hard copy convincing evidence that reason would prevail and they would say o ka ye you have made your polite it o to come around they also decided he would answer any one's questions he wanted to join this notorious face book group called sandy hook hooks it is swear a lot of the deniers were congregating and sharing theories the cover vote on their page look it came straight out of a horrmovy a corps girl with a keep quiet finger in front of her mouth the administrator of the casebook group immediately let hymen did you identify yourself is i am a father red you s yeah i was in scantly to me it seems crazy to even go there this does not exactly sound a group of people who would want a listen to you people who are conspiracy minded hat see these tragedies unfold on the internet were on television they still feel separate from these events and i considered that a bridging that gap could be an important step at a human element to this t thrift that is right and here i am ism on the person and let let us see what happens the question started pouring an why were not these children rushed the hospital's wine was not anything done weren't ye going then take or won't my doing this why was not a rest how coper called from hertfrord and i started to recognize some of the patterns the were there there are the people you would expect in a conspiracy group aunt i gun control people and i government people but also parents they were young parents with small children and they just could notwrap their minds around the reality that you nothn't indulge can look and children in their eyes and bullet into their heat they just cannot deal with that the conversation on this casebook group quickly got ugly and abusive some of the members started using antisemitic firs liny was trying everything to keep up a report with them even told them i listen to ale ones in my car i us to argue with people about nine eleven being an inside job i entertain that we did not go to the moon but it did not work he started blocking people and fighting back this got him booted from the group whats remarkable is just how up for this whole fight he was when a bunch of people kept private messaging him penny thought what it'll to start my own jackboot group he called it conspiracy their synonymous this name was men as a joke he has a dry sense of humor anyway he made some progress with people the people who were not full blown deniers who actually wanted help parking out the truth of what really happened but they dropped away once they got answers and pretty soon the only one's last were just dark sadistic trolls coming in to entertain themselves one of genie's worst trolls was a guinea wolf gang calling that is his real name by the way he is a retired schools security expert in fora who probably the number one new town hoax are in the world this guy travels to newton appeared is an asper on ale ones is show he is even called for newton parents to exhume the bodies of their children to prove that their at hall ten ordered a background check on penny then sending out in demon to lots of people it was almost a hundred pages the seen everything from his social security number and to number to almost every address he would never lived at with tholos names of his relatives were included to the online harassment had become intents that penny and very need and their two girls went into hiding they wove been to spear ate high security gaited communities but pennies address kept getting expose and hooker started posting videos of where he lived one apartment that i had move them to it'd only live there i think for a month and i got a call from a particular hoagie who happens to be and prison now for i hap a murder and down he called me out any was acting a harass an then red me my security number and then red me my address where i just move then to and i sad o and a in to department that much anyway and an i move shortly after that to try andthrow the hovers off penny started putting fertility bills in different names and got multiple per boxes all over the place all this force liny into a new battle strategy if they were good exposed him he did the same to them he wrote newspaper all bad cling out habit and the others by name and when these hoaxers posted his new address as on line he did the same to them he also made it to that if you goggled their names the first thing any one would see was all the sandyhood garbage they would created and penny being penny decided to write a biography about wolf gang habit's life called the hooks of a lifetime he really sits an we book penny became the one who knocks he calls us troll rustling it is trolling the trolls he gets both energized and sheepish when talking about it e insists sometimes the only way to fight hard for hoaxers is a turn the tables on them and it worked on some of them freak them out still penne was just one guys and every day new mountains of contents about now over showing up on line his crusaded was a lonely one the hoaxer seemed dangerous those o the other newton parents wanted to stay as far away as possible from them and i darker moments the conspiracy part of me would return and ask myself an i the only one that lost o child why am i the only one fighting thank how is o and people were trampling all over other peoples children memories and the child n no longer had of wish to defend himself and people were just silent about it but while penny was escalating his tactics was the other side around the second anniversary of sandy hook a small group of conspiracy theorists made an almost three hour move on you tore questioning the shooting the described themselves as independent journalists and researchers but their backgrounds were totally random they included a magician the owner of a moving company a guys who been trusted for stabbing some one five times and a stay at home dad i dust have an idea that i wanted to be an underground sill maker myself this is dug acquire he says he went this group on line on you tore and got brought in at the end to help polish the move it felt exciting at the time dug was a struggling fill maker and loss angels occasionally did some stump work he got i to conspiracy theories the way lots of people do watching them on you to lenis he loved the ones about big foot new foes but then he went to look up news about sandy hook and you tools recommendation system started suggesting hoax idiot he did not believe the theory that the kids were actors he thought children died but he felt pretty sure there was some other kind of cover up going on maybe one with the mafia and where did you get that information where did you come up with this idea of a mob had you run this somewhere a no wheres cause i make move i think i have an actor imagination we let am confuse the what was are thinking a a family head done some one wrong my we say the move good fellows o a i henry hill is is hiding out in a little village is h wheels mention kinnervurton cop but when they rely their film they uploaded it to a bunch of different accounts on places you tore visit daily motion pretty soon it was showing up everywhere to combat this when he had a changed tactics one final time no more talking to hoaxers one on on now the thing he would focus on was content removal scrubbing their stuff off the inner neat he decided he was going to get every single copy of the my taken down which was not going to be easy he could not just right into you tore and say hey the radio was full of lives that was not gong to be enough the internet is full of live he needed something else and he realized he had at these conspiracy therms had use photos and videos of him and not and vareneet those were his property taking this move a copy right violation the stolen images were now a useful weapon when he tracked down every place where this radio was posted and he probably seen thus there is little button you can click on to report stuff that is what he did for hours every day and success sort off the hoaxers kept reporting and moving the video on t other sides the crazies and o running the sign it is it is the play forms who ere allowing this to go on that edifies it for me that we have to just remove all of this carnage and that is all we need to do but this of course pesto a lot of hoaxers we don't know what is goon on we just told can look right alit stones he was stumped penny had successfully forced the imfulwar sight to remove pictures of not using copy right show from tray this is amazing the clamant us penny pager they think the us takin hold out little a in shay were shutting peoples at she ton because there the little in he memory the children no ore not wet even if we ware you cult vile i our first to moment because that what there for be you take all right you taken mi right i let ones put one of the guides he worked on the move on the air his name is bran his formalabama a what do you that of us think she our what an actin you a the d berry ha very lot about we it w on be you i a rubecrol in that ye i me of the that shat as town when were just in castigating in and looking at all said it must be horrible for shot there that the yeomanly ti is stage i show shut she just to chemically one of you voter i we even put up a i ye shown at e he ut at e copy right grip e e without yon copy try grit a the people are i a a you you e gory might re i coy wow on i the show a was join n other the et of major a takin all the age o only are they wonder ut the bid off go after mow ran in this vine anneal too one shod his hands he had millions of them penny's e out the city he lived in and the address picked up his mail even held up some salute shots from gugorth penny to this video taken down too flagging it for privacy by nations but it did not matter the hovers had taken on a mob o mentality pursuing an harassing money this is an infiwarst man named lucky orchards who left multiple death threats on money phone ha you a a a a o he a an a a ha a an we an a nan r varia a a ha habit a y a e but e had eat o she said look behind you death is coming to you real soon penny was already living in hiding he would move multiple times by then because hoaxers kept tracking down his address but now the chances that a hoaxer might show up at his door and kill him suddenly felt much hire his kids were living with hin half the week and he worried about them at the same time he did not consider stopping he did not think it would make them safer that is one of the misconceptions that exist that people think that am only targeted because of challenging the content and that is not the case i took the action because i was being targeted sos my address is published all over the internal my food is published all over the internal and my living children foods are published on line that is existed before i did anything i dare not cause the targeting it was already there i has minimizing the targeting he poaxtad receives for firearms it'd asked if he actually bought them and he would not give me an answer amidst all this penny kept up his daily ritual he would wake up make copy and then sit in front of his computer for hours flagging content trying to systematically race not from the sandy hook hook story there was a lot of stuff he could not invoke copy right law for the death threats in harassment that was much harder to get taken down the tat companies were weary of becoming arbiters of truth making decisions about what its users could and could not say but penny in his usual methodical fashion kept chipping away on you too he kept a score card once he nailed some one with three copy right strikes you two would remove their accounts he killed thousands of videos this way the hoaxers called this getting posted he become a hash tag then he and verineek help get a professor in florid named names track fired the sky at harass then for years an kept she know his image to promote his conspiracy theories he is also the one who held popular eyes the conspiracy term crisis actor on his blog right after the shooting and that woman who was leaving death threats lucky orchards penny reported her to the police and they arrested her she was sentence to five months in jail the judge rebuked her for going after penny saying quote this is a reality and there is no fiction there are no alternative facts he barred her from infowars and thither conspiracy web sits is one of the conditions of her panel won surprising thing that happened over the ears is that some of the hoaxers who used to harass penny flip to his side there were dozens of them penny says these were people who came to him only after they changed their own minds not people he tried to convert he says that never works it is a waste of time some of them became disenchanted when they saw sandy hook hoaxers who were more intrusted and photo shopping evidence and getting on line followers than tracking down the truth one of them was dug who worked on that hoax removing about sandyhook and twenty sixteen he found a number for liny and left a voice me my any pardoner this is dead dug my guide if you ever need me if you ever want to get hold of me and and learn about what all these people are up too ah here is my number did you apologize in that message ah i do not believe i did not surprisingly penny did not return its call dug was reaching out to penny because the hoaxers had turned on him too he says he started feuding with some of them after he made a via exposing a christian you tuber who was making money a false outrageous claims all the social me e accounts than got fact penny was the only person he could think of who knew how to fight back he wanted advice he tried him again and got through he told tennis that it felt heathen sort of brainwash that he been on a rollercoaster ride that he wanted to switch sides tennis had started a non profit called the honor net work were volunteers help families from mash tragedies fight digital harassment dug began helping him scrub content when you were doing it did you for he were doing penance yet yet and my heart is very heavy for this were you surprised at how quickly penny let you in am yet and i still i ah the fact that he even is giving me a chance ah ism very humbled i tell him my love em ah i tell him that he is my mentor ah sometimes i call him boss and he says do not call me boss ah a you apologized to other families at sandyhook ne i think oh just to try to li call up a young one of these families that they do not think me to hear from somecin you two brigand lossangelis i think li one day ah i am very sorry ah very sorry ah any problems to any victim dug is now one of penny's most devoted volunteers lye's got more than a hundred people helping him out at any given time tho the burn out ride as high because the work is in tents and hooker's harass volunteers dug all the time for helping long when penni goggles know his name now he no longer gets page after page of hooks or content a lot of it is gone now instead the first hits that come up our news articles about penny's fight to make the tat companies more accountable for years he is been criticizing them in the pass for not doing more to protect families of mash tragedies from an mine abuse last summer he and very meet called out mark uckerburg in an open letter in the guardian they wrote quote you arguably the most powerful man on the planet have deemed that the attacks on us are in material that providing assistance in removing threats is too cumbersome and that our lives are less important than providing a safe haven for hate shortly her casebook reached out to penny he started working with their content moderators and policy makers and says there response times are now much faster he also help turn up the heat on ale ones last spring he an very meek and another at from new town fix defamation lawsuits against him their parents followed with their own so a few months later aplstarde removing ones is material from i tunes same they would

online reporter contest four years earlier to work for info was he was a young and angry ale ones fan back then committed to exposing the shadowy elites but now he was disillusioned because ale had changed and a final straw was the muslin ale had lately been brook asking untrue stories about america muslin running secret terrorist training camps in the casual mountains of new york and cheering the nine eleven attack here he is talking then candidate dona trump you are vindicated on the magical mural shoran legit new jerry but new york cow skin all over it what do you have sh e still acting you well it to go to of he an was very strong order and i just one of iris messing your reputations amazing i will not let you down is josh we found himself intimately involved in the business of demonizing muslin this was not why he would signed up these were not powerful lets they were regular people recently joshborded a plain and shat next to a muslin family the little girl was laughing her face press to the window josh looked at her and he hated himself and soon after he began testing me he wanted to make commends he said he knew he should quit working for ale but it was hard ale paid him well and although he had seen ale scream at people in the office and punch cabinets and rip down blinds he would only ever bee nice to just as we continued to talk i realized that josh had not come to tell me any specific secret about ale he just once to vent's frustrations to somebody else who had known him a long time but then he said oh here is a story the thing josh told me then would if true hotly strike the story of he ale ones became ales ones first he so know the ale's account of origin story but what got him obsessed with rooting out conspiracies he folded a few times to the rolling stone journalist oleander's chick and growing monologues on his show n i was skin ears and and i be had pogge in would come i a there of to pot the corgi end come et shell bags of drugs people this took place in the dales suburb of rockoon where ale grew up and i would ta stool they weld he that or to meeting about drug justyis of the he they had carps up there that at you would drug your just jupusad i was o pillory he was shown coca expose at we they took me an laughs where i hemin the wall told me wall i rule you if you do not shall up they say you from about the we it know for he moved out or are because of a place corruption in rockoon had opened ale's eyes to the existence of powerful cabals can exposing them it would become his calling and at all began at that school assembly that is ale's origin story but according to josh it was not true the true story he said was much more revealing an it was also a big secret josh said book have heard the story a couple of times from shouted friends and family members very few people in the office no it but when ones was a tea anger he was a bully no one liked him because he was a bully there was a group of kids hat felt unsafe around him anti there came up with a plan to crick him the invited him out to a party in a barn it was a trap josh said they beat him within an inch of his life that is why his family moved to at i his whole family up rooted him and moved into a completely different city because of this crazy thing that happened to him josh said having as guides conspire against ale by luring him to that party was the real reason he got obsessed with conspiracies he had been the victim of one john i parted soon after that i walked around replaying our conversation and wandering fashion look

barn it was a house but more importantly the way josh told it the fight was the thing that made ale a conspiracy forest but had said no that is not true hes said ale always had his theories even before then i he had someday about the frit pen won teaches in the in the school cap and everybody yen do it if we were it a om it is o i was ta gather on barn he do not hard the he don go e d ain ashen did a we re man i era i a i as i social my gar i ma li to shut et maul i go if if race shaft to areas can be here with you give is a thursday in february ale as talking to me from this studio in often ism at home in new york i think the crazy staff ale is referring to by the way is that a judge as just ordered him to give a sworn deposition in the courtcase bought against him by some salty hook parents except one condition for doing this interview he wanted to make a brief statement though my story is not about salty hook this is what he wants to say so ho my shiny of statement looking back before i was ever should yes ago i review the information and i do believe the hard shiny hook an by the way that is only sort of true even after ale first admitted that children died at sandy hook hedged saying they probably died and i ten to believe they died have apologize the family many time in why few years ho my reporting has cause this any pan hes apologies a contentious because he is apologized but then continued to cast does on the shootings i never shared did any one should rase the victims fame and i ask the media o police stop sharing that i have shed that as best as we can tell ale never directly instructed his hands to harass the families but on his broadcasts he repeatedly talked about deny posters ex wife grandson and he gave posters mailing address and show gugalearth shots of the building and said he would probably have to go there himself is any one else ho lis going erase the family to stop whatever shiny hook an some events tragedy the need to be recognize its time for us to come together as america ans human and the fin the wive of children and other essential o diventual's period ale declines to answer follow up questions about sandy hook i

ask in after that pay ye o e oo e e o eon e a o o e yo a o e o so e e o to this is the story josh had told me in the hotel lobby i jarred told me is the story ale swears is untrue ale's family would not talk to us i cannot say exactly why they finally moved out of rockaway in our interview ale retold the story of the school assembly but he also named other reasons for their move like how was often born mother was homesick and fed up with all the fighting the end what seems clear is that this fight happens and the assembly where ale outed the drugdealing cops probably never did if i had to guess i would say that ale is replaced o true stories when he is humiliated at a party wit a different story for he is a hero standing up to corrupt cops and getting beaten up for his bravery in a way at the same story as o one wit the whole footbortiand came at him in a balas is the character he plays on infra was the beleaguer hero attacked from all sides bloodbath but undaunted and emerging the victor s stories little kids tell about themselves ales disputes most of the other things of people told me about him he says he did not pretend to be the antichrist in high school says he did not roll his eyes back in his head or dye his tongue black he says he never told a classmate how he would to raper he calls all of that in same garbage he says he does not punch cabinets or it down blinds

the benchvirsthrorsponsor by express vein i talk about the most over single show why haven't you gotten o vepianet it express vein right you express vepianta cam slashed the goal of the current wave of procomas protest is very simple the goal is not to protest in favor of palistinians of course if it were protestors would have been out in the streets for last twenty years pushing for comes alters since comas was telling literally billions of dollars and using it to build terror tunnels and rockets and they were killing anyone who oppose them the goal is not even to make a political point really politicians may try to translate the obviously pro terrorism in antiseptic messages of these procomas protest into political speak my try to make it about a sense fire or negotiations or two state solution but that is not what these protests are about these protests are about intimidation it is that simple the size and virulent of the protest is designed to intimidate this is why the protests are not generally calm or peaceful they are generally rounded hey are very often violent the involve assaults on police officers and on news unlucky enough to fall within arms grass yesterday a procomas rely in new york city for example ended with the procomasnic hitting a jewfish man in the head with a chair this of course is not a saran hate crimes against news are up over two hundred per cent in new york city the process protestors will descend on the museum of tolerances in irony almost too thick to believe in order to assault news and reporters watching a compilation of comes atrocities in the gaze envelope all of this on the eve of the anniversary of crystalnached the kick off a violent nocuatrocities against news in nineteen thirty eight here is what that look you can see people screaming three palestine trying to bee people up as they enter the museum of tolerance museum tolerate by the wight its right on peopeuple of a iran one less jewfish areas of the city and pro palestine protestors procomas protestor shut up to tried be people up of course we have seen these tactics all over the world protestors attacking police officers in onion defacing historic statues and putting the mafia on ben franklin climbing the walls of the white house we have seen protestors chancing openly for the slaughter of news calling openly for the destruction of the state of israel itself on compasses across the nation yes have been surrounded pushed around threatened here as you sealed yesterday my almamater where one woman scream to beat that ping new as protestors beat up a pineta of his really prime minister benjamin inti yahoos he can see them man beating an pinto wit stick and and screaming the top of their lungs you see a one get come up grab the itinahopanada and star cunning at meaning it while everyone sheers in the united kingdom jewfish students are now fried to go to class according to reporter e town smaller quote in pistol a jewfish sudden was told you and your family are money grabbing murdering muslin people another in birmingham received an instrogramassage from a stranger warning quote may a slow and painful death be granted to you and every other in is you a university rabbi also received a direct message on the platform quote you massacre innocent muscles i hope you die too in warlock a jewfish students whats group was sinful traded by at least three different people bombarding freshers with the message shown to me including fog dirty jewfish calisrael going humanity n mud ring a and free palestine all that was scald wrong of course over it am i the last night a costing two students there jewfish and is raliamatee students were physically prevented from attending class by a hostile group of pro comas students calling themselves the c a a the the administration warn them to clear and get out of the way or they would be suspended they were nod none of this falls into the rum of politics it is mere intimidation it is show of strength it is a threat the idea is very simple there are millions of us the camps supporters we are in your streets we are in your classrooms we are in your companies you'll say and do anything we exploiting your western weakness you will import more of us your sons and daughters will join us in marching against your values your law and foremen organs will wash us passively as we do all of this and you will do nothing that is the message the goal of the procomas protest and rallies crosstie west is make news and western allies afraid by showing they have no limits process forces in the west hope to force their enemies into acquiescence their goal is to play on the emotions of soft head liberals who quite anger with justification who believe that the angrier the protestor the more that anger mas spring from oppression the only way s relieve that anger therefore is to relieve the supposed oppression to surrender and the west is filled with those who would surrender the latest example comes courtesy of the washington post yesterday the washington post removed to comic by famed cartons michael cameras here is what it look for those who cannot see it is a camps member it is a camaspokes person and tied to him our babies an innocent woman in the corner you can see a picture of the leader of casbolag and a and pausing in flag and this comaspokes person is saying how air is real attaxivillians this of course is an accurate cartoon this is indeed compass strategy to hide behind civilians particularly children while blaming immunity and the depiction of the mamas figure is based agamas senior official nosy came whose most recently seen explaining away the slaughter of news and then pledging repeat that slaughter here is what gosh coma looks in real life and here is what he looks in the cartoon this is very obviously gosh came no matter the cmasnixs in the washington post offices promptly intimidated the washington post into fully pulling the cartoon these on false accusations of resist editorial pagederative is ship said quote a cartoon we published by michaelr miss on the warn fossa a cartoon whose pull cation i proves was seen by many readers as races this was not my intent i saw the drawing as a caricature of a specific individual the comasspokes person who celebrated the attacks on unarmed civilians in israel however the reactions the image convinced me that i had missed something profound and decisive and i regret that again it is the reaction that convinced him it is not the actual content it is the reaction the angrier people get at him the more they must be justified send a modally a staffer at the washington post celebrated on the company slap pedalo in surprisingly it is pretty obviously piratical procomasne her twitterfeet contains allegations of his daily genocide and blame israel for the bombing of the allokley hospital those palsinan islomicche hod perfect contains precisely zero condemnations of comas but the post cave to her and her allies they don't cave to her because of the inherent content of the cartoon in fact here is another carton that still up on the post you to page ire's a cartoon that is effectively a blood bible falsely depicting prim minister bedesman insyahu punching a palisinian baby tin thdefates where ignoring a comas terrorists the caption reeds israel pounds come targets in goa the idea being that beefy is looking specifically at the terrace ignoring the terrorist to punch and presumably kill the baby that is a blood libel it is still up on the washington post you two page this is the story in the media o these days they will defend hitter supporters who hade israel but they will dump cartoons that label comas terrorists that is presumably why the york times spent its day yesterday defending stringers button quote who ere participating in comes terrace attacks of october seven they are literal pictures of some of those stringers carrying grenades to the actual attacks must not upset the atomic radicals and the alomograticals know that the spineless media will cave to their demands that is why rivers invaded the offices of the york times yesterday according to the yorktalinews quote a demonstrator set off a smoke pom it's about thirty others breached the lobby were witnesses said security guards let them briefly chances one witness sad quote it was fifteen to twenty of them doing the actual damage with guitar pictures the i would set up is camera and then they would be spray painting windows here is some footage of what it looked last night outside the york times building an inside wit the near times building is it the giant crowd gather right outside of he you times building chanting theylso make for to spray paint of con cop cars with three gosh and where is offer marmbual being arrested why is it become open season on cobs these spray paint at a cop car with id f c k bag since when is tax pair funded property open season for procomasnecs the protestors who entered the york times building claimed against t all available evidence and they were invading the times building because the times was somehow pro israel which is absurd the n york times is most untie israel publication in major leggacymedia saying that the times is somehow proisrael is saying that prove a is two pro america now the protestors know that they're not all the ways stupid the a purpose of their many riot was simple keep the we york times intimidated believing that the anger they are demonstrating must be the result of some sort of oppression again that is how works in the media the angrier the supposedly oppressed percent the more they deserve your acquiescence and surrender intimidation does work all of this is reminiscence of the shaley heads scandal of two thousand six when that publication printed a cartoon of hammed the profit saying quote it is hard being love by jerks amid the massive protests french president junk spinach condemned the magazine for duo overt provocations well you know that spend a bunch of terrorism against charge habdoh in to thousand eleven the offices were fire boy by historic radicals in two thousand fifteen two his comic radicals murdered twelve people in the shaley at do offices the same people who in two thousand six were claiming the shaley eddo as the aggressor by two thousand fifteen ere out in the streets saying yes we shaley habdoh which was a lie they were never in favor of shaley a dose speech they are in favor of weakness weakness breeds egression the aggressive push because they sent the weakness this is what we are seen in the streets its why random alleys now feature overt threats to kill news there is one in florid yesterday it's point o right now to killjoy amid om of you right now i go in c for his people he says he would go to the gosestrip and he would kill you this sort of behavior is absolutely run the mill at brooms valleys this is not a peaceful mark these are not just people who are chanting for political cease fire the intimidation is the points it is the reason for increasingly violent attacks on jewels internationally it is why the is an attempted shooting at a montreall jewfish school yesterday what should the west do the answer is to be intimidated do not cave in to the radicals if they get aggressive they should be confronted if they get violent they should be arrested by law enforcement that is literally the job of law enforcement if they are not citizens and thy support humans they should be deported to countries that better reflect their awful values no more weakness unless you want more terrorist more terror supporters and more dead innocence hair just one second we are going to get to the west continuing to start to cave because again the oppressor oppress matrices is the death of the west it is the ethenes will gets that one second first veterans say is upon us our friends over a buttock been working toward alleviating ten million dollars in veteronsette thanks your support they are over ninety per cent to that gold to day think about this thou us military is made up of one hundred percent volunteers these are men and come who willingly sacrifice everything they have for the country when they are unnerving they are turn home to a tight chop market and outrageous living expenses that is why ism happy that there is a private company partook that is jumped into help when you switch to burdock's lightning fast five you network they will do not it a portion of every new order too this excellent cause the can make a real difference just by choosing superior cellphone service and again i use puritan i know how good pure talk is pure tons plan start to twenbux most they offer on limited talk text more data and mobile hot spot just tun in over to pure talk dot come slash chipuro and make that switch butts help was the burden on the many women of given much for the country is at are take dot come slashapro switch to pure talk to day it is a door you are making yourself on coverage better andyursa money and at the same time theuctually helping fell america veterans it is the right move it is the america we visit puritan dot come slash shipuro today go check him out right now and meanwhile the weakness of the west is being made apparent pretty much every single day all all these talks about how israel these more humanitarian pluses they need a sense fire morcuman attempts secures the thing israel right now by the available data is being more targeted in an urban area than literally any army in human history the actual ratio of derris killed to innocence killed is probably about one to one and that is awful that is terrible it is also entirely because compasses strategy into hide behind civilians knowing that if they get the media on their said that if they get the leftest on their side if they can demonstrate anger in the streets that there will be an attempt to call off the dogs they'll be an attempt to preserve compass in its position of power that is the goal here and again they the the goal is to intimidate this is why you have seen a wide spread media attempt to pin jo bisons personal unpopularity on his support for israel but that is not where the data are the reality is that bison support for israel is quite popular in the united states the america people do not support compass the reality is that by eighty for to sixteen per cent in the latest hazard cap terispol america support israel overcomes and just as many believe that israel is justified in its response the to say piece written by mark pen at the waltz journal he is a poster an adviser to bill in hilly canton the is not coming from republican who wishes to see job win is coming from a democrat who wishes to see jobidon win according too mark pen he says it is true that the sixteen per cent who support comas include many democrats as eighteen to twenty foyrolds split only fifty two to forty eight in israel favor but are those democrats going to vote for dona trump who move the you embassy to jerusalem in the end they will come home as they always do bringing home swing voters will take more than israel policy israel ranks seventh among the issues of chief concern to america voters if jobidon can mac progress on the other priorities he is reduced to running a negative campaign against trump but the reality is that jobidon's israel position is actually widely popular that is why you are seeing these protests grow in size in virulence as they attempt to convince jobidon that if he does not push israel off the mark the they will somehow lead to his defeat dezwisu recruited to lead threatening that her followers ain't can vote for bison again mark pen is carrack where they devil for trump from most pro israel present i america history bar non this is why you see jo bisons staffers wearing routinely to the media an attempt to under cut him in the york times today remember this the you times we should remember a costing two all of theses protesters zero israel newspaper which gain insane they printed a story to day called is rally forces have limited time an gosh yours official say who and these people quote as senior biding officials push israel to do more in my civilian casualties general charges cue brown junior the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff set on wednesday he was worried each civilian killing goa could generate future members of common which by the way this is the summit argument you ever here it is really a stupid argument that that is the same argument as my gashing during read war to if we killed to manganates and to menus villains get killed was were killing amazes were just going to create new patsies it is the most self serving catch trying to argument of all time than one worry about the when we are killing everyone israel almagosh if we kill to many members of sis yummy people it is on radicals millions people all over the world would be radicalized by is taking out sis that is not the way this works again what creates derris is hope of defeating the west that is why they multiply when you think that a movement is going to lose you typically do not join the movement but according to the near times general browns comments offered a rare glimpse of division between israel an the bid administration it came as the united nation secretary general atonal guttettas see the number of civilians killed in the gosestrip showed him there is something clearly wrong with israel military operation against comas now again these staffs that are coming out from the gosestrip are solely from commas commas lies about the stuff all the time they label cams terrorist as civilians all the time very often you will see a stacomous like eighty people killed seventy of them cavilings and it turns out seventy themerteris and ten of them were civilians because it's just a guy who is eighteen years old with a on but he was actually us roaring genes and teacher is not uniform according to the near times however the level of carnet has deeply shaken israel and shipped its military response the longer the is rally military campaign continues the greater the chance the conflict will spark a wider war several officials in the bide administration side that of course is again a lari actually if israel radically escalates and starts going wholehog just o get this thing done with that escalates the chances of a harsh response the been low level conflict in the bialies for literally my life time my parents lifetime as long israel been around the only times it is broken into war is when there is an overt feeling the israel can be overcome it is the bided ministration again is going wobbly that is not particular shock and that is due once again two all of the public pressure that is being brought to bear by procomas protestors and their allies in the media this presumably is why to kidnaps out they are saying have been asking israel for longer pauses for humanity causes israel is literally taking multiple our gaps in the middle of the day there is lot's o tape of this and there are guarding civilian corridors is o comascarding the civilians it is israel spending its own blood an tressure to guard civilian corridors stet palisinians can walk from the areas that israel is targeting away from those areas known out israel has now set up a field h hospital four palistinian grabs on the beach in gaze why because when they are gone there can have to going to all shiefuk as all she a hospital has been cases military headquarters for literally to decades when they do that the are going to have to move sick patients from one place to another come ass meanwhile ism's waiting for israel to killers that can brags the cameras about it but here is jobidon doing this silly routine about how israel means long or humanitarian pauses o a but if commons is not actually going to release the hostages that is just allowing them time to regroup and re arm the only reason he is doing this is once again the by administration is trying to play it both sides they are trying to say yow were proisrael paperback and ins true they are and at the same time they are simultaneously under cutting that by claiming that israel is violating human restricts not true by claiming that israel needs to do more to protect civilians even israel is doing more militarily to protect civilians than any army in history including the america army in places a rock or aft gannistan again all of this under cotes it it actually undercuts the ability of israel to finish off the bag goes now there is going to be response by the west to all of us that that response is slow boiling when it comes to a head it is going to be really ugly

dot cam for full offer details the folks meanwhile the west is going to have to respond at some point to the fact that it is honey combe with people who support actual terrorism and that starting to happen already in rope it is income to a had tomorrow in onion onion has seen hundreds of thousands of people protesting in the streets for camps screaming about how israel should be obliterated screaming antiseptic slogan firing fireworks at officers defacing historic statues attempting to deface the senator which is a central monument to the dead in world were one and then it was extended to world war to tomorrow is artist stay in luondod and again they are expecting a giant procamas rally the goal of that is again intimidation and it is expected that there is going to be a fair bit of controversy maybes viands because some of the people on to show up to count er protest are our people where a tempting to protect those monuments when the people who is come under fire is swell brakeman she is the home secretary she she is excellent swell braver in bathe way alien she gave a speech at a i recently all about all about the failure of the west to take stock of the people entering the country she is totally right about thus well now she's under pressure because reship sounds is thinking about maybe dumping her she wrote an article accusing police of bias and allowing the procomas protests she claim that some senior officers apparently play favorites andapparently the prime minister did not sign off on all of that downing street says it is still investigating how the article containing in fumitory comparison between pro palisinian mobs and marches in northern ireland was sent to the times for publication sumac is not firing her yet she claim that mob protests were largely ignore by officers even one clearly breaking the wall that is one hundred precentor and you can see it happening in real time and we have tape of it we have protestors literally firing fireworks at officers in onion and the officers doing nothing and meanwhile telling people who are holding brutish lack they cannot put the brutish flags right there we have video of police officers in onion a resting people for saying the procamosnic should be deported and meanwhile you have procomas protesters who are intimidating breaking windows doing what they do naturally all of the controversy's about swell a brakeman noticing this to the way that this insanity works is it swell brakeman noticed and that means that she is bad according to the puca independent reshes snack is under pressure to sack swell a brakeman after she define downing street by publishing article accusing those police officers a bias over protest in support a palestine but that is not what the protests are about my friend doubles marry is pointed the out if youctually look at the tape of the protest this is not a quitting pro palestine protest it is a pro comose protest that is why they were not protesting against compass five minutes ago every one understands that even if you are an advocate of the two state solution which get his fantasy land given the fact that the palistinians themselves are incredibly raticlises n have no desire for to state solution but even if your and you would be in favor of comes being got in rid of but nobody is actually talking about getting rid of compass id is very very likely actually that there will be some sort of conflict the royal brutish legion has defended pro palistinian demonstrators right to protestomen a furious row over whether a rally should be allowed to go ahead on arms to say the royalbrish legion has urged protesters to be peaceful and show respect as corner's flock to onion this we can to remember war dead in a statement the arm forces charities at the brutish arm force to play vital rule and protecting the rights and freedoms of everyone nutcase society including the right to protest where not aware of any protest during the arbiall remembrance vents we hope events can go ahead over the we can without disruption at we will see at we will see apparently the latest prokomss march through onion is due to take place not only tomorrow but they have now mapped out were exactly there going the six organizing groups behind the demonstration had faced calls from the at police to postpone they're march on the grounds that would clash with remembrance services first of all if you have a march that is going to clash with the remembrance service for fallen soldiers in the up that should say something about the marchers that should say something about the marchers if they are marching for piece and love there would be no clash with the possibility of people who are who are marching to remember war dead tit is pretty obvious the orientation of many of these marchers the let's commissioners tor ark rally ultimately decided to give the march a green light the lord by parliament are clear there is absorb no powered am protest said seamark he added the marchers had shown a complete willingness to stay away from the senega and whitewall and have no intention of disrupting the nations remembrance event ahem we will see if it goes quite as they think it is going to go meanwhile men laden over in france is beginning to gain more support because of this the simple facts the matter is that france which has an extremely large muslin population they the muslin population of france right now is about three point for million museums about five percent of the total population pew research center predict that the muslin populationwal rise to between eight point six million which is about twelve and a half percent of the country in twenty fifty this one of the rolling threats that people are perceiving because again they are in tire districts of parts that again is very controversial to say but its realities are no goons people leave them alone the police do not want to go in there the same thing happens in ares of onion by the way there certain precincts when he police just do not want to go in fact under the highmagration scenario that pew research estimates they say that the per cent hurewoul be the percentage of muslin in the e u by to entry fifty under a high migration scenario thorite per cent of sweden seventeen per cent of norway fifteen per cent of finland twenty per cent of germany eighteen per cent of francs twenty per cent of austria seventeen per cent of the puca at those are very very high numbers because again a huge per centare of this population as we are seeing from the proud it now is not in fact assimilating to western values even under a lower estimate those are big big numbers and the blowback has begun and your starting to see righting parties who are gaining credibility because of this marina pen who is the the leader of the national rally party originally founded by her father scholmarila pen cholmarie was a pretty vicious antiseptic marine has not been at least an in police or practice and marine is trying to now join she so again was in a run off for the for the leadership of the country in the last election cycle and she is now joining in an anti antisematismrallilic to fight antisemitism because the case the she is making is that frame is imported too many radical museums which of course actually happens to be true a mornings the associate press french far right my to marina pen has set up a cocoffiny of criticism over her plans to attend we can march to protest rising antisemitism in france pro minister elizabeth born numerous political parties end citizen's a to attend that sundae marshal pen has said she in her national party rally party also will be there the paries corn present horn bordello said in in interview he does not think jomarila pennis antiseptic a remark that revived the lunch between past an present government spokes percent olive obviate veranda had wednesday the marina pens party does not have a place at what is up is a grand civic march fights sat everybody is free to show up again one of things get to happen as you see a rising a rising level of radical muscle a activity in the west you are going to see parties marina pan who are going to start seeing electoral electoral victory that is not thing that is going to continue to happen because it turns out at eventually the we can ascend eventually people in the west get tired of this sort of stuff and the blowback is extremely real it will be fascinating to see what happens to morrow in onion they'll be a very good early indicator of just where the west is going if the curing stasis of weakness toward radical is slum continues i can meanwhile an jobidon is continuing to have serious electoral problems ill get to those in just one women first venteranstay is now upon us is time we step up and help give back to those who have served our nations are forces is t where black rifle coffee company comes in as a veteran

america coffee oka jobidon is having trouble on number of fronts the media are trying to chalk it up to the israel compass war that is not why yous having trouble in fact is approvalratings are basically stagnant they been stagnant for quite a while because he is not very good at the president thing ism looking at his approval ratings right now and what you see is the jobidon's approvalrating's right now basically the same as they were in no back and jury of twenty twenty two nothing has really changed been pretty stagnant the reason for that is because they are a bunch of boiling problems one of those probing continues to be illegal immigration in fact take emerged yesterday is not him good for join timer gesture of legal immigrants on their way to the united states and as they were marching they were cheering jobidon's name that is every republican attack ad for now until the election just young men a man's entirely young men there get not clout of not a lot of women in children an at in that crowd ism these are these supposed refuges and they are cheering jobidon's name you en you connect tat to the fact that the illegal migration is but it is bad the texts literally had to this week absorb land in the real grands an attempt to stop a legal immigration according to the ache daily mail the texts general land offsonouncin aril state troopers could clear out two islands near legal pass five months later land commissioner n on buckingham added another in fronting that part of operation flat top texts pointed to old maps that claim the islands in the middle of the red grand were always part of texts frontal island is the largest the measures about a hundred n seventy acres one's full of lush greenery it has been stripped to dirt and line with barbed wire in the past week why because the legal emigrants were showing up and then they were using the as the launching point to cross the real grand front an island notice the singlemost dangerous spot on the southern board is clear to patrol buckingham treated on nonmember first lieutenant cries all of eras told news forward in tonic the reclaimed islands were mostly used for a legal border crossings he said we see the influx of e legal emigrants coming across they would use those pieces of land as a refuge notes medical migrants either data from the department of homeland security showed thousands of chines migrants illegally cross the red grand by way of mexico in twenty twenty three by the way they're terrorist threats who cross the real grand to it turns out the when you cannot actually clear people car crossing the border you have avoided who they are far tell soldiers have ben crossing the borg using these islandstho texts literally hade to claim islands in the middle of the real grand just a clear them of the possibility being used for a legal immigration meanwhile in your latest plowable illegal emigration crime story was shaw reporting over at hot air this week ice managed to arresting he legal emigrant from honors in virgin he was charged with fell in escape by force threat or intimidation abduction by force and assault on a family member that is bad enough by itself but after digging into the start backs background story becomes even worse this the third time he has been arrested on similar charges and yet somehow he kept wining up back on the streets they know where when and how he got into the country how many more him are lurking out there apparently he entered the united states on an unknown date and unknown location he was not inspected or admitted by an emigration official he was previously arrested by for patrol near rotates in tune twenty twenty one he was then given that famous notice to a peer before a debate migration judge and then he just absconded he was later arrested in jury twenty twenty three by the heroin police department and charge with fellow you rate by force toreador intimidation a auction by force and assault on a family member was been in the country since twenty twenty one he was detained at the border he was told the chosen sort and then hes wet and did a series of violent crimes there is a lot of this going on in the united states if you orntomake dona from president is a great way to do it and jobidon has been facilitating that meanwhile when it comes to the economy it is clear that from pa really has no tools at his disposal he reload isn't know what to do at this point the fact is at the economy continues to run hot despite the fact that the interest rates are now up well above five per cent if it continues to run hot at this rate the inflation is going a continue not only the inflation going to continue wage price birls are going to continue which means you feel poorer to morrow than he did yesterday even if the rate of inflation is decreasing inflation itself is still increasing which is why yesterday fed charge germ pal indicated that the central bank would not declare an end to the its historic intrustrat in creases until it had more evidence than inflation was actually cooling according t the wallstry journal price and wage pressures have ease recently polis disappointed however because he thinks that the fed is more likely to tighten policy than was it if any change is warranted he point t to earlier inflation head fates passed episode o with price pressures be for a little while before surpassing feat officials by before surprising ifundofficials by picking it up again he say been monster economic conditions closely to avoid booth risk of having been is led by a few months of data as well as the risk of having rates raised rates too high the is intros rates could be going up anyway by the way if your looking for new mortgage again we have not we have not act seen bubble burst at because the mortgage race are in believably high people are not actually selling their houses because there not selling their houses that means that there's no inventory because there is no inventory the price of night at top there will come a jointure while people start to lose their jobs in countilford their current mortgages and then you are going to see he serious real estate bubble burst i will say one thing for from pal i was very amuse yesterday from power was confronted by by protestors protestors a started trying to interrupt him

very very heavily red state what's virgin in fact is the state devoted most for dona trump in the last election cycle yesterday mansion said he do not run for another term in west virgin hes seventy six years old but that is not meanthat his political carers overs well see he may even pose moron threat two jobidon then just that his turn ends granary twenty twenty five which means of course that he is going to his seat will be up for election in twenty twenty four here y was in bouncing yesterday they would not be running for reelection in the state after months of de liberation and long conversation of my family i believe in my heart of hearts that have accomplish thine set out to do for west virgin have made one the temples decisions of my life and decided i will not be running for reelection to unite estate senate but what i will be down is travelling the country and speaking out to see if thereisnan interest in creating a movement to mobilize the middle and bring america together to the west virginity who've put their trust in me and thought side by side to make our state better it has been my honor of my life to servo thank you cay mansion out in west virgin what is that demeans republicans pick up one seat remember hes senate right now is split fifty on forty non democrats to republicans that is he flits n ow gout fifty fifty that means public that is pick up one more seat now here is the thing there are zero republican senators facing reelection in purple states in states that trump lost in either of last to presidential elections there are six democrat senators wore facing reelection states in states that trump one in at least twenty sixteen or twenty twenty see purple states six senators up zero republicans all democrats rite six at silo senators are democrats what exactly to one races look or they look unless republicans boot which republicans have a magical way of doing i mean it to it i have to say am astonished t the unbroken chain of republican failure over the course of the last six years or in arizona person sentimo announce that she was on to run isn't independent that is be of the democratic party basely under cut her because she was making too many deals with the other side having too many conversations with it round and the while that has now opened up a three way race between craton son mut is independent ruin ago as democrat and care lake presumably as the senate opponent in arizona now carry lake just lost the gubernatorial race over there is quite possible that she would even lose in a three way race that senior would pick up some f he moderate re publicans and that she pick up some the moderate democrats and that she loss burke garage somehow season that can be of very hotly fought race an uncomfortable one f republicans because republicans have decided n t arizona to just more cowbell is the solution apparently meanwhile over in michigan democrats have a seat is been vacated by deny stand she is announced her retirement she is reelected in twenty eighteen with fifty two point three per cent of the vote depending on who republicans nominate michigan and the corban state of the michigan republican party they could theoretically when a seat there is con be difficult michigan of the michigan republican party is currently bankrupt they do not they do not have any ability to take out at is my understanding and not only that they have had a history of nominating candidates just wildly under perform in general elections but that is only two states there the other states montane is a traditionally red state john tester is seeking reelection in twenty twenty four he want in twenty eighteen with fifty point three per cent of the vote but he is going to be on the ballet presumably at the same time as trump in twenty twenty four do ring in twenty eighteen as democrat n republican state not quite the same thing as running at the same time is republican president who in montane should have some cot tails to could easily she republicans picking up that that would give republicans a fifty one forty nine majority in oho oho still swing state hands sorta but oho is deeply red trump on the state widely in twenty sixteen and twenty twenty sherd brown is looking for reelection he won in twenty eighteen with fifty three point four per cent of the vote shard brown is a much more formidable candidate than nobly john tester is in montane however is that a seat the republicans could win if they do not run somebody terrible sure that is definitely enable seat again at can be a presidential year pennsylvania republicans look the are actually going to run somebody good this time that presumably would be have macormic who running for the senate in pennsylvania democratic sent rebobcasy is looking for fourth term he is reelected by wide marching in twenty eighteen but the state seems to have gotten closer along these lines at maccormic is good candidate in wisconsin sewer tammy babbling up for reelection against she one widely in twenty eighteen the question is to whether republicans will select somebody who is sort of more middle of the road misconsin or to win the seats or were they get out the vote in why marching in twenty four is for the question trumps can have t have details of trump has even if trump does not have clotells republicans have a very good chid of retaining the senate however if trump does have coattails republicans could theoretically walk away with fifty three fifty four seats in the united state senate that is the current situation that is very bad for hoiden in the democrats obviously but mansion retiring f om the senate in west virgin giving up his seat presumably to may be governor him just is o re publican as not just the problem for democrats in one sense it is a big problem for them in another which the jo mansion could easily join a no labels ticket the is been a lot of talk over last couple o years about a no label's third party ticket taking votes away from hoiden and that could easily happen it money has now retired from the senate jo mansion has retired from the senate and there is a wide spread push to run a mansion money or round mansion ticket as a sort of third party alternative that is very risky for mobile a mean super risky for mobile because here is the thing he has a certain locked an level of support it is not all that high his locked and level of support is probably somewhere in themed thirties meanwhile he got donaltrump his locked and level of support is probably in the low forties to mid forties there is probably fifteen twenty per cent the vote that is up for grabs in between there now if there is no serious third party challenge no serious third party candidate then probably those people split in favor of jobidon that is typically what happens an election r dona trumps an all however if there is a plausible third party alternative that change is real fast right now robot off kenned is the junior is is sort of the default what if there is a third party guy and in a lot of palling his up in the twenties in one place up in the thirties which just shows the wild dissatisfaction the america public has with the current political choice is being offered them being in a non functional eighty year old and dona trump the o these of these are not choices that the broad swath of the america people are into the party bases in the re publican party loves trump the party base in the democrat party doesn't a abide but the film tor stuck with him man's that a lot of people or sort of in the middle and dissatisfied with both candidates and to the possibility of a cone qua moderate tickets a a party crossing ticket thou mansion round unuransee i twenty twenty five per cent the population that to a very serious look at that in come dis proportionately would himation from mobile inside because again dona trump has a higher level has o has a higher floor his a lower ceiling and e has a higher floor dona trump a u hoiden has a lower floor and a higher ceiling just electorally speaking that is what although because it is poor performance his ceiling may also be really low at this point according to the her times the mansion plans to do remains mystery his closestates an advisers insist they do not know a conservative democrat who as served is one of his parties key votes in the senate he is long kept his own council on his biggest decisions and made up his mind at the last minute mansion is floriated this year with no labels roup the has made noises by running a centers candidate for the white house no label's official set on thursday mansions announcement had taken them by surprise hough they commended him for stepping up to lead a long over do national conversation about solving america at biggest challenge regarding our no label's unity prasinnential ticket we are gathering in put from our members a cross the country to understand the kind of leaders they would to see in the white house said the group in a statement some allies o mansion our skeptical he'll run for one who cost hundreds millions of dollars to run a credible independent or third party campaign but he might just because of the high levels of dis satisfaction for months this year mansion is come iced up to no labels according to the narrow times which far has secured ballad acts in twelve states in an attempt to offer an alternative to bison and trump the group's present many jacobson has told potential donors the group intends to select a republican to lead it ticket a decision thtwoul exclude mansion if no labels maintains that position one candidate's openly teasing a no labels run marry hogan he is been trying to push that he has no level of support mansions a bit of a different story even see democrat's panicking about this by the way democratsman panics about no labels for quite a while here becks again they look at jobidon and they do not what they see the the realities that are setting in for jobidon are very real and very terrifying he seen have to figure out pretty quickly what his strategy is his strategy by the way is going tore just attacking dona trump why that works are not is going to be very much dependent on the new cycle and if you are democrat runngagains omaltrump you do not want that to be depended on the new cycle jo mansion must be scaring the payoff democrats right now artiguizes thrust the show continues right now you are not on one o miss it we will be getting into the washington posed which has decided that

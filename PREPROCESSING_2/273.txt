when eff as twenty two he had this rare problem with his eyes and doctors had to use layers to fix vessels that were bleeding at the back of his left eye which worked gray but a long after on cold bright winter day he came into his house from the cold and saw this color and it was i as almost an after image when you look at a bright light yet and it was a blind spot right where they had had put the layers and instead of seeing blackness was this greenish not green it was a green that they could never exist it was florescent and as copulating and static that that green but not green action may be better we of describing it was if the color black was florescent and green it give just con to say this words back to you if the color black were florescent and green yes that sounds crazy it yes yes you has some color seem more energetic bright red or bright yellow and others are more peaceful set of a blue green sea color what which is this it was both it was both energetic and call me but but a god of the color is greenish right it is in the kind of green family yet it is it is greenish i regret about a munch you markers a while your trying to to find a way of representing et to my doctor and if your to try to painted or drop you would start with a kind of florescent green writ and then what would you add to it to add the other part that is not green black and fireworks you just said black and fireworks yes he said that if you have ever had a my grin headache it can come with a kind of colorful sparkly static its that fireworks but really he said he is never done a good job describing this how do you describe a color that only you have seen look et just it would wish of these things that what would you say but this color what does it remind you of the feeling of punching somebody in the face or more a soft kiss from somebody who just falling in love with or more warm toast and butter on a cold morning you know i have to say o of those of those three options you give me i think i only have lots of experience with the third and does the color remind you of that one you ait warm toast and butter on a cold morning him no does the color does it remind you of the feeling of of hope or more feeling of kind of existential red existential dread tattle color does it remind you at all of the feeling that you get when you are a kid than you get either a hoo or a dingdong and its sort of cool and the outside shell of it is perfectly hard invite into it in it cracks open in its soft and chocolatier underneath o no the color does it remind you of the feeling of somebody's wen a cook something for you and you do not know enough their good cooker bad cook and then it turns out there just an amazing cook everything you eat you think misses of very good version of this particular thing that ism meeting yet i is a little but more money than that when you see something that nobody else can see it can be terrifying jersey was scared that may be something was seriously deteriorating with his vision ones it became car that he was going t be fine use can be able to see they had the other impulse to shows friends share it well ye i used to make drawings of it i used to make drawings of the shapes they a used to black pander then it did the outline in that florescent and it is you ho so to my friends can they did not they did not get it they did not think it was that that me what would they say oh men usually usually what i get is is that is interesting ah that is the worst ye where when you see something at that the people can just i think for most people you want to tell somebody wen to share it you wan to do something to day an fer in we have three stories of pole in this exact situation whole involving science one about in comedy one about angels if people see something nobody else can and they cannot stop themselves they cannot shut up about it don you be easy chico its s this america life i i a glass stay with us at one do these genes make me look fatless el let us kick things off with this story somebody who not only sees something that nobody else sees when he tells other people about the stuff she sees they do not buy it investigate reporter avid destine explains i wrote a book called the sports one it is hardly about how some super athletes are genetically different from the rest of us they have epergnes they're physiological freaks i was deluged with males from parents wanting to know how they could find out if their child had michael german gives a coach wrote offering up his players as guinea pigs for genetic experimentation there were many unhinged males coming in that i pretty much stopped opening them and then i got this one that had the subject heading o lymph medalist and muscular distriopi patient with the same mutation i opened it figuring it would be a link to some article that it'd missed in my reporting instead it was a note from a thirty nine year old ion mother her name was gill miles she was the muscular distrefupation and she had a wild theory linking her genes to an olympic sprinter named priscilla lopes sheet and she wanted to send more info shire i said send it along why not days later a package arrived a nineteen page illustrated bound packet it thumbed through it et was a little weird hand drawn diagrams with cut outs of little cartoon weightlifters representing proline molecules old photos of herself in her siblings the original pictures not copies there was a detailed medical history and he was clear she knew some serious science she described in detail how prolines function she refer to geniutations by their specific dean addresses the way a scientist would and then i landed on page fourteen there were two photos one of gill in a royal blue bikini sitting on a beach her torso looks normal but her arms it is there on the wrong body the stick arms on a snow man her legs too are thin that her knee joint is wider than her thigh those legs cannot possibly hold her upright i thought the other picture was of priscilla lope sleep who been ranked the best hustler in the world and two thousand eight she won the bronze metal in the one hundred meter hurtles at the olympics an base in the photo she is in mid stride it is hard to describe just how muscular she looks picture all the muscles toucan imagine on a woman now picture more in that photo priscillas the vision of a super hero that a third grater might draw huge muscles bursting from her this her skin can barely contain all the power beneath it ropy genes snaking along her based this is the woman gill believed she shared the same to hat a jill is toll we is jill remembers arms and legs a liketeio all bill's life doctors had been mystified by her case they had no idea how her muscle disease work much less out a treated she did know her disease came from charge an temptation and she wanted to reach priscilla because looking at photos of priscilla seeing her body she saw clues that made her believe priscilla had the same mutation if priscilla did if jill was right and scientists might figure out what was making bill's muscles shrink in priscilla's muscles balloon and maybe people jill could some day be help the whole thing seemed a slingshot i reached out to robot green at jeneticistad hazard who had got to know while writing my book he is an important proponent of people being allowed to get their own geneticists ut after looking at the pictures of jill an priscilla he thought jill was almost certainly wrong he doubted they had anything in common and science the side he had other concerns for one thing us a somewhat famous toilet ah just any other a celebrity can we come the focal point for an individual for various reasons in a very unhealthy way i was concerned that an power in relationship between these two women could a in badly yet i mean people go off the deep in when they are relating to celebrities they think they have a connection to of course this a very polite way of saying maybe she is a nut job i wondered the same thing how could you not the i dead the nipa housewife working off fugal images would make a medical discovery about a professional lathe whose body has ben obsessively examined for years by a small army of doctors and hat lentic trainers it seems pretty ludicrous but the fact is people with ends and oh does hade been telling jill that her theories are ludicrous pretty much her whole life jill was born in nineteen seventy four at first everything was great she met all the normal baby milestones she sat crawled and walked on time then it age four she started stumbling and tripping all the time constantly falling flat on her face i would described this fear i had about witches fingers this is jill and you know my mama's kind of puzzled what what was i talking bout witch is fingers what do you mean and when we walk ti fell the sensation almost they were little they were nail hands and fingers reaching up and graving my shins that it'd fallverly forcedly that was kind of to beginning of noticing something witstefferen bill's dad remembered that he would had some problems walking around the same age which his doctors said was the result of a very mild case of pole but bill's troubles were much worse than her dads had ever been and no one could give them an answer her pity patrician was stumped he suggested they take her to the mail clinic they were stumped there too they tested the whole family and found that oil and her brother and her dad all had signs of muscle damage but jill was the only one having trouble walking it might be muscular dystrophy the doctors thought but that did not usually show up this way and little girls they were really really a sir they never seen anything this they said our family was extremely you need and they could not defend what tight but was you anal estimably that is good and one way because there being ones but in the other hand of is terrifying what is my life expectancy what are the symptoms that all be dealing with it is alarming you do not have something to grasp the hold of jill went back to the mail clinic every year and it was always the same there was nothing the doctors could do nothing knew they could tell her they constant falling eventually stopped but was replaced by a burning sensation in her legs and wile she was growing in height a normal girl the fat on he arms and legs was vanishing by the time she was eight her arms and legs were skinny that other kids could rape their fingers around her wrists and ankles by age twelve veins were bopping out of her legs his asked how it fell to the old and then her muscles started to fail again i nonmember just getting in a bike i always ridden and feeling someone came up behind me and just threw me into the handlebars and got a big runs across my best from you know i fall where to could told my self over the the bike i just start my muscles touch as star quivering and rollers kinin i invited a friend to go with me and i came even stand up on the states and ism just sitting here going some is just something terribly wrong how rapid how quick was that that you basically lost the ability to roller stamen in river beg i was say public within a few weeks o gilded even bothered tell her parents what was happening she knew there was nothing there the doctors could do about i by the end of that summer the symptoms es done she could walk o pay again she started looking for answers on her own but she did it the way a kidwould you knowing having my body do things that i cannot control forces are acting on me and i develops curiosity fascination with things i would read about poster geese and i would bring home lots of books from the library ah i remember it really frore got my dad at one point was he tipped over my book bag and there is all these books about supernatural things and he was what you in to the accouter what one out it was nothing of the sort it was about i could not explain what was going on with me the doctors could not explain and i found these people that people could not explain what was happening to them totally fascinating ah i believe i by the times moment to college head maxed out at five for three in about eighty seven pounds she decided that if she was going to figure out what was happening with her body she would have to do it herself duringgill's first master she set up camp in the library she began poring over every text book and scientific journal article she could find on different kinds of muscle disease i just that while ell star reading about them one by one and see if something fits she did this for months going article by article a police officer driving up and down every street doing a grid search but nothing really fit until she came to a page in a medical journal about an extremely rare type of muscular disprove called emery drifts and then looking at the pictures i was a very startling thing to realize me see in my hands arm just an instantaneous lock on something that is in your visual memory but what did you say as the little girl i would ah notice he had what i called papa arms big forearm and hand muscles and then at ism reading about every drives they actually describe the look of the arms as a papa arm to armada but there were very very few forces of women with i much drift as muscular gesture the journal described at the three had marks of memory drifts patience they couldn't just their chins their chests or their heels to the floor and her arms were pe actually bent at the elbow and i you know get chills reading this thin can live got all three ah a really great visual to think about that is shockingly a a baby don that is elbows tat do not bend and feet slanted to fit into high heels actually as a terrific representation of what toes the very drifts look which is very ironic as we get this to little girl since they this is perfect and where actually handing them a doll that has weren't in disorder when you flip open you and you see these pictures and see these descriptions is it the fireball just slipped on in this is it devil i i was sure it is it is very i s great but as terrifying a what was very frightening was to read there to a lot of cardiacisheis sin vole it this disease emir drive is patience we learned often dropped dead of heartfailure she became obsess with reading about it before she went home for college break she stuffed her bag full of medical books and journal articles purposely even hit them under several books cause i did not one o alarm anybody at home and i went out in the kitchen long enough to make my cry pop corn and i came back in to my my at was reading them and i tried to take him away and i just do not you now do not read those and he was really sucked into it and he said we i i have all these symptoms and i said jolly i know the arm thing and the the nap and and he said no he said i have all these cardiaccemptems he had always thought the stiffness in his muscles and hart troubles were unrelated he said shall the doctors told me i had o virus not to worry about it we both just looked each other in i said you do not it is not a virus it is this we have o more writhes they went to the i i heartsenter where doctors put a heart monitor on deal's father his pulse rate dropped below thirty beats perminnute which meant he was either about to win the tour to france or he was about to drop did he had a pacemaker put in immediately she safe your dance life i mean just abs amazing this is ails ma'am many but was not for her how oud we have ever brownness am and i y i remember being in the hospital that day and i i think he is just in a of j and he just love total do not love for cell but i think was a hard burden for her because it just seem we else was looking the i hard center was not set up to confirm whether not her family ad emir drives that was not their specialty she went looking for some one who could remember she was nineteen well i went to a neurology cleek a i can remember even what i wore that day i dressed up as professional as i could i wanted to be taken seriously i mean i i had not a navy dance ut and tried to present the articles to my a neurologist and how did you've start that conversation how you make your case i just said it'd been studying to news aid is funding a great dill a time in the library and have come across these photos and am sure this is what we have and this is this is the name and could you look at these with me and the doctor just was very abrupt with me and said now you do not have that and refuse to look at the papers it might seem rude that a doctor would refuse even to look but at the time most doctors believed memory drifts only occurred in men also this was a self diagnosis coming from a tea nature a defiant tea nature there was times that when i was in the doctor's office i would see my chart and it pul just list diagnosis muscular sisterly i known etiology i hated seeing that i literally just take a pen on on my person i scratch it out and it'd writ am i drifts muscular justify and my ma would see me thou the tick c not cannot punch your chart and i i wanted list ad what i have in her reading bin she would come across a group of researchers working out of italy they were looking for families with emir drives to study hoping to locate the jane that causes the disease we'll decided to write to them she mapped out a family tree noting the symptoms she saw in her father two younger brothers and a younger sister then she stripped down to her underwear and that i set the timer on my camera and i took pictures of my self cause i thought will if that is how i identified it only send a picture and just inquired would you one to take a look at our family up to this point the italic's had only collected four other families to study they were thrilled to hear from jill and they immediately wrote back from the letter it seems they think she is a scientists who has access to a lab they asked can you send as donee if you cannot prepare donee just send fresh blood but nineteen year old gill soon learned you cannot just go to the local hospital and say draw my blood i want a ended to rope sod jill con minced a nurse friend to smuggle needs and gestures to her house they filled them up with samples of her family's blood and shipped them off to italy to day you can sequence an entire genomic a few days but back in the mid nineteen nineties not much it was four years before all heard something definitive back from the italic's they confirmed she had memory drives she would been wright all these years despite everyone telling her otherwise one day i open me and there a was and that was a weird feeling to realized to e this is it i cilice don et and they tell me that name of the we end of its declare lamb and the researchers had discovered the genetic cause of bill's illness a gene called the lamangene what makes the lam an gene really important is that it effects the command center inside every cell in your body this turns other genes on and off light switches changing the way they build fat and muscle bill's lam an gene has a typo in it a serious one along the spiralling ladders of her donee the three billion get ten as and seas that make up bill's gene she had one letter in the wrong place and it is just almost darkly comical to think seriously and on this less to find out cable what happen exactly at it comes down to a genu as change to as thin soon after jill got an internship in a habit john's hoping that was mapping diseases associated with the lemon gene the lab director had heard about bill's research on herself and saw a chance to have not only a dogged intern in the lab but also their very own real life lemon mutiny bill's job was to sift through scientific journals and find any references that had been linked to a lemon mutation sitting there day after day reading she came across an incredibly rare disease a disorder called partial lipodistrophy i causes the arms and legs to look as if all the fat on them has been melted away leaving veins and muscle to stand out looking at photos of patience with the disease all jill could think was that these people looked her family members could jillion her family have not just one but two rare genetic diseases the odds of getting one of them was one in a million the odds of getting the other is one in at least a million and the odds of getting both to gather there have not been enough human beings in the history of our species that any one should ever get both just before when jill discovered memory triples she zeroed in on a photo in a medical article and saw herself in it and just before she tried to get confirmation from doctors she tried to tell scientists that she had the second rare disorder partial dystrophy and just before they said no they said that statistically there was very little chance that could be true instead they died not her with something a little more common they did not necessarily laugh at me but were kind of incredulous that no you do not have that and there and it described it is interne in drum where you have a medical student that is being introduce to lated you diseases and the con think in they have what they are reading about i just thought well i must be wrong i think i to is buying an to that idea that that is quite a rage to they they yen the second tonetic disorder because it is a rare too i just kind o that wile my be an i not to i kind of back today from that even tho let kind of a date wo feeling she dropped in she stopped reading about this new disease and before long she stopped doing researching to emery drift too mostly because the research she was doing started to free her out in the case studies she read the average person with emery drifts was dead by their early forties she was twenty five an anxiety over this was landing her in the hospital i had to panic attacks that were brought on by the stress of reading all of these things that they just died suddenly and i went to a council for a while i worked with my cardiologist and we decided it was just too much information it was not healthy i really just did not look up things did not read articles and i really got to the point that i decided i want to go on with my own life she went cold turkey no more medical research no more die why diagnosis she took a job as a writing instruct or at local community colonist and taught a dull education classes at night she started dating eventually meeting the man who would become her husband and even though the was a fifty fifty chance that she would pass on the emery drifts geniutation they decided to have a child her pregnancy was normal and her baby martin does not have the disease but after he was born jillrally deteriorated physically if you ever had a muscle to which how strange it feels do not have control of your body bill's muscles started twitching from head to to sometimes for hours at a time and she was suddenly having to hold on to her husband to steady herself the best what i can describe with what it was it would be where gravity is getting incredibly heavy and it is some mice turns up the knob and you think of how highwould they have to turn up this gravity that i cannot get up off the floor by myself i cannot stand up right i cannot take a step you know it is it is a tremendous amount of forest pushing on the body by martin's first birthday she could barely walk one day he was calling that he wanted macaroni and cheese and a i knew i i was yen it'd six steps to take my i realize this is the this is that this alas six steps om gang say i i just knew as that that point that i was not be able to get up again at the same time bill's father was also losing his ability to walk father and daughter transition to life in motor ice scouters ails as her dad was discouraged for the first time in his life after a visit with an horologist he told her i feel i go there just to be waged then one day she got a call from merman and it was about dad he just moved from his scooter into his favorite chair he said to my mom he just felt tired and then he simply just found as hadn't he did not breathe again and he die he had a sudden cardiac at what age was it he was sixty three on the day he passed away jillion er siblings and relatives gathered at her parents house after pulse people at gone if his consoling down and my sisters said i got i got this just show you she starts pulling up pictures of this extremely muscular they and i just took o look at it just kind of wet we do not what you don't we do not have that i me what what are you talking about this of course was priscilla at first jill did not get it did not see any connection with the muscle bound athlete it had ben twelve years since she went cold turkey on medical research but a week later jill got curious she started gouging pictures of priscilla not just running photos but shots of her home doing regular things feeding her daughter baby food it helped seeing the clothing on her to see how it fit it was just unmistakeable it is a pewter that could analyze a photograph and get a match and be a hundred per cent sure that is the same shoulder that is the same upper arm i see the same veins i see them branching this way he just know and that is hard to c only how could she just now but i knew ut we were very likely cut from the same cloth a very very very rare cloth it was the third time oil saw something in a photo other people did not see it had happened with memory drafts it happened with lypodistrophy now she saw that she and priscilla were both missing fat in the same places on their arms and legs they had the exact same muscle divisions in the exact same places in the hips and bud oil was certain this was because they shared a mutagen and the only question was why did the gene blow up priscilla with muscles and take gills away this is my trip to big but it is her rocket feel i me were we are conman book superhero as that are just as divergent as could be i mean o her body has found away around it somehow i know that sounds the plot of a holly would move in fact it is totally the plot of unbreakable the brace will's samiel ell jacks film jacks plays a broken bone physically fragile man searching for his genetic opposite a man born strong his body will survive any physical drama in final scene jacks tells wills that he is the i t a so we wanted to enlist priscilla an her genetic detective work but there was a practical problem she had no idea how to go about reaching her may give had crazy ideas can i fly a candidate she up at a matin greet and try to talk to her an it is if you ere on this mother i cooler and it is enow you've just connected there restraining order at best i made people will think you are crazy i was just trying to resign myself to the fact that well what am i going to dell a full year past and then jill happen to be an ear shot of her tell vision when i started yammering about athletes and genetics on disjoining america find the best fit for your unique gene and then special eyes in the midteniars an that all is is just the pattern this is just if i finance this is exactly what ism looking for jill reached out to me with a request and i did happened to have a way to get it to priscilla through her agent it was such a odd request is is really out there i this of course is priscilla i he is just this lady she's and i a i just as she has the same gene as you and once have a conversation i was in i do no cress an es have a conversation see were got jill son priscilla the same bound packet that she sent me and it was not any of the cryptic science that got to priscilla it was a childhood's stories jill shared about kids pointing at the veins in her legs priscilla said she always used to come home sad and crying she would asked her parents can i get the veins remove for my legs because i on the ways are making fun of me just lie allow legs a vain you likewise it look that once she grew up the finger pointing did ant end it just more when people see huge shredded muscles priscillas on an athlete it usually means one thing steroids and priscilla's been dogged by doping rumors since college after she won the olympic bronze metal and been some media outlets in rope began to openly accuse her and of course there was a not furtive glances m you would walk by and people kind alike would whisper oh look at her gloats a look at her er look at her arms er her shoulder is a her was ans they go look look look it is more on then i member there's one picture as put out they put a big bud's face on my body and i just than he just er give like ism ism lift ink as my ism running and play saying towards the finish since ism using every ounce every inch in o ever yo ti he is a energy my body to get to that finish line the was pretty message and i was really pissed about that and fetus i got test i i i thought how its narrative because i got testis much for track and field and i think a lot of people really honestly truly believe that i was taking stories at the world champion ships in berlin in two thousand nine priscilla was drug tested just minutes before winning a silver metal there is not even supposed to be any drug testing that close to the race then the following month that mimetic greece some one told her training journal out of her bag it was at the very bottom underneath expensive work out clothes and shoes none of which were taken why steal training journal it someones covered lot of doping stories ism convinced some one thought the journal contained her stailwoyd regiment priscilla an jill spent a lot of time talking on the phone in eight months after i first put them in touch they finally met hin person in torn where priscilla lived they picked a hotel lobby villa rived first i got to be a few minutes past the time we were get to me that couple mar venison it is and to get really scared i have much writing on this i was just latch in the doors skis the hires the sir you i was not sure and i see this lady that all my gash this is see i family priscilla felt the same way it really was just a wow come do i now you get they you awes are talking and it just just giggling about o kea got a flex for you then she is she that it is the the harder for to get a setter hosts to plan a sot of to show me sixteen i do have i do have the definition to him you do you do a but s wit is that smaller than yours than we cant a gig and but it was still of there is something really a something here let us that's the research o that is find out because how could the genes do this to you and o do this to me that is that was where my question was and how it took a year to find a doctor to test priscilla finally jill went to a medical conference and approached the foremost expert and lipodistrophy doctor obey mind gang who runs a lab at university of texts southwestern medical center he agreed to do the testing the results showed the villa been right she and priscilla do avigenet i connection they each have a single typo on the same one of our twenty three thousand genes the lemon gene it is not the exact same typo but there almost rite next to each other that is splinter of distance and type location makes the difference between bill's muscles and priscilla's muscles it is why jill has emery drops and priscilla down but doctor gang also found that they do share disease they both have the exact same rare sub type of lypodistrophy the diseased that wastes away fat jill been told it had nothing to do with the back when she was a summer in turn to john's hooking jill been right about that all along doctor gang called priscilla immediately to give her the news he caught he them all shopping with her kids as is dream about going getting a big duty burger free and doctor gang calls me and says i have your results a ma got and then as can i call you back cause ism in them all right nipas i now it is kind of important are you bet to go eat lunching s yes ours you only bought to have salad your in track for a pangas attack and is see what then heck told priscilla that despite her rigorous training regiment her untreated lipodistrophy left her with fifteen times the normal amount of fat in her blood her next hamburger could lander in the emergency room she was that close in other words once again jill steered some one away from a medical disaster shed saved her dad's life now using the cutting edge medical tool known as ducal images she caused the most sentence medical intervention in the life of this professional athlete that is what i just oh my gash if this was not for a jell i would define hae been in the hospital and i called her and i told her as you put much to save made from having to go the hospital an we goes wet i go doctor gang told me that i have the men and my mum r is i adheres scientists can learn all sorts of things by studying very rare genetic diseases for instance research on a rare geniutation that gives people freakishly low collestral levels led to a drug that treats high collateral i knoll timer's treatment might come from studying a small group of people in iceland they have a super rare mutation that protects their brains recently a group of scientists started something called the match maker exchange it is a kind of oke cupid for rare diseases where people can share genetic and symptom in formation with each other and doctors the hope is that it will spark new discoveries it is just the the weep of gest of make sings bosybor that is than life a molecular biologist in france he does supertechnical work on a proline with the lovely name sari b p one it affects fat storage and his research team showed that messing around with it can create mice with almost no muscle at all or potentially little rode schortzneggers when oil first reached him she told him that he may have found the actual biological mechanism that makes her in priscilla different o k that that is tenias a kind of foraffliction from my side say sat really good question that is a really really good question because i have no idea o f what ti genro was genii dis before she contact me now i have change bottle for my teem a rest traject and this is only because gilconfact me tho years ago shes a the tetiawsm and have you ever had the experience of someone outside the scientific community an affecting your researcagendanis can it way a e my land people from outside going ana giving me helps new idea i have no example of these kind of sings maybe an asinine he scientific if condo of course this is different hin the skepticism kills gotten from scientists and doctors for decades i check back in with one of the doubters robot green the geneticist ad hazard i first talk to who was incredulous about any genetic connection between gill and priscilla i you meld him the results of priscilla's genetic test oh i was knocked over i was completely and utterly astounded and i remember thinking i was i was ashamed that i had doubted this individual because she turned out to have a remarkable a discovery about a week after i talk to doctor's green and lefty i played those conversations back for gill could ye retake the a and what is in your mind when you hear that less if it really does hill really good a i it is kind of ad this wait come off me som exhausted emotionally and intellectually and in every way possible and i in happy i do not want to be the crazy person that is on the nerve all the time coming in i really fell confidence we can go somewhere with this and i got some really great people oil says she is proved her point she says she is retiring from de i we medical research she gave me the same line that professional athletes use i want o spend more time with my family but her mother does not believe she is retiring nor does doctor levee and i certainly do not believe recently oil send me female she picked up on a tidbit in a very technical scientific paper about potentially reversing muscular district i of want to read too much into this she wrote me but of course ism cure avid upstate the book that he read that kickball this off is the sports game in side the science of extraordinary athletic performance he has more about jill an priscilla including jaw dropping photos at propublica dot word in the parsecs refers round this story as predicted job has gone back to the research game she to rocks to priscilla he resent retired from tracked field coming out of you now we started to days programmed with the color green that was not green after the break tignotaro finds a joke that is also not a joke that is chico when our programmed continues to sericin lie from our glass e woo in approgrm of custom thus a theme bringing different kinds of stories on that theme to day spoke something only i can see we a stories of people who spot something that no one else is noticed and then feel compelled to tell somebody show somebody do something about it we have arrived at at two of our programmed to momjokes comedians do not usually laugh at the on jokes as a rule it is gosh makes sings es funny as a rule

wait usually works this was a rare chance to root for the other kind of jokethen non starter the rush no one understands including you you rational brain can make its rational arguments and then what

the wall that he wanted deaf revolt to fall in love with him and nothing happened and once when who's feeling really lonely he screamed into the hole in the all that he wanted to have an angel for a friend and an angel really to show upright after that but he was never much of a friend and hit always disappeared just when udo really needed him the danger a skinny and all stooped and you wore trenchicot the whole time to hide his wings people in the tree were sure he was a hunchback sometimes whentherewere just the two of them he take the coat off once he even let udo touch the feathers on his wings but when there was any one else in the room he always kept it on kids asked him once what he had under his coat and he said his a backpack full of bus that did not belong to hi and that he did not want them to get wet actually he lied all the time he told udo such stories you could throw up about places in heaven about people who when they go to bed at night leave the keys in the admission about cats who are not afraid of anything and do not even know the meaning of scat the stories he made up were something else and to top it all he crossed his hart and hope to do udo was nuts about him and always tried hard to believe him even let him some money a cup of times when he was hart up as for the angel he did not do a thing to help udo he just talked and talked and talked rambling off as hair brain stories and the six years he knew him udo never saw him much as into a glass when udo was in the army and basic training and really needed some one to talk to the angel suddenly disappeared on him for two solid once then he came back with an unshaven do not ask what happen face udo did not ask and on sturdy they sat around on the roof in their underpants just taken in the sun and feeling low udo looked at the other rooftops with the able hook ups and the solar heaters and the sky it occurred to him suddenly that and all their years together he would never once seen the angel fly ow about flying around a little he said to the angel ut make you feel better and the angel said forget it what if some one sees me be a sport udo nagged just a little for my sake but the angel just made this disgusting noise from the inside of his mouth and shot a gob of spit and white flam at the tar covered roof never mind udo sulked i bet you knot no how to fly anyway sure i do the angel shot back i just a want people to see me that is all on the roof across the way they saw some kids thrown a water bomb udo smiled once when i was little before i met you ease to come up

gap between the awning over the grocery store and the one over the shoe store people would look up and all they would see was the awning it would not know where as coming from the angel got up too and looked down into the street he open his mouth to say something suddenly udo gave him a little shove from behind and the angel lost his balance udo was just flown around he did not really me to hit the angel just to make him fly a little for lags but the angel dropped the whole five floors a sack of potatoes stunned udo watched him lying there on the sidewalk below his whole body was completely

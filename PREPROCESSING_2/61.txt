todashospasserbakpresspepian you a web history being seen and sold to advertisers now neither at expressvypian right out expressbypianticam flashes happy talk is dangerous in politics it is dangerous because it gets people killed it leads people to believe foolish things out of idiotic hopes and fatuous streams leaders tend to believe what they want to believe that is precisely the opposite of their job particularly when it comes to national security foreign policy ought to be the preserve of cold eyed men and women capable of making hard but correct decisions unfortunately politics tends to draw people with starry visions or at least cowards will mask their own cowardice with those starry visions it is hard to tell which one present bison is becoming these days as israel war against comas continues and make no mistake that war will continue until comas is utterly destroyed widen seems to be starting to waver he is made many of the right sounds over the course of the war is expressed support for deposing comas is correctly stated that israel has a difficult task in doing while minimizing civilian casualties yet now prided by a radical left wing legacy media and young daft staffers he seems to be wavering thus yesterday bid an issued the following tweet quote commas unleash a terrorist attack because they fear nothing more than is rallies an palistinians living side by side in peace to continue down the path of terror violence killing in war is to give comas what they seek we cannot do that what precisely did began mean by this see wile the white house came out to day and they said this was not a change in policy bidonstill wants komasko and but the tweet seems to create it catch twenty two you cannot give homes what they want says hoiden which is supposedly more violence but to destroy comas requires violence is began arguing for living comas in place in the name of defeating come or is hes simply setting up a deeply on realistic expectation for any military in the face of a terrorist group that purposefully embeds itself civilian areas in order to pray on western off heartiness with regard to civilian casualties either way biding is harming israel war effort with such metric and the west by proxy hes falling victims the propagandist efforts of the legasymedia which continue to promote for separate foolish claims first the comas is not quite as bad as it seems second that israel is much much worse than it seems third that israel ought to make concessions to the palisinian authority in order to defeat comas and for that biding electoral prospects rely on believing the first three claims let us go through these in order first the claim the comas is not all that bad gotta it is astonishing and bewildering and disheartening to watch polices tonal form in reel time but we are watching it happen that is the only similar phenomenon to what give seem to what is happening right now holiest denial we are watching an active attempt to relight comas into some sort of political protest group just a little more passionate this has involved outright lies the li for example tat comas did not kill people at the nova music festival it was israel helicopters or obfuscation to have heap of his daily women being raped or merely medical reports of their broken polices more often is taken the form of down plan comas es evil altogether thus we get man malgelten o the an mason b c claiming that comas is actually a reasonable negotiating partner as shown by the fact than that they are now hostage deals going on is popleomatic amazon as them ti spray work fer dialogue that has allow the last three days a there spreed can actually be pro long now proper mi dis a some being tat certainly the coatis believe could a been establish much earlier on in bis couplet when this for broke out i they had actually show to the america an these raises that mamas base but what they were say publicly and willing you on the ground with the relieve o t people america than tit to is rallies early on they were prepared to enter into this kind of pray work but here we are must sat an a hawelater and any ester can bold that i think no the cookies on how did they build on this wo mat can to prolong it the the scuppering i ain got the comes to an et corpse's reasonable party how do those hostages and up in the gossipstrip we of know who cares come was always reasonable they were the ones are willing to make a deal because that is how works when you kidnap other people's children and then you are willing to make a deal to protect yourself your still the bag i but not according to mas and be coma golden we get the legacymedia claiming the chassis hostage relieve strategy spells the beginning of a broader rounds of negotiations with israel supposed new piece partner thesewould be the same people who just murdered twelve hundred as daily citizen six weeks ago and took two hundred forty hostages then there is claim number too that israel is morally equivalent in some way to homes ill get to that claim in just one second first i wont talked you about daily wires most trusted privacy partner and the pro mere

bad claim number too that the media are making and their allies in the radical illogic world and their allies on left is that israel is somehow morally equivalent to humans this claim these days usually takes the form of suggesting that israel is convince carpet bombing gas or in discriminate in its use of fire power that is absurd on its face according to homes itself israel has dropped about forty thousand bombs on fossa during this conflict also according to mass israel has killed about fifteen cousin people normally bombs kill more t an at were point three people particularly if you ware using target weaponry what is more israel is protecting civilian evacuation routes the commas is currently attacking israel is giving weeks of warning be fore striking sights israel is using a notch bombs to empty buildings israel allowing commons terra to merge into civilian populations rather than killing to many civilians israel is being more careful than any army in modern history given the urban contact of this war it again it is dealing with a terrace group that is predominantly hiding in urban areas that means civilian casualties will be high by necessity again that is not uncommon in war according to one paper in the journal frontiers of public health here are the civilian death rates by modern war meaning civilian deaths over total deaths seventy four per cent the corban war forty six per cents in the eanomemar eighty eight per cents in the person gulf war fifty six per cents in the bulk war twenty eight per cents in the afghanistan war thirty six per cent in backstay and sixty seven per cent in the arch war yet the medicare participating in compasses moral equivalent to the hilt they are in fact acting as the moss ought to be granted immunity and permanence specifically because they are hiding among civilians again their logic's that if commons were out in battlefield is real cad milden but if commons violates the laws of war than israel has to give them immunity basically grab a baby and s safe in tad this of course means that every terrascrup in the future is going to grab a baby and hide behind the baby yesterday ja taper of signed ho been better tan average in this conflict actually ask for mas daily prime minister no tolybennet one of the medias typically silly questions will not killing members of commostrous create new members of commas which is saying will not killing notes in world we to just create new notes as been it answers if that is the case it is not possible ever to win a war but do not you think the last six weeks an dona lot to in inside in inspire a whole new generation a taro's i mean all the civilian days i mean do not you worry h that in itself is going to raise and inspire whole generation a palatine to hate is rallies a tat ma a i notion in id on o the war war man ma a sivilliandaty yes you a yo a i ha war and we have your to a a and eggs a in silo ago reducing number that at a a a have a a ha rain ma o we pa la a ria a that of course is exactly right again if the logic is if you kill badges wont to create new badguise that means you have to leave the badguises in place but according to the waster journal the yours push to have israel fight a more targeted war signals is shift away from president bison's full throated support at the outset for the campaigned house compass and is the focus of now in tensile consultations between bison and prime minister benjamin is who on how to handle the conflict certainly if thus has a mad wand it has been hiding israel will be all ears until then is the empty verbiage that lends credibility to comes lies about suppose it is really evils then there is claim number three that israel needs to make concessions to the palestonian authority in order to somehow curb comas the two state solution is the answer this is the claim of simpleton and dulled homes freedmen augustforn policy colonist for the execrable new york times who has literally never met in is rally con cession he did not love to day he writes that is quote a revamped palestonian authority is the keystone for the forces of moderation coexistence and decency triumphing in all wars it is the keystone for reviving a two state solution the palestonian authority since solo that been committed to reaching a two state solution based on the boarders that existed before the nineteen sixty seven war to believe this one must truly be an imbecile the palisnian authority from the outside of solo saw the solo cords as a roman horse their leadership said as much over great see in nineteen ninety four quit this solo agreement i am not considering it more than the agreement which had been signed between our prophet hammed and the crash that agreement by the way in the koan was the prelude o the slaughter of the fresh mako a few years after managed signed that false piece agreement this is why our for increased terrain activity after solo it is why he walked away from the camp avid courts in two thousand and instead launch the second into fade it is why his successor halicoston iromachmudabs the the exacting thing with shoot omer the premonish of israel into thousand eight the p a has never wanted a two state solution the p a is a terror group it remains a terror group that is who the p has claimed that israel fabricated evidence of october seventh and they have been soft peeling compass a atrocities on october seventh concessions to terrorist breed terrorism it is that simple but the bide administration continues to pretend that a two state solution led by the palestonian authority which again is led by a holicosan iron and mokmudabas is somehow in answer to historic extremism every day proves that these is totally wrong unfortunately thebiggest obstacle to piece in the idle east right now is the radicalized palestinian population and they have been radicalized over the course of generations by in indoctrination from the leadership in the grab world by poling data the palestonian population does not want piece with israel they want it destroyed at is a again that is every piece of data that is coming from the population the population likes comas they palesonian is comic good in knowthe were happy toking this thing and pretending that these terrors s are completely separate from the civilian population in the sense that the derris our widely despised topic by the population just pose the the terrace than magically peris as going to bloom in the iddleleast or something it is a li in fact according tote most recent polling data from a w r a d which is a mole up polling outfit the palestonian authority has the support of a proximately ten per cent of palestinians that as the same level of support among palistinians as the western media here is somvidio of the palestonian population that is supposedly ready for piece this is footage of palestonians mocking is rally hostages being released over the pass couple of days including children and old women here are you can see crowds of palsinians jeering at mocking women being released back into israel after being held postage for a month and a half we keep hearing bout hate gotten civilians totally hate homos i would love to see any evidence of that whatsoever onestatistical level at all and again people keep angel he cannot really took a pole in the gossistrip oke abut o pole the wetback or come of supposedlyising in control they are wildly popular in the wetback according to the west clearly the answer is more is rely concessions say they had turned over the entire gossip strip entirely to comose well that obviously worked out amazingly well last time then there is the fourth and final clam that jobidon is an electoral dangers specifically because o israel war to exterminate come ass the bides to abandon israel in order when the election that too is ridiculous and its li the data simply do not exist to suggest the bidinselectoral trouble is specifically because of israel and ma goo war on october seventh jobidon was riding at forty four per cent in the poles against total trump according to the real clear politics pulling average to day he is writing out forty five per cents in those exacts an poles on october seventh he is at forty point five per cent in his approval rating to day his at forty point four per cent in other words nothing has changed since october seven but the media repeating the drums if biding does not cave to moss he will lose the youthful and he need citizens these ones from plan who went wild last night when the city council considered condemning come of this actual take from the oaken city council these are people who live in your country these are people who you live next to and whose tax dollars you aren't your sending your taxsollars presumably to pay their welfare bills here we go there is not been beheading of babies and raping israel murdered their own people on october seven calling famous the terra or iris astonish ridiculous races and plays in to dantisital propaganda that is flirting our mediadnthat we should be doing everything possible to combat i support the right at politicians to resist occupation including throughhamos the armed wing of the unified politician resistance as an grab asking with this contact to congamhamas is thaw anti grab races the notion that this was a massacre of news as if fabricated narrative many of those killed on october taganhavia time is hat including children were killed by the idea and a moment condemning amps is ball propagandamen to a thank car time is that be here them complain about moths violence is tithing to a wive tiger complain one is we finely things up and fights back these are the people that jobidons required to listen to according to the legs media these are theccorparts of began supposed constituency according to the waster vernal roughly half of america eighteen to twenty four years old think come ass is october attack was justified by grievances of the palsinians according to a hazard hairs pole only nine per cents of people age sixty five an old or feel the same this according both media is the real danger to jobidans reelect efforts in twenty twenty four and this again is ridiculous here is the deal biding either be running again son true literally the most pro israel president in america history by far or rondestantis or nick half the most pro israel candidates in america history by far are all these comossellovers can a stay home and watch one of those three be elected what is more those age sixty five an older vote far more often than those eye eighteen to twenty for is turn every election cycle an incremental gain among the crazed young voters would likely be you weighed by an incremental loss among all the voters who do not particularly homes besides which many young people are just plain stupidity do not have to draw line somewhere here for example to day's example of higher level stupidity this is colombia university there is a m a truck that is driving around and it has on at pictures of people who signed a statement in support effectively of compass and these are students from colombia who apparently do not know how dock tape wordsmith honestly this this the greatest example of what our universities are it is a bunch of absolutely over educated complete dolts who do not know how to use a rule of duck tape it is amazing let's it that they litter that is not out that is not how dockage works guides we that they bell a tiny little tiny little bit of duck tape above the actual paper that there trying to tape up and it is not working because why are they why are the putting e tape all way across the cardboard by honest god my evener old sunless had used tape it n this it must but then probably they have the their agreement a eastern studies there doing an amazing chop of the doc tape just truly in cable job also that ow ta rippeductape about his scissor anyway but widen needs the votes of these morons the media have their story an they are pushing it but here istle dill israel not can stop in any case because they cannot here is the idea of spokes person explaining and where this is going forward from here is that we are ready and as soon as we will get the green light from the government of the state of visual to continue operations we will do because we understand that there is a direct link between ground operations and pressure on homes and there willingness to e hand over the hostages and we are ready an equip to do and i hope that that will he commence as soon as possible every day that the rate host dis or return is great but we are preparing for the next stage of operations and we are have or she firmly focussed on the aim to this mental commas to make sure that never again will any teristorganization in got a have the ability to do wat comas did on october the see that is exactly correct is real cannot stop the leather and of doing it alone or they will dell with western helps what dos it actually matter if the wet backs is rill in out battle well it certainly means one thing above all others a west perceived as we cowardly horse is a west ripe for the taking that is why the west has a stake here because the weaker the west looks the more radical is lame say on a look at the west and the are going to salivate a happy talking wet is a weak west and that happy talking west t in fortunately is not relegated to the israel compass war and as we have seen hundreds of thousands of people marching in the streets in support and solidarity with compass as we have see governments tossing out members other own government for pointing out that maybe procomoss protests ire actually i con a bad that happen in he brush government what we are watching is a west that seems ripe for tho take embrace o something everyone's reading yo woman laden letter from two thousand and to tong about all his grievances but there forgetting that the reason that has woman laden decided that he's going to attack the united states is because he thought that the west was a week horse he set it himself and that part is true in themiddle least and truly inform policy generally when people are perceived as ripe for the taking people move to take that is how it works form policy is a game of power protection it is not about moral station it is not about being right is about being strong and if you are perceived as week if your perceives is vacillating you are opening yourself up

trust and will dot come slash chipper the perception of western weakness can be manifested in many ways it can be manifested morally it can be manifested with regard to for example open emigration the open emigration debate that is been currently on going in the west is total insanity of course it is one thing two suggest is the united states did for much of its early life that a in open emigration stands with no welfare states is not a terrible idea because your gin to get the hungriest people the an't love their welfare state here they were and here in to come to place with no welfare state and they're going be forced by the market to integrate into the market which means for example learning english it means for example adjusting to the business values of the community already in the united states that is true of the emigration policies of the united states basically between the civil war and nineteen twenty and then in nineteen twenty we started to restrict emigration a lot of that was or of know nothing ism but by the nineteen thirties in the rise of the welfare state suddenly the mouth started change because again if you if you have a bakery and u put a sign in the windows is free dough nuts every one welcome what de polio on come for the freedoghnuts it is con drive a very different crowd then open for business delicious doughnuts for sale it is a different thing or help wanted rite the all all three of those signs are different messages free doughnuts every one welcome is a very different sign from help wanted which means come here if you want a job will pay you or don't nut's forsake which means come here and engage in our market and when the united states and when the last put out the welcome mat for people by saying come on in yourn't have to a simulate youren't have to be engaged in the market at all you'd basically come here and create your own enclaves in which you continued to despise western values well taking welfare dollars of course that is gan to change things and of course it is going to lead to a massive backlash that back lash is already materializing over in ireland were as we discuss o earlier this went economic greggor is now under in investigation by the iris police for having the gall to suggest the perhaps emigration policy in ireland is badly manage the iris prime minister who is just been a moral bleep show i he am he yesterday spent his his take complaining the people were connection crime with with migration which i is not it though i mean legless be real about this when virtually every country when you have a lot of poverty stricken people coming to your country from foreign cultures that is going to come with som additional crime and none of that crime has to be there because again any country the definition of a country is a country an control of its borders that is the definition an here is the iris pro d minister saying the it is intensive to talk about these things just fin imitation too am the terrible events tat the that occur to upon of square on carry stay i i read with ask people to try in avoids n connecting i crime with migration an it is not right an yes of course a people who are migraine mi commit crimes i just was people are not ma crimes id a country of five point threeminlin people i feu hundreds of thousands of mischance they are going to be a few of them i commit terrible crimes just the the our people born a bread an ireland to commit terrible crimes every day including murders o gay but the difference is that if you are born and bread an ireland ore an iris citizen ireland has an obligation to import people who or criminals or who cannot be that the same thing is true of the entire west and yet the west has decided to blind itself to this fact and again when the incentives change your going to get a different type of person who becomes an immigrants that just t is what it is as our rip on people that is a reality about people again change that sign the bakery window is can h change the kinds o people who enter the bakery or doing the same thing here in the united states clean the circus who should be i peach for failure to his job when he just awful the homeland security secretary he is been garbage this whole way we have had a consistent on going migration crisis at our southern border for years on end with extraordinarily generous asylum and refuge policies the basically allow any one to come to the border claim that the are refuge the ushered ins the interior of the united states and then be set free here is all hon the mark is pretending that everybody's coming i legally is asset to the united states that is not true some people come to the united states may be assets to the united states frankly we do not know but the idea that everyone who crosses the southern border is magically in asset to the united states is clearly false it also does not address the other sort of a elephant in the room which is dealing with on document at i emigrants who are already here in the nation and i know is been a political football as a fund rigor out the best way to address that but am on to ask you what is the best way to address that from your perspective the answers quite clear and quite straight forward and we have been waiting for rid for about thirty years and that is to fix a system that everyone agrees is fundamentally to and and we need congressional action both for are the lawful pathways a that really need to be more to bust in statue and for the twelve million people your here n the united states who have been contributing fundamentally to our countries well being there are neighbors our friends or fellow congregants are they provides our our frontline workers are we need to do something and a i am hopeful in some our assets and some really really are not and your generalized to open border policy which has something been promoted by by an administration clearly which is we we have migration crisis is a sign n of weakness to the rest of the world obviously it is why have people marching to the border chancing jobheihten's name right now some sent democrats are beginning to see the light because they realize this actually really bad policy there to see this happen in rope as well as righting parties start to make serious headway on the emigration issue according to politico a growing number of sent a democrats appears opens making at partner from migrant to seek asylum in order to secure pub ligan support framing you crane in israel there motive ate not just by con corn for america an battled allies they also believe changes are needed to help a migration crisis that is going more did and to potentially dull the sting of political borer politics in battle ground states before the twenty twenty four elections john tester democratemontana who is a very vulnerable center is his look i think the borne tom attention am one that thinks it does hurt tester says he is eager to see if a by partisan cop of negotiators can come up with an agreement on policy issue as elusive is emigration senator temp badman another vulnerable democrats as ism certainly cat with border policy being part of a national security supplemental on changes to asylum policy she said what it'd to see us makes in by parts an progress which has eluded us for years the system is broken that is exactly right and neither left his con a figured out or the left is an suffer the political consequences an meanwhile when we speak of weakness the great institutions of the west deciding to abandon their most o fundamental values and attack those within the institutions who still defend the fundamental values that is another level of threat a we are seeing that materialize over the course of pope franchises rain in the vatic pope francs is not benedict is not john policeman pope francs is a liberation theologists in it there is no other way to read his activity inside the vatic i know that for a lot of catholic that is that is a hard thing to to recognize in and think about but the reality is that he is predominantly in economic marks with serious liberal leanings on the social issueside which is why he is put all of his focus on redistribution's politics in environmentalists an environmentalist m in ripping on supposed righting catholic or simply abiding by traditional doctrine with regard to social politics elude t issues the one the really the only socialissiuewhrehes been fully con listen with the church over the corsetimes benabortion all the other issues he his shown wavering on will now he is militarizing his stands by going after cardinals who disagree with hin according to the newer times almost as soon is pope francs to can the head of he roman catholic church and twenty thirteen raymonburk an america cardinal emerged as is leading critic from within the church becoming into fact antipope for frustrated traditionalist who believed francs was deluding doctrine france has frequently to moved in stript the america cleric of influence this month the pope apparently finally had enough according to one high ranking vatic official who spoke on the condition of anninimity france has told the meting of high ranking vatic officials he intended to throw the cardinal out of his vatic subsidized apartment and deprive him of his salary as a retired cardinal the news the possible conviction was first reported by the conservative italic newspaper that nova boots quotiadana i in screw this up it is close to cardinal burg and recently sponcsard a confront featuring the preset criticizing a major meeting of bishops convene by francs that news papers report comes only a week after francs removed another vocal conservative critictures of strickled the bishop of tailor texts after a vatic investigation into the governments of his diacid apparently asked about the report of at conspokesman metal krooni de lines to conformers o night tong or port cord i do not have anything particular to say about that well rob to that who is on a catholic himself he has a peace today in the nor times settle pope francs tries to settle accounts which is obviously a reference to the godfather their settling all family business add for years pope france is governments of the roman catholic church has been seemingly destined to drive the churches concerned and liberal wings ever further apart thus the persistent question hanging over his pontificate howl he hold this thing together by opening debate on wide r ray of hot button subjects without delivering explicit changing has en count he has encourage the churches progressives to push the envelope as far as possible even toward real doctrinal rebellion in the hopes of dragging him along at the same time by favoring the progressives in his personal decisions and making institutional war on legs of john poll the second and pope benedict the sixteenth h has pushed conservatives toward crisis paranoid and revolt on both fronts is done clear whether the papacies weakening authority con pull either group of rebel's back then the last few weeks we have seen a clear attempt to use that authority a real just of the possibility to keep the church together he is moved against two of his sharpest critics on the right that be strickled and burke he has also tried to draw bright line against the experiments of german bishops the leading progressive faction issuing letters o clearing any reforms the german contemplate cannot change the churches teaching on the animal priesthood an the immorality of homosexual relations but the reality is that again the pope keeps handing signals to the progressives that he basically agrees with them he just doesn't want ta move to fast the reality is that liberal catholicity is failing it is failing postal hat says pifalcism does not have a large umber of conservatives or progressive priests coming along in germany in fact they have almost no younger priests at all there only forty eight new seminarians in germany in twenty twenty two for church that still serves twenty one million self identified catholic the accistential crisis popes explain the intensity of pressure for liberalization and protestant isatin because to many german catholic leaders this feels the only way for the church to survive but the reality is that the only growing segments of any churches synagogs to in the united states are the ones that actually abide by traditional dicots traditionalist churches traditional synagogs those are the ones the are growing progressive churches progressivesinegots are dying out be it turns out if ye just want a go to the democratic party rally an go to a democratic party rally and it does not take all that kneeling and saying stuff and satin and eating foods he so get some seaside a democratic party rally and dire hair blue and basically achieve the same goal if yo an not join a call the cute of left wings is much more fun than the cult of progressive christiania which still bears that weird tinge of bazar guilt and obligation the fact of pope francs has been actively going after his conservative opponents and if y if you want u thing the future of the catholic church this would be the way to do it this would be the way to do it and then again that that happens to be true of virtually every one else in religious life these days the single worst thing that has happened to the lest over the course of the last seventy eight years rely since the end of world were to has been that a cline of religion i the west that cline of religion the lest is led to a wide rise in radical theologies masquerading is politics in's been really really bad the answer to that is not a church that abandons it is central principles in favor of trying to cater to people who hate those principles and hate the church the answer to that is a more muscular response on behalf of eternal truths if you believe those eternal truths and if you do not not sure what your down in church in just one second you will get to the latest media self be clowning because it really

arecertainly not allowed to make jokes about it which is why we totally make lots of jokes about it in lady callers just another reason you should goes subscribe right now because lady callers the funnies move the decade it is going to be out fridge night eight p m eastern you will only get access to it if you come a dailywares subscribers to go do that right now can me seeing of the media be clowning themselves i have to say as we talk about the for the medias supply of racism the the supply of racism does not get demands the media are desperately desperately in need of a supply of racism because they write about full tin and they have decided that they're just going to make up stories now about racism the latest is a story about a young kana city chiefsfan who war face paint the face pain is half black and half get the cate is wearing canvas city chiefs covers is aces painted half black and half red and he is wearing a headless you now to cant city chiefs mascot and tum dead seen reporter baron chilies wo apparently spends all day just booking desperately for for some sort of racism to report a accused this kid named holding a mental of mocking black people after seeing a picture in profile which did not show the half of his face painted red chilies also slam holdings native america headless and his tomato chop gesture blaming little boy had quote found a way to he black people an native america at the same exact time there is only one problem is one the great selfhood swell time it is fan frickantastic turns out that their actually has native america heritage his grandfather serves on the manta tune band of who mash indies the team's malt ethnic squat had enthusiastically joined in with holdings india shopping juster the kid is technically native america but his also apparently race he says hit takes a lot of r disrespect to dis respect two groups of people at once firs again betas putting on kensichieves colors black and red he is not mocking black people an he's not mocking red people those are the colors of the team in the same way that if you were for example an else baker's can yellow got ism in golden golden purple right that's be that thud be the colors but that is he said that he is races against black people and also racist against native america people and the kid is native america and then he he adequate this is what happens when ban books stand against critical race theory and tried to a race centuries of hate you give future generations the anal they need to evolve in recreate racism better than before that is the stupidest thing have ever heard first felt that is a great case for bandit critical race theory because critical race theory makes yon more on makes yo a dummy it make see the kind of person who believes that kid painting his face in the team colors his races for doing melon musk i then a congratulated his seem for spotting the error in this because there is a m a community notes the got attached pointing out ha stupid this is the pole her nominated reporter was on abash this ma's not made for poster attar shows the praetor is these case for the idiots on my mention or treating this is some harmless act because the other side of his face was painted red i could make the argument it is even worse cellar the one who hate pelicans but wear sombreros on sink what condign complete nonsequer again just amazing work there superamazing work there from dead spin for making is kiddish because this kid as on a file a lows you would not believe and it is going to be great and i am here for it joining in the clown show was of course clown can leotard who is a a a supposdsports commentator who spends his day doing progressive politics most of time or least more than he show and he defended the dead spin peace he said no matter what you should never put black and red commination on your face ever it is races do not do it ever here is a picture of a can leotard last year dressed up as a member of a roman he is running black an red on his face or no that is who it must be races mushy races again the supply of races him in the united states is just not keeping up a demand into the price is rising that is what is happening here i gan meanwhile the twenty twenty four race continues a pace dona true way out in front obviously of the rest of the field butt the coke network has now announced that they are going to back nickel hale a going to the water journal america for prosperity action a conservative drop bled and partly finance by charges coke said tuesday would support the former south caroling governor handyman ambassador the organization support is to boost hale as the campaign enters the final seven weeks before i a if he said she has what it takes to lead a policy a ended take on our nations biggest challenges and help in sure our country's best days our head with the grasses and day to capability wo bring to bar in this race no other organization is better equipped to help her do it the question is whether she has grassroots momentum weather she has inform striction ore take n age the the biggest question in this race is what is the dynamic that's any mandate we is notional trumpet d fee town trump if you want trump defeated in the primaries the problem with hale is that if the basis cops out his support does not go to hale if the basis transit drops out his support will largely go by pulling data to trump and then the race is over that just that is the match again i really ambassador hale leknickey a latch is a wonderful person she is done a lot a good things particularly is you an ambassador she is done a good job in this race if nickel not to dances out to mantis is going to his votes will go to trump that is where they are going by contrast if haleywere drop out her votes would largely go to to mantis now is that mean any of them have a chances topping trump we right now again he is a formidable favorite if the basis does not wen i what his out the race mean is really that simple if the basis does wen i and haleywin's new samphire they go to south caroling hale main south caroling and at that point trump probably runs the table if you look at the rest of the race unless there is this sort of god bleeds mentality in which trump has ben wounded and now people do not vote for him but again i do not see the dynamics of the race radically shifting in favor of of nickel hale if ronde basis drops out of the race that that is inherently the problem in just the second will get t o rondosants is trying to recapture som magic

to recapture some magic going into the we coxes again looking at the poles right now down trump does have a very wide lead still in i the latest poll from i state civic has trump up fifty four to de mantis eighteen to nickel halers twelve take is coming in at six per cent in that particular poll again on average trumps at forty seven and t mantis is it seventeen ounce calk es state you fancy big moves in places i in new samphire trump again still has a big lead in second place this time is halers sort of flip flops with de mantis action crispy is still polling in the low double digest eleven per cent in the latest washington post monmouthpoll but of new hampshure but trumps at forty six half at eighteen chrissyat eleven and to mantis at seven even awake is actually pulling ahead of to mantis to mantis looking to recapture some magic one plays sons to do that is having debate with gave newsroom the governor of californy who is rung a shadow campaigning case jo bison should keel over which is not an insignificant possibility before the election news's entire stick is to pretend that every other state is worse than his own there is only one probably it that as a former resident of californium a lifelong resident of californium it is not true if the reality is that again gavenuwsum has governed the statewide garbage californium is in serious trouble if if you look at the run down of florid versus californium the editorial word the waltergurna has a good run down today employment since canary twenty nineteen employment has increased by one million thirty one thousand in florid while declining by eighty five thousand in californium unemplo men despite as shrinking labor force californtia's four point eight percent chablistrate is the second height in the country nearly twice as high as florist's two point eight per cent business formation florid has received two point seven million now business applications since canary twenty nineteen one revery eight residents compared to one revery eighteen residents of californium personal income business and corner workerarnings have increased by annual compounded seven point seven per cent in florid since the first quarter of twenty nineteen compared five per cent in californium populate ion migration between jury twenty nineteen n jury twenty twenty two over a million californians left brother state that include most o my family while seven hundred thirty seven thousand people on next moved to florid that means according to latest diarrestato californium lost fifty fifty five points seven billion dollars and adjusted grows in come between twenty nineteen and twenty twenty one energy price are twice as high in californium as in florid state local taxi californium at up to ten thaws n one hundred sixty seven dollars per capita for ss five thousand four hundred six in florid pensions were fifty one point to billion dollars in californium last year for the seven point three billion in florid medicate californium spends a hundred and twenty nine point to billion dollars manually on medicaid for than four times as much as florid homelessness californium as a hundred and seventy one thousand homeless people firsts twenty six thousand in florid again bottom liner is that californium is leap so and florid is doing pretty well ow that is a preegood basis for a present actual campaign you would think but again politics is performative these days i think to mantis will dull in the debate against nuwsum but until somebody shows a real challenge to either bison or to trump they are the for on nominee at this point i mean they are obviously the front runners very very clearly a meanwhile republicans running into a bit of an interesting pickle there spinal hunter bison to talk about his dad and his business deals will now his lawyers are saying that he is going to come testify but only publicly according to politico as hunter don face faced a protracted criminal probe for years ho is told cooper with prosecutors an wait quietly for exoneration that is sprouts you fail will now he is taking his to his adversaries on directly over the past three months undermine has filled to barageof law suits and has challenged his indictment on gun charges by attacking the prosecution's painted he is even trying to seen a true the counteroffendcibill plant in court rooms and in public justice is father rams up his reelect campaign som of jobiton day's a world that is going to elevate bison in the public eye hunter bison that is and that the more you see of underside newest are going to jo that of course is certainly quite possible however it is also true that hunterbidon is trying right now to respond publicly to republican a terms to supine him by saying that do they want him to testify not behind closed doors in a letter tuesdays the house overside chair aims comer under bison's lawyer suggested that do instead of hundred test find behind to we doors he wants a public hearing on remember thirteenth argue d quote prevent selective leeks manipulated transcripts doctrine exhibits or one sided press statements course the will be largely per formative but am i in favor of open hearings supposed to close hearings and the substance i the hearings begin to be have out both have a get in open hearing with hunter and get closes hear in the open hearing he can jabber about how he is being is mistreated unfairly and how he is just a child leave the children club and the close dor hearing maybe get some substantive answers out of him but not not not a dumb political strategy the bottom line note is hat again jobiton is facing a he is facing an up hill battle for reelection that's be real about this the poles are not in jobidon's favorite right now and in the best argument that any of the other candidates originally had against trump which that trump cannot be widen that is of the poles are suggesting right now that is a very hard argument to make just on the data points and that is coming from somebody who is likely not s vote for trump in the primaries if the mantis or hale is on the ballet in just one second we have to get to the

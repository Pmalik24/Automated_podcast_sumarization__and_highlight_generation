a new signal poll initiates total panic among democrats as jobidon flat lines against to beth of republican candidates former trump eight peter nofvaros convicted of contempt of congress and the w who issues another coven warning a bencher of this is venchvero so the bench vino show sponsor by express it v piano talk abut them every single show why have not you gotten of vpianyet get express van it out expressive plans i come freshmen there is talk now among democrats of pulling the rip cord on jobidon it is time to parts shout out o bison land the reason of freaking out is because there is a pole last went from the walker journal those really bad for jobidonat showed that he had approval ratings in the third es it showed that he is running dead even with donate trump now there is a second pole out from signal showing the jobidon is indeed an extremely weak candidate against sign and is pole you'd imagine that general be pretty friendly to presented bison this pole certainly is not according to signed there is no clear leader in a potential see match recent bison and for president trump who's widely ahead in the get be primary nearly half of registered voters forty six per cents say literally any republican presidential hominy would be a better choice than bison in went twenty four meanwhile hypothetical matchrops also suggests that would be no clear leader should bison face one of the other major go p contenders there is only one that notable exception against governor like hale of south caroling former you and ambassador he would lose forty nine forty three according to the signal pole all the rest of the republican candidates are running either dead even with bison or within one point of bison either up or down since bison announce his reelection been earlier this year his approvalratings have remain mind in the low forty similar to donate trumps standing in twenty nineteen well below road pagan barokamum an build canton at this point ahead of their reelection campaign the the fact is that virtually every metric four america about jobidon is bad his job real ratings that thirty nine per cents according to signal fifty eight per cent say his policies have made economic conditions in the united states worse that is up eight points since last fall seventy per cent of people say that things are going badly in the country fifty one per cent still say that government should be doing more to solve the nation's problems which again those fifty one percent of america to look at our government and see how in truce of our government is and how large it is teach meaty we spending thing the government ought to do more to salt my problems honest god j banging banging your head against a wall repeatedly is not a good strategy for solving problems on biding personally fit eight per cent a voters say they have an unfavorable impression of him fewer than half of america only forty five per cent say biding cares about people them that is a terrible number for captain empathy over there only thirty three per cent describe him as some one they be proud to have as president of the united states u they really really low number two thirds america say now not to were proud of it only twenty eight per cents of america say the jobidon inspires confidences only twenty six per cent say that he has stamina and sharpness enough to survefectively is president meaning seventy four per cent say he is not he is not viral and sharp enough to be president those declines are notion my republicans the are given by democrats an independence is well seventy three per cents of america say that are concern the bison's age might negatively effects is culled his current level of physical mental confidence seventy six per cent are worried that he will not be able tocerve out another term sixty eight per cents say that they are worriedabout his ability to understand the next generations concerns for people younger than sixty five that seventy two per cent old people not he under starts the young people but you would imagine uts what they say because they are older most a democratic voters at this point are hoping for all turn of debidon sixty seven per cent of democrats and democraling voters says either very or extremely likely the bine will again be the parties nominee but that same per centare sixty seven per cent say the party should nominate somebody other then jobidon that is up from fifty four per cent in march now they cannot name who that person should be there just saying we are very dissatisfied with jobidon we do not him very much now they are been serious proper y inside democratic party for jobidon strong majorities of democratic in democraticallyine voters say that biding cares about people them ut that is at eighty one per cent that shouldn't be at eight one per cent if you are democrat that should be ninety per cent ninety five per cent your support was inside your own party wouldn't be at eighty per cent seventy five per cent job approval among democrats that is on very good free president of your own party only fifty one per cent of democrats say that he inspires confident and only forty nine per cent say that he as the station sharpness's are effectively is president a minority of democrats think that cordon is up to the job as far as the biggest concern with bison forty nine per cent say his age his mental acuity seven per cent health semen per cent are also top concerns of my mouth is crack that sixty three per cent of the america public or am sixty three per cent of democrats who say that do they are deeply worried about basically his his ability to function other seventy another see per cent say there world betta ability hands the job seventy per cent of democrats are at least widely concerned about these particular problems only five per cent say they have no con ferns those are those are really really awful numbers as far as the choice is in a twenty twenty see mats registered voters are currently split between trumpet bide the have got trump up forty seven forty six over jobidon in these in this pole now through the real decline for bison there is among minority voters and this is why i think this pole and a lotipoles it a find of a chimera i think that their lot of polsrght now that we're showing bison at bad numbers because their lot of people are saying that they are wavering about jobidon but i do not believe that those voters are going to stay on t e side lines or flip to dona trample explainer i mean by that in just one second first is your sulphone

signed pole the numbers tat are showing don at forty six per cent there is some other numbers baked into that cake that ism not certain are going to maintain up until the election in othewords he is certainly running week he is certainly a very very week reelect candidate i think thar a lot o voters out there who are going to quotinquote come home cure's what i mean bison right now see's a majority of support among voters of color at fifty eight per cent his not going to in voters of color at fifty a per can he is going when voters of color at seven per cent the reason i say that is because if you look at the last election cycle in twenty twenty he won ninety two per cent of the black not he lost thirty eight per cent of the his panic vote he he won the his panic vote fifty nine per cent of his panic vote he one seventy two per cent of the action vote in t e last election cycle none of the subgroups are coming in at fifty right per center below two assume that all of them are going to coming collectively at fifty eight per cent i find that very very doll to believe no democrat has lost more than about thirty per cent of my norite vote for probably two generations the notion that this is going to be the time when the numbers to shift dramatically in favor of donate true have a hard time believing that that is the caivvhn the a lot people a sang not that atarontoll pollsters e vote for biting son at him very much but if force to the loris i think there can be a lot of voters who quotquote come home which is again why i think that counts er in intuitively one of the things that is that is strengthening bison is dona trumps candidacy man it is pretty obvious that that jobidon cannot turn out voters for himself nobody chobinor caresabout abiding joining literally ran a campaign as a corpse last time he ingoing to do the same time this this time except he is an older corps in a feel am out he is going a go from his face hole and then there a reel in back down the basemen in delftware an that is con be is entire campaigns i can is batetrump he is not in do it mono mono combat with trump not nothing his going to sit on the sidelines and wait for dona trump to be the center of a mention it on be exact cam campaign as last time now do you think that fully ten to twelve per cent of my north voters are going to shift t over from jobidon to dona trump have a very hard time believing those daft he still sees a majority support among college grabbers at fifty six per cent fifty five per cent among voters younger than thirty five fifty three per cent of women donate trump has majority supporting the sign an pole among white america men fifty three per cent voters with out a college to gree fifty three per cent independent voters are still breaking and bison's favorite forty seven to thirty eight to suburban woman fifty one to forty four again ism having a hard time seeing the path to victory in those numbers because it seems s to me that if i independent voters are splitting forty seven to thirty eight and all the democrats are voting against trump anal the republicans are voting for trump i i do not know how trump is able to pull out of victory under those circumstances again trump's high water mark is this pull at forty seven per cent could he wanna election with forty seven present him an he did in so thousand sixteen but it was the tightest rushing ever men he literally he lost the popular god and he was able to win the votes in precisely the right places is that history going to repeat itself in the selection cycle ironically again jobidon's bad poll numbers are actually helping him in sort of a practical cents they are elevating donate trumping the republican primary because it is making trump seem very electable against bison a lot of republican voters who love trump on a personal level there like don't have to choose between winning and voting for the unlike in the primary look at the boles that is totally understandable i get it in make sens riminlight trump in this pole is actually running the same as ronisantis the basis is is running had to had against biding at forty seven forty seven basically of the same numbers if you are a a trump faced hid love the guide and somebody says you will is not electable there no look at thespone the can o go well i mean who is he is running the same as all the other re publicans he basically runs fall re publican i cant i have my can veto to a vote for the guyjuy loan is entertaining and did good things for me last time around and is a giant middle finger it is the left and he can win just as easily as any other republican when ism telling yous i do not think that that is actually true but i certainly understand the date of t it is being presented on the other side and that is actually helping bison because if you believe as i do that jobidon's large advantage and voter turn out comes solely as a result of people hating dona trump well that is good for bison the other thing this good for bison about these bad pole numbers is that one of the tings that really hurt killer in twenty sixteen against trump the first time one of things that really hurt her was an assumption by literally every one that show can walkway at the election that was the baseline's sumption of virtually everyone you remember the the famous new york time's needle that showed the beginning of the right a ninety nine per cent publability that killer client was can be president and by the end of the night of course on a trump was president yourmember this because every one thought killer was going to win no one shut up to vote for her all these voters in wisconsin pennsylvania michigan all these voters eellike killer is in a win anyway and it is it is cold outside and i do not or that month ism seen a stay home and dona trip was able to sneak by my favorite staff from the twenty sixteen election that that proves this out is that in wisconsin which donate trump one by a fair my decent margin in wisconsin donate trump in twenty sixteen one fewer absolute votes than it money did in twenty twelve but men rosy lost the state because borak mama got the vote out for his side an killer canton lost the state in which in which who's runngaginst to present got fewer votes that it money did in is consent it it w the the twenty sixteen was election was reflection of two things people din killer coin and they thought for shirshos can win well the first is still truer people do not jobidon but they are certainly not sure that he is going to win and that means that if you aren't in certain and sike get your ass out of the chair on voter day and and i go do the thing the voter turn out is not on to be as lows at what is on can to be as high as it was last time because last time was in saying with all the mainland balling and all of the humor and the bealemriets in and the cove n everything but is i can be as low as it was in twenty sixteen lot of these places either from democrats name what is this utter this is giving reason for democrats to panic both should as shul give you the actual starts here with regard to how how bison runs gas various of the republicans trump is u is running as we say forty seven fort six override in this vow which is margin of are effectivelyther tide they are forty he is a forty see per cent to forty some percent against ronosantis he is down two to my pants forty six to forty four he is down two to him scout forty six to forty four he is up one against the take romasuamy forty six to forty five and he is sure down two to cross christy forty four to forty two christy over bison nick hayleyis dealing with a cleared she has a forty nine to forty thread n a hypothetical match up between the two according to seamen the difference is driven at elastin part by brought support for valley than for the republicans among white voters with college degrees which which makes him censes right all these other candidates a running for the exacts him crab that trump got nick valley does have some for white call or appeal than many of these other candidates do not the democratic coalition is white college educated voters and minorities that is that is their coalition and the republican coalition is white non college educated voters and a bevy of s prison marshal marshal legions from various minority groups that is higher than it has been under prior republican candidates if if he can carve away some the white college educate a group or some of the women or some the independent voters republicans have a good shot ad victory right now republicans are saying he are more deeply driven to vote in twenty twenty four seventy one per cents they e are extremely motivated democratic line vote or sixty one per cents shay the are extremely motivated and this is again why i think that this pole is con vachimara i do not think that gap is going to exist on electionday i then when he get to elections day after month and months and months of demotrump is on trial dona trump is a ratios donate trump is going to destroy the world democratic vototurn out in twenty eighteen in twenty twenty in twenty twenty one in twenty twenty two has been very very good democratic voiture out has not lagged in any elections since donate trump has been on the ballet or in the shadow been on the ballet do i think that a lot of democratic voters are just going get word en stay home i i have serious tots put again these poles center in actively may be actually helping be not a practical level democrats however are panics and get t that democratic panic in just one moment first have been on the road obviously the means not as much sleep as i need now i am home to night i cannot wait to get on my relic sleep mattress and go to sleep for hours and hours and hours it is the thing i most need in life my relic sleep mattress makes my life possible head on over to hell's

freaking out you can see the members the media or basically begging the democratic party please run somebody else now again bizarre we now have agreement between the two parties on one fundamental principle there is noway can lose to that that is the fun mental principle repellant no way we lose to this tottering old geriatric more on no way we lose this corrupt cat no way an democrat tor looking it down from it no way we lose to a guy who is under four separate incitements before the election and a got who participate the events from the last election to note to canary six and g who cant whose whose main campaign activity involves going on true social an saying stuff in raising hen he for his legal fun no way we could lose to that see both parties in agreement mean style the the predator me of the gripping fists saying noway we lose to that git the promise one side is going to be wrong right someone is going to lose the election someones getting have to lose the election you've assume or maybe this is search no accent and we will just keep runningthe him election over never never democrats are are actually panicking first which is interesting and again i think indicative of the fact that when we say the democratic voter turn out is gin to be lower i am not sore because if they are panicking that means the actually wont to win the election here is earn burnet with the kat porter the representative with whiteboard and a she she says should bide and be re place on the ballet with this can brutal polling does the democratieparty meed to start seriously looking at some one else president by has done a terrific job on the economy and i this this is a matter of just people wanting to tell sort of dream up what they could imagine for different kinds of candidates that this plate but the truth is join has a terrific story to tell o the economy but do you really think ultimately congress on ten that if people tost saw the economy in differently they would not care about all these other issues that they they seem to have strong a put pans on the stamina the age i whether they are proud to have in this president all of those a frankly pretty damning converse well i somebody who run three tough races i have read a lot of poles an my day and there is always cross signals a men i think that some of what you see here i ting at the end of the day you look at the biding a ability to win independent voters particularly over trump o you i think this is shaping up with some of the exact same demographics going the support president bid as the last time an i think you hear if anything even stronger con sons about president trump i mean again y you we here just going trump that is her only defense and as you will see that the defense mechanism forbidden always in fever's going to be trump jam tapper was asking similar questions to jobidons sampan chair cedi richmon saying essentially these are really bad poll numbers what you can do about it do you not acknowledge that the perception of his frailty perceive frailty is during his campaign is hurting his real action chances now about the president's age your going to voters will see his vigor voters well see his accomplishments if you just look at a his scajeris traveling around the world over the next for a half days to continue to show america leadership on the world stage when they can par president widens travel to that of a republicans even republicans that a running for president he is travelling almost thirty per cent more than there wow he is it the defense is the jobidon goes in cars sometimes and on plans again pretty we dealisabeth warn was also out trying to defend jobidon yet you can see how weak the defenses are and as we will see the real defense is that we hate dona trump as always has the only defense the democrats have for joint's presidency why do you thank there having such a hard time getting or mestee thou ya colony why ye thinks many democrats for party the test that ills be their standard barres there ye know what i i cannot do poles ism not good at this but i can tell you this presents lean a great who he can and how do i know that i just look an what he has delivered i look at thirty five dollars l and was and well see to hit t two thousand dollar cap on what seniors ay poupocket medical care i look at tunes and the number of people echos out wen to get bad for thirty five dollars here an fifty dollars over there i look at the fact that he is pass the biggest claim at package in tot history of the world and everybody is wait impost of a fact i cause you spend money on windmills really in in inflationary cycle and and ism pain a lot of money for gas overtime i go to pill up and you you are telling me he spent the lot of money on windmills like that is that that is your case i i when elizabeth warn who as a hazard law professor i do not know what pulls a what is a pole how do i read them i know elizabeth warn i met elizabeth warn in fact choose one of the people who was a recruiter a at the hazard law party i wen to when they we when they doing groupie unless angels and om elizabeth warn is man a freehold this this this is absolute nonsense but again the final democratic pitch is going to have nothing to doit jobidins can to have to be entirely to do with donate trump which is why if that is their plan if their plan is we run against tonal trump then the poor pulling forbidden actually creates kind of a bazar sweet spot in the eye of this hurricane for him all get to that momentarily its very weird first have your invested in a nice jack choose made a nice dinner whellyour body should n be any different en you were that suit in soft know once a week where those shoes ay be every day button are

dot come promicoch pure exclusionsupply see sight for details o gat again the democrats case it is always and fraverign to come down to we hate donaltrum that is all it is and coal his makes this clear right an't shoe shoes asked this question yesterday why what makes you think there in when the selection set well democracy is its sickout those of us who live in the national world our deeply annoyed by this kind of language the reason i say this is because democracy is always at stake mean what when we talk about what democrats have done using executive orders for example to cause ocean to try to force eighty million america to take a acceding the dey of wont a day or when jobidon decides to relieve student loans simply what the wave of his pen or when members of the democratic party try to under mine the credibility of the supreme court for when they refuse to acknowledge elections in gorge for example stay arms when all that happens that apparentlies good solid governments when republicans do any of the above then that of course is i is a threat to democracy but the reality is that are democratic institutions are pretty durable and they've prove themselves pretty durable the is who the this sort of language annoys m i i talk obi yester an the so when people say this is the last selection they line to you i know their long you because here not out in the woods training with he militia right now that is how i know people do if they think a war is coming they start preparing for a war you now they do not do sit by their computers in an air condition t office in tweet about it that typically not what they do but again this is the campaign strategy the campaign strategies can be jo widen in front of a blood red in a pen once hall talking about how fascism is is about to break a wave upon the country of dona trump we are to be reelected to the presidency this their entire campaign here is comelharris making that bazar case you were dustiness that e some of the republican critics that om of you and the present and when you look at current plane wonder for republican nomination is the former president the forty fit president we elects we we all ball there is e tomcat say and the america polo there is too much at stake is coed for if my opponent winds racism i rain and many america by it but if they do the only reason they bodies because the media are wears on routine basis and also because wearganispend the next year talking about dona trump and genuousex and if it little entire elections about dona trumping junior six and not about trobidons crap policies that does give the democrats leg up if youren'n independenvoter an all you hear day in an day out from the media is threats democracy dona trumps court today because the threats democracy dona trumps on court today beat the threats democracy canary six threats democracy if that is all you hear from now to electronic we've dona trumps on truth social tweeting about that stuff all day well i mean that is not going to be a good pathway to election wat would be a good pathway to election for any republican worth is solve is jobitdiness a terrible present he is really bat tho jobicaus what the vast majority of america agree with that and by the way tobidin's getting worse according t the losantialist finds the biding administration is now considering forcing some migrant families to enter the country without authorization to remain near the border in texts while awaiting asylum screening effectively limiting their ability to travel within the united states administration officials have ben considering that idea as a way to stem recent increases and the number of migrant families crossing the southern border which reportedly reached an all time high last month they are calling it the remain in texts plan which is it is clearly motivated by an attempt to stop all these people f going to new york and chico and blue on slaves where all the mayors are getting increasingly pistol so love this basically jobidon has an open for policy that is being greenlet by federal judges by the way because taxes tried to build a barrier in the middle of the red ground to prevent illegal migrant from crossing border and you us judge ordered texts to move those buses from the middle of the red ground this is the an embankment on the seaside the riverwich of course makes at a lot easier for people to illegally enter the country the bite administration is facilitating the entry of people into the country legally and then they are saying and by the we you have kep them in texts they cannot go to any blue areas we hat you have keep them right there in texts you have to suffer mean this is just youren't o about malicious governments malicious and nasty governments that would be the peak of it and by the we it is clearly response to democrats are becoming increasingly agitated about the fact they are perfectly happy with open border salons there haft pay the cost of it just everybody all the rich white democrats ore in favor of fun the police because they live in protected areas of the united states living gay communities and favor of deepen the police it is just that clothe people in blue cities and the i love open borders this a sanctuary city please do not come here redo not want a at you sanctuary please do not come here my favorite side by side of the day yesterday epic dams is a flash back two thousand twenty one epic dams talking about the magic of illegal migrants when you've think about it tho goo days us spent a were always central inflows a sustanstrog number of them or undocumented ben for delivering owes a worth stocking our store they were i in the streets keeping all city run and we have taipan a in a slay there to make our every one has help there when it to make sure we have proper translation services in all schools they keep our or city running says ericadams circus twenty twenty one u fast ford two years hers epic atoms yesterday waited i no support on this nasty ne cross a we receive in no support and let me tell you something new york is never in my line have a head a problem that i did not see in indie to i don't see indent's i don't see into this is you we will destroy new york i guys that is that well this this issued the migrant crisis will disturb thought that this was amazing place from any nothing more fun than watching left thing policies actually have there predictable consequences then watching the same people who advocated for those policies realize how bad those policies actually were now meanwhile the economy continues to slow i know that they are telling you that is not the case again if you operate the business there yard this every staff that is coming right now is a staff that is rooted in consumer spending consumer spending is not what drives economic growth what drives economic growth is people producing new products new innovations things that are cheaper and easier things that are better and more efficient you known that happens when business is in vast you mot business are not doing right now because they are scare where the economies going investing money is tightening up it is not as loose people are being a lot more meticulous about where they put their money and by the ay that is going to have downstream facts palmar according toe waster journal is now paying some new store workers less than it would have even three months ago a sign that employers are seeking to out labor cosses the once hot market for hourly staff cools the country's largest private employer changed its wage structure for hourly workers mid jury according to documents reviewed by the waster journal and palmar employs under the new structure most new his will earn the lowest possible hourly wage afore that stor in the past some new hers such as those who collect items for online or held made slightly more than the other new staff members such as cashiers the wage structure change came after palmar and other large employers have for years steadily rased wages n to benefits to attract workers in a tight labor market the market is starting to flat n out people are not kin to pay as much but those price there still inflated which means that the price iron a start then at have there can have to come down when that happens people on to start losing jobs a the the gravity still applies here meanwhile health and turns costs ire taking the biggest jumps in years according to the waster journal health an turns cost our climbing at the steepest rating years with some projecting the biggest increase in more than a decade we wallop business is and their workers in twenty twenty four costs for employer covers are expected surge around six point five per cents for twenty twenty four he is are bad economic numbers and they are because of jo bison and his in stationary policies what would you rather run an election on that stuff for would you rather run election on whether donate trump is mean and nasty or weather he is the greatest patriot whoever live the more your talking about trump thewless our talking about bison it is a simple it is a simple matter of mutually exclusive time use you cannot talk about both trump and by there are not the time a campaign he the people are focus on one candidate or there focus on the other candidate which again brings up the fact that the legal troubles unfair as they are that democrats are now leading on top of dona true there does ins have n effect and they will haven effect just because they are bat justcause there unfair does not mean that will not have an effect that absolutelyill have an effect his people are talkingabout the stuff as they will then you know there not talking about join being awful at his job is it t taken incredibly due example now peter never who is a former white house official he was found guilty of contempt of congress charges for refusing to cooperate with congressional investigation into the canary sixth two thousand when one attack on you us capital there is a short trial for nevarro he is the second trump are to face contempt of congress charges after stove band an band was convicted on who count how sentence to four months behind bars he is been free penning appeal nevarro has vowed to appeal the verdict you as de strict judge i mean data found that never did not have enough evidence to show that tum trump had invoked executive privilege that's the claim that ark holder made a colder you remember was the turning general for brock about mac he also was found in contempt of congress for not showing up and testifying in font of congress he was not actually formally charge because he claimed executive privilege and barocchamo ma backed him trump has not really made a statement about with the navar was utilizing executive privilege and the evidence is not there or the judges well if's not executive privilege then you have to show up and testify but here is up peter never explaining i said from the beginning this is going the supreme cord said from the beginning i am willing to go to prison to settle this issue ism willing to do that but also know that the likelihood of me going to prison is relatively small because we are right on this issue ckawup he i think he actually is right on the fissure meaning that he has a couple of defenses one is executive privilege because he was working for trump and therefore whatever he said to trump was not he is not compelled to talk about that in front of congress executive privilege applies and and too even if he thought executive privilege applied it may be enough because you have to show beyond a reasonable doubt that i was not accident inference or mistake that he did not show up for the for the cheering in congress colic he wroth wrong get on is calender butler he thought he actually had a rational reason for not showing up in that he thought executive privilege have ben invoke but he is that the story that animas can be telling that have the entire the legal in and out first all if you are it is already too late if we're explaining your losing beyond that the actual story people can be covering is that cars broke out the press conference i were going just do this here is some the case of the press conference we've one most important constitutional separation of pours issue and people will not let me speak i first the member it is what me going to do now i is alow o a mi on i a yorotaltid me that oo flat let i be gin the o good time si means it this all grab ten is just this algae go extraordinarily well an just a second we will get to the legal panel facing an tonal trump he is now saying hat he will testified his own trial his lawyers going in the back

could face concoct of interests if he is representing trumpet also facing want nowt again this is going to be the the story of the campaign unless dona trump is a very meticulous campaigner and that has not been his history in the past meanwhile do trump is sounding off who he ad most likely to make the answer is o pagan market the real i bring up ninety million people watch that ninety million people and the only thing i think that might draw an audience to the even approaches that would be if you were to sit own with the dockers of sure mean mark and prince hurry they him much would you do that for the ratings i to a you go w the queen i the a e fly the been you e credible woman ninety five you to sop i tit this it er not a we the you you on on i a you a but i did now li embody i but they would not be the only one but i mean that would get ratings would not it i you want o et et u e ate a e a o yo a o o i let e to do e i would oi that he heres the thing down trump is much more entertaining than every other person in the race that is his draw it is also it is his it is his blessing his cur spider man i the the fact that town from is much more magnetics much more charismatic much more interesting than every other person thrice means you've in me talking about him if your talking about him you are thinking about him if mouthing about him and talking about him you now you are not thinking are talking about the dead guy in the corner of the president that is that is in that is anenotchel the problem in the selection cycle i can meanwhile the w echo is now sounding yet another major alarm over cold wo o here we go get ready according to the express world health organization has warn of concerning trees for covenineteen a had of winter as a dangerous new strain runs rampant across the northern hemisphere here is the w to chief fetus at hokum get basis explaining that i it is time to i get prepared for lowdown s again the cisidwas eternal is is show o the choovit is h to it an that we'll con t to tools scientude now cat great well meanwhile they are lot of schools presumably led by all the seasurgunians that are trying to mask up again according to the express schools across america a rein stating mask mandates for kids in response to the surging cases again i will remind you that covet as a general rule the original strain which killed a ton of people who are seven years old killed almost no one in the youngest age group kinteroverse junior his and albata has asked all students staff in visitors to tart wherein face masks in classrooms despite the absolute failure according to all data of mask mandates to actually effectuate a a reduction in spread of disease alabamas talidaga city school district which is home more than one thousand seven hundredstudents has also urge children and staff to hear masks they said they are encouragebut to required mainland elementary school became embroiled in controversy this week after they said the student must a dawn and en ninety five masks for ten days despite just smattering of cases your c celt officials are camping up their messaging around masks as well for g ho new mask wars again which is just delightful meanwhile green chomp here i show asked about the c d c and o apparently they are going to ignore their own masking advice which is exciting stuff we are in indifferent place than we were two r three years ago but even be no into be reminding t than d wait and returning about schools thirty t they are the experts there the science o to come to to come forward with their guideline and it is important that we allow them to do the work oh i yap great s i guess we will be talk mat mask mandates in school again literally the least useful intervention of pretty much all time ere going do that again in the name of science now would not that be a good thing fur the republicans to talk about when that be a good thing for them to run against it might be i ain't do that meanwhile controversy continues to squirrel around this in sane gambit by the democratic party to basically got the america military that we an pay for abortion their basic idea is that you must allow the america military to pay for people to travel to other states for abortions or we just wont even put up for a code leaders of the military and then well lame re publicans for not green lighting that that is the gold the crated cropland which the cropland chichis all of our military appointments plus abortion and republicans fly ha out this you put those guys up individually and we will say yest to them individually and we will not say yes to the abortion stuff and democrats why a you gutting the america military mommy tubbervill the senator from albata he he is pointing out how ridiculous this is he he says on sitter senator stumer could put these nominations on the floor when ever my wants to which of course is exactly right it is not stopping democrats from long about it elizabeth warn who i mean lust be real t when we talk about people who are deeply concern about america military readiness elizabeth warn does not list in the top hundred here is h lis with warrant explaining that mommy tubberville is undermining america national security ism sure you speak to southern your republican counterparts on the senate your francs but sone of them how can they allow the sky to continue with is what is going on a s to at start with the first part and that is what senator topervillas doing is undermining our national security this is what teary defend ten this is what all of the defense exist say and thesis in fact i sure you have heard the story about the chines diplomat who recently wit laughing and making for it is america calerpart betas we cant even a our military promotions in long yet they care deeply about the military promotions we will know what they care about is making you pay for other people's abortions that is o they really car about and violation basically common sense rules that senate has abided by for decades right that federal funding should not go toward abortion does mean the federal government has not fun to planparno they have but then it were not spot to directly pay for abortions until we are now doing meanwhile the rest of the republican candidates are still out there it r tongue lout about trump eras trump is far and away the leader front runner in the field what the poles are showing right now is some movement on behalf of nick daily in particular states particularly in iota you seeings to movement for nick half nationally trump is still foreign away the leader he is was had aby thirty four points in last see an an pole that is impose showing the bison is very week is showing trumpet fifty two to want at eighteen nobody seen double digests for all the incoming that the mantis has taken he is still the number two candidate in this race by a fairly long shot even in iota the latest poles are still showing that de mantis is foreign away number two it is got trump at forty two and de mantis an nineteen that is going to late t anbisynews to join registerpole in new samphire it is basically trump and then a scrum the latest emersion pole has trump at forty nine and then has tosantis at eight christy at nine scout at six romaswuamy at three you have got a trafolgar group pole which got t tick with grain of salt with trumpet fifty wants tat eleven christy at nine shot at eight to masuammy at ten signs to bunch people for s are congregated there the mantis still remains the most durable second place candidate despite all the incoming that he is been taking and despite facts he has not really had a lot of and a break city moments in his campaign far yesterday some more on in the crowd suggested that he was responsible for a a mass killing of black people in jacks bill and i and this is where this anis really is the bast the dances really is quite glad at fighting back against his sheer i hears what sounded or the sing you lad weapons to fill the street into immature hateful people an have cause the deaths of the people were turned a couple weeks ago first of all i did not allow anything with that we listen excuse me ism not going to let you accuse me of committing criminal activity i i any a i with mayor ait he should have been he should have en rule intelligible but they dent involuntarily commit him an they were no no i do not know know there is not true there is something about o true you downcome here n in in lame me for some madman that is not appropriate and ism not going to accept it a it is then that is what the chances get out more of this more of the dissansis would probably help him in the basic a time for some things i and then some things that i hate sell things that that i to day organ of course has been good on this issue for a while now because german operates in a very masculine world where men fight each other in a cage and that you's talking with pillar recently about called genera affirming carrying he went directly after it hit is a terrifying that there that they are calling it gender affirmant care when it is really childhood mutilation before you have the ability to figure out what permanent means you are seven years old you cannot get your face tat thou you cannot go to war you cannot get married there is reasons for all that stuff you are too young and this idea that you should be able to make life changing choices hormone blockers run which are a not reversible no mater what the they say they say it is reverse will know the changes happened to your body during puberty and if you stop those changes that change is you cannot reverse that you are gong to have a micropenus your your taking estrogen while your bodies developing your blocking at tostostron if you are doing all that stuff it is going to have an effect on your body enough you are happy without effecting you do not care o we but how many people are and how many people young and how many d transitions are there who have horrible stories and and you are a monster in a big it if you even bring that up he is right obviously the fact that you one of the great ironies about this whole damage and pillar obviously on the resat is tomato him is it forty years ago dentistry was on bill marshal and you will recalled then is prayer literally sad therefore people who say the men menstrual it an pillar and his entering spinal laughed at that us this four years ago and now pillar and organ are having to say the something with tennis was saying it is amazing how fast the the culture change is and moves in time with what the radical left wants e time for a couple of things that i hate killer canton has a new job is exciting she apparently is

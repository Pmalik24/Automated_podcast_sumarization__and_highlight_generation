welcome to the superman lagoon science science pace toe i man drhuberman and om a professor of neurobiology and entomology at stamford school of medicine to day we are discussing the immune system and we are also discussing the nervous system which is the brain final cord and the connections of the brain and final cord with all the organs of the body we are also going to discuss how the nervous system can be used to activate in control the immune system about ten twenty years ago somebody said that the mind could control the immune system it probably get laughed out of most academic conferences and certainly the work wouldn't be published in quality journals but nowadays there are dozens if not hundreds of quality pure reviewed studies on how the mind and how the nervous system can control activation of the immune system this is a wonderful growing body of research and just to give you a hint of where we are headed with this just this last week there was a paper published in nature which is the apex journal for scientific publishing pressure journal extremely stringent a paper published in nature from chufuma's lab at hazard medical school explored how acupuncture can reduce inflammation in the body and i will describe the study in a bit more detail later but what they discovered was that by stimulating the body in particular ways that particular sites on the body they were able to liberate certain sells and molecules that enhance the function of the immune system and potentially can be used to combat different types of infection and just give you another little hint they found that a particular type of organ tissue called fascia some of you may have heard of fascia fascia surrounds our muscles just to look at it you might think its a kind of useless tissue at sort a dense bag that in which the muscles are contained well turns out that those dense bags are much smarter than we thought they do not have a mind of their own but by stimulating the fascia in a particular location on the body there is a pathway leading out of that fascia directly to can organ called the adrenal medulla it'll explain what all this means that could liberate particular chemicals that had a potent anti inflammatory effect were basically saying is that the nervous system acts as a set of highways between the different tissues of your body calling into action the immune system liberating particular molecules that can reduce inflammation and lead to faster healing and i will explain how all of that works as well as some other non acupuncture methods for activating and enhancing the function of the mine system to day were can be talking all about healing with the mind in a completely non mystical nonabstract since before we begin it'd to emphasis that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd the thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens at lentic greens is an a in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast he reason i started taking athletic greens on the reason i still take athletigrens once or twice to day is that t helps me cover all f my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i mig have in addition it has robotics which our vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called got microfilm and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your mine system with your brain to regulate mood and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens it get the vitamins i need the minerals i need end the phobics to support my microfilm if you would to try athletic greens you can go to athletic greenstone come slash supermen and claim a special offer they willie you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitemend three k too there are ton of at and ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if for getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient in vitamin d three and k too is also important because it regulates things cardiovascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic green stock come slash supermen to claim the special offer of the fivfree travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar have talk many times before in this podcast about the key roll of hydration and electrolytes for nerve sell function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium and potassium present in the preparations all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration end that your getting the preparations of electrolytes if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element doc come slash supermen and you will get a free element sample pack with your purchase they are all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to element element do come slash supermen of let us talk about the immune system and the nervous system and how the two interact and how you can control eurimian system to serve you better we are going to talk a lot o mechanistic science little bit of detail you learn some new language around the mine system names of the different sell types and forth but i promise to make it all very clear regardless of your background we are also going to discuss a lot of tools and i think many of you are probably here because you want to know what you can do in order to boost or enhance the function of your mine system and a very reasonable question to ask i want to begin by just acknowledging that if one were to put that question into the internet you would get back a lot of answers and there is now a sort of generic form of that answer that deserves our respect but is not going to be the topic of conversation to day i just want o tip my hat to it however and list off of few of the things that we know set us up to be healthier then we would be if we did not do these thing the first of course is the foundation of all mental and physical health which is to get adequate sleep meaning enough sleep whatever it is for you that you require to get deep sleep s it is got a be of high quality and to time that sleep correctly meaning you cannot sleep during the day one day and at night the next day and expect your system to function well talks a lot about that before on this podcast you need a relatively consistent sleep casual most of the time about eighty per cent of the time or even better would be ninety per cent of the time but the realities of life make it that we cannot always go to bed at the same time and wake up at t the exact same time look we need sleep we do need sunshine why do we need sunshine because it sets our rhythm in to a regular state where the genes in all of our cells can be expressed at the correct times where sort of a factory of cells if you will in that factory can only run properly if it knows when certain things should be active and when certain cells should not be active and the best way to coordinate all of those activities of all the cells is to get sunshine in your eyes in the morning and again in the evening and not to get too much bright light in your eyes in the middle of the night that is just foundational and then any list that you will find on any number of websites on the internet would say o cay get good sleep get sun i get exercise how much exercise we should all be getting a hundred fifty to a hundred n eighty minutes of on too cardie that s cardie vascular exercise where we can just barely hold a conversation or may be not per week we should be eating well we are always told we have to get good nutrition what good nutrition means to you is going to be different than what it means to somebody else but a we acknowledge that food in take and quality of food in particular avoiding process food sails going to be important social connection is important hydration is important yourestarting to get the picture we can take all that acknowledge it as useful and foundational for mental and physical health but of course there are many people who still struggle with getting ill too oft in or with not being able to heal from physical injuries and wound s or from a various bacterial viral infections quickly enough or deal with chronic disease and to day is really about how you can take all of that at information acknowledge it and follow it but in addition to that there are things that you can do to leverage your nervous system in order to enhance the function of your immune system in very robust ways that is what id to shift the conversation to the first topic we have to attack is the question of what is the immune system and how does it work i think many of you have heard of antibodies or killer cells or the various organs of the body that are involved in the union system the bone marrow the spleen the thymus and the limp nodes i to just take a moment and do a sort of brief immune system one or one really simple cover the basic elements of the moon system that every one listening or watching this can get a clear sense of how the immune system function and what its basic parts are for some of you this might be two basic might be a little bit of background you already know i think for most of you this information will be new and i promise you you do not need a bi biology or medicine background in order to understand this it is actually really simple because it is truly elegant in design you have three main layers of defense for your health these are the three things that are constantly at work to protect you from invasion and illness from bacteria from viruses and from parasites and the first of those three is a physical barrier that we call your skin that might seem kind of obvious but everything about you is contained in this compartment that is boundaries by your skin and your skin is a very important aspect of yourimune system if you have ever had a cut you essentially have a breach of the boundary that is your immune system and you would notice a number of things would happen you might i get some swelling around that cut a you might get a scab likely you would get a scab over time you if you got dirty there are some bacteria that got in there you might see some accumulation of white blood cells what is called posse now it is wont of gross but that is what that is you might take on a yellow tint because of the a accumulation of some dead cells there but basely your skin is the primary barrier through which you keep things from the outside that could harm you from getting to the inside now still in category one your body in your external surface you have openings to that surface right you are not just round a or a body shaped a completely covered up with skin you have openings what are those openings will it start at the top and work our way down a primary site of potential infection are your eyes if your ears you your nostrils you your mouth if those are going to be the primary sights by which things can get into your system and you need to put things into your system yin you to drink and eat and you see o get light in your system that is what you have those openings but bad things meaning things that can harm you can get into those systems and then of course along the back your throat all the way down to your stomach in your digestive system and through your intestines and out your rectum you have a tube that you are basically a series of tubes have said that before in this podcast and this is one such tube by which you extract nutrients from the outside environment but all along that tube including your nose and your mouth it is lined with mucus and while mucus might seem kind of gross to some of you the more you learn about mucus them wore you realize that mucus is really really cool because mucus essentially acts as ay filter as a trap for bacteria viruses end it has certain ways of scrubbing or killing those bacteria viruses now the mucus is constantly being turned over as will talk about later the chemistry of that mucus is really important in order to make sure that certain things do not make it into your system and other things are allowed to move through your system and you can extract nutrients from them the reason ism talking about this first category of a barrier for immune system in such detail as it'd you to invasion yourself as a human of course but as a human that is a a clear entity from everything else and you have to bring in the right things hand you have to keep out the wrong things or kill them now inevitably bacteria viruses and parasitic infections are going to make their way into our body but whether or not they are killed off or whether not they take over and cause us harm is going to be determined by layers two and three layers two and three are the called innate immune system and the adapt of immune system the innate immune system is what i will call the second layer of defense it is very fast whether or not it is bacteria virus or parasite what happens when you have something enter your body maybe you swallowed it may be got in through your eyes may be ah you shook somebody is hand who is carrying up particular a kind of illness and then you wiped your eyes and have talked about o this podcast before very soon after we meet another person usually within thirty seconds believe it or not most people wipe though that persons chemicals somewhere on their factor or on their body surface as has been demonstrate over and over again ah that you ant to learn more about that we did not episode all about chemical signalling where you can learn about it i know it sounds weird and you might say i do not do that but indeed you do a most of the time most everybody does was to this innate immune system is this rapid response when something enters our system and our body does not recognize it it is not food it is not clean air it is thing that is either a bacteria virus or parasite and the inademian system involves the release of particular cells that are waiting torment ready to attack whatever this invader is and some of these sellotapes you have heard of before the most typical one are they care the called white blood cells the white blood cells will actively go to the site of invasion and will start to encapsulate or trying surround that give an invader the other names of these different collotypes or things neutrafills natural phages natural killer cells just a few of the many types of immunecells this gins an ambulant system but rather than go and try and keel something a paramedic would they go there and they try and surround and kill whatever this invader is they work in concert with two other assistants and those assistants are called the complement prolines complement prolines exist in the blood and what they do as they travel to sites where there's an invasion and they mark certain things for being engulfed and eaten they sort put a a and eat me tag on it a they they easily put a chemical tag on to invaders that then aloud those white blood cells neutrophils macrophages and actor killer cells to say a i need to i net basely raptor will kill this thing and then rapid in a body wagon send it off kill that thing rapid in a body bagonsend it off and ism using the analogy of the body bag but a in the cents it is one a it is the rite one rather because these cells that come in and kill things the way they do that as actually to ingulf the invading bacteria virus or parasites they she surround it and when you see poor you see infection am it in a may be a cut on the skin or something that or even in it a ingrown hair that i get some bacteria in it that possie that the the white part i know it is count of gross to talk about but those are the white blood cells and those of the dead oftentimes its dead cells and that is the dead invader sitting there it is trying to create in isolated compartment cause once to keep it in that part of the body of you get the inademian system the complement comes through blood and helps it by tagging certain things within eat me signal and then there are the cells that are either damage from the injury or from the parasite or are suffering because of the bacteria or the virus itself and the cells of your body will also release an alarm signal which is not and eat me signal but a help me signal and those help me signals come in the form what we call site kinds and the sit of kinds are things interleukin one interlunar six tumor necrosis factor alpha you may have heard of these things if you are it all a curious about or been learning about the health space a on line helspace especially the last to years inflammation is all the buzz word now everyone stalk of inflammation inflame ton inflammation what do we mean when we say inflammation well inflammation is a physical response butts also a chemical response and many times the markers of inflammation that are measured in people or an animal bodies models cases me where this research is done are things interlacing one interlunar six tumor necrosis factor alpha when those go up in the blood it is a sign that somewhere the is a cell that saying help me help me and is secreting these things which calls in those neutraphill's macrophages natural killer cells and white blood cells and it might help to remember all this but by just telling people that what interlunar means is to communicate right the interlunar i shouting out help me the complementprotines are coming in and saying eat eat this nagging the the invader with an came signal and then the killer cells and the white blood cells are doing the job of of tryst kill off that thing that is the innate immune systems the your skin and mucus lining plus your innate immune system are a beautiful two layered set of defenses against various kinds of invaders and infections and then there is the third type which is the adapt of immune system and you will notice that leading up until now i have not said the word antibody at all and that is because it is the job not of the skin or the mucus or the microfilm or the innate immune system to produce antibodies that can recognize specific invaders but rather it is the job of the adaptor immune system to create antibodies against bacteria viruses and even parasites and even physical o intruders to your system the adapt of immune system has its incredible ability to show up at the site of invasion or infection or inflammation it is called there by various o various cues including the side kinds that we talked about earlier and what it does is it actually attached to and creates a sort of a an imprint of the shape of whatever invader happens to be there if that a particular in invading bacteria virus has a contour that is conorippled or con o spicy or of whatever shape it happens to have it creates an imprint of that and then using that imprint in concert with some other cells creates antibodies that are specific to recognize that invader should the body ever have that invader inside of it again now that is why it is called the adaptive immune system and in many ways it creates a memory of a prior infection that these antibodies can be made any time that same invader comes back again i and this is the basis of what we call immunity this is the basis of what we call it an inhancedability to combat certain types of infect on and it is really a wonderful and i mean just a can even a state how incredible this really is that all of our bodies have this capacity right we have something called lucasites these are essentially white blood cells we have red blood cells and white blood cells and they both are derived from the same type of origin cellist us a stems when u hear stem cells stem cell just means a sell that can become many different types of of other cells a we sometimes here about stem cells a in terms of people that are getting injections of stem cells er the potential therapeutic a affects of a or potential of sum cells but we all harbor certain stem cells within us as well that can become lots of different cell types and there is one particular type of stem cell which is the himopoetic stem cell which can give rise to red blood cells and white blood cells and in general these reside in the marrow at least in in adults a in or bone marrow we have this ability to make certain cells that can go out when they are called out chemically they called out to cites and infection and create antibodies and then maintain those antibodies in our system or have a memory of that particular infection that if the infection comes back again we can kill it off immediately and it does not have to pass through these a multiple stages of first the innate response than the adapt give response taking some time there are lot more details to the adapt of man system but i just want to and beside a few points that might be relevant a first of all the name of the antibodies that are created sometimes come in the form of i m and i g things that sort this is into a full deep dive immunology class but i stands for immuniglobulent of the immunoglobulins are part of the adapt of immune response and in creating in a bodies if you hear i m the i m is the first of the adapt give immune responses and it tends to come on earlier somebody is a munopositive for i m for a particular type of viral or bacterial invader that means that it was a fairly recent infection later one creates the adapt in mine system i should say creates and i g which is the more stable form of the specific antibody that is going to recognize a given invader i g tends to come up a obit later just to recap some thing gets into your system through your eyes through some whole in your in your skin a caught through your mouth a sexually transmitted diseases come in through the mucus membranes that are on the genitalia or in the genitalia sexually transmitted disease airborne disease gets into the mucus somehow gets into the blood stream then there is the innate response which is a more general response of trying to contain and come bat the infection or invader and then the adapt of response is the one that generates the antibody's first the seem response the lunula globular m response and then the imimmunio globular we response i g response how do we keep these three barriers or these three defensesystems to infection toned up well leaving aside the list of things that i mention before that generally enhances their function things sleep and sunlight and good nutrition et camera that the sort of generic things for good health one of the key ways we can do that is to keep that mucus lining in really good shape and what does that mean well the the mucus lining needs to turn over quite often and it needs to be the correct chemistry to be a trap for the bad stuff and for it to be permeable to the good stuff to the nutrients that we need and it is now very clear from hundreds if not thousands of studies that the best way to do that is to maintain a healthy called microfilm the microfilm being these little bacterial organisms that are good for us that live all along are mucus pathways and even in our eyes now just to be really clear it is not just about the gut microfilm we actually have a microfilm in our eyes we have one that specific to our mouth we have a nasal specific microfilm there is one all along the gut and the species of microbioda that live all along the digestive tract differ from the mouth to the throat to the stomach in testing into the rectum it is well establish that there are healthy microbioda that live all along that lengthen they differ along that length there is also a urethral microbiota and there is a vaginal microbiota that promotes health of that environments is wealth how is it that one can maintain the healthy microbioda and not favor growth of harmful bacteria or allow that mucus lining to become too permeable to the bad stuff that can come in from the environment well as far as we know there are three railways to do that the first to are purely structural and mechanical it is very clear now from work some of which was done at stamford but elsewhere as well that the nasal microfilm is particularly good at scrubbing bacteria at preventing certain types of infection this is a reminder that whenever possible unless eating or speaking you want to be nasal breathing not breathing through your mouth your nose is a much better filter for viruses in bacteria than is your mouth the mouth contains certain structural features even organs and retypes that can a protect against in coming infection but you do not want to be a mouth breather for a variety of reasons and there is a terrific book called jaws a hidden epidemic which as written by micholecandracal n and pal garlic at stamford and stamford medicine with a forward by her diamond and robot zupolsky it is really a lot of heavy hitters on that book that talks about the increase in infection that one gets when breathing through the mouth as opposed to the nose now of course during hard exercise one breath through the mouth that is not necessarily bad when one is eating or speaking that is not necessarily bad at all guess it spend what your saying the joke but in general when possible you want to be breathing through your nose many people have trouble breathing through their nose because of called deviated septums or chronically collapsed sciences the best way to dilate those sciences actually to breathe through your nose it can take a little bit of time but there is some a plasticity to the sicknesses and be a nosebreathe or not a mouth breather you will combat more of the infections that you are constantly confronted with i should mention that we are always bombarded with different types of bacteria viruses and parasites in our environment and that the goal of courses to in reinforce your mine system o you can keep these things at bay and not get sick there is actually a paper that was published in sell report sell press journal excellent journal that showed that the nasal microfilm it has particular species of microbioda that a good at fighting off infection there has not been a direct link between particular patterns of nasal breathing and the nasal microfilm yet but oxygenation of that environment by breathing through your nose turns out to be quite important over all for enhancing it as a filter do not just think of your nose as something to smell foods and to bring in air its also an active filter for things that could invade you the other way to trying keep out bad things and to avoid getting sick is the advice that your mother and certainly my mother i gave me which is to not touch your eyes after touching other people or touching other surfaces and as i mention earlier we tend to do this subconsciously and that but the reason to avoid doing that is the eyes are a primary entry point for a lot of bacteria viruses you are constantly lubricating the surface of your eyes with the socolacrimal glands and tears and things of that sort if you have ever notice when you wake up in the morning you have some sleep in your eyes youth con a crusty stuff in the corners of your eyes er on your eyelashes that sleep that crossed are actually dead bacteria that you have successfully battled during the night and that is what that is it is not the accumulation of some healthy tissue it is the accumulation of that your healthy bucks membrane and tears and other things that are specifically combating those bacteria i know that sounds a little bit rose but that is what that is o your wiping away the a casualty is of a battle that you fought at night during the daytime you do not want to introduce viruses an things to to your eyes as much as possible it is a primary side of entry this is why people wear goggles in surgical units and things that sort to try to avoid getting a things into their eyes very very important and then the third way to keep a healthy line of defense a for your a entire mucus tract is to enhance the proliferation of good got microbioda the best way to enhance the quality of t for got mi crobiom and the mucus lining that services this protective layer all along yourbody is to invest two to four servings to day of tormented foods low sugar tormented foods have talked about this before a bunch of times on the podcast but these are data from a my collie just in soninburg lav at stamford me and there i just wiped my eyes yet you got me a but that a paper publish in the journal cell which is a absolutely spectacular journal a really points to the fact that when people eat fermented foods two to four servings per day it helps reduce the activity of certain sit kinds now what those are right sells make side kinds to call out help me help me it to reduce the amount of a sit kinds the called inflamatome now that does not render those sells more vulnerable the reason they saw a reduction in a lie six and i one and some of these other soda kinds is because when people have a healthy got microfilm there are fewer cells in the body being infected from outside infections and therefore less of a reason for sells to be crying out help because they are thriving not suffering do not wipe your eyes keep your hands clean every one tells you that right keep your handling do not wipe your eyes be in no naselbreathe or not a mouth breather unless your speaking exercising r eating and keep a healthy got my crobiom by eating two four servings to day of quality low sugar tormented foods things sour trout things not if a if you can access that have try to before its interesting a for of an acquired taste a kitchen pickles again low sugar sources are going to be a the sources that are going to be a most affective for this now your armed with three ways to enhance the function of your mine system and combat infection that is i to think separate from the typical type of information that you get such as you not get good sleep y good nutrition good social connection et camera all that stuff still holds true but these three other points thin can really make a substantial difference in terms of bolstering the amuse system yourimian system i do one to mention because these names are going to come up a several times during this episode that while interlucans lie six and oil when in encourage inflammation they are these help me signals that call in sells to a gobble up invaders there are some interlucans that are anti inflammatory and the one that i to highlight in particular because it will come up again in a little bit is interlunar ten not all of the ill in certain number not all of the interlucans are inflammatory some are anti in inflammatory sun's important point to keep in mind as we go forward next stud to talk about what is called sickness behavior and indeed there is a category of behavior that we call sickness behavior that is very informative as to the things that we can do to avoid getting sick now this notion of sickness behavior goes back several decades or more and it is a very interesting way of looking at the function of the immune system because what it does is it bridges us from this thing that were calling mine system where it is tells and cells and site o kinds and lucasites and it starts taking us into the realm of the nervous system because of course the nervous system controls behavior sickness behavior is a sweet of responses that we tend to all undergo when we are feeling sick this is going to vary from person to person but there some general categories of things that we all do and happened all of us after we are wounded or sick or dealing within infection of any kind and by examining sickness behavior in some detail it can be really informative as to routes that we can take to health the main thing about sickness behavior is that it tends to involve a slowing of our usual levels of activity people start to feel lethargic or they feel the activities that previously they could do with relative ease are very difficult for them or somewhat overwhelming the other thing you start to see is that people and animals by the way stop grooming they stop taking care of themselves not necessarily stop showering although oftentimes that is the case but they will stop a doing their hair they will stop putting on make up a depending whether not they did that before they might stop animals will stop licking and grooming themselves people will stop taking care of their cosmetic appearance now it is not just because they do not care how they look when they are sick it is because there is this overall suppression of certain kinds of activities and an enhancement of other kinds of activities and this is really important sickness behavior is actually a motivated state it is a state that is design to accomplish certain things one of the other features of sickness behavior addition of being lethargic loss of grooming will be a loss of appetite and oftentimes people who have a great appetite normally just will not feel hungry at all and there several theories as to why this would be one prominent idea in the literature is that it is to discourage vomiting and diarrhoea which of course it can be infectious to other people that is a theory i i do not know that that is ever been tested directly but that is one idea the other ideas that its simply to harbor more resources forsake of repair and i want a talk about that because were we are all told to get extra sleep when we are not feeling well or to rest but just any good two or three year old constantly asks why why good scientists good a people who are interested in health information should always be asking why why should i get more see what happens in sleep that i should get more sleep when i am sick why should not i just push through this and there r couple reasons for this of the been established in the literature the first is that there does seem to be something useful about slowing circulation when we are ill one idea that has some dated to support it is that when we slow our circulation our blood circulation yon not running around much or running at all but rather am lying down getting extra rest may be sleeping maybe even just remaining still is that the lymphatic system which carries a lot of the immunerelated cells and fluids is able to ramp up its levels of activity it is interesting right it reducing circulation of the blood but increasing circulation of the lymphatic system you have all a probably been familiar with a the lymphatic system when your combating an infection your your limp notes can get sore you it limpets behind your ears in your growing your armpits around your throat around your on your your thyroid in your throat et camera that is the other reason now some people when they get sick get a psychologically go into a very vulnerable state where they really really want people other people to take care of them your probably witness this am or you feel this way yourself about fifty per cent of people have that response they really want to be taking care of now when you think about it from an adaptive perspective this makes sense right a member of our species is ill and they more or less will cry out for help a in one former another to the other members of their species to take care of them and of course this will be especially apparent in cases where people are young enough or incapacitated enough that they cannot actually get resources on their own you have ever been really sick just getting up and going to the fridge or to the rest room can be can feel a a a monumental task about fifty per cent of people report or describe seeking of help and support when they are sick but you could also imagine how this would be a very non adaptive response because it increases the opportunity is spread infection to the caretaker that is an interesting consideration another fifty per cent of people seem to have the opposite response when they are sick somehow regardless of how they were prior to getting ill the sickness behavior that is engaged by these normal circuits in the brain they are indeed neral circuits in the brain create a stay away from me i do not want to be bothered i want to be left alone i do not want to be taking care of right it is not stubbornness it is a it is literally a a lack of interest or a disinterest in social connection when one is sick and you see this in animals too some animals will seek out other members of their species others my unfortunately now pass a castaway bulldog castellan when he was sick i always knew because he would go round the back o the house and he would just hide there he want would just take himself away from everybody else he did not want to be takin care of and i it was just a natural response tom i do not think he was turn and prevent me from getting whatever it was that he had if ever somebody does not want to be taking care of er if they do wont to be taking care of realize that people tend to fall into these two bins naturally in animals tend to fall into these bins regardless of what species they are its about fifty fifty and again the sickness behavior is a motivated state its design to slow circulation of the blood increase circulation of the limp and the other killer cells in the body reduce the probability of infecting others by reducing its thought diarheunvomit but also breathing on others interacting with others and in some cases it will activate this u i do not want to call it a regress state but many people feel somewhat more a if there a if they are adults they feel more child when they are ill and they want to be takin care of very badly some of it might be learned some of it might be innate we do not know but the sickness behavior is very interesting for a couple of reasons first of all it mimics another state that has been described in the narrow science literature which is major depression and in both sick individuals sick from bacterial viral infection end in people with major depression it is been shown that there are robust increases in the levels of interlunar sicks and tumernecrosis factor alpha there is an idea now circulating that depression involves these inflammatory side of kinds being very active and we know that illness involves inflammatory side o since being very active f you think about it the similarity between major depression and being sick ought to be able to point us in a direction of interventions that could help us either prevent illness or move through illness more quickly but as we head in that direction because indeed that is the case i just one emphasize that sickness behavior is what provides this bridge between the immune system and the nervous system and what will soon s he also is that healthy behavior behavior that allows us to avoid infection also points to a clear bridge between the nervous system and the immune system that it is not just that we have a brain and body in our organs than we have anime system that is true but there interacting all the time and this is going to lead us to a place where it is going to be very clear and not at all surprising how certain patterns of thinking and certain behaviors that we can elect to take can help enhance our immune system function and vice verse there r two other feature of sickness behavior definitely worth pointing out one is a theory which is that the reduced appetite in particular appetite for proline rich foods when sick is thought to be an attempt a subconscious attempt of the organism to reduce the amount of iron that it is taking in now typically the amount of iron in take that is recommended or or more or less is for men it is about eight milligrams per day a for women it is anywhere from eighteen to twenty seven milligrams per day depending on whether not their pregnant lactating or menstruating et camera the ranges can very a but and indeed it is true that if iron levels in the blood go too high over forty five a you now milligrams per day can be very toxic to the system but the theory that is prominent in the biology literature an the health literature is that the reduction in appetite is action attempt to reduce iron in take specifically because many bacteria and other forms of infection seem to thrive when levels of iron in the blood are high i do not want to see any one take this to extreme and suddenly do an iron deprivation diet in order to a to get well but it is an interesting theory that it'd be remiss if i did not mention because it makes good sense iron is actually attached to hemoglobin and red blood sells in the bloodstream normally that can help us a quite a lot om it is also in muscle i should mention that iron could be a sequestered into muscle and iron serves the lot of important health promoting rolls but by reducing appetite and thereby reducing iron in take it does reduce the capacity of certain things including infections to travel in certain compartments within the body again that is just theory but i think many of you are probably familiar with not having an appetite when you're sick the other thing that is very typical of people with major depression is loss of appetite not always but often loss of appetites o here again we have loss of appetite and sickness behavior loss of appetite in major depression and perhaps not surprisingly one of the major symptoms of sickness behavior and major depression that map more or less on to one another is loss of of libido or interest not just in social interactions but in secs an reproduction and again if you think about sickness behavior in depression they are very very similar o case sickness behavior and major depression have certain door features in common we need to therefore ask ourselves why and how does being sick influence the way that we think and perceive our environment and impact our appetite whether not we want to be cared for more or cared for less again people tend to diverge into two different bins there and believe or not the pathway for this has been identified when we have an infection some place in our body and it could be up in our head con be a bigness infection could be an ear infection or i should a dimension many of these same mechanisms can also be the consequence of a wound or an injury to the body y back a y back injury or a slip disk or guess it is called a herniated disk is is the way that you hear described when we have that we can be kind of irritable we do not want to do certain things when we just want to be left alone things are harder how why well there is a known pathway which is the called vaguest nerve that connects the body in the brain signals to particular brain sides to engage this category of motivational state that we call sickness behavior many of you of probably heard of the vaguest v a g u s vagus the vaguest nerve is a very extensive nerve pathways the tenth cranial nerve comes out of the back of the the brainstorm had into the body and and branches out extensively to enervate or connect to many of our organs includingour lungs our heart are got et camera and all of those organs are able also to send neral signals back up to the brain we sometimes hear of the vaguest as the rout to calming ourselves down unfortunately that more less a myth that i do not know how wit got propagated you have lots of different pathways in the vagus usually nagual stimulation actually creates more arousal and alertness although it does have multiple pathways but there have now been many studies of the vaguest in various contacts including in sickness behavior and it is very clear that the vaguest nerve is the fast pathway by which an infection in the body is signal to the brain to a particular location the brain call the hypothalamus which harbors a lot of different types of neurons neurons for instance in the peptic area that increase body temperature and fever i that is one of the most important things is to increase body temperature in order to it is the body's attempt to kill off this invader because many viruses and many bacteria do not survive well at elevated heat that is the function of a fever of fever actually as a functional roll in a biology we complicate words we call anything that increases body temperature or creates a fever a pyrogen many years ago a in my undergraduate years i was working on brogans injecting some thing call lips jolly salaried into om the belly which then gives you a fever the way it does that is is alias causes an inflammation response in the gut the gut does not know what is happening the stomach sell do not know what is happening they just start secreting the isle six the a isle one although sit of kinds the killer sells migrate into the gut that is what you sometimes get a stomach each when you do not feel well you have a flue or something it a neral signal electrical signals get sent up to the hypothalamus the hypothalamus says up i do not know what is going on out there but there is a signal somethings going on was just eat up the body was to start cooking whatever it is out there of course you don't want fever to go too high because you can kill brain cells but within a particular range that the fever is a a functional and adaptive response case of your taking drugs to try in lower the fever that might make you feel more comfortable but actually that is limiting the response that your body is creating in order to try and kill off that invader and again you do not want fever to go too high this is going to very depending on age a you can look up on line with the what the range tolerable ranges are for fever but when your trying lower body temperature when you have a fever unless your heading into dangerous levels of of heating up that is socially the wrong way to take your system if you do indeed want to kill off that invader o case of the vaguest nerve is the quick response it also sends i put to areas of the brain that change your perception of the outside world one of the most a obvious of these obvious once i tell it to you is photophobia right i love bright sunshine i love bright lights when i want to be alert we all have different levels of of light sensitivity but most people when they are sick when there is an inflammation response in the body they feel bright lights are kind of aversive they get well described con a classical photophobia and that is mediated by a pathway that goes from your eye too an area of your thalamus call the anterior nucleus of of the phallus this is work that was done by coiffured paper at hazard medical school a it is really beautiful work and then from there up to the outer lining of the brain which is the mining's just of on the outside of the brain where the brain starts to interface with some of the other a connective tissues will talk more about these later it cannectually create a photophobia and a headache when one is ill here is the pathway some in some invader gets into your system cause you wiped your eyes or got in through your mouth you don't listen t h your mother got inthroughyour eyes you are feeling sick something is going on there you have a stomach ache because of all the it inflammation there the signal goes up from your vaguest were your heating up with a fever you have got photophobia because you have activated this pathway by which what would normally be tolerable light is triggering the thalamic nuclear they inter thalamus the that is projecting up to the mining's you have got a headache in response to looking at light it is basely triggering an over all pathway to get you to go into a quiet dark place and rest and the last element i list talk about is the rest there is something that gets triggered from the body to the brain to the hypothalamus and we think we know which hypothalamic area is it is the superoptic nucleus we think superoptic cause it is right above your called optimism if you want to look up where that is it is right above the roo for your mouth and there nuclei there that promote the desire to sleep even during the a time what would normally be the active phase of your circadian cycle now at is really interesting because what is happening here is you have got multiple pathways that are saying avoid light reduce your amount of behavior heat up all the things that are making sick the the sickness behavior in it is going from your your body to your mind to to make you do the right thing now there is also a slow pathway that is purely mediated by the blood called humoral factors not cause their funny but humoral factors are factors of the blood as you have an effect an infection for many hours or days the amount of isle six and lie can and tumernecrosis factor and other inflammatory side o kinds is starting to increase such that the total amount in your circulation gets high enough and is communicated to the brain and it tends to enter the brain through a particular type of tissue that is really interesting call horrid c h o or o idea choroid is really interesting it is kind of this of fluffy tissue that sits in your entitles the vehicles are the spaces in your brain and the spaces in your brain have what miscalled cerebral spinal fluid in them tcebrospon fluid contains a number of important things but the choroid starts releasing and responding to these side of kinds a the inflammatory side of kinds and then the brain actually starts to experience all sorts of changes in terms of inflammation to neurons your memory tends to get poor your cognition tends to get poor these are transient things most often these eventually these things will pass but this is deep into sickness when your really feeling loud you cannot read you cannot watch a move you cannot do anything if you ever get sick and you just cannot be bothered by anything it is probably because you have had that fast response from the body and you have also had this slower response where you literally have a set of tissues in your brain that are sending out these these inflammatory signals and now your whole brain is starting to cope were trying to cope with this infection you got a slow pathway in a fatpathway that all sounds really terrible now it'd to talk about what you can do to reduce the probability of getting sick and there are actually things that one can do as you start to get sick and once your sick to accelerate the healing process by flipping the equation up until now we have been talking about how the body activate certain areas in the brain to create sickness behavior that is very much depression probably all familiar with this from any time had a cold or or flue or something really lousy or an injury now let us flip the equation and ask what can we do with our nervous system in order to enhance the function of our immune system in order to be able to heal and recover from illness and injury more quickly let say you are in that unfortunate circumstance of waking up one day or coming home and you have got that tickle in your throat or when you breathe your your nasal passages do not feel the same way you have got bit of a head ache your feeling kind of off we all know what we should do we should all hydrate drink some water and go to sleep right that what we are all we are all told but there are actually things that you can actively do in order to get your immune system to deploy and more robust response at that early fays of potential infection let us focus first on the rest component yes of course we are all told that we should take a hot shower and go to sleep yon get nine or ten hours of sleep but there is an interesting way of looking at sleep specifically for it is roll in enhancing the immune system and there is a wonderful review i ill a put the review in the actions that look specifically at the literature surrounding sleep that is different because it occurs support of the immune system normally when we go to sleep we have slow wave sleep predominantly in the early phase of the night and then over time as we sleep longer longer we get more called ram rapid high movement sleep talked all about this on the episodes on sleep course you have slow wave sleep in red sleep throughout the night always but it is the fraction of slow wave sleep to red sleep the shifts and they perdifferent functions et camera there is some evidence that the sleep associated with an infection in particular early stage of infection is associated with elevated levels of sratonan in the brain that either through an adaptive mechanism or for whatever reason the brain the neurons in the brain of the called safe fully a start releasing more serotonin and that that serotonin in its related pathways can help enhance some of the immune system function they could combat the infection there is starting to be some data and i emphasize starting because it is not a very robust literature yet looking at whether not supplementing precursors to sceratonan five each keep keep on which can be taken in o supplement form or consuming foods that increase seratonean naturally these would be any foods that contain high levels of trip to pan you can look up with those a white turkey for instance a certain complex carbohydrates can often be rich with trip to fan that consuming those foods can enhance the amount of ceretonan that is available in the brain and blood and thereby lead to the particular quality of sleep that allows for more deep healing or for when i say deep healing i mean for a more robust and mine response now again those are are still emerging data what is very clear however is that during sleep and in particular during sleep that is associated with the early stage of any kind of viral or bacterial infection the called lymphatic system is much more active than it would be normally what is the lymphatic system the lymphatic system is shall a relatively recent a discovery i mention limp and the lymphatic system earlier the lymphatic system with a g is a system in the brain by which debris that accumulates throughout the day but in particular debris that accumulates under conditions of narrow inflammation and inflammation of the body is cleared out or is washed out of the brain and the activity of the lymphatic system is extremely important for the recovery from infection of any kind and it is now becoming clear is important for recovery from dramatic head injury and may been from psychological drama the lymphatic system is can be thought of topless as the plumbing system that runs through the ventricle but also mainly a through the lining that sits between the brain and and the skull in some of the other a tissues and o things of that sort the horrid is involved as well brain imaging reveals the glemphati system is very active during deep sleep in this this kind of wash out of the lymphatic system a night aware of some studies the wrong going now where augmenting the serotonin system through either supplementation of tryptophan or five h t p or even ceremony in itself these are laboratory studies is being looked out for its caphaci to increase the amount of circulation in the glemphati system and the ideas that it might and a one underscore might potentially lead to more rapid recovery from injury and illness and potentially ramp up if you will the activity of the immune system it essential is at camping up of the activity the immune system now regardless of weather or not you decide to for instance supplement with five h t p before sleep or not it'll talk about what that might look in a moment there is away that you can increase the activity of your lymphatic system under normal circumstances because of the mechanics of the lymphatic system it turns out that if you elevate your heels by about twelve degrees does n have to be exactly twelve as you sleep by putting may be a rolled pillow or two pillows underneath your feet by having the head below your legs it seems that there is more lymphatic wash out or clearance during sleep and this is without taking any compound to adjust the ceretonan system i would say if you are not feeling well yes take the hot shower yes a get into bed and go to sleep but elevate your feet to try and increase the activity of the lymphatic system some might even consider that if you have to be awake that you might want to be awake with your feet elevated above your head now that might not be practical for the work place a but it might be practical for a short nap during the day or or something of that sort the lymphatic system is not is t active during sleep it is also active during certain phases of waking in particular when we are in a deep state of relaxation as many of you probably know i ma big proponent of self hypnosis because of the quality scientific literature on this if your interest in self hypnosis you can go to revert r e v era dot calm revert is a cost free a a for plan centroid that was developed by my cologne avid special and others that the stamped universe school medicine based on quality studies and preview data showing that deep states of relaxation can in be used to improve pain management improve transition time de sleep and a number of other other things you can select that the serious thing a for outcomes that that you are seeking o using reverie it say it is a great thing that especially for people that are challenge with a meditation could use because you just listen to the script involves deep relaxation i would suggest using that script but with or the script for sleep but with we elevated to increase activity of the lymphatic system now if you do decide that you want to am test out this a serotonin hypothesis on your own obviously check with the doctor ism not a doctor om professor son professing things not suggesting things but five ah t p is a supplement that have talked about before on this podcast that i actually do not recommend for most people for sake of sleep because it can disrupt the normal architecture of sleep and create a deep sleep early in the night and then a spontaneous waking with some trouble to get back to sleep and that is because the way that the serotonin system and the milestone an system interact however under conditions where one is feeling they might have an infection or in early stage of illness in that case five ah t p might be a useful supplement in order to acts us the states of sleep that are not typical they are not the typical deep sleep that you would achieve on when your feeling healthy these are states of sleep that are specifically there in order to try and repair some of the immune system related inflammation that is occurring if you to explore the five ah t p approach and you feel it is right and safe for you and you have talked your doctor it is three hundred to five hundred telegrams taken about thirty to sixty minutes before going to sleep for the night that is the typical protocol not incidentally increasing serotonin is also one typical approach for the treatment of major depression this is the basis for things essessarise selective ceremony and retaken hitters polar a excuse me prosaic and am zoo stand forth the five ah hep approach is a a much milder approach than prescription drug of course am but will allow more ceretonan to be synthesize and or released now for those of you that are interested in learning more about the lymphatic system it is a fascinating system and you might want to do a deep dive there in terms of the behavior of protocols and what is known about it there's a wonderful a article called the lymphatic system a beginner's guide as is a sign toxic article a the first author is lessen is the last named g g e s s e n if you put in lessen the lymphatic system of beginners god you can access the full length manuscript easily on line it ill show up on immediately in your search end in a really interesting way the lymphatic system has now also been tided to the iron deposition system early o talking about iron and how of course getting enough dietary iron is important but if levels of iron are too high it is not good for a number of reasons there is a very interesting article that just came out last year called dysfunction of the lymphatic system might be related to iron deposition in the normal aging brain we are starting to see these links between iron levels being too high the lymphatic system not being active enough and forth leading to sickness behavior inflammation and may be even damage to neuron's associate with aging we can flip that on its head and say that increasing the activity of the glemphati system feet elevated during deep sleep may be the elevated a above that the head on while awake during a nap or doing a revere script o once a day or something of that sort could increase the activity the lymphatic system lowering iron pinto a point that probably below a the typical in take during periods of of infection perhaps perhaps i should say can enhance the lymphatic system and vice verse and then you have got this specialize sleep that is related to sickness behavior that seems to have heightened levels of serotonin that might be augmented by increasing a it excuse me that might be augmented by ingesting five h t p again not on a regular basis i do not suggest that people take a compounds at increase creatine and unless it is prescribe you for depression or something a but not doing it on a by supplement with trip than or five h t p on a regular basis but only under conditions where as i mention you might be starting to feel sick or your coming down with something your combating some sort of infection if we consider the advice that we typically get when we are not feeling well of take a hot shower get getting bed and go to sleep and we have now touched on ways to potentially increase the efficacy of the sleep part through the lymphatic and the serotonin system what about to take a hot shower part is that good advice hell turns out it is and there is actually a way to do even better there is a study very interesting study the title reveals where ism going with this its effect of a single finish sand session on white bloodsell profile and martial levels this case it was done in athletes and non athletes which is can in ice this involves taking a athletes an non athletes and exposing them to sand it was not particularly hot it was ninety six degrees which is not cool but it is not really hot nowadays you here about people doing very very hosanna the humidity the sand if you want to know as fifteen plusermise three per cent but basically what they found was that just one fifteen minute son session could really increase white bloodsell profiles and could a just court is all levels in ways that were beneficial for combating infection and now there are many other studies this now this should immediately make sense based on what we said before about fever heating up can actually help combat infection but for those of you that have listen to the episodes on temperature when you probably know that when you get into a sand or any kind of it environment your body is also going to be actively pushing to cool itself off there is probably an increase in heat there is an increase in heating that then afterwards your body will cool off maybeven with a dip below baseline i do want to provide a cautionary note that if you are already running a fever getting into a sand could take your body temperature into dangerously high levels dangerously meaning you can kill neurons and once you kill irons they do not come back please do not kill your neurons a i do not recommend getting into a sand if you already running a fever this would be something to do at the initial stage of an infection or if your feeling a little bit off this is kind of a a camping up or a superprotocol of the typical advice of take a hot shower and get into bed that is good advise now were talking about a hot sand probably showering off and then getting into bed may be augmenting sacaton i know many people do not have access to sand in that case a very hot bath or shower do not scald yourself of course but as hot as you can comfortably tolerate or you do not write at that edge of what you can tolerate would be a good idea some people have heard are creating sands in their bathrooms by running hot water an creating a ton of seem anything that really a heats you up but not to dangerously high levels is going to be beneficial am if you have access to arson terrific this again was only fifteen minutes they would had a cool off session would you get more of an increase people always went know if you did it twice as much would you get twice increase that those data do not really exist yet however if you are interested in maximizing the effects of sand it is clear that a cool off period is important it is not that at fifteen minute sand as good an a thirty minute sand is better if you are going to take that route of of exploring more it does seem that doing a fifteen minute heating period followed by a five to ten minute cooling period and then getting back into the heat can be a beneficial and this is interesting it gets to the mechanisms by which the hop of famous that a areas the airs of the hypothalamus that is that generate increases in body heat if the activation of those neurons occurs as you heat up and then were you to just stay in that heated environment they would actually shut off and some other neurons would be handling the job to speak but by getting in and out of the heated environment you actually force that system to send repeated pulses of these a court is all lowering and white sell stimulating a signals to the body some of you have probably heard the phrase few d a fever starve a cold i do not know who first said that i could not find the citation but we hear this and we can speculate that the reason that phrase feed a fever starve a cold came to be is because of the adaptive function of fever that increases in body temperature make it challenging for intruding virilism bacteria to survive even though of course highly elevated body temperatures pose a danger to the host organism to you reading eating does cause an increase in body temperature through the called thermogenic effect of food i can understand the logic of feed a fever it would mean that when you have a fever it is your bodies natural attempt to heat up and kill some invading a thing and by eating you would further increase your body temperature why you would want to starve a cold i do not know however a maybe it is because when your nasal passages are congested its uncomfortable to to eat or something of that sort the feed a fever part make sense to me that the starve a cold part is still mysterious to me i could not find any logical reason why that would be good there are communities out there that believe that fasting is a a viable way to combat a certain types of infection fasting in particular prolong fast do increase the amount of a adrenalin also called epinepferan in the brain and body and as we will next explain epinephrin a adrenalin does have a powerful effect on the various inflammatory side kinds and on the immune system in general let us talk about a behavioral protocol that any one can use it does not involve any equipment you do not need a sand i you do not need anything at all that has been demonstrated in excellent pure reviewed research to enhance the function of the immune system and actually allow people to combat infection in very dramatic ways next i to do an inept analysis of a study that has achieve some prominence out there not just in the scientific literature but on the internet because it relates to how particular types of breathing can impact the immune system and the ability to combat infection the title of this paper is voluntary activation of the sympathetic nervous system and attenuation of the innate immune response in humans this is he paper that was published in p n a s which is the proceedings of the national academy of sciences you essay it is a very prestigious journal for those of you that no pianos that there are certain papers publish in pianos ere there used to be that were not pure reviewed in recent years i think all of them have moved to pure reviewed papers o this is a pure reviewed very high quality study and i just wanted to scribe the basic contour of the study it'll explain the findings and then i want to go depth and explain the mechanistic basis for these findings and the protocol that we can all export from these findings here we go first of all a couple of terms that everybody is on the same page the sympathetic nervous system is one division of our nervous system its a set of neurons adown the middle of our spinal cord and in our brain that generally lead to a heightened state of arousal and alertness is associate with epinephrin release in the brain and a adrenaline release in the body it is the called fighter flight system when it is really active but it is the system that is active when we are wide awake and we already talked about the innate immune system that is that first line of defense after the skin barrier of course whereby some infection comes into the body and there is this rapid response of increasing in inflammation and that is also about the time that you first feel lousy whenyou i feel i think have got something i do not feel right a head ache i feel nachos i meeting of i i do not feel good that is that is the the innate mine system kicking in s what they did in the study and by the way i should say they a this is first author is cox can acts last author last name pickers p i s ka e a s what they did was they exposed human subjects to an endotoxin by inti in another words they injected people with cold is a bacteria which makes people all people feel terrible senautious fever vomiting diarrhea is very unpleasant ski these people voluntarily signed up for the study however some of the subjects in this study performed a behavioral protocol that can best be described as picnic hyper ventilation my lab works on these types of breathing protocols this is not work that my lap did but basely subjects i pereventilate followed by breath pretension by breath holds and it'll explain exactly what they did they also looked at other forms of behavioral protocols but let us focus on that one there comparing controls that do just sort of a basic meditation versus people that do the intense breathing followed by some breath holds ism just paraphrasing here in the intervention group the breathing group plasma levels of anti in inflammatory side of kind ill ten this is a side o kind that is lowers inflammation increased after endotoxin administration and that was triggered by an increase in epinephrin and a adrenalin in other words doing a particular pattern or breathing allowed an anti inflammatory side of kind to be turned on whereas that was not the case in the subjects that did not do this particular breathing can protocol and they discovered that levels of groin inflammatory t enough ala tumernecrosus factor alpha desex interlucansics an interlucanate which you should all be familiar with now as groin inflammatory side of kinds were lower in the intervention group whereas these isle ten levels that are antinflammatory went up finally fluke symptoms were lower in the intervention group this is an amazing finding is are human subjects one is one group of subjects is doing this breathing protocol the other group of subjects is just meditating they both both sets of subjects have been in injected with e cold every one's getting the same amount placed into their system this is very very interesting and it leads to the question that every good scientist to year old or health information seeker asks which is why how how in the world does this work why does this work well to make a long story short is because i am going to going depth here the reason it works is because the sympathetic nervous system the called stress part of our nervous system it is not really called that but the part of our nervous system that trigger stress from mild stress to severe stress event panic causes the release of a adrenalin an epinephrin in the brain and body and under normal circumstances when we have some sort of invading infection our body is able to push back on that to resist it by engaging the stress response what is happening here is there is a there is a behavioral protocol involving the nervous system was all behaviors are generated from the nervous system of course a behavioral protocol that people are deliberately employing that allows them to activate the sympathetic nervous system which intern allows them to activate the normal pathways by which immune system function is enhanced oke now the reason ism under scoring this is that the common interpretation of this study is that somehow it blocks the normal immune response but that is not really what is happening here yes there is a reduction in inflammatory side of kinds and there is an increase in antiinflammatory side a kinds but that is not really the same thing as blocking the immune response this could just as easily be viewed as enhancing the immune response and combating the intruder in this case cold let us harsh this study a orbit more closely first of all what is this magical pattern of breathing some of you may recognize this as called whimhoff breathing whim of course the bushmen i think his occupation on line used to be listed as dare devil believe are not in wicupeta that is a pretty cool a occupation a vim is best known for his activities with cold exposure holds multiple world records for that am swimming under icebergs another an incredible feats a that you defiling do not want to try a unless you're extremely skilled and really knowhow your doing as as he does but also for the use of breastwork the breathing that is called whim off breathing is very similar not exactly the same but very similar to tumor breathing as it is been described historically in the science and physiology community and in my laboratory cops i run universe laboratory refer to it a cyclic hype r ventilation which just means repeated deep breaths in and out and then there these retention ism a because ism here a in the hot sea anyway i might as well a demonstrate it for house to you know at this looks there are variations on this with respect to whim with respect to tumor practitioners with respect to the syclhype ventilators everywhere this is one general theme of it it involves twenty to thirty deep inhale and and then exhales through the mouth followed by a exhale of all one's air and a breath hold that is the retention and then at some point fifteen to sixty seconds later repeating the twenty five or thirty breaths and then again a a breath hold with lungs empty there are variations on this but in our laboratory and o in this particular study if it looks something this k i am not going to do the whole thing right now but it it go something this case let us us some i do that for thirty thirty breath i can already feel myself a perspiring a little bit your heating up that is the release of a adrenalin caused by that breathing patter and then exhaling all of once there no speaking between ism doing and then sitting lungs empty until one feels the impulse to breathe and then repeating for several rounds two or three or even four rounds now some people will also introduce a big inhale in breath hold at the end and find that indeed they can hold their breath much longer than they normally would be able to because the trigger to breathe is normally activated by increases in carbondoxide in our blood we have neurons in our brain stem and in our various regions of our brain actually that respond to when carbondaoxide is to high and trigger the reflects to breathe but when we exhale deeply we blow off a lot of carbonoxide we do not feel that impulse to breathe come quite as soon basically this study looked at people doing these hi prevent syclihyperventilation with retention twenty five or thirty breaths than the retention twenty five or thirty great then retention twenty five thirty breath then the pretensions of three rounds of twenty five to thirty breath followed by exhale hold in between of various duration but in general fifteen to sixty seconds is typical what happened physiologically this what one of thereasons i this study what happened physiologically well couple of things course blood oxygenation drops you would ex best that based on hyperventilation and especially based on the extoll of much carbonalxide we could explain why that is but blood blood we blood levels of oxygen drop the p h the alkalinity of the body goes way up this is very interesting if you look up this paper toucan look a figure one panel sea the p h goes way up people become alkaline you have heard for of alkaline water an i paint to say this i pilose some friends for this but yet do not do not waste your money on drinking alkali alkaline water you cannot rely shift the alkalinity of your body om there are cases where some compartment in your body needs to be more alkaline than the rest your got is the different alkalinity than other air's of your body et camera but in jesting high alkaline water is not gain a shift your over all alkalinity if you some one can send me a quality reference that shows different that ism happy to revise that statement but in any case doing that pattern of breathing that just described greatly increases a p h greatly i i should say does not send it off in to dangerous levels hit takes it from seven point four to seven point six which is a significant increase a in alkalinity as p h levels for those you remember highschool or a college chemistry as as the numbers on the p h go down you are becoming more acidic as they go up your becoming more alkaline ora or more basic you from seven these subjects when from seven point four to seven point six during the breathing and then afterwards it return to normal but that shift in alkalinity is thought to be important here what is going on here how is the breathing leading to the shifts in where i should say reduction in inflammatory sidelines and an increase in the liberation of these antineflanmatory side of kinds well the authors make some good arguments as to why it is not the shift in p h per say or the shift in carbon alive levels in the blood but rather it is the release of epineferon there is some good reason to believe why that is the case is beyond the scope of this discussion but that it is actually the release of epinefron a k adrenaline that is causing this reduction and inflammation and that is actually supported by something that you have probably experienced before which is if you have ever worked work worked or worked really hard or you have been a a caretaker for somebody else or studying for exams and people around you are getting sick and you are just powering through it and you are not getting sick but then you stop you turn in your final exam you stop taking care of somebody else or you finally stop and rest or you go on vacation and then you get sic well you have just experienced the effect that adrenaline epineferon can have in activating your immune system by way of the nervous system in order to keep fighting and combating infection and that brings us to a larger theme which is that stress and combating infection or a wound is not one unique system it is the same stress system that focused to combat psychological stress when your very very stressed at least in the short term because you release much a deadline in epinephrin your actually better able to combat infections and you reduce inflammation and the whole feeling lost response or right remember reduced flue symptoms here this pattern of breathing is actually a very useful too and i confess i use this pattern of breathing any time i am at the initial stages of of getting some sort of bug if i feel have been running myself ragged or if i somehow for whatever reason have a tickle my throat or i have that con sensation o my nose i i might have a it may might have caught a bug of some sort i will do this pattern of breathing i been doing it consistently i show the last four years or or more a yank this is just anecdotal a reports but i find that it allows me indeed to either have those early symptoms disappear or it allows me to just count of push through and and harder longer i do not suggest people continue to push through exposure to infections obviousydo on a infant other people a nor do you want to crash and suddenly get get a massive on illness of some sort because you stop doing this breathing but i do think it is a useful tool to purely behavioral intervention that has been shown here and now there are additional studies on the way to enhance the function of your mine system and to reduce inflammation and this is to me one of the most concrete examples of a zero cost to that bridge is the activation of the nervous system through breathing with the immune system by way of releasing a adrenaline and thereby reducing the terrible effects or feelings of lousiness from a in this case any cold infection now i to focus on a couple of important points that i have not heard disgust broadly elsewhere which is that the hyper ventilation and the breath retention are both important you cannot simply hyper ventilate to get this this effect at the level of epinephrin release and reduction an inflammatory pcytahines it is been shown before that the hyperventilation face and the my podia which is a can low low oxygen saturation due to the breath retention they both combine to increase epinefern a adrenalin levels you have to do the twenty five or thirty breasts and then the retention twenty five or thirty breasts than the retention meaning that the exile with the breathhold in order to get the full effect i also wan to provide critical cautionary note do not do this anywhere near water or while driving a car these sings a might seem kind of obvious but a obviously in the off chance that you black out or something that it could be disastrous please be careful a and again do not try push the breath hold the moment you feel the impulse torch just breathe and it did seem that the three rounds of twenty five to thirty great with interventions excuse me with a breathed pretensions in between was the ideal protocol there is one last very interesting feature of this study that i want a emphasize and that was that they actually measured the called catacolamine concentrations catacolamines are things dopamine epinefran noripinefran these are chemicals in your nervous system and body that promote states of alertness a dopamine of course part of the reward and motivation pathways they explored the levels of these molecules in blood in plasma during and after this breathing protocol and as interesting as i mention before up aneurin showed robust increases compared to the control group norepanefran significant increases occurred in the in the breathing group but a in the syclicaprovenilation retention a breathing group of course a but less a and dopamine levels actually a drop somewhat but this is very interesting because there is a new and emerging literature largely from is a i essay rolls lab a in israel what her laboratory has shown is that motivational state and mind set has a powerful impact on various aspects of the union system that were thought to be independent of the brain and mind and thinking this brings us back to something that we discussed at the very beginning of this episode which is that twenty thirty years ago the idea that you could heal the body with the mind with considered on of quackery a i think that there is an intervening period up until now where people at might have said sure if your stressed out its can to make things worse in may i think everyone agrees that stress makes every thing worse at some level a outcomes to her degeneration performance in a physical endeavors in mental endeavors if stresses too high for too long people experience different challenges and essentially every major psychiatric disorder everything suffers but in the short term stress can actually be beneficial in the ways that we just described and stress if you we break it down is really a petrochemical state red its the release of these catacolamines and what is rolled laboratory has shown is that when the called dopamine system and that several episodes i describe their multiple dopamine systems but the o called mesa limbic reward pathway involving trios the nucleus a combats et camera when the reward system that is associate with dopamine an born normal infra is activated you see incredible effects including for instance highly significant reduction in tumor size in cancers now why would that be why how is it that mine set dopamine and tumors are and tumor growth aresomehow link we now know how this occurs largely through the incredible work of scrolls and others now i to turn our focus to how it is specifically that certain mine sets in pact the immune system in ways the we can actually point to specific biological pathways and also specific protocols related to mine set i guess a simple way to frame all this would be to say that most of us are aware that yes indeed you can worry yourself sick we have been told that you cannot worry yourself sick and actually there was a paper published in science again one of the top three journals out there the top three really being nature science and sell and then other of course excellent journals exists but this was a paper that came out in science a last year first author is carioca k a t a o k a describing psychogenicstress and fever this was looking or asking the question are there areas of the brain that actually underlie this notion that we can worry ourself sick and they discovered a new pathway and they were able to both activate this pathway independent of worry in stress and see illness occur and they were able to inhibit this pathway block activity in the neral pathway and prevent psychogenic fever and the worrying of one self sick they they were able to do this om in a very controlled way it'll just mention the pathway in was a you want to look it up in more detail this is a portico limbic pathway for a just a orient's the cortex is it more less the outer shell of of the brain its involved in thinking and sensation and perceptions and learning and main maintenance of a lot of memories are stored there we all hear that you learn i u you learn and remember in the hippocampus that is the initial side of learning and and memory but then that information believe or not passed off to the quarters were it stored in kind of a long long term hard drive type storage the portico limbic pathway is one in which your thoughts your prior experiences can literally enough in a structure way feed down on to the areas of the brain that control very banal processes including temperature regulation this is a portico limbic hypothalamic pathway we talked early about the hypothamusis controlling temperature in a lot of sickness related behavior right remember values up to the hypothalamus and all the sleep more or less appetite fever oke that is all in the hypothalamus this is a top down portico limbic hypethral thalamic pathway and it has a fancy name it is the torso peduncular cortex dorsal tenet testa the short of that is the d p d t ts let just call the d p t t t to the dorsimedio hypothalamus late is hit should not mean anything does not really matter what we call it but what is important is conceptually it is a pathway that originates and sights of the brain that are associate with thinking with emotion and with prior history and feeds directly into an area of the brain that is involved in basic physiological subconsciously controlled processes that is incredible right and it points to a physical pathway by which the way we think about something changes something core about our physiology now in some ways that should be surprising right if you think about something that excites you your tartrate can increase you think about something that terrifies your tartrate can increase tat eat that thinking controls our physiology is not in who concept at all a but somehow human beings we have been a challenge with the idea that we could actually think ourselves into being sick but this paper from catch shows that if you expose somebody to a psychological stress you can actually activate this pathway in create a fever and how did they do that well you can do this by exposing subjects to a very stressful real event and you cut through associate learning may be in all my pilot v fives which i love much we could dramatize me to the pilot v five if i had some horrible experience happen me while ism looking at and concentrate in the pilot v five then you take away the horrible experience you give me the pilot of you five and i are to experience a lot of the symptoms associated with that terrible event they were able to do this using sickness in during stimuli and forth they did all the various a derivations and identify this pathway that when activated even in the absence of some horrible event could create fever and illness behavior and forth and if they blocked certain stations along this neral pathway they could block that effect this is really concrete evidence proof if you will that there are dedicated pathways in the mammalian brain your brain in mind that allow us to turn thoughts into illness that is kind of a depressing idea what about the inverse what about turning thoughts into health well that is the work of scrolls they explored the well establish psychological phenomenon that when cancerpationce or very ill people or people were suffering from very debilitating injuries when they had or when people had or reported a sense of hope their rates of recovery were much higher right sounds very subjective but what is a sense of hope a sense of hope is a sense of the future a sense of the future is tightly associate with the dopamine system doppomen again being this molecule o reward and motivation and movement but movement and motivation are about things that are beyond the confines of our skin and are about the future and what they discovered and through other studies from other groups have discovered is that stimulation of the dopamine pathway either simply by thinking about papa future ideally a positive future but thinking about a positive future leads to activation of this call measolymbic reward pathway and could reduce the size of tumors could accelerate wound healing could greatly accelerate the passage from a state of illness to a state of health and well being there are many many studies now starting to win out related to this there is also the idea that augmenting the dopamine system can increase the rate of healing and there are individuals out there who opt for instance to take things that increase dopamine now obviously drugs of abuse a would not be a good idea in this context even though thy increase dooming they lead the big crashes they have eductive properties at et camera have talked before in this podcast about things eltyrasine take it anywhere from five hundred to yo sevenhundred fifty milligrams can increase dopamine because pyridine as a dooming precursor of course things mecunipurines which are a dopa the immediate precursor to dopamine some of these will leads to somewhat of a crash om in certain individuals other people tolerate them a little b better again soave to talk your doctor use to figure out what is rite for you if you have bipolar or manor schisiphrania a these things are i would not recommend them at all i'mnot recommending them all ism just mention them for potential exploration if it safe and right for you but the point is this the dopamine system when activated can accelerate healing it can accelerate the recovery from injury of all kinds and that should not come as a mystery or surprise result to us it is because this reward pathway and the fact that it is related to a sense of the future seems to liberate entire systems within the body that make inflammatory she of kinds go down and antiar lavatory sitakinds go up exactly as was demonstrated in the beautiful piano study where breathing sickly hyperventilation was used to increase apanefer and increase norupanefferan and to augment the catacatacolomine system i think tot that the bridges between these studies are really relevant in one case ism talking about potentially taking a and over the counter compound to increase dopamine to accelerate healing in another case fore talking about using breathing there's also the use of cold water exposure to increase dopamine i talked about this several episodes ago but it is been shown that cold wat immersing oneself in cold water up to the neck or how cold will it depends on what you can tolerate but uncomfortably cold but not cold that you become hypothermic but were you it is challenging to get in but you can stay there for you three to ten minutes or has been shown to lead to very significant up doubling or more of base line dopamine levels an epinefran levels that go on for several hours this may be the basis for why people will do cold showers or ice was and then get into arson what is call contrast cold con cold heat contrast therapy as he way to augment these nerve transmitters to day were been talking about how these nor transmitters can be used to enhance the function of the immune system and just keep in mind that any time you talking about increasing nor transmitter levels that can be done pharmicologically through supplementation or it can be done behavior through exposure to cold water for instance or it can be done even just simply by breathing in a particular way cyclic preventilation followed by retention the catacomb mines nor a adrenalin opening and noropinefran or the bridge of activation for the immune system and the nervous system they are the way that the nervous system calls out to the immune system aah we have a problem we need a counter this you can think of them them meaning dopamine epinefran and noropinefran as being able to deploy larger amounts of immune cells all the types of a funerals that we talked about at the beginning of the episode can thus far we have been discussing how one can prevent getting sick or when when starts to feel ill how one might be able to shorten the course of that infection by camping up the activity of the immune system but what about when you are already experiencing symptoms the runny not stuffed up nose congestion headache et camera well there are many ways to address that at the symptom level you probably aware of all the over the counter medications many of which focus on the epinefran system in a things that are of the sectored variety prevent will reduce congestion because of the way that they cause release of epinefran and some of the effects on dilating the bronchioles and dilating the naval passages and forth ism not can a speak to whether r not those are good or bad choices they do have a couple of effects that are not great for the course of on treating the underlying cause which are first of all they can cause dehydration you have to make sure that your hydrating well both fluids an electrolytes and they also can interfere with sleep because as i eve talked about on the episode son sleep one of the shall marks of deep sleep and in particular remsleep is that epinefran adrenaline levels are low this is what allows you to have intense often very emotionally at in dreams during remsleep and not act those out a and lo adrenaline epinefran during remsleep as a the basically a signature a geochemical signature of the remsleep state which is vital forth emotional and physical repair and forth the fact that they can inhibit sleep the fact that they can cause dehydration the fact that they can make p pole feel con a lightheaded in misery makes them not terrific choices for a number of people there is an interesting alternative choice and when i say alternative i do mean alternative a the choice i referring to is spiraling which is ashes form of alga a years ago i think when i first heard about spiraling it sounded very much of the kind of a nineteen seventies eighties healthfood a store variety seem really kind of a mystical and enuacky but achy now there some recalling studies and some data and also an understanding of the mechanism by which spiraling can have potent effects in reducing what is called rhinitis which is a fancy word for a congestion of the nose and an inflammation of the nose basically any time you here the a word that includes iris a at least of its in the medical or health context the generally means inflammation of some tissue a hint is just being inflammation of the nasal passages but that is one of the most uncomfortable symptoms of any kind of infection there two studies it'd to high light a just very quickly one is a the effects of spirilinon allergic minibus and the others a clinical comparison of the efficacy of spirilla a spiraling a platplatensis that a technical name and sitter and seterizine for the treatment of allergic minibus a these looked at humans this is not a mouse study this a study on humans a both sexes or miles an females a in one case looking at a hundred plus subjects under twenty on subjects the other or sixty five subjects decent number of subjects randomize child double blind a both cases saw significant decreases in nasal obstruction improvedability to smell a improve sleep a daily working side of kind a hinplamatory did of kinds were reduced as well a reproduction nasal itching all the such you to experience i can imagine after taking two grahams two grahams not milligrams but two grahams of spiraling sometimes had to be taken for for a short while before a the effect kicked in that is pretty impressive a i would say but it does normally speak to mechanism but in exploring the underlying mechanisms for a spirilina's effects on reducing a rhinitis is interesting to find that spiraling ashcan inhibit the formation end or activity of called histeminurgic mast cells amaasti mast cells we have not talked a lot about a masses but they are an very interesting teletype in the immuneresponse a essentially what they are little packets of histamine and when we have a some sort of a injury or a irritant rather to the skin a mosquito be for instance or poison oik poison ivy a a something that causes an itch or something that causes inflammation internally does not just have to be on the skin these marcels are these little bubbles that contain a his to mean that go to that site and release their histomanurgect contents and cause swelling in an inflammation of of whatever sells are affected locally at cause you might thinkwhy would i not have a mechanism in my body that would cause swelling an inflammation a will then those cells in turn send out side a kind signals that recruit the very sellotapes that we are talking about way bake the at the beginning of the episode the sells that are characteristic of the innate immune system the come in the macrophages an the other a types of cells that will come in and gobble up the the foreign invaders or a will help sequester and move away say the poison from a bit or from whatever irritant a again it it does not just have to be at the skin surface ism describing an example of of at the skin for instance if you have ever had hives of any kind a that almost certainly involved mas cells sand when you take an anti histamine antihistamine in order to a deal with seesnalalogies for instance your dealing a your your excuse me your taking a compound that is reducing histamines in mast cells and spiraling is also been used quite effectively as a way to treat a a seasonal ologies and some of the symptimology equally on par with some of the major prescription and over the counter drugs for that a one cautionary note of spilling does can carry some side effects for people o that are a have a genetic mutation leading to something alpine u these people know who they are their very sensitive to a final adenine he seem people cannot drink any sort of a neutrisreader diet soda for for reasons that they understand it con be quite dangerous it is a rare genetic disorder but none the less a spilling can a can be an issue for those people a for most people the side effect for profile is is pretty minimal and just to be clear i do not have any relationship to a spilling company or anything just finding interesting that there are these compounds that a sound rather a forgive the phrase but of a rather new a a because they come from a a alga from a plant but when you look at the underlying mechanism it makes perfect sense that is often an what we to point out here is that if there are the called alternative therapies a alternative because most people have not heard of them it is always nice if they map to a specific logical mechanism and framework by which that compound would work has supposed to some anecdote of o i hear spurlina's great aerologies well now we know why it inhibits marcels and histominurgic marcels in particular earlier i mention a new and very exciting study publish as a full article in nature full article means that it is a major finding a it at the journal nature they have letters which are important findings there still very highstringency for getting a letter in nature published a but the full articles a generally there is only one or two per issue a in the a weekly addition of nature and just last week there is a very exciting article published from chufas lab at hazard medical school a chuff have known for number of years his group has done phenomenal work on the mechanisms of itch and pain and discovering some of the receptors an pathways for than pain and more recently they have been exploring the mechanistic basis of acupuncture and the title of the article is a narrow anatomical basis for electroacupuncture to drive the vagal a renal axis and while that is a mouthful now most all of you are probably familiar with what i mean when i say vagal adrenal axis vagal meaning of the vagus and a renal of the adrenal glands and perhaps we should not be surprised although excited none the less that when chufu'se lab looked at stimulation of the body with can the lectroacupuncture this is these are needles where it a small bit of electrical current low level electrical current is passed a into the the needle and therefore into the body they located sits on the body that can increase inflammation by way of releasing in inflammatory side of kinds these areas included the the abdomen and they found areas on the body such as the a lower limbs the hind limbs in this case that can stimulate the vagal adrenal reflex a and can lead to reduced inflammation and what was really interesting is that they figured out that it was activation of nerve endings that resided in the fascia i mention earlier what kashas but just to remind you the fascia is a a really thick sheath of tissue that surrounds muscle if ever you have heard of rolling rolling is a a form of very intense message have never had this done but have heard about this it is a a it involves among other things each separating the muscle away from the aria somewhat it is ha very very deep tissue message ache a good friend mine who a had that this done told me that it was probably the most challenging of experience that physical experience that head ever been through going through this rolling procedure may be some of you have been rolled as they say and can report to of the experience whether not it was pleasant or unpleasant or you felt benefits or not in any case this study is not about rolling jersey but it is about the fascia and what they discovered is there's a specific population of neurons those nuns have a name as they often do in science name is not important but if you want to look it up it is the pro are to neurons piano we artunerons and they send a connection deep into the limb fashion tissue and then they send another connection the connections referring to our ax on nor on have as on wire in one direction a that goes into the deep facial tissue of the the lower limb anear the calf and thigh and then they send another wire up into the spinal cord and to a region of the hind brain a in the backup bronco year your neck called the medulla in the medulla oblangata that neon also has a name called the deemed does it after and that neon connects to the adrenal gland to release our good old friends the catacolamenes nor adrenalin adrenalin and dopamine or nor apineferan epineferan and and dopamine and their release causes a reduction in inflammation even in response to an injection of something olippipoly salaried which cannectally induce fevers what is all this saying this is saying that activation of the deep facial tissue cause is a chain of neural reactions that leads eventually to the release of norpanefr nor bengaline adrenalin and dopamine and once again lowers inflammation very much the breathing study that we talked about earlier in the pattern of silly cyproventilation with pretension leading to reductions and inflammation i cannot tell you how happy this makes me i had nothing to do with this work but the reason it makes me happy is because i have a particular fondness for when practices that have existed for many centuries or even thousands of years such as acupuncture such as respiration work start to converge with some of the hardcore mechanistic science and the reason this excites me is not because we want to take science an race the previous tools and methods of these ancient practises not at all and it certainly is not the case that we just want to name things or rename things with modern science what is very exciting is when we can discover mechanism that explains why certain practices work first of all that validates those as legitimate practices maybe even insurance will start to cover them whereas may be they previously had not i do not know what the current statuses for insurance coverage of acupuncture may ism guessing there are places that do it may be others it do not i personal am not a somebody who receives acupuncture i have in the pass but ism it is not that i am a particular a fan of it but i think that there are number of people that benefited from its i think that is wonderful a breath work and respiration work i is something that have a cultivate s a practice over the years i mentioned earlier how i use it to a bushbuck on incoming infections and forth and now that does not sound total the just a figment if my imagination there s ache mechanism published mechanism to explain it but the most exciting thing to me about all this is that practices that traditionally have been shrouded in complicated language or were the unique domain of the practitioners and relied on phrases the meridians or the caracaras of which i think is perfectly valid language but does not inform mechanism and then in a separate community the community i come from the community of scientists have use language pray to heron's macula obliged o vegoladrenal axis and theysicly no one can communicate with one another because the languages shrouding what we are now starting to see is that at their convergence is a common mechanism and with that understanding what is going to be really terrific is as new protocol start to emerge in understanding mechanisms and pathways and in being able to understand the the base set of practices breathing electracupuncture and forth we can now start to day dream in a very realistic way about the development of new protocols more effective protocols protocols that perhaps one can do at home without needles perhaps protocols us such as the breathing that you can do anywhere any time and and be confident that your actually impacting the isle sic in the isle a pathways reducing those in increasing isle ten we are no longer wandering around in the fog hearing about these magical techniques without understanding why they work nor are we just seeing a munch of science that a is descriptive but not mechanistic or pointing to specific protocols ism just delighted again i had nothing to do with this work but i really an a terrific a work tofu and colleagues and a and also ant to acknowledge a journal as prominent is nature for a suturing this a affront because i think it really does mark the beginning of a new path in medicine and just to underscore that point a little bit further the national institutes of health of course has a cancer institute and i institute the deal with trying to combat cancer and to a cure blindness and forth and now they have what is called and c c i h which is complimentary health and there are good tax dollars being put to the kinds of explorations that were talking about that undoubtedly are going to lead to better treatments for in immunological diseases nor a logical diseases the convergence of the mine system in the nervous system very exciting times and i hope that by learning about some of this new and emerging science and hearing about some of the protocols that are either zero cost or low cost certainly for respiration that is the case or for the use of heat or cold or i maybe even electoracupuncture if you have acts less to that that we can really see that we are starting to evolve as a field of health and medicine and science and action practicsysand that they're really trying to converge and have a vector as we say in a new and more exciting direction once again we have covered a lot of information to day we learned about the immune system the adaptive mine system the innate in system and the nervous system and how those interact and throughout we discuss protocols that can allow you to tap into this relationship between the nervous system an mine system and hopefully avoid vendor shorten the course of

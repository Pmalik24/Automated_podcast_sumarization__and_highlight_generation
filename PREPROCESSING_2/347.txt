welcome to the superman latcongens no science science pay to e fermi i man drew supermen and o professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford' school of medicine today my guest is doctor rent alike doctor rent alike is aboard certified neurologist and pelvic surgeon she is an expert in both male and female neurological pelvic floor and sexual health during to day's episode doctor alike answers the most commonly ask questions about urinary pelvic and sexual health for instance how to avoid getting utilize urinary tract infections we also discuss pelvic florinatomy and function as it relates to overcoming an overly tight or an overly relaxed pelvic floor this is a key distinction that most people are not aware of many people here about the need to called strengthen their pelvic floor but in fact many people need to do the exact opposite they need to learn to relax their pelvic floor in order to achieve proper neurologic and sexual function today you will learn about that you will also learn about sexual health as it relates to erectile function as it relates to things vaginal lubrication as it relates to orgasm we separate out very carefully the difference between psychological desire and a arousal that occurs within the genitals themselves and doctrmali lights some important misconceptions about sexual dysfunction for instance that many people believe that hormones are responsible for sexual dysfunction but in reality hormone deregulation is responsible for only a very small percentage of sexual dysfunction and yet pelvic floor and blood flow related issues can account for a large number of cases of sexual dysfunction in both males and females i assure you that to day's discussion is going to illuminate many new areas of information many new tools and protocols that ism g using most people have not heard of we talk about the curl vascular that is bloodflow related and muscular aspects of flatter function prostate function scenes glands we talk about vaginal health as well as penile health we talk about these things as it relates to different stages across the life span it is a far reaching in depth and practical conversation that ism certain everyone will glean important take always from now before we go any further i do want to highlight that the content of to day's episode is sexual in nature we talk very directly about different types of sexual behavior and we talk about it from the standpoint of the cognition and biologist it is a medical slash scientific discussion that said we cannot be aware of ware this podcast is being played and who is listening and i assert that there are certain themes within to day's discussion that would not be suitable for young children how young well that is certainly not for us to discern we realize that different parents in different households should be the arbiters of what sorts of information their children are exposed to or not my suggestion would be that if you have any concern whatsoever that the content of to day's episode would not be appropriate to be heard by some member of your family that you please listen to the podcast first or at least check the time stamps where we have detailed what specific topics are covered and then to make your decision accordingly i shall mention that not only as doctor alike still an active cognition she sees patients daily out of her clinic in southern californium and we provided a link to that clinic in the shownote captions she is also authored dozens of high quality serviced publications in the fields of neurology pelvic health and sexual health and we have also provided link to that bibliography in the shownote captions and she's also a spectacular public educator she provide zero cost content about sexual health public floor health and neurology as it relates to both men and women on her youth channel and there too we pro video link to doctor maliagues you to channel in the shownote captions to this episode before we begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and efforts to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and signs related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme id to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is rock rock makes eye glasses and sun glasses that are of the absolute highest quality have spent a lifetime working on the biology the visual system and i can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of challenges

superman lab podcast and as always thank you for your interest in science and now for my discussion with doctor rent mali doctor rent mali welcome thank you think you then matches not hereto be here ism delight to have you here ism a huge fan of your content i find that you are able to deliver critical information about sexual health neurology pelvic floor libido and many other things that are of immense interest to people but that ordinarily people do not really know where to get the high quality information and coming to you for that information means they are going to get the highest quality information i truly believe that because as everyone will soon here to day we are going to have a a very frank discussion but one that is really grounded in science and medicine around sexual health and related topics these are topics that typically people learn about perhaps a little bit in school may be at home from friends usually over hearing things i supposed to direct exploratory conversation on line pornography and at least in my experience growing up there was education around sexual health reproductive health et camera that was more oriented toward the fever of things as tea eyes fear of unwonted pregnancy all of which of course is extremely important for people to learn about but far less about om sort of that healthy versions of sexual health right ye absolutely this is an especially important conversation it is also one that i think has a back drop that we should just acknowledge right off the bat that because the information is gleaned from multiple sources and because there are i less you say a influences out there that relate to the morality of different practices that there can be shame there can be misunderstanding there can be secrecy and that further leads to misinformation ism confident that to day a you can clarify things for us and we are going to stay out of those trenches and last thing it'd to say is that because a number of terms will certainly come up that i think for some people ism they are not used to hearing and general discourse ism just going to get them out of the way now penis vagina anus prostate what else is there i we are we are going to talk about libido we are going to talk about intercourse or a sex anal sects we are going to talk about all of that i just want to get that out there that a we can reduce the a shock a the shock response elf it make talk about all of it great to start things off in anticipation this episode i solicited for questions on social media and i got thousands of questions but there was a lot of overlap in the questions to start off it'd to talk about pelvic floor g because both males and females have a pelvic floor and mynerstanding is that there is a muscular component there is a neural muscular component there is a blood flow component what is a healthy pelvic floor what does healthy pelvic floor do and then we can talk about some of the health issues that an unhealthy pelvic floor creates and some of the ways to ameliorate an unhealthy pelvic floor absolutely pelvic floor very simply is basically a bowl of muscles that is connected to bones that hold up all your organ basically in your pelvis there is all these muscles there and there function is essentially many it it helps with urination dedication actual function it helps with posture and having a strong healthy pelvic floor can mean that you are having normal urination you are having normal dedication your having great sects and that you are also not having ailments backpack or issues related to those those functions and those organs and you don't pelvic for is is important in many different aspects an we deal with it a lot as neurologists because it is integral to these functions that we take care of and when you have an unhealthy pelvic floor it can vary from person to person and while you hear about it a lot and women men also suffer from pelvic flooridous function are problems with the pelvic floor be i public lords function happens a lot when your doing things if you were to go to the him and do repetitions of of any sort of exercise and you did not rest then that muscle would become contracted an short very similarly if your pelvic floor is overstrained it can become contracted and short and tight all the time and you may not know it it may just be a function of stress anxiety a or over use or posture problems things of that nature that can affect your pelvic floor and this can lead to issues let start with urination you can have symptoms of urgency frequency a meaning if to go a lot to the bathe or you have to go and have a sudden desire that you cannot delay sometimes even have leakage in some cases it can make it difficult to urinate because the panic floor is tense or perhaps to incompletely vacate the flatter correctly you go to urinate and then you go back to your dancer and five minute later after urinate again exactly something of tall it can be either that you are not acting completely or that the panic for muscles are tense that their stimulating the later it feels there is more to go is not always that you are not evacuating it it can present in a number of different ways and then with a with sexual function it if its very tense you can have pain you can have pain with sex you can have pain with erections you can have pain with ejaculation sometimes tit can be a lot of different kind of pain centrums and you are i have all these different things going on n it is really just pelvic fluorides function a with with i function you can deathly have constipation and then often you can also have back pain a and all f these things can happen when your pelvic floor is to tense sometimes your public floor can be to weak and that can be often because of we see this in women a lot because of child birth delivering children a with some people of neurologic disorders they can have weak pelvic floors a connective tissue disorders less dwell system for example these sorts of things can cause weakness to the pelvic floor which can then cause very often what i see eorinarian continents a leakage a which can ben no create problems for people down the line thank you for that first question how does somebody know if their pelvic floor is too tight from a a over contraction or chronic contraction of the muscles their verses too weak am an one of the challenges in having this conversation is that if we were talking about contraction of the calf muscle or the bicep i think everyone intuitively knows because they have seen the shortening of the muscles when the muscles quite flexed and the lengthening of the muscles when it is relaxed a is there a way to describe pelvic floor muscular shortening in a way that everyone can understand would this be a a we are gin to be direct to day would this be we tensing up one's am a anis an bout the opposite of of the movement that one would do before initiating a bowl movement and relaxation is sort of the pattern of pelvic floor muscular am relaxation just prior to initiating able movement i will they most people cannot recognize it because it is very difficult to notice it sort of a gradual and it can over time become noticeable with these symptoms but otherwise it is very difficult because it is not a muscle that we were ever train to recognizes right you hear about legal exercises for example and people talk about how to do them but that is all you ever hear about the pelvic floor and you do not really know how to kind of do things in a way that protects your pelvic floor or a or kind of what how do even tell when it is too tight or not relaxing and that takes the sort of a training and usually when people come to force get an examination to see if your pelvic floors tight to for women at the pelvic examined for men as usually erect exam how dos how does that exam go it is essentially palpating the muscles and also looking at the function well say for a digital palpation would that is a medical acknowledge for fingers are called digits a am ism old enough to at to recognize what a digital prostrate exam is right the physician inserts their fingers through into the aniline and and feels the prostrate to see whether not at swollen or not and and as om saying the ism realize in as son as we think of met medicine conidia modern medicine evolved this is basil basically been the practice or what fifty year sixty years may be a hundred years in the same way that the the old school practice for glaucoma thus of i pressure was for the physician wo just touch the eyeball o folks for those do you think that medicine has evolved much a it clearly has in many ways but cumin any event a prostrate exam those i just described what would a what would a pelvic for exam for a male and a pubic floor example a female a involve at a count of granular level yes for for women you can feel the panic for muscles through the vagina you can feel the olio cowages the pubocoxages the elevate or ait an those are all names of different muscles in this bull is is n a position who can feel the car fingers and young you could do you could put your finger but you to have a reference of normal right you would not know what a normal pelvic floor feels verses the tight one verses a weak one and you can assess the tenseness base on ouzo palpation you can also see if there is tenderness and you can assess that base on just at a general physical examination and then also you can observe i can say contract your by squeeze your pelvic floor up and and i can look and see are they squeezing or are they pushing are they coordinated or not right because that is the a function of normal house of the pelvic floor and sometimes you will see that there discoordinated am you can also assess fir sensation in the avian things that that that could be consequences of dysfunction to there be dysfunction an laterality the pein for pulling up into the it or up in to the left absolutely what typically when you see a panic flortharipis not not of panic flortheripis but these are the people who do the work right they they work with you on a prolong basis to help you normalize the function of your panic florist born the him with the train are right they really work with you to get your paid floor functioning correctly and the first step to that a lotic panic flortharipis will just a line your bones and and your your kind of the way you sit and walk to make sure that you are not straining those muscles by pulling in different in different directions and if a mail goes to the physician to get a pelvic floor exam there is obviously a difficulty in putting fingers into the urethra one would hop a too small and opening how are they doing the pelvic for examines it external to the badgers it through the anas some of its through the ones you can feel the muscles through the anas than you can feel the parental triad fill the muscles there as well sensations so supernal area from the outside of the bad to am the region between the scrotum and the anas yes of it sounds to me if people want to get a high quality assessment of whether other pelvic floor is healthy or not they mean to see a pubic for specialist yet that its not the sort of thing that they could into on their own necessarily it would be difficult i mean there are things you can buy on line probes that you can insert an the vagina that will teach what a do legal exercises and give you some read i of some readings but they are not really meant to piano teyusualy something people use if they they have a weak pelvic floor and they want to try to do it at home on their own also there is nothing that can to give you a baseline reading is this normal or abnormal but talk about eagles for small whose eagle he is a a gin collegiate i do not remember all the specifics to be quints but basically he came up with eagles which are a strengthening exercise for the pelvic floor and what it is what we describe it to for patience as we say you are going to there is are different ways to describe it you are going to house the muscles that use when you learnt but try to stop the flow but you do not do the when you are yearning cause that can create dysfunction you can to learn what the muscles are and then you squeeze those muscles and relax in between sets to speak and you will do the other way people describe it is pulling up and in in the lief vagina or for men san a you say its the feeling that you are trying to lift your penis off the floor without touching it right those are kind of year o describe it those are kind of of ways that you can describe those muscles and you can squeeze for five seconds and relax for five seconds and do them in repetitions and they are just any sort of exercise you do you do not want to start doing a hundred of them right you on a do them i shell the people i tell patients you them lying down that you are only focussing on those muscles you not working on your posture your not doing anything else and as you get better with them lying down you then sit up and do them and then once you are good with them sitting not you can do them standing and start with you do not ten of fifteen at a time liking a marketing repetition to yo the on tats one yet ten of fifteen repetitions in the morning tend to fifteen repetitions at night a maybe one more during the middle the day but do not overdo it because just anything especially when you are starting out you can and if you are doing tons and tons i eagles then you will get a tight short pelvic floor muscles and you will then develop pelvic flooridous functions it is really important to kind of understand those mechanics which is why a lot of people think they know how to do eagles but they really do not and i always encourage lie if you have the time and the resources to go to a pelvic floor physical therapist they can really work with you and make sure your doing them correctly what are some of the benefits of eagles for those that need them yes they are typically prescribed for your starring continents specifically stress your nearing contents leakage that occurs when you have increase in your intrabdominal pressure a valsalva or coughing sneezing lifting heavy things jumping on a trampoline a for those purposes we use eagles to strengthen the pelvic floor and also an women pelvic organ prolapse when you have weakness of the panic floor that leads to a bulge that you can visibly see or feel in the vagina for men we often prescribe them for people who have had a prostatic to me who then subsequently develop leakage after the procetact me that is against tress herinering continence now a lot of people use eagles recreational because improving the paid floor musculature can lead to more intense pelvic floor contractions during orgasm which can be more pleasurable and some people do it for those purposes but again i caution people not to overdo it a because then you can lead to a more tens pelvic floor which is not where we want end up yes i will under score a that cautionary note years ago i heard about eagles si chill try it sounds all good right i only heard good things about eagles am and what quickly resulted in was painful urination and i thought this is weird everyone saying eagles are great and the best thing i could do for my panic floor t seemed was to avoid eagles yes am and obit later all when were talk about prostrate it'll explain at least what my experience was as it relates to the prostrate but i guess the take message that ism gathering from what your telling us is that strengthening the relic floor is great if you have a weak pelvic floor strengthening your panic floor further if you have a strong pelvic floor can be detrimental it can be it can be as if you overtrain it just if you overtrain anything else and a you just have to if you really want to do eagles if you have any symptoms at all you described painful urination or the things have describe pain with erections pain with a g adulation pain a difficulty emptying any of those symptoms stop and go see a neurologist that they can kind of assessor panic floor what is the antikeygl in other words if somebody decides that they have a tight pelvic floor how can they learn to relax their pelvic floor there is a lot of different sort of things that you can do fur a women you can do message of the area you can use vaginal dilators to help relax hen muscles you can take repositories that have medications value or backlefen which are muscle relaxants and a that can help as well although they are not treatments the more of abandoned but they can help with the symptoms that you are having and then a you can also i think the best thing is to work with the physical there's cause they can teach you certain exercises that will help down train the pelvic floor for example one of the ones i tell my patients is happy baby pops it actually enoustratches and elongates the pelvic far muscles doing these exercises regularly will help you lengthen the panic far muscles one thing that have experienced extreme painfrom and that stopping was one of the best things that ever happened for my pelvic floor was to not do any kind of crunching movement with my legs crossed i would go these you of classes one in my life and i they would have everybody o these crunches and have always done some abdominal work here and there during the week if ism being diligent but they would have us cross our feet and that seem to lead to some pelvic floor discomfort that was similar to what had experienced when i did the eagles yes giant for me seeing the keyholes was one of the best positions i ever made i only do them for a short whiles i get this is clearly not for made and i guess that is another point ism that tell me if you agree were not that if you hear about something on line or on this podcast or anywhere else and you tried and it seems to be sending things in the wrong direction either you are doing it wronger it might not be the right thing for you exactly an i think all too often we hear this thing is great and people jump on that ban wagon and than they an up worsening the promise or developing promise were they did not have them previously but is there anything about the anatomy of the neuromuscular connections or ore musculature of the palm floor that would provide support for my experience the that doing crunches with legs crosses essentially is it possible that is creating a symmetries on the pelvic floor and now ism sure ism angry yogateachers and um crunch crunching was stop everywhere but he if it is the question of your pelvic floor of fou extra delineations in your abs where my votes going there is the couple things here that we should dive into one is that people do not often breathe correctly during exercise a and diaphermatic breathing is is really import which is a deep breath that expands the did from not kind of shall beating that just in your mouth and throw and that is actually when you you now when you do any sort of exercise the your trainer will tell you exhale on the effort right and there is a reason for that because when you inhale your pelvic floor relaxes when you exhale your pelvic floor contracts and it actually that contraction stabilizes the pelvic flora whatever intrabdominal pressure your your causing to increase from the exercise whether it is a squat or as crunch or whatever your increasing your abdominal pressure your panic floor is then contracting to help stabilize that and part part of the reason people tend to hold their breath during crunches right they do not do the appropriate breathing and that can be part of it the other thing that can happen with certain things is that there are nerves and carries particularly the pedestal nerve and the pedestal artery that run through the pelvic floor when you get pelvic flooridous function you can cause decrease blood flow to the to the pelvic floor muscles which can affactsectual function and you can get nerve inflammation as well that can all they'll cause pain and tell they the kind of halidill comes together glad it you mention blood flow i think our entire discussion to day should be framed up at least in the back of our minds in the minds of our listeners an viewers as involving at least three things any time we are talking abut erectile function or dysfunction or pelvic for function dysfunction or vaginal lubrication or lack thereof we need think about the hormonal influences the blood flow related influences and the curl influences including the curl influences that come from the brain the signals of arowzle for instance ore lack of arousal tam and on am we will not be overly systematic in in our a parsing of all this but i i think what you just mention raises really important point that sometimes in an effort to do something that is good for the muscles strength in the muscles one will cut off blood flow in fact one of the more common questions i got and i consulted with a couple of exercise physiologists about this and they confirmed that a lot of people who squat and dead lift heavy in the him or even who just fence their pelvic floor when they are doing things dumbbell curls were other exercises and especially people who seem to do a lot of abdominal work reported to me in the questions that they experience things erectile this function that they experience things pandering vaginal intercourse that essentially they had created some sort of sounds to me a hyper contraction of the muscles in that area that were impeding all the things that they wanted as either side effects are direct effects of exercise because many people are exercising for esthetic reasons and health reasons but nowadays it seems especially on the male side but we all struck ago their old testoster on the female side a lot of males lift weights in order to increase their testosterone and for reasons that are obvious also want have healthy sexual function and here they are doing this thing that is very good for increasing testosterone if they're doing it correctly and testosterone is involved in libido in the male sexual response end the female sexual response of course but they are impeding their erections you can start to see how a there are probably a lot of confused and may been distraught people out there they are trying to do all the right things and they're setting up rode blocks and even a sending themselves backward in some cases the question is how does one know whether not something a let us a low lubrication or pandering vaginal intercourse or a loss of reptile strength or some sort of erectile dysfunction whatever it may be cause it can take on different forms as will talk about how does one know if it is blood flow related hormone related or neural related and if it is nor related how does one know of it is issue of lack of appropriate signals from the brain over suppression or lack of o arousal from the brain or whether not at some parietal neral thing of enervation of the pink origin i think there is there is a lot that we can go into here but eventually first you one to find out very specifically what is going on are you getting aroused are you having erections are you masturbating there is all these questions that will help us go down there sorority interrupt when you say aroused a forsake in this discussion i just want to make sure that we distinguish between psychological arousal the desire to do a i guess here we also have to be precise a arousal to engaging interposing arousal to a desire essentially era think people learn recognize or we talking about a arousal as the response of the genitals correct o desire and arousal this is a very important concept does not always go in one direction sometimes you can feel arousal meaning you have the tell tall signs of arousal your nipples get e rest you have more lubrication if you are a female you really man when fou man nipples get erector in er to believe something no a you maybe get the sex flush whet you get some some redness or or warmth feeling that is your body's response write to arousal and sometimes that can be an erection and sometimes that is not not having an erection does not mean you are not aroused it may mean other things but certainly that is part of it and then desire do you want to have sex do you have relic when you think about your partner or who whoever you want to engage with to their desire to actually do that right or rest it just more of obligation or other things and does it desire it does not matter f the desire comes after arousal for some women in particular we see that they may not have the desire right away but they want to be intimate or close with their partner and they will start just being close with them and then arousal will come and then oh ye it'd this then the desire comes after and that is normal that is totally fine also you want a kind of part that out and then for men you can ask are you getting erections at night because that will tell us the function of your organ at night verses during the day where you have also psychogenic components right you can really get in your head about erections when you have a problem in the bedroom with performance it becomes a vicious cycle rite you you have a problem the next time your really street you are not present you are not mindful in the moment with sex and you are thinking about on ma got a mean perform of a might a perform and then it does not perform again and your just it is getting worse and worse the anxiety is through the roof and that is actually causing your sexual dysfunction i think it is it is important first to identify those issues and then also for a bloodflow a sometimes we can we can assess passed on well what other comorbities do you have do you have other issues on going that may be affecting your bloodflow most common high blood pressure diabetes heart disease and if you smoke all of those things will effect blood flow to the genitals and that will point active negatively negatively that will point us to a more vascular issue hormonal issues are are very important for desire and and as far as sexual function in terms of erections there is only three per cent of erectile this function is related to hormones it tact does wonder a rectal function correct as opposed to desire freesias wire it desire is predominantly modulated by the hormontostostrom for both men and women in fact if you a lot of people do not know this but women have more testosterone in their bodies an they actually have astringent tosaftoms very important for both men and women for variety of reasons and you tuna using that discussion with the patient will help you kind of identify were your headed in terms of a what you need to focus on for treatment there are certain things you can use to assess blood flow you can do doper ultrasounds of the penis as well as the clitoris to see if there is good blood flow you can assess the peqsostolic velocity which will tell you if there is a problem with are tub inflow verses the end diastolic velocity which will tell you if there is a problem with venue outflow and that can assess those things there are some toss you can do for nerve function although their very uncommonly done because mostly w e can kind who get that through clinical report and unfortunately if your having nerve jobs sometimes it depends on what is causing them but sometimes they can be very difficult to reverse and that is kind of a problem we know that as people age their sensation becomes less just through aging the nerves the receptors become less sensitive and you will generally have less responsiveness to the same sensations you did when you are younger and that can have overlays all of this it is complex but really i know a lot of it comes from the discussion you have with your patient or you kind of really doing a deep have in what is going on really thinking about each of those aspects and also what is going on your relationship and what is going on in can of your life stars tangsiety the coward this is a thing to as many of have been taking a g one daily since two thousand twelve som delighted that they are sponsoring the pod cast a g one is a vitamin mineral robotic drink that is designed to me all of your foundational nutrition needs of course i try to get enough servings of vitamins and minerals through whole food sources that include vegetables and fruits every day but oftentimes i simply cannot get enough servings but with a g one ism sure to get enough fitments and minerals and the robotics that i need end it also contains adaptagence to help buffer stress simply put i always feel better when i take g one i have more focus and energy and i sleep better and it also happens to taste right for all these reasons whenever ism asked if you could take just one supplement what would it be i answer a g one if you would to try a one they will to drink g one do come slash supermen to claim a special offer they will give you five free travel packs puss a year supply of item in d three k to again that is drink a g one do come slash supermen gush lots there to attack em and ism glad you mention the relationship itself because i there all sorts of things that can impact the are all response a novelty i'mnot everyone is in a committed relationship whether not people are engaging in a lot of masturbation to the point of ejaculation or climax or not em pornography et camera were will get into that a it is a vast space to explore before we go any further i want to make sure however that we cut people to where and how they could find a really good let us a pelvic floor a therapist and where they could find a really great neurologist to do the sorts of exams and perhaps the sorts of treatments that we have talked about because em at least as far as i understand much of what people want to learn on this pod case is how things work and what happens one things s break down but also a to resolve those issues let say somebody wants to check out their pelvic floor figure out what is going on there maybe there having issues may be there not if they are male or female where do they go wits their place on line that has a great list of of some of the best ones one's aria can be done over tell medicine no how's one go about that yet in terms of your pelvic floor it is good to get assessed by a physician who specializes pelvic floor d now that could be a neurologist that could be a ynachologist or even a physical medicine n rehabilitation doctor that specializes in pelvic floor health typically you will see a in neurology you look for people who are bored certified in female pelvic medicine an reconstructive surgery if you are woman if you are man may be sexual medicine a some one who specialize in sexual medicine would be a good place to look for gin call just a genuine look at some one who has interest in this area who aero does manage pelvic floor and then in terms of pelvic floor a physical mesonreabilitation at least when i was in trying there is about twenty cumin i doctors around the country who really focus on this it is not a lot of people if you can go to a pelvic floor physical therapist and you have one near you that is great as well you a you do want to make sure that one may do are certified in panic floor physical therapy and that they have taken care of your gender if you have male anatomy that you want to go to someone who actually seen men because a lot of the panic floor physical therapist tend to treat a lot of women and that is kind of what i tell my patients general speaking there is no least to my knowledge no great resourcing may be will will look that up in safely and fine one that is very helpful thank you and because it again going back to what i said the beginning of our conversation think there is a lot of no shame or at least lack of clarity is to how one gets help for issues that a relate to the genitals because if you have a headache you having and i issue an or nowhere to go yet fully you are head k does not warrant going to inter all just what it might stuff thence be o them all is optometrist i do not think we hear often enough about where to access the best quality care for these sent thank you for that in thinking about sexual dysfunction it'd to have that conversation more o less in parallel if we can round male sexual dysfunction an female sexual dysfunction and i one to make sure that before we do that the do creating the correct parallel construction as they say erectile dysfunction in males is clearly a form of sexual dysfunction what is the parallel to erectile this function in females is it lack of natural lubrication and lack of relaxation of the vagina to have non painful intercourse is there is it even possible soave a parallel conversation about these two things it is different in in some circumstances there there homologies right the penis is the homologue of the clitoris right the liters is the essential the same sort of spunky erectile tissue that you see in the penis it gets erect with arousal and it is it actually extends very deep into the palm it is not just a small little ordinance actually quite long and you can in men you can have erectile thisfunction cause you can see it but in women you may have difficulty with orgasm and it is not exactly a parallel but difficulty orgasmic in women is multyfactorial and can get into that but i think there there the different and i think also sexual dysfunction presents differently in both genders when you talk about men they're very the one visual they see of arousal is erections and it becomes very in grained in your psyche that if i do not have an erection ism not aroused right but there's a lot of reasons that you might not have an erection that we have sort o touched on vascular problems hormonal problems nor logic problems a psychogenic issues and other medications you are taking there are issues that can effect a tactile function and and that can be part of it where you know you might feel you have low desire because your royals not there not becomes a little bit confusing for women what they can asses is their level of lubrication if sects hurts and if they get an argal them and those are kind of the ways you can look at it thank you for fleshing all that out years ago i worked on sexual differentiation an in particular the role of hormones in sexual differentiation and indeed as you described we learn because we were taught and i think a people still generally agree that if one looks at the embryological origins of the penis and the liters they are eventually analogous structures a and that a lot of male genital development involves literally the regression the disappearance of the female sexual genitaliunassociated or gins molaryan duck somethings that and what would become the ovaries become the testes et camera et camera those are anatomical parallels but will you just describe for us a very beautifully is the functional parallels has it relates to sexual function and dysfunction ism hoping with tat framing that we can a that we can a knock down a few these pins a in a little less time because there is a lot to tackle here first off id to address the hormonal issues you mention that only three per cent of reptile dis function and by extension can we say also a female a issues wet sexual arousal or hormonal an origin is that right with desire yes ocher are hormonal and in general an arousal in terms of lubrication if your using that as a as a barometer yes you can see less van lubrication do to hormones and i celery three to six per cent for up to six percent we see of erecthiw to function is hormonal it is a small percentage of the entire entirely of erectile to function as i think in looking on the landscape of social media podcast and and just in the common a mind set we have all come to believe that testosterone is prolabido it is pro desire in men and women think now people a strong appreciate that pro desire in women as well durian men and that dopamine is also associate with desire and the general public tens to have this view of estrogen is being sort of anti libido or anti male which is frankly false in fact en one cover this on the podcast with doctor collgelatten with doctor peter attic and another fellow a tuber a ceric for more plates foredates has talked a lot about the fact that if people if men excuse me take drugs an astrozol to suppress the estrogen thinking that oh it is all about having high testosterone estrogen oftentimes they crush their labia just abolish it which has led to a slowly growing but ai think positive shift in how people ore thing about estrogen estrogen's great for brain function estrogen's great for libido in men and women and that is a revision of a i think how most people think of the male sexual response it is more in keeping without people think about the female sexual response oh estrogen and the female sexual response that that make sense but wet were trying to do here is clarify some of the a is conceptions now the reason i mention dopamine is that my understanding is that dopamine is involved in the exalt theexcuses me the desire response we will distinguish desire the psychological arousal from genital arousal physical arousal and that prolactin is associated with the refractory period during which direction cannot occur another perhaps orgasm cannot occur in females et camera but my understanding is that is also not at simple and we need to take a step back perhaps and just talk about the physiological underpinnings of the desire and an arousal response it'll tell you what i was taught and the can tell me where it is wrong i hope i was taught that the erection response and the vaginal lubrication response is generated by the para sympathetic nervous system the relaxed the rest and digest aspect of the nervous system hence why some people can get psychogenic sexual issues of lack of erection or lack of vaginal lubrication but that there are individuals out there for whom a lot of alertness may be even and this is a controversial thing but for some people even some sense of aggression or kind of edginess or excitement adrenalin in other words can stimulate direction or national lubrication it gets tricky i it is not the ten books is not it they taught us in high school as far as i know i was taught that the arousal response in males of females is initiate by a para sympathetic to relaxed tone and that as sexual desire and a arousal and sex or masturbation progresses that it shifts more towards the sympathetic nervous system which has nothing do with emotional sympathy and has everything to do with arousal the catacolamines dreamy norepanafran an epanafran also called a drenalinan nor adrenalin a released and that the climax response it which mayor may not include ejaculation we have to separate that out is one that is really of the stress system of the body and then in the postcoital or postejaculatory or postclimax phase than there is a shift back to the para sympathetic nervous system that is where om the a pillotac and the a the exchange of a odors and tastes and other molecules is known to enhance pardoning through things oxytocin vast pressor and on and at what i just described is exceedingly oversimplified i realize but is that more or less how the physiology works yes a the way where tot in medical schools point and shoot thepoint is the part sympathetic nerve the final you all the maadints that one and that tender you go on to the sympathetic nerves but it makes there and the reason that i think your hearing a t this aggression or or these things there leading to arousal is because there needs to be a stimulus right a visual stimulus a tactile stimulus some sort of stimulus at your getting that is then causing the release of nitric oxide from the parisympthic nervous system and that could be for some people aggression or some form of that right yes a we people about nitro oxide because we will get into this when we talk about am drug stay increased blood flow a palish by aura and also am non prescription drugs things a else airline marine and am water melon for that matter i ow ans that i read on the intern a get how yet nitric oxide is essentially the ignition for what we say for erections ignition for erections that we if you thought the reason i talk about erections more often as when you look at the data in fact there was a paper on this where they looked at the number of articles that came up when you put in the word penis and the number of articles that came up when you put n the word liters and it with fifty thousand about penis and two thousand about the liters can we have this was actin major section of the comments yet on when i asked for for questions on in steam ism in comments on comments and ye how come am why not a et camera is that because the neurology and am sexual health field was dominated by men that is going to be the presumption words it because it is easier to study somehow her i men what what is going on here we i think there is been a lot of am andyou can go back to frond where he thought that that the female sexual response was less valuable and and there are some some rest valuable i yes i not li that the right i arm b o no noon no i oi r turns man an i wit these join i to d you sad with it right we yo at was but it was more about the male sexual response than the female sexual response and in general yes there is there were more men in medicine there was more an it is easier to study right you cannot say the clearest quite as easy as you can study the male penis response cause you can see it visually you can injected and see and erection response where yule do this for people who have reptile this function they will take medications that increase blood flow trials you will inject into the penis and you will see in erections you can actually try mix tryma there is it is injured all the enthral on is just when we what a you injecting the ton there there are they are three basically brand names of intricavernosal injections that we use for reptile this function i hear injection an nicest i i think i i to think that it reflects a unnatural male whats i sort of a om i taken aback at mas is a pic for contractthece oh it is it is care to hear about it is a very small needle it is very well tolerated have dot it to nations ain the office and they look i messy you're done they do not even it is it is not as painful as it seems and when you are not having erections and you have tried multiple things people get to the point where they are willing to try that i and and it is very effective as the most effective non surgical treatment we have for reptile this function and it is usually either one medication two medications are three you can have it'll provide wavering and third one that is yea pecan om look a son put in the comes om i surely they mom what what is it design to do as it is it om a was o later a sort they they the work in different mechanism but similar to the medications that we have p t five inhibitors it five in hitters work in the erection cascade basically what happens let us ecru must say get back to the nitric oxide thing will get there nitro oxide essentially is released by the end ofthelium in response to a visual tactile stimulate stimulating cut right and your body releases nitricoxide which then sets off the cascade for the erection and that release is f g n p which is which is causes the erection and it is degraded by phosphor disasters and medications that inhibit fosshood diesterace vagary and sales tend to prevent the break down of that simian piece have longer lasting erections and similarly these medications work sort of similar to that some of them we do not know exactly how they work but they work by increase increasing began pier s an p that are involved in those cascades and what about else trilling i hereabout else striking used to said over the counter supplement and it is in the arguing pathway and o my understanding is that it work similarly to things a sealosphiagra but is perhaps not as potent else suggest a cautionary no out there else tailing can give people vicious cold sores an canker sores vicious a you here about this on the nternatit is been verified by grotesque images that you do not want to gouge for and not every one tolerates it well these actually work by increasing nitric oxide they are not in the they are not later down the pathway there actually increasing the availability of nitric oxide ell arguing is the more direct pathway but it is very low bileavalability elsitralyin converts tell arguing but it is last much longer in the bloodstain which is why people tend to use else trilling now in in sexual medicine these supplements while there's been some studies on them and they are effective there is no regulation on the supplement industry we can recommend them but we just cannot say that for sure that the supplement is exactly whats said on the bottle we see lots of studies where they'll say i read one about melatonin and there is a variation of melatonin from what is on the bottle to four hun per cent times more and that is kind of the struggle that we as medical doctors have at i know we get a lot of slack for it that we do not talk about supplements but it is really the challenge there is finding the quality supplement a great site is a which have no a relationship to i except that i mention them all the time is examined not calm ow much at it has references to human studies r send where there is a lot of office to my shown and we get into some side effect issues does cannot address bra am quality by brandishes but m thanks for mentioning that what percentage of males who take seals am teach to dolphin or diagram we reptile this function get a relief from that because you mention only three percent of erectile issues an males or formally in origin but what per centare a likely to be bloodflow related in origin a large per centare our blood fly related that does not mean that the medication will be effective for every one if you look at the large percentage are are vascular in nature at that is the number one cause in in as men age we know that about fifty per cent of fifty two percent of men over the age of forty will have erectile is function and that continues to increase as you age fifty percent of fifty year old sixty percent of sixty year old and on and forth it is very very common and the success rate in the studies of about sixty to seventy per cent when you give some one a medication they will have sustained erections that are sufficient per penetrative intercourse which is the way we kind of discuss erectile is function in studies and in no with nations is is about sixty to seventy per cent not every one will have success but not all f that is because the medication does not work a sometimes people are not taking them correctly is ye filing to try to front doses and then they are still this issue of your your brain is coactive and if your having anxiety having their issues are stress in your life that can haven a fact on your ability to create in erection there is lots of factors that go into it a but generally speaking they are active and they do work quite well and they are tolerated pretty well as time ti seven percent is not a small number the that is a significant number that is the majority at by i significant margin is there basis for the use of a says a to dolphin diagram a elssitruline i in females tho yet there there is not a lot of day on this but certainly you know if you have surmise that there is a blood flow issue and the having difficulties with organ them in certainly something can tryalfully bull and certainly people do try i try these medications offulyable to see if they improve sacral function for women but there is not a whole bunch of robust randomats control trial studies on women with with these medications cubit later we will talk about prostrate health specifically but ism just going to i make a note here that i nowadays there is ism increasing use of lo dosage i seals slash to dalifill ism rather than i what i found on line was that the erectile dysfunction treatment dosage of seals to fulfills somewhere in the u fifteen to twenty milligram range what we are talking about here is ism daily use of i two point five to five milligrams of seals to defile for prostrate health and i learned in researching for this episode that i todalfill kalis was actually developed as a drug for the treatment of prostrate health to am essentially increased bloodflow the prostrate to increase prostrate health not for the treatment of reptile this function i i found that to be somewhat interesting i and a lot of people are now starting to use that i also learned that am if you dive into the a the guts of the internet i one can find that now there is a growing use of combined dosage seals an pail morphine which is a prodopamanurgect agent i will get back to doping a lament later but i is there any basis for lo dosage say two point five to five milligram daily use of seals to dalifille in females yet tho we let us talk about it for males and females i think lo dose daily seals is excellent for erectile function in men evens that true even a sorry interrupted that try even for men that are not experiencing erectile this function it is not indicated for that purpose but there is a thought that its increasing blood flow to the aria thou people i have personally used it for men who have paw the pain to help with increasing blood flow you can also use it potentially as a preventative to some people have you do not could have thought that's gets increasing blood floods preventing fibrosis of that erectile tissue that can happen with age or their vascular problems though it may be beneficial for that as well although again that is awe label and not something that we generally am promote a as far as for women there is again it can help with blood fuss if your having issues of you have a females having sexual dysfunction and she is got kinds of ask their problems that she is got a dibedies highblood pressure she smoke sent yes its certainly reasonable to try and see how they do usually want to give at least a four week trial to see if there is any benefit with those medications g thank you for that why is it that i get many questions about erectile this function from males who were in their twenties and thirties because everything you said up until now was mainly focused on men forty years and older is it from lack of physical activity over give nicotine by the way raping as far as we know raping in smoking bad for erectile function and perhaps sexual health and males and females generally because nicotine is waves o constrictor nicking does have certain benefits and i cover this in an episode on nicotine am norcognive benefits in a the elderly in particular but it is of as a constrictor it runs against all of the a sexual arousal stuff that were talking about m but okay let us assume that a male in their twenties or thirties sleeping enough sixteenth hours a night is exercising is not doing anything to punish their pelvic floor in the him there not doing a legs cross eagles while doing counties or something while inhaling i i that was a quiz by the way of fer earlier topics covered let us assume their you know eating pretty well major the foods are coming from non process or manly process foods the dual meditation each day their engaging in hopefully healthy relationships they are not masturbating crazy to porn and i let us assume that they are not on any assessor wire all these twenty thirty years on the internet asking mainly you this is they a under you but also to my direct messages about their reptile ofshues i will say i have seen a lot of young men in my clinic and i will say that they very often have panic farts function that even though they are doing all the right things there they do have me were in stressful society to you can try all the things to be to decrease your stress but lot of us are sitting long periods of time especially during covet i mean people sat for month right years just sitting at their home computer and exercising one hour is not on off at the day full of sitting and all of those things can affect pubic for functions my theories that that is probably the more common cause to walk more reive this standing desk walk more standing desk wo case and then my guests is that there is some psychogenic feed back loop absolutely just her speak for things are not working as well as they would than they're stressing about it in the stress is making things worse absolutely and u now you mention that people are not master bating or your using porn but a lot of people learn about sex the porn whether it is good or bad we cannot it is not a great think but that is accessible now when we were growing up you had to find a eye are you had to find a quiet room that no one was in a walk in ism enough to remembered the ton the street i will not mention em a by last name but yet kiddo the street you know had am porno magazines you magazine and then there was ashy a library of these goodness session say whether they where in the til this groping where kids would stash them in am in spicy locations in parking lots and then you not boys would biker scape word over would walk over and then they would take terms take difference use me looking at them but that that actually is to raise a perhaps a more important point am which is that looking at pornography is different in masturbating to pornography which is also diffrenthan masturbating to pornography to the point of ejaculation right because am i also get a lot of questions from people about their porn edition issues and there is a growing theory out there that overuse that meaning not just looking at but a masturbating to pornography to the point of ejaculation is creating a deficit of seeking out an am cultivating healthy real world sexual interactions yes i went i went at start this before i get into that is is to say that if your mastering to porn and you have normal healthy relationships and your going to work and your have a great we no a partner and you aevereathing great in your life it cate shame is the real problem and i make the watching pornography together yes i think inviting it is important though that it least in a literature they describe they do not describe prediction they call it for problematic pornography youth and it is only describe in about four per cent of people in these studies it is it is a small subset of people i think it is becoming more common because pornography is excessive and it it act toes ta opening pathways just this any other sort of addiction rite you you watch pornography you get a dopa men response your brain then as though i want o i want that again and you keep seeking more novel more a massive different types of pornography to get that same m responds but it does not happen t everybody but although i would say it is sorry at winter but that the doping response as it as a hard word biological mechanism for adaptive behaviors including unless just a fine healthy sexual behavior because i feel there such a range on that dependngon one's background religious beliefs it tetter any time we talk about sects on this podcastelic to say that involves at least poor things obviously consensual age appropriate contact appropriate species appropriate yes absolutely absolute that's thatreally glad you brought that upset have parade you get at before but it is very important and i think there is a spectrum a large spectrum of people who watch pornography exactly to pornography and have a normal life and that is fine i think that if we shame those people were creating problems right we say oh you udo that that is horrible and then they are in their head right and their causing problems in their life because they because of shame and there is i think there is a little bit of am cultural shame that comes of this discussion and it is a problem in the long term if we if we say that oh this is going create promise not everyone has there's many people who watch pornography and have no problems who have normal healthy relationship's great sex with their partner and it is fine or they're not regarding other between relationships ye and the relying on masturbation specifically i are there any data that distinguish between m just pure imagination phantasy verses visual phantasy as it relates to developing or inhibiting sexual health and here we thing about the desire aspect let us assume physical arousal handled i do not not intended i think that a the the the think about young people are want to get back to that the l in's your question but the thing about young people who are watching biography that is what they think fact i supposed to be they do not get an education about hat sex is right no one has the conversation with their kids hags this is what happens when you have sexes how long it should take this is what for play is and this is not normal this is the production this is a produced product that meant to arouse yo right and and to give you ideal an ejaculation are an orgasm right o no one has that discussions that then go to relationships lake i and my partner not react that woman did on the porno right or why did i not react that woman did on the porno a why did not he react ye when they would in porn because can i think females or watching porn's well deftly no i think i shall i think that a you raise of really critical point which at this shame can extend both ways and i think to that and that is a problem and and because it is excessive i think we need to have conversations that think it needs to be open we have to talk abut sex and that's what kind of why do what i do we have to have these conversations people know wat normals thank you for that i do think that a people need to know what normal is in what the range on normal is keeping the constraints that we talked about place earlier because i do think those are universal healthy constraint i consensual age appropriate contacts appropriate species appropriate or i to take a quickbreak and acknowledge our sponsor inside tractor inside tracks a

slash supermen to get twenty per cent off i asked whether or not imagined the pure imagination based arousal verses am visual arousal and for some people the sounds of of people having see is extremely arousing you ever lived in a major city new york with just wit summers in the you hear lot or more more often than you do in there is where people are living further bar you hear people having sex ya it is by it is part of the art of the auditory landscape yet you're very close together a but yet there is not exactly at least to my knowledge i do not know of the data that looks at fantasy verses visual horses auditory but i will say that you can get habituated to certain things and there is that data that maybe you can get habituated to watching a certain type of thing to get aroused and then normal things do not get you aroused right you may watch chronography and then you may have difficulty getting aroused or turned on when you see your partner a you may get used to castrating a certain way right if you use certain barrator stimulation or certain pressure sensation every single time you mastery you can get habituated to that and you may not be able to replicate that during penetrative intercourse a and i think that is really important and i think the take home as to try and vary what you are doing masturbation is fine healthy way of self exploration again with the cavity as long as you are not masturbating to access and avoiding your obligations are your family your partners your friends right the are just masturbating for the the benefits of maybe sleep improve went moodboostaying reduction in anxiety those tho those things are great and i think a with that beings that you just find it be thoughtful about varying tat one of the issues with masturbation have talked about when i was a guest on other podcast mailing the context of man masturbation and perhaps with pornography perhaps not is that it is pretty clear base on the it a surrounding a diction that any time there big increases in dopamine without a lot of effort required to generate that dopamine turning on pornography on the internet verses asking one out on a at going out on a day again but sing about going through the conversations and the making ritual that is the human making ritual that of course in the contacts of healthy interactions involves getting mutual consent and these kinds of things right that you could imagine how with without placing any moral judgment on it without shaming anybody you could imagine that if somebody exclusively masturbated and did not develop the skills of courtship and building healthy sexual relationships that pornography end or masturbation could start to create quoting u problems right whereby somebody only felt comfortable in those domains i think that is what ism hearing more and more about when it seems to be young men reach out absolutely and i think you are it is deftly the ease of access right but i think that is pervasive in the young society now you do not have to actually go and find a mate you can just go on an at and look for somebody right there is there is to anyone of finding in it man i was wined in the hero when a no smartphon printing and a no a my point as i think that were become very am connected to technology in our world which also means that we are having less conversations the younger generation is having less conversations and more on line conversations than i think that the sale that is to be developed as well and i think part of that is contributing to all this is won one thing that i can attest to is that i grew up in a community of mostly male friends have female friends always have am where a lot of what we learned about sex came from older my case guys my sister probably learned about sex from her female friends a and there was always that one guy who would just say stuff that years later i realize was incredibly misleading uneven just detrimental and i just wont to remind people that when you are on readmit or anywhere on the inner net and there is people saying things with certainty am they might be that guy ye right up an and am and if you look at the if i look at the long ark of those people that guy's life it it did not speak to a tremendous success in the domain for which they were asserting such confidence let me of it to that way of am it'd to slightly pivot to a different aspect to this conversation because it is just really critical which is the female sexual response this is something that am does not get enough discussion absolutely and there is a lot of stereotypes write the stereotype that we hereabout is oh they need more for play which can be true some cases is not true a the stereotype is that women are more a intimacy in relationship based in their sexual response that cannot be true i have female friends and have known women who also are just really interest in having sex for sex sake at times or maybe all the time a i think it'd to think that we are past the stage of human development where the stereotypes around this are a are fixed right and i an and we hear more about this than we see more about this now but what is the real deal around the female arousal response and then we ill talk about female organism response and there ism just going to you are more now that any time we say something a arousal or orgasm the remultible forms of that om then we will talk about the multiple forms of female organism yes if you talk about the responsesychle you can go back to the research of masters and johns and what they did this was way back one and they actually watched sex workers have sex and this was i guess he'll payback for music heat with men that they watched and to they took note of the the site the kind of the steps of the female arousal or sexual response and the first phase is excitement writ and during that phase your tartrate goes at your breathing little heavier there is the sex flash you can see redness and areas yet you knowing the volva in the breast men nipples and then you go to sort and that can last a variety of different times you'll also start seeing some lubrication vaginally right and then the plateau response is when that is kind of at its pique an a kin stays steady and then you reach organism and orgasm essentially is a response to the body where you will have again increased sympathetic response and you will have pelvic for muscle contractions which are rhythmic about point eight seconds or you are having a rhythmic public floor contraction along with the sensation of organism and then you will have your recovery period which you talk about briefly earlier which can have sort of a refractory time period at which point you can no longer orgasm again if you to or for men to obtain another erection again for a short period of time and that can be kind of an absolute refractory period where it is deafly not happening and than a relative refractory period where you need something more novel and exciting to then again resume that cyclic a coolish effect thetas effect before on this podcast it'll just cut people to it a a time stamp link in the shown o caption we do not go the down the path but one thing that is really important understand is that the college effect is present in both males and females meaning if a male ejaculates and am is of the feeling that they cannot have another erection for some period of time the presentation of a novel i guess we should say partner because we count be tong about homosexual relationship peed not just heterosexual but a a novel sexual partner female or male depending on their a their proclivities am can override the refractory period m and they can have another erection and ejaculation am similarly a female will have a poster gamic refractory period if they are am given an adequate stimulus r a something arousing enough they can am experience arouse orgasm again and we know based on really good pharmacology that this is a a dooming driven a thing the prolactin is essential establishing the refractory period in the dopamine is essentially overriding the refractory period fascinating her chemistry there a and speaks to the incredible extent to which the brain is controlling the genitals yet let me e we always stay unsexual medico that the brain is the most powerful organ for acts not not your genitals but the brain because it is powerful an ism not oh of fora touch on the later but of bring it up now there are some sensually acting medications now available for the after proof for free men of polo women with low limit t maybe hanthrow this out was the one that ism aware of a is a in that is often used in the a niche cultures a is milanacite simulating hormone in men on which gives people at hand makes them erect a milanacite smiling hormone at message comes from the medial petutarif ism not mistaken am one of those weird regions no reverence at but after but e ah but and people are now injecting this is a peptide in can cause rips i have not had that experience i never tried this am i musth but told that it it people are getting cavalier with it they can on lavishes a precise being enduring and perhaps even final erection is that true thou in price is a i reis is them a yo ts actually from iritis the green god who's often photographed with a really big erection while ism grand you to about that ego in a that a uts at roman roman a reek but y ma either we a it is an erection that last longer than four hours and it is actually a surgical or it is not a cervical but it is an actually an emergency if you have an erection that last longer than four hours in the absence of in o sexual arousal then it is important to get to an emergency from because at that point you construct developing decrease blood flow and ultimately changes to the actual tissues scarring fibrosis a its treaty important to actually go to the emerge whom do not wait cause your embarrassed a really get there and get treated however if ism not mistaken earlier you mention that it is exceedingly rare that people who take sales slash to dalafill we diagram for erections are getting true pripizme correct and it is mostly from a those injectuables we talked about earlier those intrcavernosal injections people can get prism from those a little bit more commonly and that something we always counselor and also certain medications trasidone a or if you have sickle selanemia those are the most common reasons that we see people coming and pitas don really o caiman refrain from my an desire o figure out that one i do not take us down a rabbit whole here si when not to get back to the names each there is actually in aft prove medication

quite effectively in increasing desire how long does it last about twenty four hours some people may be up to forty eight a as it i know men using a mletuside stimulating form on peptides el really wont to caution people a about obtaining gray market peptides sorry for this a a insertion here but a they are a lot of peptides available without a prescription on the internet they are almost all contaminated with something called l p sloppy jolly salaried which is not something you want to be injecting a lot overtime that is i say how we induce in a munrespont in animals in the laboratory a and it is amazing to me how many a websites are selling this stuff in it a arise to you easily you despite on the internet says not for humaner animal use in people are injecting it and a the olpsissue is something i think it is a puttetially get a shut down that whole market at some point but if you are interesting using a peptide you should be obtaining it by a prescription from a quality physician exactly in because we have bremilanatide we can prescribe that for men as well also sometimes will do it affable for men who are having delate ejaculation cause it will help them achieve orgasm a little bit better a and this is available for premenapasa women the other a medication that is available for low libido is called slabancrin also known is laddie is the brand name and that also works on sertinoge it is got kind of a mixed response serotonin and doplemenergic areas of the brain and essentially works as a daily medication taken before bedtime under telegrams a day that actually helps with decreasing hyperactive sexual desire disorder works in about sixforty five to sit e present i patience and you ne to take it for some time now both these that branny medications they are a little bit costly and some tempts i charms does not cover them but they are available i think very few people know about them and i think they really great and useful tools in the toolbox and these are for desire therefore yes the they re after a prove for what we call hypo active sexual desire disorder which is essentially lo libido that causes distress and bother i do not want to take us off course about a vaginal a lubrication arousal and we more orgasm but as long as we are talking about a arousal and am reduced ta arousal that requires treatment i have to ask this now any time we talk about a arousal and libido there is no b m i which by the way the bodymastindex is probably not the best a tool either a but there is no chart it is not a thermometer that says your ninety eight point six plustermine as too degrees your good if it is too high much higher than that you have a fever if much lower in that your hypothermic my understanding my i don't thing i eve understand but a my understanding is that one determines whether not their libido is normal high or low largely based on some intuitive understanding of what their partner or partners desire whether not they can meet those desires and if they sort of a a true enough of a sample size they date enough people where they have sexual interactions they can they figure out over time whether not they have a low medium or high sex drive an people tend to compare to how they felt in earlier years or at different times of the year or under different psychological conditions and stress conditions that kind of thing but we really do not have a bench mark for this right may we cannot say that am for instance that if i people are not desiring sex are thinking about sex with blank frequency that they have low libido right its sort of what is working ore not working for you in the contact of your life i that is a yet ta very god to think about there is no right or wrong a icy what your think there's no right or wrong among of libido there's many people who identified asexual and they're happy with that there are people who i to have see once a month and they are happy with that it really is a matter of distress are you bothered by it when we look at studies for female sexual dysfunction you can using validated questioner s that afar aft you can actually see that about forty percent of people qualify for having sexual dysfunction but really bother is only seen about twelve per cent and you can be bothered because your bothered you can be bothered cause your partner is bothered but it is really up to you right if you feel there's something that you want improve on than that is when you go see our doctor but there is no right or wrong answer bit this is very subjective and a lot of times will see couples who have miss match libidos not dos tot mean one persons right in one person is wrong no it just the matter if well how do you if you want it come to a point where you agree how do we get there and what is what is your uncle i leader will talk a a bit more about chemistry which i find infinitely fascinating because in my life experience have just been struck by the fact that occasionally you have a physical interaction with someone sometimes is not even physical interaction and they are just unbelievably arousing to you or somewhere between or sometimes it it just sort of are not there or just not there are that much or nobody likes to talk about this or it is there until you sleep together and then it is not there and this is all not just put on males this is put on females i i i hope she isn't kill me for saying this i know somebody who is a family member who once said sometimes you after realizing never want of sleep with somebody again by sleeping with them and here we are not talking bout dramatic experience right right si again that thiscusherman libido as you o apply point it doubt engaging what is healthy levels of lobe do not has a bought to do with what one self desires as well as the hopes and expectations of the people that we are sexually nvalledworth we will get back to that it later in the contact of chemistry cause i find it fascinating and it is something that is not talked about enough but thank you for that let us get back to female sexual arousal respondent nail physiologically what happens to the body is that prepares for penetration now that could be penis that could be a sexton that could be a digit finger a to be more specific it what it does is the service months up and out of the way that the inner one third two thorns of the vagina lengthens and a elongates to allow for penetration and it can actually double nearly double in size of that of the baseline basinal length and it is preparing for that if you and that is part of it in some people who have a painful intercourse it is because they have not had adequate time for arousal and there the penises penetrating before they have had those adaptations to occur and also the label open up to allow for that penetrations of these things t actually happen physio logically to allow for preparation while some people may be aroused and get to that point quicker some people do need a longer period of time of what as you described for play and not everyone is the same but thing its important to have that discussion with your partner and lubrication is one of the ways that people assess arousal but that is not the be all and all some people just make a lot of lubrication and some people do not and certainly that changes with age and harmony if a certainly we know that after men a pause with a drop in estrogen and testosterone you will see a decrease in lubrication and sometimes if people are on medications that can alter their hormonal access they may also see changes in lubrication after during blast feeding can see changes in lubrication and again this is not a they are not aroused necessarily this is a physiologic problem that they're having can we distinguish between arousal based lubrication the ay sexual arousal based lubrication a gain folks for give me for being hyper specificity language but there are other forms of arousal besides sexual arousal that a we know from it is not a pleasant topic from am reports of falling sexual assault that oftentimes a the victim is demonized for having been a lubricated and they will say well then people will presume that somehow they wanted that interaction and that is not true in those cases it is clear that those that the lubrication occurred independent of libido type arousal exact ora let us set that aside again unpleasant topic but one that is important to to attempt to flag or there forms of non libido type arousal lubrication that allow for non painful or even pleasureful penetration that are important to distinguish from the arousal base lubrication in other words i have to imagine am that women will half sex and it can be pleasureful ere t lease not painful and that might relate in some way to baseline levels of lubrication and here we have been talking bout lubrication a mailing the contacts of arousal o postmen apple reductions in lubrication but are there also postmen pool reductions in base line lubrication are some people's vision is just more lubricated at i must they at rest as the scientist in me om when am there sleep for instance i mean men are having erections in their sleep are women getting vaginal lubrication in their sleep periodically my guesses yes while they are deafly getting literal and an engorgement right they are getting clearly guardsmen there as been somestudies on that that they are also getting nocturnal to messes right just men do as far as lubrication that the data at least from what i understand is there is a protective maccanis them whereby women when when there is any sense that there may be penetration that their body will immediately start creating lubrication and that is protective to avoid you don't aroma and injury there is also baseline national discharge that is completely normal women will make physiologic discharge in fact in our examinations when we examine one will say normal physiologic discharge because we see it there is always discharge and it is a it can be up to five millibars and it is not a small amount it can happen e me quite a lot the name menstrual cycle dependent in terms of thou viscosity an yes it changes over the cycle and it can be different in color and different in thickness and that is completely normal and i think that is a real problem in the feminine hiding industry a you do not need to smell a certain way or or reduce that discharge this is completely normal healthy and you talked about chemistry and i know there is not a connate on this this animal ans right their sense that are coming from you which are actually attractive to a partner potentially and and in whatever physiologic know i do not know thiesknowledge ta at antis but there is that part of it see a there is a lot of marketing towards women that your dirty you should be smelling peaches or whatever that there is a lot of market a i may be this as generational thing but i learned early on ma think by behavior no since courses that vaginal lubrication were a part of the arousal response for both a these were always framed in the contacts of lateral sexual relationships but both partners lends in both partners a because is could be a homosexual female relationship toot we want make the conversation is brought as possible a and that the a odor what is just be frank here a the odor and the taste a played a role in both arousal but also the perabonding response that would establish future arousal and any one that is ever been in a a in a relationship that a what is my had healthy sexual a relations i to think is experience a remembering somebody smell er think about somebody smell and that itself to be very rousing yes partners even ism smelling of different articles of each others clothing not thing arousing this is the stuff of of real physiology we are not were not making the stuff all right but there is there is a lot of marketing towards women that they should use pushing or other things to clean themselves and it is it is damaging right it is actually one it can affect the vasa michrobiums o their pages changing and that can effect they are risk for this or facture vaganosis and a and and there there buying these spending their money on these things becausethey are being told that they are not clean and they come to the doctors thing oh i i think i have aseity but it is normal physiologic discharge a and i think it is important to say that this is normal and and it is normal to have an odor that is disdain to you and that there is of course if sure a fishy odor that may be a sign of a very strong new novel odor that was not there before that may be a sign of a actually transmitted in faction but if it is your general odor that you have always had that is normal whole about other infections east infections or bacterial infections of the got number of questions about michael plasma om infections which and we do not hear that often about but yes youyou can see if your discharge has changed an become more cottage cheese or there is a men it others symptoms itching a or discomfort then those are signs to go get a valuated a michael plasma's another infection that we see in the vagina but we also actually sometimes see in the earing and while it is not something we rottenly passed for when we have people who have symptoms of you are in attract infection and they are not improving sometimes the will check for michael plasma that could be causing sometimes in the eurethreadself a that a couple episodes about the gut michrobium i colly just in sonunbur et stamford is lovers directly above fermis expert about microfilm done a couple episodes about this and am he reminded me and i to remind people that a every mucosa lining of your body has a robot microbus that means intrenasal and true national entry urethral in a males and females am here is an anal microfilm there is a microfilm on your skin on your eyes am and you mention during an other a in other ways of i say quit ice cleaning it because that language falls in line with the idea that it is a good thing you are telling me it is it is it is a bad thing in many cases am because wiping out the microfilm what er some of the things that a females can do in order to a promote the health of their vaginal microfilm it is it is really our bodies are amazing the vagina is a self cleaning of in you do not have to do anything you just lot the vagina is a self cleaning a muckier no in to repeat that too often into ma different contacts went remember it forever you well you and the all you been to do is wash the hair bearing tries because those are the ones that great threat and and and should be cleaned but others an that let soapy water run down owning to do anything your body will take care of it itself when else five years old i pull my parents in the bathroom and i said they still talk about this i said i want to know everything about sax i wont know everything and they were all my got what are we dealing with and it'll never forget my dais look tat me he is argentine he said just remember cause of the one thing in life you cannot give back that is all i that was it that hat that was it o gash we you my discussion of my sons are my son my elder son has been much more graphic than that i tell it is a main well went you into the world e anyway a yo figured it out let us spend a few minutes or more talking about female orgasm one of the more cryptic topics on the internet not because it is not disgust but because i think that the new ants of it is not discussed often enough or in full depth let us take the time we need am to parse this i think that the simplest way to parse it is going to be from the anatomical standpoint literal organism verses called sea spot or penetration based organism but of course penetration based organism is also a bit of a misnomer because a there can be a literal stimulation by pelvic pressure or by digit pretty bout fingers as digits because we are both am in the medical slash science profession but which me at fingers here or something else right vibrator toy whatever am to for a depends on flexible you're i do not know but the point being am that i think the simplest way to go about this is going to be to talk about the distinction between literal organism and sea spot organism however those are achieved am and to also talk about this idea of gratedverses absolute o lasso axis has actual parallels to narrow science where we talk about communication between air on being grated meaning it is kind of e one level than a higher level than lower level ere all a non right am how shall i say this am it is clear in my life experience in observation that there are multiple kinds of female organism those that are grated and in some cases cumulative they sort of build towards a larger and larger organism and then there are what some people have described as cliff type organisms where there is a refractory period i think that is a fair way to frame this and clearly there are different responses to the organism response some people get sleepy some people get energized some people it heightens their desire for more some people they need a a a period of time in which am they become hyper sensitive to touch am a lots of different things going on there am psychologically physiologically am yet tell us all of it to in terms of orgasm mig i think it in point to distinguish that there is orgasm and the n there is different areas that you stimulate to achieve orgasm some people will stimulate the liters is probably the most reliable form of stimulation that will achieve orgasm and when you look at the data and again female sexual is function does not super robust but what we find is that about eighty five per scent of women require literal stimulation or to climax very few actually climax through just vaginal penetration alone and this is a real problem we are seeing on the media that you you have sacks and you penetrate and male women are having orgasms that is not the reality for a lot of women and in terms of stimulation wee talked about throughout this podcast the liters is the homologue of the penis or the pieces the homalogueof the clients however you want to say it i do not you forgetting it both direction deicers threw that one up yes a literal stimulating is just pen stimulation for women that is very reliable and there is a huge orgasm gap for men it is pretty consistent that when they have a first time sexual encounter ninety five percent of men are having an orgasm we look at first time sexual encounters for women with in heterosexual relationships it is about forty five to fifty per cent are having an orgasm and when you look at homosexual relationships of women it is again ninety per cent there is clearly some lacking in nine you per cent of om female homosexual interactions that a first time interactions ninety per cent or having orgasm correct is only because they understand the enemy of other by way of understand thenatemy of o there is a huge agasiology on psychology oh yes that is but the o there is a huge gap there and i think to to bring at home is that literal stimulation is the most reliable way and as you mentioned when your stimulating casually you are often the clients is a wishbone and it goes around the vagina and you are often stimulating those the cure is what we call the leg es i guess for lack of a better term of the liters and your stimulating that your also stimulating the clip the literal shaft which goes deep into the pelvis the g spot is a is an area as erogenous down where it is kind of the antre wall the vagina but two to three centimeters tin that is the location of these prior retral glands called the scene's glance and they are analogous or homologous to the male prostate just some men have prostate play and enjoy pleasure from prostate stimulation some women enjoy g spot stimulation now that's not universal right not all men enjoy prostate play and not all women are going to be aroused by g spot stimulation and i think there is a huge a huge variety of ways you can stimulate with stimulate any one it can be man or women some people will have orgasm through just nipple stimulation alone some will just here something or see something and be able to achieve an orgasm and it is it is varied from person to person and i think that the big take come from this for people listening is you have to talk to your partner and this is the harvesting we never learned how to talk about sex what do you what do you not and and do not take at personally right i think a lot of times people feel you half to orgasm to have pleasure which may not be the case for everybody a and if it is how do you prioritize that for your relationship on if i got off track there but that is kind of a i think the the take combs for this and also the vaginal penetration it is actually usually from cervical stimulation not necessarily vaginal because the large density of enervation the vagina is the first outer third of the vagina there the deeper two thirds of the gin has as much less innervation and yet there is such a thing as cervical organ and the service being further up t the vaginal canal a is cervical orgasm specifically the the stimulation anal a the foci of an orgasm that starts in the back of the vagina is a yes shots from stimulation of the cervix through whatever means trig an that can be pleasurable and w lead to orgasm and again orgasm is is defined differently red but the one thing we know is that there are pelvic for contractions which are measurable tat you can kind of tell that your partner is having an orgasm if you have a female partner because you can actually feel those contraction right whether it is on her digit or our organ or beltway supernurty question here am years ago when i worked on hormone bisexual differentiation of which by the way were done it episode the podcast on previously am a you know learn that the levator any muscle am is the muscle the controls erection and males and presume the a literal tomassinsand in an engorgement in females is there an equivalent muscle responsible for the orgasm response or is the contraction of the pelvic floor on part of a more general theme of a muscular contraction and a bunch of different of nerve roots contracting the reason i ask this is that eventually in this conversation were into migrate up toward the brain but because his is a science and health podcast when we talk about orgasm of course many people recognize that as their experience of it and the recognition of it in other people am and descriptions et camera but a are we talking about a response that originates at a folie am complicit a in the brain we talk abut a seizure bat you no starting at a focus of rosin then spreading out am or we talking about a bunch of different nerve roots and brain centers firing in synchrony and that is why some people experience it as behind their forehead and in their generals the are as a whole body response and e ere we are not telling about the flood of of narrow chemicals into the body ism told about during those moments of orgasm am what is happening naturally i mean it does have certain p well's to seizure i of does let me go back to your first part of the question which was a about orgasm and are erection and two lessons being lit the levator nice actually what happens during the reason you get in erection and presume we capitol stimulation the same ways blood flows into the erectile tissue and the tunic which is the outer layers of the of the sh of the erect tile tissue which are too easily cylindrical shape structures in the penis and in the clitoris they will fill with blood and to that tunic will compress veins on the outside to prevent old for from leaving sos not a muscular event is an actual blood flow event the downcome when we wanted to study erection behavior in romance we would om give them injections of tostostron females or male and observe changes in sexual behavior accordingly erection and literal tumescence all thous harder harder measure in riding there's a way of indirectly measuring that and then we would measure the size and weight of the levator any muscles as a redoubt of how indriternized that whole system was them well you know we have what is the role of later any in in the sexual rthelevator a i i think we earring when you an not i silly those muscles are part of the pelvic floor right and those contract when you when you climax right weather it is organism from male a female there contracting and their exercising wright there get that is how they would increase the their strength are their density om if you are measuring that through the actual climax of which you cannot see in roans right your kind of using as a credit in that way a that is what happens those muscles contract as a response and climax is a brain initiated of tan organism as a brain initiated event that is why to answer your second part you classy feel focal response but you also can feel a variety of responses us all come no from the brain it is not a kind of tithe a described it as a ripple a fact a it is more a it it is the way your body response in that particular stimuli and it is actually the ultimate form of mindfulness you cannot think of anything else when your organism in right it is you have this moment of clarity and and every and and everything you are very present in that moment and people will feel different stimulation depending on how there how they kind of how the sensor of their nerves are their sensations are not things that a his perhaps a good time to a mentioned opening we talks about a few times a earlier when talking about the arousal arc that starts with parts sympathetic sort of calm and then am move typically starts as calm and then moves to am the orgasm response we know that the organism response is associated with release of opening a and then prolactin which sets up the relative or absolute refractory pride the a the interesting thing and i got some questions about this is that am there is literature as i understand about the elevation in opening cause by say anta depressions well button bropriron which increases opening an group in efferent am people who recreational use drugs cocaine were other stimulants am people who take am lateral giants or other drugs that increase a levels of opening because i did hole episode about those drugs and they are different forms of amphetamine unless talk about riddle and which a slow different and i got a lot of questions about people who experience feeling a lot of a desire see arousal but not being able to achieve the a physical arousal erection or vaginal lubrication it is almost as if they are sitting further along that arousal art hence the importance i think of a people learning g to have calm a states of mind when going into sexual interactions now i realize that in saying that it might be confusing because a lot of people think we that this anything but calm right sexual royals anything but calm but maintaining enough calm that they can a ride that ark a for whatever duration is appropriate for that interaction in them rivers again when we shurraily get back to this a some people will have sex for long druids of time some for shorter periods of time and here people do not really know what other people are doing except by way of pornographic and self report and discussion am is it the case that drugs that increase opening can inhibit the sexual response do they tend to promote the sexual response because i also mentioned earlier there is a growing trend of people taking by way of prescription of course from a physician am combined able morphine which is a dopaminergic drug a with to dallafill which is a a pity five inhibitor its can increase blood flow and ism hearing about men and women but mainly men doing this ramen up their opening a camping up their blood flow to their genitals in order to have presume we more arousal in sex does it make sense an a yes o as a mechanism yes in terms of aril margin a the that has been study and its bully been approved outside of the united states we do not use it very often here in the unitestates that has not been aft approved a but it is a very complex response i mention that a flabancer and which is essentially acting that occasion it actually has not only a inhibitory and not only stimuli try but all wen history of facts on dopa means o the way it sort of works to enhance interest or libido its sort of complex and kind of confusing when it was actually approved it was it was being studied for an anti represent and what they found was that women were actually having lee no better a interest in acts a more interest in actions of that kind of how it was disco very similarly vagary was actually studied for high blood pressure and when they went to am it was horrible blood assure medication but then the people the men who took it actually did not return the samples but the study they realized that clue what is going on here and it was because they were having better erection is it true that a at some neurology meeting that the first am description of biagara's treatment for a mortals function involved the speaker actually coming out from behind the podium and revealing his erection is that a true story yes i do not think it was agar i think it was not nitric cavernosal injection now i think he came you a it is the truth rather is actually a publish are it'll send it to you you can share it if he liked in metralest tat a it'll read the article there is a published article about people who were attending at the meeting and yes he came out and at the time it was mostly man in neurology but there were spouses i guess in the audience which is not typical now but a there were women in the audience and he came out with the philoneraction to show that it he now in fact well i suppose at the neurology meeting am or we whin meeting where a one comes out in reveals her a insane of vaginal lubrication than will have a we have a gender in sex balance at the meetings on neurology am be interesting to attend one of thus some day am differences in arousal as a function of stage of the menstrual cycle really interested in this i did along episode on fertility and we are going to have a few other i v f experts a fertility experts on the pad cast am but clearly am there are differences in hormones across he menstrual cycle we know that for shore ye am clearly there can be psychological variation according to those foremost were truly other things across the menstrual cycle and it is always an imperfect experiment because we are not laboratory rats and people are having different interactions across the menstrual cycle is there any known am correlation between a desire and stage the menstrual cycle there is some obvious a assumptions that one might making a prior t ovulation et camera around the time of oblation a but what about the other direction to a is there category of women that are very interested in sects at certain stages of the menstrual cycle and then not at all interesting sects an other stages the menstrual cycle we know that all that i dated the have heard and maybe a gan closes could speak more on this they study those variations a little better but there is data to suggest that libido does increase prior to ovulation and during ovulation anting it the couple days prior because that is the optimal time for fertility yes there is dated to suggest that in terms of completely a lack of interests i do not believe there sat but ism not a natter is there evidence tot females who perhaps have not experienced clue g spot orgasm cervical organism can learn to do that and i always find it interesting that whenever there is the discussion about different forms of female organism a people are careful to point out that many women do not have penetration based organism and then they separate out literal stimulation as more a more common rout to organism but of course there can be literal stimulation with penetration absolutely right and a depending on the physical arrangement a there can be literal stimulation purely by way of penetration through pelvic contact am fingers et camera yes or ho how do we how shoal we think about this how shall we talk about it there was an interesting study that i just had recently where they gave women words for these things right tho a the there is the rocking stimulation that can also stimulates the meeting that the you are penetrating but there a rocking motion that can also penetrate the litter is there is a stimulation of just the outer part of the vagina which again as they me chin the gspoght is there it is more highly innervated o that can be more stimulating there is also wags to a lying yourself that when your penetrating your putting pressure on the liters and then there is stimulation with actual stimulation of the clip intentional stimulation either by yourself or by the partner and there are audible different ways to do that right a and there i think that it is important to really a kind of exit cay to explore and not always be a home run and i think that is when you get into relationship where you're maybe second there fourth time having intercourse with some one that you can try and explore these different things or if the partner themselves knows what they to actually tell the other partner it there is a huge part of communication that i think it is plays a huge rolled in this because we know ourselves better the any one else the you can tell your partner what you and i think tat that we have never been taught how to do that yet a such important conversations for many reasons as you point out a defile not something they teach people in school except soon they might say something about communication is important and that almost always circles back to the the keyword things we talk about earlier which is you know consent and age appropriate a contacts appropriate these kinds of things an a and obviously substances alcohol and other drugs can strongly confound to those issues and that is well just leave that as as a kind of an obvious one a as all were talking about communication on sexual interactions a perhaps it would be useful to people to cultivate a a language or a nomenclature there too to facilitate that a some of the language that have heard that is a quite useful as things a youknow people have different arousal templets right some people certain ideas ore stimulating to them and other ideas are aversive to them and then there is this category an between were sometimes people sort of either do not know cause they have not tried it or have not thought about it or there sort of curious but kind of unsure or it might work in the right contact but maybe not all the time is there any kind of structure that is been put out there as a way to improve communication around sexual inter actions ye i mean there is no script but i think in general you want to have the conversation outside of the bedroom not right before sex a right after sex because that leads to you know a sense of in security for the other person mi i do something wrong and something go wrong here you want a kind of move those to a neutral location kitchen table in the car whatever somewhere where sexes not and happen am at least for that particular moment and a m e yo listening a some challenging conversations on this pod gust challenge it a previously challenging because you try to get things clear an it as clear as possible an this one's challenging because they're many soviets everything right we on for ye won sex in car you right get or they did when i was growing up a and sometimes they still do o get please continue yes that is one and then too when you are discussing it i mean this is kind of goes for any difficult conversation is you make i statements right you that i it when this i do not it with this it is not something you did right tat you did not do this you did not do that makes the kind of an animosity sort of situation and then i think also part of it is being open about those things than it made it is not can to happen in one conversation i think that is the hard part tee you think your going to have a conversations gan to go great and things are going to be better it is on be multiple conversations and some of them are not going to go well right a that is another place where you can actually get the help of a sax therapists and there is a website for that it is a s c t a cent dot or where you can look for a sax therapist near you and you can even do those things virtually a and that can be really helpful when you are having difficulty having a conversation ye i think again such important conversations and then when people a differ in terms of their level of experience it gets am but the actually problematic but all it can be potentially educational and then of course there the twists in turns that occur with when one is asking about somebody ease's arousal templet oftentimes you will learn things about people's sexual past and that can be either neutral stimulating or aversive right that can open up all sorts of other issues relates to the psychological interlace there is no way we can pars all of those now i just think it is worth highlighting that it is understandable why those conversations are challenging and it also is understanding why pornography is not g invade those conversations it right imply conversations there are between a your brain your hands in your eyes in a rear sum a not can holiday in particular order other i want a switch gear slightly u an talk about but is i got a lot of questions about yournaretract infections let us make it blade to both females and males because yes males get your inaretract infections females get them more females asked about your retract infections how common are they should they always be treated with antibiotics is crambiary really a good treatment if for their other things that are better is it beat to the acidity or alkalinity how does one prevent getting duties can get them from swimming should you ternate after sex tells about youths and how not to get them and how to get rid of happy tell outsize are very common in women a only up to fifty per cent if women get at least one outta in their lifetime and up to a third of them get recurrent duties and what that means as they have two or more in six months or three or more in a year now this i common and we will see a lot of it and it is not as a until your having recurrent you get the natures have one year or you have one every few years it is not a huge issue in men however outsize are much lest common and that is because the earethreat ens longer there is last a entry from the outside world into the flatter which causes infections and a the when men would a tides concerning is a man getting the ut but others multiple reasons that it could happen but it should be investigated that you can make sure there is no anatomic abnormality a functional abnormality with the flatter that is causing the uses in terms of prevention a there are kind of major things are headed in the outlines that we all we all talk about one is my ration making sure your drinking about truth three leaders of fluid ideally water a day a dilution is the solution to the pollution wrist drinking more fluids is going to get that bacteria and yogin a p it out can help keep not let is sit around the flatter very often another thing in women who have altered states of estrogen whether its postmenapozzle surgical a menopause or may be have a produced estrogen for postpartum or other reasons or that about turn the icon half of the minstrel sickle were not necessarily for those specific people but for those specific times but cause its pretty short lived a guess you could use it but a is is vaginal estrogen vaginal estrogen meaning estrin ta supplied in the vagina either through a cream a suppository or a ring is is highly effective in reducing the occurrence of recurrent ut es and this is because when you have low estrogen the station the vagina goes up and the station of gang goes up because there is less conversion of glakagen to lady bacilli and then those lacdobasilla are preventative for uses essentially you want a reduced the pe back to its normal acidic p h and vaginal estrin is very effective at doing that in fact and our clinics will actually check of vaginal p g to see if there is an indication that their page is too high that may be they do need vagal strong particular on the perry menaces was hard to tell just by looking if they are really a heading into lower estrogens state sometimes and that is very verieffective and very very safe when you look at estrogen the the woman's health initiative way back when sort of made a big stink about how estrogens laid to cancer however a vaginal estrogen has never ever been a reported breast cancer dean cancer or any other blood clot any other adverse event associate with vaginal estrogen you can get some breast tenderness some discharge those things can occur a but the absorbed amount vaginally is little that your estrogen level barely goes up it does not even reach premed puzzle level just goes up very slightly in the bloodstream not enough to crate any sort of abnormality vaginal western is extremely safe and it is pretty affordable you can actually use coupons if your insurance does not cover it through a goodarax or marcuban's fantasy and get it very very affordably and it is very effective it does take about three months to work you need have to be consistent you plied about twice a week at night sometimes three times a week a and it is its very effective the ring you put in once n at last for three months but gently speaking that is the most effective option for low estrogen states other kind of simple things are trying to make sure your completely emptying your better over a lifetime people can develop some mild pelvic lords functionary not enough to create pain or discomfort but maybe there not emptying completely right because maybe they used to hold their earn for long periods of time when they were did or may be there always hovering over the relics that on a sit on it at work and over time that can crate a little bit of mild this function which can make it more difficult to completely empty the blade and when yearn is sitting in the latter for long periods of time it is basically food for bacteria to grow and back there grows and then you get current you ti making sure you have complete empty by sitting relaxing on the toilet sometimes leading forward and they maybe going a second time standing up sitting back down going again and even for men sometimes trying to sit and see if you completely empty cause sometimes standing you are not able to empty completely well the lot of menargan the just the else you it was fun to research for the suppesode because m there entire discussions on credit about i what percentage of man sit while your eating of minor shinning base on having visited many man bathrooms in my lifetime in just being in the world a the that i assumed that men stood up in order to to urinate but therefore a decent percentage men to down you there are an in fact s very country and probably the reason its become more interesting lately my mediatory a certain country was recently surveyed thing was germany abut essentially is recently picked up by the media that german sit more often to p and that people always as better for me to sit to pour standup and there is a whole big discussion on the media but the reason being is when your sitting your public floor is most relaxed and if your having any issues emptying your body you are going a p better also if you have an enlarge prosy which i am sure in a talk about pro post enlargement that can sometimes allow you to develop a little but more in abdominal pressure cause your sitting and you can lean forward to overcome sort of a blockage and and there are some s some indications were sitting is better but if your being fine in your standing that is fine to i don my you have to i thing is just something that you knowing other countries they do more and here we do not and tot don't thing it is right or wrong it just depends on your individual circumstance kin a spermicides or condoms or both on increase the frequency of you takes for a females spermicides absolutely spermicide if your condom has firmicin or your using spermicides that is a known risk factor for you times other things i want o touch on you did ask about cranberry cranberry's actually in the america your logical association guide lines for prevention of r current you times and women now how does cranberry work right do i to string chose it is actually a specific active ingredient in the can berry which is called pro author sianadens or p cs and i nowt they have actually looked at the amount of p cs you need in what formulations wo you thirty six telegrams of p cs in a soluble form lot of the supplements on the market will say that there thirty six telegrams of p cs but there the whole berry the using the the skin of the berry and the stem of the berry and that is not gat a help you you need to make sure that the supplement using is a soluble form of the can bare in it actually very very effective at reducing the risk of you time should you mean am capsule a joke a a yet it is a capsule an that you take once a day and there is some although not as much data that if you are having them around secs which some women do always have post coddle you times a that you can take two on the day of sex and two on the day after and that may be helpful but there is not a lot of data there but certainly adoption that you can try that is pretty low risk a that is kind of the the guide lines now there is a tun of other things that you can do to help prevent that are kind of available and have some data behind them d man's is one of them we take a about two grams of day of d man's and you drink it in that actually helps reduce you t iris it is e studying the small random controlled trial to be effective and a and those are kind of the bigger ones there is other things that people use robotics but there is a lot of heterogeneity as in robotics and what to take and are they really effective vaginally a in the flora there those are kind of the big things and there is a lacturall lot of microfilm study and you t ice going on act at you see a la a we are the looking at the microfilm of people who are more at risk for you t is or even over a to later other conditions that in the try to figure out is there something here that we can target or that we can figure out is is causing probes because sometimes we just cannot figure out wives happening a in terms of wiping from front to back and swimming and being after sacks there is no good data and any of those things a wiping from front to back i think it does create a little bit of shame it is not a big deal if you wipe back to run as long as you are not as long as you have cleaned yourself to speaks i think a it is last of an issue wolerturnu is o you referring to any contamination from an a any bacteria round the a yean a lot of women who have current duties tend to come and feel very dirty thine there is something wrong with them go i wash all the time ism really clean a really this and it is not something they are doing it is probably a micro bum of fact or a hormonal of fact or yore there is something going on that we need to investigate further it could also being anatomical or functional problem were you are to emptying the latter correctly the as lots of different factors it could ben it is very infrequent i would that have never seen a patient whose dirty and not the reason o can duties a perhaps even the opposite is true the cleaning too much based on what you told us away ye and there eliminating the got micro excuse me just rolls off the tongue how again no pone intended am perhaps it is the they are abolishing the local microbus on the skin too much cleaning eliminates the microbus on the skin it that we do not want a wash we am when soninburg was a guest on this podcast he said she kids can develop a very healthy microbus an general microbus oftentimes by sorry parents not washing their hands before eating if they have been playing with soil outside or did a little bit of that as actually healthy pets actually offer microbus support this is weird i know it sounds i readout we have to imagine how we have all does a species was not with antibacterial sand alcohol swabs everywhere and a noisy we do not want infections ut overleaping can destruct the microbus which presumably can lead to outs perhaps some one who is cleaning excessively is more at risk than somebody is cleaning a little lass absolutely and actually the cleaning can irritate the dermisrihts at you can actually gate contact or time typed symptoms from over cleaning and that is one of the you no things for that i i deafly have a tide defy have one will know you do not but there is a host of other things that it could be one of them could be that another very common one that we already touch on is panic fluorides function very often pelvic flordisfuntion just like you had pain with tarnation women can also develop pain with tarnation that does not go away and it can start where they hate you t i that trigger the pelvic floor and then the panic lords did not relax that the pain distrigger the panic for the tents up and did not relax because again were not taught how to relax our pelvic floor and a and then they have developed panic lords function wise duty note going awarewise that keep coming back and that is another common thing that we see in people who have quartan quit recurrent times but do not really have them to be clear i experience the pain in urination as a consequence of trying those dam key wiles five everyone going but stopping that was in formative in two directions one it relieve the pain very quickly these good the other was a i realize that it is possible to have a pelvic floor that is neither a hyper contracted or over relaxed in some cases just not doing anything for it is to is the best circumstance right and the only reason i mention that is because am obviously this discussion is not about my pelvic floor this discussion is about fact that some people perhaps need to clean lass some people maybe more but probably not base on what you said some people might see to strengthen their pubic floor some people might need to am relax their public floor an some people's pubic floor is probably a o k i any discussion about u anything medical or you especially hormone stuff this happens along the discussions around that get into it seems with with male every male now seems to wonder if their testosterone is too low not the ones that are blasting testosterone cause they know successively his u and as you point out earlier at least intros bisexual function that is unlikely to be the case may i less o desire but on button terms of a genital base arousal function and i mean you have talked about tosacteral lot on the pod casts ism sure your audience knows very well the multitude of benefits for testator i think there is value in assessing harmony panels and amassing your level of free tesastron testosterone and assessing if your having sinters are not always sexual right it can be depression it can be weightgain that you are not gaining a muscle mass a you can have cognitive changes those things can still be a sign of lo tostaterna and very valuable and important to assess that reminds me of another thing that we get back to a outcast what to about kinneystones but am have heard of women using a small amount of testastron cream directly on the liters as a way to amplify the maybe it is the a desire andarousal effect or perhaps just one or the other have the way that we discuss testaceronuws in there are consenseof statements and there is a action abundance of data on tostatrone use particular postmen puzzle women for low libido or low sexual desire and it is all been very positive inciter's been increased a sexual desire base on value questionary increased number of sexually satisfying events with testastron use now the range of testacernan women is about a tenth of the the amount of tosaterna man needs right testator an cream is systemically absorbed wherever you apply it and the way we generally recommend women to tried us if they are having low liked when we have ruled out other issues that may be psychological bin a relationship other issues that can a feclabeto medications here is a lot of things obviously that go into that but if we set and we have checked their tesacernat appears to be low for physiologic levels for women whishing an as one tenth of the male level then we can actually prescribe awfullabl testosterone and the guide lines or the nonsense of statements are not a true guidelines but they recommend using transdermal testator and getting drew tell tubes from the farmesey and putting a tenth of one tube on the back of the calve or the upper outer buddy hairless area a for absorption that can improve desire over all and then the other place we use testastrodeas in women who have of what we call vestibulodinia to the vestibule is the area outside the vagina which is very hormonally active there is lots of antigen receptors there and it can actually when you have hormonal issues meaning lower testastrode and aster in that area it can cause pain and actually applying a combined or compound estrogen testastron cream to that area over time can reduce that pain and discomfort as to lesson receptors or wanders an receptors all over the body very much in the generals very much in the brain and their very useful to a very useful place to treat women for those issues thank you gidneyston't hop do never have one i to ye do not either people get them a how do you've weld getting them in how you get rid of kidneystones a very often or they a they can beer a writing toprometabolic disorders right it can be one dehydration is of very common cause of it a dehydration combined with may be a slight metabolic abnormality where your creating more calcium or oxalate in your marine can result in a in kidneystones and how can you prevent them i an i each person is individual if you get kidney stone typically we do with call the twenty for hour earn analysis plus some blood work to assess what is the metabolic abnormality we can target that either with diet or with medication and the can of general recommendations for people who have kidney stones one is increases your fluid an take to two tor three years again the same number i told you before you want a decrease your oxalate intake nefhugugle ox lag and find millionthings that you eat that have oxalate in them but the big ones are spinal and bar a we seeing a lot of nuts too that are eating people eating lot more nuts to get more proline u no cutting back it is impossible to get rid of all of that in your debut having a spinner salad every day while switch it a different green wright do not eats finale everyday a also you want it increase your citrate and tie that an inhibiter of kidneystone formation increasing fruits and a and things that to increase citrate vegetables as well actually ane easily accessible thing is crystal light it has a high a citrate compositions the you can drink crystal light with that to three leaders and that can be helpful a you want a decrease your proline intake high levels of a a burins ore eugenic meats red meats and things can also put you at higher risk these are run of the general sort of preventative measures we talk about for kidneystones a if you have a kidneystone a lot of dispeople can have kidneystones and their kidneys they are not creating any proms their tiny we can observe them over time if they start coming if they star going very large or they are starting to move into the writers of the tubes that train the kidney often times they are their companies with pain quite a bit of pain a and it can be very uncomfortable in those cases a we can if they are not having any infection symptoms thing there is no signs of a urinary tract in faction o there is no fevers no chills we can treat it conservatively with pain medication and also under our medications fall makers you use for a enlarge proceed as well that act you relaxes the you readerall smooth muscle to allow the stone to passage but better a if you are having an infection you got go treated right away you can get very sick very quickly in fact a have seen young healthy patients they are peatier than me walk in the in the car with a kidneystone and within twenty four hours there in the icy because they are really sick because of a kidneystone but of slumbered your an idea a a tea colored yourancs of the meaning blood in the ran yet all of those are important warning since that you ideally do not get to yet blood in the earn i mean does not always mean infection at could just be irritation from the stone but certainly feverous chills or you have a sign of it infection and the stone looks its blocking if you get imaging an you see was called hydro or throws or pressure behind the kidney and your you have these signs of infection we do not want a wait because you can get sick pretty quickly u and then once a to treat the kitty monsters three major options one is shockwave another is you reader copy where we go in with a camera we have small leave or we a break it up into small pieces and dears o the camera inserted through the u death correct your sleep under anestese us you do not have to other get i saw the winds and then a percutan as naferaless atomy which is done if you have a large kidney stone or a very hard kidney stone that is up in the kidney you can go in through the back with a small a small incision and with a specialized camera that goes in and us ultrasound a less o trip the to break up that stone and kind of suck it out that way s ore extremely helpful bits of information not even bits the sir a this is enormous amount of useful information i to pig it again for sake of bread we cannot go into extreme depths on everything wat appreciate your willingness t to follow this caramel with me oral contraception previously on this pat cast i hosted a female physician gesso who offered both sides of female oral contraception discuss some of the benefits discuss some of the risks i made the decision to post eclipse about both on the intrinette an wow wow wow was i surprised but also frankly a bit shocked and then finally intrigued why how polarize the discussion is around female oral contraception am end female contraception in general severing a nor plant am the pill proud category of things there but for sake a discussion the pill et camera it seemed that approximately fifty percent of responses which seem to come mainly from women were of the this stuff is terrible it ruined my life it ruins lives it destroys you it has immense am risk and then the other half seemed to say know there is reduce risk of certain forms of cervical cancer am this has allowed me a the obsecual choices in life style that i prefer without risk of pregnancy i mean it was astonishing to the point where i thought won if only i could postpostclip simultaneously am obviously i do not know what the answer is a but i do know that this is among the more polarizing topics available for discussion am what is the story meaning what or the data about oral contraception why much controversy and wants the real deal here yes it is a very polarizing topic and there is abundant data abundidated that we eveintoto study and again this is a not high quality evidence but we looked at credit threads and we looked at sexual disjunctions to the the low habit de organ difficulties and we red hundreds of threads and we did a qualities anal infect in female to fee what ore people talking about and problems with oral contraceptives and ant he depressants leading to low habit and and being very as you described very this ruined my life was very comment and that the theory is that taking oral contraceptives increase lives the amount of see harm one binding globular which binds testosterone and estrogen and that actually makes testastera unless available which is as we have talked about a very important harmony for desire and in some subset of people their seeing they significant consequences of taking oral contraceptives now i think that there is we do not know which women are going to have this problem and we do not know how it is probably a very small subset of people but we do know that this does happen and that when you measure as the beg levels there up and that even after they stopped or all contraceptives you will see elevated as e beg levels from base line real for at least four months afterwards you will still see elevate esaebegy level we do not know but not infinite we do not know and and yenendecanc pagans weird because it it we assume everything is a short term of felt but there is some pastose in the system because it is a narrow indicrentaem yet i thin gather some narrow plasticity there that occurs as well and we do see this and i think that the other side of this ye apply oral contents are amazing right there their helpful for sexual freedoms for for preventing pregnancy for you know for a lot of things and particularly other conditions too pitiless and and other problems or all contraceptives are amazing and they have changed gynecology in management of these women for and in a very positive way and i think yes i do think that there is oral contraceptive related sexual dysfunction usually logos estrogen a sort of contraceptives are the culprit abut i think that it is it is again the data female sectuasmec leisure is just not as robust as man sexual dysfunction literature i saw a lot of comments about how or contraception head let to depressive symptoms u or just con adonis u apathy not just low lower habit i can imagine how that would be the case through the elevate secs honor n biding globular which is you preventing to saucer an estrogen from in free i literally i and exerting their effects on notjust the body but the brain but is there any evidence that or contraception can destruct no transmitters ism not aware of any i do not think not to my knowledge a well it sounds to me or contraception for women us where we normally her about it it sounds there is a varied response and it is highly individual i certainly had partners that love the pill or at least in seem to mind it have had some that hated it and no way try that never will or just went with other forms of contraception or whatever reason were not using contraception it seems to me that there is a lot of variation out there how does one explore that without risk of permanent damage it sounds truly permanent damages unlikely u in won are the other options a yo know is the ring a copper mud oh no any sort of long acting hormonal contraceptive were seen i we that is what we consultations on as if their having issues with oil contraceptives even if they come with pelvic pain and their honor contractors it'll tell them you now what just stop because maybe the even the fact of on the and an receptors a yesterday receptors is effecting the lubrication either things were not sure but you an't you stop in go get a long acting contraceptive method i can mud li can't and us a mud safe and here i should probably ay look a copper and is one form yuorn'ta mention a few of the other form no i do not describe i us but generally speaking their very safe of course there is risk with any sort of it is a the precedes your inserting and i up their s obviously some small risks associated with it but it is safe and effective form of contraception if people are wondering why the copper mud is an effective form of a contraception a copper r is a the third rail for sperm as i understand it much that am i was able to find some evidence for this in the medical text books that a in the old days as i say a prostitutes who wanted to avoid a pregnancy would put copper pennies in their virgin really i know i do not recommend that anyhow and a please and am i do not think it is a fool proof form of of a contraception a but there is evidence at that a an it happens which is amazing that means that people somehow figured out the copper sperm relationship which is not a good one for the sperm and a deduced from that a behavior ye that we does trending suggest if you'll do the hiding is just an interesting medical factoid a i can tell you one move on from the chic we will a before discussing prostate an anal sex not stated next to one another for any particular reason i want to talk about escessorise a lot of people over the last twenty thirty years have been prescribed selective baritone and retaken visitors and other antidopressence am that have disrupted their sexual function or their sexual desire n seems in particular a do you see a lot of the senior client you hereabout it a what can people do about it a you oftentimes these sexual a arousal or dysfunction issues associated with essessorise another medications make those medications prohibitive and people in a theratone an is kind of the anti to organ them and in fact we will use escessariyes awfully both for people who are having premature ejaculation it delays ejaculation and then there is also other sexual disjunctions we see with it and it does happen absolutes dose dependent ain some cases when some one comes in with escessari related disjunct ton if they are doing well you can either try to reduce the nose or switch them to a a other ante to present for example hell outran that does not have such severe effects on sexual function a and you can also use seals and vagary you have tut while we have talked about forget totes function as an addition if we cannot change their medication management because anis gets a little bit complicated because we know ere tells function depression or very in her related now what is causing what and what where do we maybe somebody went to see their dilator for depression was also having issue it directions and now what you if you fix the erections you help with the depression what i means to say everywhere shouting o i think i think that there's a lot of discussant has to be had their as a lot easier to talk yourprimary care doctor about depression than it is about your erections and i think it is important t really dig into that a little bit but yes there it is definitely a known thing we use it to our advantage when needed and a and it can be helpful to to switch medications or reduce theses you mentioned earlier the trasidone can cause a sustained erection a and is trasidone in the category of a touching the ceremony and transmission system i do not remember the mechanism but interestingly trasidone is also used for off label as a third or fourth line for premature ejaculation as well am i i do not remember the the mechanism off hint let us talk about prostrate an prostrate health earlier i chewed up that a there is a growing attend toward i exerting more progressive a malphysicians a or physicians wretreatmeils excuse me a thanks a prescribing low dose to point five to five telegram seals which is to falafel which may assist with directions but it the rational for this l o dose daily loosens not centered around directions person it is really about u prostrate health improving what flow to the prostrate reducing prostrates u an even reducing the probability of prostate cancer u what other sorts of things are you encouraging men to think about men thinking about their prostrate yet before i forget i want i mention that logos todalafil is actually a treatment for e reptile this function fact it works quite well particularly men who are having a lot of psychogenic issues one because it do have to remember to take a pill before sex it is always on board and your taking five telegrams every day and it has a thirty six hour half life over eat of your kind of increasing those it can actually work quite well and is a great option for a reptile this functions i do to make that caviar a in terms of prostrate health it has been shown to be a active for b p show enlarge prostrate this is a very common condition in fact if you look at autopsy studies eighty percent of men at eighty have an enlarge prostate that git is very very common now does every one get symptoms and what is the long term concerns of it and what can you do about it typically as the prostate enlarges it is wright around the retreats a walnut shaped glance it is underneath the bladder around the urethra and it can narrow the urethrae the tube and over time you can imagine if your i always give this example if your sucking from a straw wrist your drinking from a straw if you have a wide diameter straw it is really easy to drink if your straw gets really narrowlike sat you take a coffee straw hen you drink out of that it is very difficult to drink very similarly it can become very difficult to karate if you have an enlarged prostrate now what causes enlarge prostrate there is a whole whose of factors low them genetics if your father grandfather had a large prostrate your probably more likely to have an enlarge prostrate u do we know exactly how to prevent that not exactly but we know how to mediate the symptom s a little bit the other symptoms you will see before you have difficulty yearning is sometimes you will see over activity you will see a your clatters responding to having to push hard against that narrow your recharged push here and out it is having more urgent we the sudden desire to go the bathroom that you cannot delay your may be going more frequently and very often you are going more often at night and those re kind of the first signs people will see and then over find it may become more and more difficult to empty the better you might see some hesitance you are waiting for your stream to start or it stops and starts a and those in organs that cannot empty that cuts not a to drips or a very weak stream and those are kind of the things that can happen over a lifetime now what what are some things that you can do to help a seals helps relax those those the fibrous smooth muscle the protects that allows yearn to pass more easily there is also other medications that you can treat very often flow mass a or other ala blockers are helpful in that area a in terms of things that you can do in general for later health prostate health there certain things tare irritants to that area and what i tell people and not every one's affected the same way i do not want people that be oh i got a stop all these delicious things that eat and drink but certainly it can be useful to just pay attention if you say you drink coffee every day and you find your self bring the bathroom ma lot if you limit your kine and take you might see that you are not going to bathonplayis often because fine is a flatter irritant that can be coffee tea chocolate things of that nature that have canine in them energy drink some as you will forget they have kine in them a and limiting that may improve your symptoms a alcohol also is a later irritant and these have actual been setting n animal models you will see that the flatter contracts more often when they are given these sorts of substances a and it is dose dependent and some people can actually habituate or get used to a certain dose of fine s if you are drinking coffee every day you may have less symptom than some one who drinks at every once in a while am other things can be a sometimes carbonated beverages spicy foods or a civic foods those sorts of things can also irritate the blaming o sometimes limiting those things may be helpful in those situations thank you much that is very informative em years ago there was discussion about em bicycle seat causing damage to the prostrate maybe en sexual this function em the still a thing i thought they put graves into the the seats but have also in reading on the internet i can't do a deep dive on readmit but em seems i women are reporting some flattering continents from excessive bicycle seat use maybe even e exercise bike does not have to be owe by yes this is at great points cycling if you think about at rat your sitting on your uranium which is that space for men between the scrotum and the anas for voting the vagina and the ones and right there runs your pudenda artery in your pudenda nerve which are again responsible for bloodflow and nerve function to the area the most common things we seen people who are am who are really high volume cycles now the studies have looked at a maybe they dost three hand r fifty kilometer race for they there know biking three times the week for sixty meets but there is no consistency but their seeing pretty high rates of genital numbness up to fifty per cent and also in men erectile this function in women you will also see numbers but because sensation is ta big part of arousal you will also see kind of decreased lubrication may be decreased arousal as well in women and how can you prevent that the reason is because when your sitting particularly your leading forward competitive bikers yo were aero writing you are putting pressure on the the beak of the bicycle seat and that is where most of that is not your weights not distributed evenly the goal is to take a bike seat that allows you to sit comfortably on your issue to velocities and postures a huge part of your public so i no we did not talk about that earlier but sitting with good posture and not a kind of slouching or leaning forward can actually really do wonders for your pelvic far focussing on postures helpful but also when biking pleasures hell they have actually looked at the date on they found that people who arrow ride meaning lean forward a are people who use narrow bike feats are more likely to have issues and you want to get kind of a noiseless see and a wider seat the the cut outs actually when they looked at kind of mechanics of the cut outs they will see higher pressure around the opening is actually not good to have a a bike with a cut out a bikes with a cut out because they have seen at least with some of the cut outs that the pressure action becomes higher on the credits right around it very important point a i do not cycle i do not the exercise by somethonra the salt bike for whit has the big seat the a for a few minutes but am i of wont at one of one thing because i think that down at make people not cycle i think it is really valuable cycling is a great erotic exercise has lots of benefit for aardvark their health but a there was actually another study that looked at people who were parts of sports clubs they were swimmers runners and and and cycles and they looked at rates of dysfunction and they found that actually the rate of erectile this function was not different between runners swimmers and cycler maybe because those other says were just looking at cycles that may be it is just the general rate of erectile this function in that population at that point in time i do not the numbness is daffy an issue the erectile this function maybe maybe not yous serve a couple of more questions for you and bodily you've been incredibly generous with you a time and in to an't here have really appreciated r sure listeners to is well analyses you recently did a post describing the multiple reasons why women do or do not have anal secs yes it very interesting post very interesting study the at covert yet and you a explained it very clearly ism guessing there are relatively few but perhaps some other studies as well about this let us talk about no secs and i maybe if you could just offer some of the the keybllet points that you learn from the literature from your clinical practice u how frequent is it i with protection without protection how safe is it what are the different reasons people do it m that might seem a kind of a silly question but it turns out when it comes to this topic its the enacting datayeum educate us sell anal sects let us talk about it well when you when you talk about anal sects the reason people it become more and more common lets say it is more and more heterosexual couples are during that we know that a male homosexual couples are having anal sects and i think the one thing is that it is safe in terms of pregnancy it you are not going tho get pregnant from anal secs which is one of the reasons people do engage in anal sects you think thus the reason people are doing it more frequently no i think that one of the reasons that people one of the reasonbut a in general a the issue with anal secs is that people forget to use protection a condemn for example because secureathons men in sections are actually more likely with anal sects than they are with vaginal penetrative intercourse because the anal tissue is very thin and friable when you penetrate the anas particularly if you have any drama a you can have you know you can have bloodless and that bloodless can then easily more easily transmit sexual to the men in section it is really important to use a condemn and use adequate lubrication the anis does not make any of its indigenous lubrication you have to use lubricant the other interesting thing about anal sex is that the anis p we is different from the vaginal peace you want to use specific lubricant that our is smoulder to anal peach you wannabe to look a anal lubricants and we could talk about lubricant but generally there is water based silicone based oil base lubricant water based are the most easily accessible a silicone based a a little more slippery and last little longer and oil based also last longer but are not good for ease with condemns definably using lubricant and always can of making sure to a b in the context of course of being congenital but also never force always take your time and an those things a really important to avoid drama because drama can happen and usually it is not severe drama writ s not going create longlasting problems but it is inconvenient uncomfortable probably where not seeing as much of it because they're not coming to the emerge of their having issues unless it is really serious a i think it is really important one to prevent from a sexuich as reinfections to to be thoughtful and cautious and sometimes it requires some preparation if we gent of penetrate in anas it is good of futon ancona start with it a large girth item you get a start with something smaller and can work your way up a and then i think ultimately why people have anal sex as i mention earlier the prostate is highly enervated and can be a source of pleasure some people enjoy that particular men may enjoy anal penetration women as well make enjoy anal penetration because of the enervation around their the pelvic floor a and that is certainly reasonable to do as far as we people engage in anal sex sometimes it is because as i mention their trinal avoid vaginal penetration either to avoid pregnancy or maybe a you menstruation or other reasons a sometimes it is because people want to do something spec sal with their partner they feel this is my special thing with this partner that i do with them and it may be something kind of a gift or something that sometimes it is almost they feel they a they have to and this particular study i look at there's actually not a lot of studies on we people engage in angel sex and this particular study that had talked about on my channel a manstergam with a talking about why they they specifically read drug users and a lot of people had used drugs prior to using to engaging in a sex and i think that that is not ideal you always want to be kind of in the right state of mined for consent and a and safety purposes and i those were coming common reasons what about infection not relate to actually transmitted infection my presumption is there is a higher rest with anal sex than there is with other other forget you visual intercourse work sex et camera a what is there evidence for that a not necessarily it is more about secures has been an infections more than anything else is rare you can sometimes sing the rare things that people have kind of comment on anal in continents temporarily or things like that very rare a mostly it is it is just actually oh has been infections because you cannot have more it is more easy to create leading threat sex if you are not careful and ore people doing animals before final see to prevent rectorial infection or secjust it's at con of some people are some people are not i think it is people are making sure they are evacuated fully a there is some media articles about what you should eat before to kind of keep your gut healthy and avoid kind of loose stools and things that a but generally speaking there is there is lots of things you can look up to make it safe and healthy and ism sure some people listening to this and their maybe they have turned it off all right a and i think we can expect a varied response to discussion but it is happening after thaapparently with a increasing n frequency yean i do not know if that is because of the increasing availability of pornography where it is visualized more or if a i really know i but we do know that there is more going on in had our sexual couples and fire as a final category of question a i was really interested in some of the posts you have done about herbs and supplements in the context of sexual desire in sexual function am on this podcast i always say always always a we emphasize behavior of tools first dos and do not because we of the foundation of mental health physical health and performance in u a in all contacts a there is of course a roll for prescription drugs sometimes oftentimes people cannot do the things and avoid that certain things they want to because of depressive states anxious states veteran prescription drugs can serve a roll but i do believe the goal is always a behaviors first then of course things adequate sleep nutrition healthy social interaction all of that stuff i exercise but we do often talk about supplements am because they represent a i think in important category of never the counter compounds that can play a roll an a have talked before about tongaali this indonesia herb i think it can be halation as well but this intonation a erbistypically the one that a i aware a works best for a mild libido enhancement m sometimes a especially the case of people taking escessorise a it can enhance libido to override some of the a challenges with assessor i induce production in libido and generally even if people are n on ourascessorise i hear from people who take tongaali and get a libido increases also things mack rude which we do not really know how these things work exactly probably some freeing up of testosterone tongadali maybe some quarters all suppression as well a maybe some estrogen receptormodulation with mockarout may be some dopomanurget tone changes am schilagy not this vatic ferbam which there is at least one study a that i think its done well that am shows increases in ephasapholical stimulating hormone with a schilagy use what your thought somethings tongaale mocha rule silage am how he that your patients about this stuff yes i think that a you i see least my patient population is still in the behavioral management place right a the biggest cause of sexual this function whether it is low tasastra an reptile dis function sexual dis function is often comorbidities right managing high blood pressure managing dies with diet which you talk about a lot but the best study died the mediterranean diet at least in in the sexual dysfunction literature exercise doing both party of vascular erotic exercise but also doing resistance training particularly large muscle groups a and and then a really working on reducing blood pressure and and preventing dibedies and those things i think are really demand i know we taught you talk about them all on this pod cast but i will tell you that when people are getting ready for for example we do a surgery for erect is function can final prosthesis this is end of the line nothing's working they cannot get n erection at all and it can be o and and they may have diabetes as a cause of it when we say you do you have to get your human global a one see below a certain level to do surgery i cannot tell you how quickly these men change their behaviors forsake of erection for sake of erections i think that really if i can say one thing before you do a supplement that i do not have a problem with i think that it is reasonable to try the a i would try one at a time to see what is working and you are not ting a bunch of things and not knowing what exactly working and realizing that they are not k an a work immediately if you take something that works immediately it is probably got a pity five inhibitor mixed in there and it is been a kind of filed over time and your neck changes over time but i would say that the number one thing that i recommend for people is improving their diet exercising getting good sleep as you known bus tastastron and even you know you mention this all the time but getting early morning like but it is it is beneficial for testastern as well because your rely helping released hastason with the circadian biology i think that those things that i cannot stars enough how valuable they are and if your smoking quit smoking it will kill your erection cabin and vain no and then lastly if you are developing true organic impotence being that there is a a biologic problem that is causing your sexual dysfunction then it is really important to get your cardie vascular health assessed because about fifteen percent of men who develop e reptile this function seven years later will have a carry of vascular vat it is the canary the coal mine meaning that it is the sign that you may be developing carry of vascular probe are endothelia dysfunction that is first presenting in the penis or in their sexual organs and we know this probably is the same for women we just do not have the data yet i know a good number of women that take tongue all in part i think on the recommendation although i wont declare i never recommended it it is an offer of something that people could try if they are doing everything else correctly in ritacess em with consulting your physician of course em and they to some of them have a reported improvements in libido in desires the most some yet and the trilogy is less known about the em distinguishing quality verses low quality sources of silage is harder dosing is hard it comes as this tar typicantypically em maybe more science on shields you we come out the next few years we could em get get behind it a bet an or right now's short upon the ya maybe if you are an adventure you might try it but ism not a it is not one that i normally throw to the top of the list i think that els the trade is is pretty good outta conduct for trust production which also has implications for sexual function and ton badly has reasonable data a i think there youknow there is reasonable data n these things i think the were that you talk about all the time examine dot come is a great place to look at that a and i as tike as ti think it is reasonable their smaller studies there not a there is by is in many takes but there therein not the there is effort dot in this around there's never gan to be a really high qualities thence no one can really find that i think is i think our expectations in to been tempered when it comes to that stay we rent doctor rollick i won i thank you ever much a for this discussion to day

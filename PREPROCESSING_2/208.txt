fourth of the scene that is out there but still the frame from do hands to describe her own feeling about how it is going was this what can it she take off some of the many many who's tical challenges they faced figure out which facilities could deliver the most shots and he to staff and schedule and track hundreds of houses of people getting scene they a recreate scheduling software and figure out

where were all get our scene is going to depend on these we mystical details and how well they are managed to day in our programmed we see just how common this is we have other stories of this happening scarce my sources that need to go to somebody and how the end of getting allocated whether those researches are place to stay for the night for love and companionship being redistributed in all kinds of new ways since the pandemic but be easy chico it is this america life ism er glass stay with us a on god committee we starve this example of a very pure situation a people have being given the difficult task of trying to figure out how to distribute something important in fact in this case life saving medicine the deciding basically who will live or die and the very idealistic solution they came up with holy sollivan tells story pul start as you miexpet wit the medical break through back in nineteen sixty a doctor name bending scriber had a nation a young man with kidney problems there was something doctor stripper had no way to treat we had to send the guy home to his family to die the case haunted doctor stripper one night he woke a at for am with an idea a way he could have saved that man a typhoon too that could be stitched into the blood vessels of the arm an stay in planted there it made long term dialysis possible for the first time they would pulled the blood out of some one's body clean it the way kidney does and put it back in people called to a medical miracle and artificial organ that could cheat death there was a problem though the machine they came up with is big and complicated they built it from a seers to buck freezer that they would modified with a bunch of other parts nurses called the machine the monster because it was big and unhealthy an every patient needed to spend dozens of hours each week connected to it and only five of these machines existed this is one experimental sages they only take care of a few people and therefore thousands of people dying from kidney failure every year in the count try on one hand a miracle on the other doctor scriber had treated one harrowing problem a medical one for an equally herring ethical problem had do you choose which few to save and which thousands would die doctor scribers or to getting flooded with requests from people desperate to be put on the machine the pressure was crushing hin saying no was ensuring a persons death he went to the administrators who were helping to oversee this whole project unasked for help the administrators took it from there the first thing the administrators society is what this is not a medical decision at all this is a society of decision they decided to assemble a group of people they chose these people not because the people had any medical knowledge or really any relevant experience at all these were ordinary people hand pick to represent a cross section of moral america society we o me will iron her i warmer this is from a documentary from nineteen sixty five i y beer ism a half why i am a pardon the money atone booster coming o merle ma on mono ply o poon cimemacin the committed was strict about unanimity the document are their heads are darkens we cannot see their faces these people had just been going about their lives when the dialyses centers administrators asked them to come in one of the people in the group a young minister toldthem it was not for can to chose who would live and die the doctor said we are not asking you to decide who will die this is all ready determent we are asking you to help decide who will be given the opportunity of extended life the minister agree to do it they all did a few of them said it would be too cruel to force this responsibility on to some one else officially they were called the admissions and policies committee of the seat artificial kidney center at sweetish hospital but a lot people called them the god committed wat the time again this is in nineteen sixty there was no blue print for this the doctors gave them no guide lines the committee considered first come first serve or drawing stars but they been told to use their consciences they came up with set of principles and rules the first rules were clear cut the treatment was in little they'd only look at applicants who lived in washington state washington taxpayers were funding the research they also decided no one over forty five there could be medical complications a d those people had at least had a shot at life and no one under eighteen the treatment was physically in a emotionally demanding no one knew how it might affect kids but those rules only got them far they decided they would base their final selection on something else social worth they tried to save the person whose death would most hurt society they made a list of the factors they would way marital status number of dependents income that worth to pay for the treatment sax education occupation a emotional stability pass performance future potential and personal references they made a policy of never meeting any of the candidates an person or even knowing their names because denying a person you would met face to face seemed too hard they once let a journalist come see how they made one of these decisions they just had a meeting where the doctors had presented them with five obligations and the committee could only pic two they walk the journalist through how they made that choice traders create for her the conversation they just had here is a transcript of their discussion banker just to get the ball rolling why do not we start with number one the housewife from lallawalla surgeon this patient could not commute for the treatment from aurally she would have to find away to move her family to settle banker exactly my point it says here that our husband has no funds to make such a move lawyer then are you proposing we eliminate this candidate on the grounds that she could not possibly accept treatment if it were offered minister how can we compare a family situation of two children such as this woman in wallawalla wit the family of six children such as patient umber four the air craft worker this is something they talk about a lot have one candidate has one kid and the other is two should you pick the candidate with two kids they go round and round try to answer a question that has no answer labor leader for the children sake we have got a reckon with the surviving parents opportunity to remarry and a woman with three children has a better chance to find a new husband then a very young widow with six children surgeon how can we possibly be sure of that how the rest of you feel about number three the small business man with three children ism impress that his doctor took special pains to mention that this man is active in churchwort this is an indication to me of character and moral strength housewife would just certainly help him conform to the demands of the treatment lawyer it would also help them to endure a lingering death housewife if we still looking for the men at the highest potential of service to society i think we must consider that the chemists and the account have the finest educational back grounds of all five candidates in the end the people they chose were mostly men white and well off people them which seems inevitable given the criteria they would come up with the select for what they called social worth education future potential income the treatment cost about fifteen thousand dollars a year that would be about a hundred and thirty thousand dollars to day and it often was not covered by insurance they would written all these rules to try to be fair but they would created an outcome that was anything but sometimes when you try to guess your own bitches you come up with the very incomplete list in a letter the minister row a few years later he talked about how he would been extra careful to guard against his own braces and not favor people who were good church members the later on he worried that he might have gone too far they unfairly hard on religious people the final thoughts were always made by consensus they said that gave them some comfort o but o a w the with a we we a car a for but comity a ut e to chop a i for to major as for to find many recordings of doctor scriber ut i found an oral history recorded decades after all this happened were he talked about the god committee this was wily critics afterward the power just in a word was you were face was a morale sol as all all right o course it was affair at all but the was the best we could do inter doctor scribbler y to he talked to these patients constantly he could not have the distance of the god committee had a actor few of his patients they ell said he was a really carrying doctor there was one patient he particularly liked a patient whose experience sundered up changing everything for dialysis and for the god committee she is a tea name girl named caroling a doctor mum sudan she had a study personal she as a very happy happy happy girl a very likable one oh a well rounded i would to say on how did that doctor scriber liked caroling much i sot of instinctive is a mother you at the feeling for if somebody to keep er not carline is fifteen i get student scoutleader tot piano when she was sick the aglets would carrier up and down the stairs at school get som her youthscrup at church o don't blood when carbine's kidney started to fail doctor scriber submitted her case to the committee even though he knew the rule no one under eighteen did he tell you when he put caroling in front of the committee did that it was going on ah did i know what was going no no i did not know until after the fact that that is what he had don oh i didn't know there was a committee ta hose who lives in dies and act she was turn down but was that for you oh i can remember the conversation i just know i was totally silence oh trying i guess to absorb what was being said i do not know how you ho put into words the feeling you behave when you deliberated best sentence that your the pard of you dies no i you just everything stops in is still does when i think about his the matter far were you ever angry that the committee down just i that she it an't lest water or now really me may have their rules and regulations no where you may have a hundred people in can only take too you pretty much after no after stick by the rules doctor sinner did not see at that way doctor scanner was n tat content with that decision he thought he had a good case and it pleaded it well an i i really thought he he felt that his to hortswud go long with hin he was a highly respected man and i do not think he was used to having anybody say now to him doctor stripper tried to find away he told the committee all treat her on my own time nights and weekend just let me use the machines they said no he could not accept it he had another idea something he would been thinking about for a while a smaller machine one that someone could take into their house and run themselves without any medical staff it was no wean me ready to be tested in that where we locked out and that he was tin to whatever it took to keep her round instill that machine was ready he called the guide who helped an build the dialysis machine an engineer named alert bad he told i about caroling said do think we could make this she only has four months alert asked doctor scrimper will not the committee get mat they ere going around them doctor scrimper said no this has nothing to do with them it'll get other funding the engineer one to help his halting dit they we n technically supposed they we at the university and there was was t we working on something else but they work non stop to do t they decided not to help the university concerned the give would shut it down some one on the thine would actually to dean watch as they called it to ping an eye out for the dean and warning their team over the inner come if they saw him in the lab they put their designs and sketches on sliding kennels when the gene entered the building they quickly switched the panels around to hide their work on the machine to get around the god committee doctor scrimper set at up independently as he research project caroling would use the dial's machine at home sudan would run the whole thing it was presented to us as being a strictly family manner to see if a family could run it correct i believe it miss fray seven night can lame non professional people a soon the row of engineer and nearest can lay people be trained the engineers finished the new machine in four months and rushed it to carbine's house and august of nineteen sixty four sudan learned how to do what before had only been done in a hospital run the machine that would remove her daughter's blood from her body wash it and feed it backing through her arm excepts happening in the basemen of her house an e special room they set up for caroling i would put her on the machine usually between six and seven o'clock at night and that would mean taking her off after nine or ten hours i it was early early morning and then she would u staying bed may be for an hour in any breakfast before went back to school and you take her off round three or four yam so you would wake up in the middle of the night and oh i was awake on night o your only ta way and night our machines as experimental lily our alarms were going off all the time and then we have to i sure at wat was wrong with it a constant problem was that her blood but clot and clog the little too the little chant the doctor stripper had invented and carbine's arm i would have to get out stern and saying in a strange and in block the clot if it is uncloudable now that was very painful for her in it hurt me you know to pain her that way rush if i mean you had to get the blood flowing again in i had a alternative but to do that o that was probably a our biggest hurdle was just keeping her blood moving were you ever worried that you would get something wrong o sure sir a sir sir me prince when somas life is in your hands i men lest when i fell her life is in my hands i was always aware of it some could go wrong but it i better not let it happen the after concentrate no do everything just right is she was at she was sick and tat i think my feeling was i i hope she feels better after this is she was sick and in just a few weeks caroling felt better oh yet she did her i sparkle an she was talk at oven i felt this is a beginning of a new chapter in or life how did doctor scriber do how did he feel when he saw that it was working o of course he was just jubilant oh he was just grinning for me to ere this research project was supposed to take three years to show whether or not home dialysis could be a viable treatment but within one year doctors agreed this would work this is what they would do sudan kept dialyzes in caroling in caroling kept getting better she graduated high squall start to college tut dialysis is a treatment not a cure and was still experimental person's veins and arteries would often scar over and stop excepting the treatment as the doctors had said it was a chance that extended life in carbine's case that met for more years am she used up liver a fusible a brains an arteries and am there having a very difficult time a putting round dialysis i that during the time she was in the hospital that is two or three weeks i think i would dialyzer there is best i could a fir wear may be as little as an hour before the blood it an am and then it she just acuminated lily ism sorry a she was an intense of care in the hospital and she died at night when i had had gone home ah we knew a that she must not gin a command of it am but s i guess i was is prepared is anybody could be a join it am knowing that we had done everything cold an it the not o mine is we would left to o we for all the rest of these people in the not only our country but in the world that a that have that can live because of foot we piled meet after sudan and caroling show the home dialysis could work doctor scriber immediately put dozens of patients on home dialysis people around the world started building these machines it got cheaper and with way more access to dialysis they no longer needed a committee to played the god committee story now it seem as a dark moment an medical history here actually point to it as the birth of bioethics we had to invent an entire field to deal with these questions we have agreed that having people not on who makes the cut to liver to die was a bad idea although the truth is we vote on life an get decisions all the time to from a greater distance deciding things who gods health insurance but where the best hospitals go with in a pandemic to make all the difference decide the things a lot e just do not use the words god committee it is easier that way thilyselleng one oft pieces of u show she iran brukitch the coming that stop that if house back she was ninety one after her bought er caroling die spend the rest of her life teaching people hat a lives to family numbers the oaf to winter's pone s when it comes to who love that of course's not seed by panel f experts somewhere wench decide for ourselves who would to be with whole of our producers on a baker has noticed the way people are deciding on that siding wen who makes the cut who get's first date it becomes part of the life in a much bigger way in jerk city wise kids shes all that is changewaywy have you heard about finding your winter i had not either apparently it is a thing single people in new york have been doing since bovid basically over the summer and fall people started scrambling to find some one anyone before winter in a second locked down back in august completely oblivious to this phenomenon i went on a date with a guy we met on hinge the dating a our first date we would spent six feet apart in a park for a second date we met at an outdoor restaurant it was going well we would just put in our order when he said what do we do about hinge what o you mean i mean do i leave my profile why would you smaller your profile because ism met this really great girl and ism totally into her i hot is it me yes of course i was compute it'd had to pull up hinge right before the date to remind me of his name and he was ready to be exclusive i am not new to at this does in happen straighten in new york city rarely want relationships the whole game is to stay single at best you get invited into their harem one of three or four people their sleeping with no one ever wants to eliminate the possibility of other options quickly but then it is kept happening it'd go on dates and everyone wanted to have road trip style marathon bonding sessions that lasted hours longer than usual they wanted to see me again they sent me flowers they even help hand this was my first time back in the game for a while it'd taken a break from dating for nearly a year i gone through a bad brick up i left town for a while did sintharapy meditated and now back on the scene i felt ripen winkle waking up to a world where men suddenly wanted commitment i went on ten dates of them nine wanted to keep seeing me by comparison three years ago when i was last single i went on thirty five dates of them two wanted to keep seeing me i thought did i get hot all those months of work on myself had really paid off i told this all to my friend home did i get hot did you get hot he could not stop laughing you idiot it is covet that is when home explained about people trying to find their winter a friend of a friend named christie a single woman in her fifties told me in her experience it is not settle we know one or two men has said o me winter's coming and ism really hoping to the somewhat to spend the winter wit they set that another person i take to else twenty two said she recognize what was happening early because she used to see in chico every winter before temperatures dropped to below zero and going outside was a non starter pop l would rush to couple up she said everyone called at cuffing season as in handcuffs i was out i was causing is guy casually and we were out one night and on we're sitting down at the car you of talking and yo was o by the way were together right and i was of my at you do not know me no and it hone hunt t the exclusively with you and by the end of the night you gone home with some one else a finally i was it was musical chairs he as trying to sit down in my chair and i sud know and you found another open chair and yours done and it was ad your great cuffingses in and ism sure out relationship ended by this big by the time people were going out again kelly says now it is loved cuffing season we are living in a for ever winter bur supposed to stay in dating multiple people is reckless people are settling she told me one room made of hers and it up with a girl who would not normally be in to around thanksgiving and then another one laugh and is now living in a ran and comrade with a next boy friend that she does not want a at but i think she did not on him for you and you her mere new york that an extreme cuff a destination cut ben it i guess you would think o be nice after all these years of rejection guy's being into me right off the bat or being tested a miss you hours after meeting but here is the problem of what they are doing projecting building up an entire fantasy based on barely knowing some one that is my thing you cannot take my thing one time i ti i much after meeting him once that i spend a week imagining all the dates we go on together including one where we got stoned and bought crazy on spontaneously and colored in coloring books by the time we went out again it'd been on many imaginary dates with him my bring genuinely did not know the difference between real life and what it'd pretended we done but only one person can do that at a time otherwise you are both two into a way too soon and that is bringing delusion to delusion an cancels the whole thing out now i feel ism on the other side of the equation ism watching people try to find their winter i am watching what i used to do and how disturbing it must have been i get we thirty three out of thirty five men passed on me it is off putting i told kelly it's this new world of musical chairs we living in but the real question is do you me to chair have just really this i do not i did much rather use be dancing around and not of a chair i i sit on it i chair an ism sometimes he got to sit on a chair sometimes don a silly care it it is an uncomfortable chair you are getting more miserable in the chair than not in a chair id ha a i do not now i had this omega i was getting out of the subway that was getting out of the sub way and this guy approached me and meet a mask on and he was excuse me can ask you a question and i thought for shrwsgin to ask directions i said at and he was a i i i just bought a farm up state and ism a growing my own locally source produce and ism looking for a girl to get in a relationship that i can bring up sone is this something had the interested in oh my a and i i was you a given my number have interested i li i what is happening to the world is is this truly the end of days also cause ism used to guys using i were in fine answer i have for neural stability using things til i i real me in but never crops no one has ever said and i got some cry t of but it is totally us using use the species he's i have fresh air in la a capital a now tat is told er its total capital ray now i get that its hard to be alone but this level of desperation is a bet much he was a step away from saying i have a van two shock guns an a can ass get in we can make it at least two weeks before the snake's catch up to us when really all were in danger of his watching netflicks alone ti thought i could enemy this way but as i talk to people i admired the single minded practicality of some of these new yorkers my friend mocha is a psychologist she says people suffer when their isolated people need to be touched she went looking for a winter to preserve her mental well being she is not deceiving anyone she is clear about what she is looking for a warm body which doesn't sound very romantic for the fillip that is can were that when i map in this moment she you just want somebody for how long ell i tell how a van i in you are totally fine with it being some one that you would not normally be attracted to or want to spent time wit all ism having to come into the and having a serious standards would you say that you are pick si guess i use to me pick i had my case i had my list that how to be checked off money in the bay good credit also a gentlemanand a has the same vision as me i were a line and we both want to build in community and you don clothes e racial weld cap what er e be a blip black black power couple used to have a my on my life din profit i would just say looking for the baroctoma nickel that is all i would put some one i standard was baron mama ye but but broke with nickel because nickel smarter than him better than him and he values that yet she pushes him to greatness and now now all if you can hold conversation you do not you are not overtly an asshole and you are smart enough i yet even these new lower standards were not low enough she match for the guyuik kids which is usually a deal breaker for her and was a quote film maker which is another deal breaker because she feels film maker is a job everyone in new york claims but she agreed to a first state he told her he baker a pie she was expecting an entire pie he just brought a piece he would eaten the rest but she was willing to overlook it i was you could even tell me that your filmclenuncle hopes into that whatever i listen to your stories bad an old panting darn gemot learning whatever ism willing but for their second date he insisted on coming over she kept pushing for an out door restaurant when he said no she counter with how about coffee finally he confessed he would spent all his money on thanksgiving dinner and he could not afford it she is still seeking a winter most people i talk to were in as pragmatic as mica if anything he's been kind of stunning seeing people who were players before covet suddenly questioning their life choices and wanting families or at least real love my friend an who used to be more of amimia of all the people i saw searching for a winter i was most surprised by him when en is single which he usually is he is prolific he would as he put it order men on acts to come to his apartment you order food on seamless he validates women but the pandemic broke him something about being alone all those months during the first lock down you k an't help it if you are we the end of fight club with a the world falling down around this you better grab on to some one's hand or else you going to go through it alone being would bike through the abandoned city it was empty he laid in the middle of filament one afternoon it felt a apocalyptic being alone it changed him when he was stating before they were always in limited options always some one better when you stop seeing everyone is an option you cannot help but stirtseing peoples throne for better worse dramatic the shift totally were living in a very dramatic time when things get when it stern to get dark to pig you enjoys to be i alone now alone in the darkness now it'd rather have some one next to me we will figured out later being alone also changed christie she is us to being superbly she is a successful heater person she has took kids her es in her would traded off week to week and she go from having a full house to being completely alone she lives facing a highway and for the first time ever there was no traffic sound and i can remember of woke for more or farm slow and just my tad and and sorry within or there with some bale with r i con halls ans or i cold just just hard an o on be beth or or for fall an you i eventually farnesol to frame o i i did to i about a teddybare she got a in a corn and rated in a baby blanket christie and been they're not looking for some one to win her with till they get their rack scene they want to find the person they want love i think the guides have been dating during cover looking for that too i think they genuinely believe they have found it in me our minds comply tricks on us when we need a break from reality the guy who told me had a vision of the woman who e wanted to be with a month before meeting me and that when i walked up to in in the park for the first time he recognizes me because i was literally in the woman of his drain here the guy dated for a week who told me i was the one and that he never felt a connection this powerful these are lovely men every one of them i think i do not actually know them adown ta baker is one of the paces of our grams coming to working a hot line we help people who are in desperate need realizing doing one of the cause that you recognize the voice of one of the collars that is in a minute the cogabubagratio when our programmed continues is me on from our recast to days programmed making the cut in the stiffical moment that we are all living through with a pandemic in the economy the way it is we have stories of people who need stuff and how decided who is going to get the stuff they need we have arrived to at three of our programmed a three reluctant pure cats when production kat mangle start to put together a series on homelessness for the pot cast ninety nine per cents visible she learned that if your home is in the bakery a the first thing that everyone tells you is to call this hot line two one one that is how you get access to shelter or housing she is forward here about this hot line all the time for people who were experiencing homelessness they usually when people mentioned it they were frustrated they would say i called the number it did not help i did not get anything and she wondered what is going on here over the past few months says spent of time with the two one one operators as it took calls and it turns out whether you get access to certain kinds of help depends exactly how homeless you are consider to be not everybody makes e cut here is cate ruschana robins used to answer to one one calls from a small office about half way between open and sanhosay now because of covet she takes the calls from her dining room table if there is time between calls she moves around the house a humming bird prepping food for dinner proof freezing her daughters homework doing sit ups to on one is a crisis hotline for people in need since covet they have been getting more calls than usual from people were hungry or need helping bills or rent the operators can refer them to programs that might be able to offer assistance i thought to a home one or the other day for almost an hour losing her home that to some one else that on a day car losing it may lose your house said she losing her mine devastating devastating calls now lot more work non stop it'll me to countless well non how can help you the most common reason people call both before and after the pandemic is homelessness to on one can fine callers a shelter bed for the night if there are beds available often there is not on a good day they may have four or five to offer this in a county whether at least eight thousand people homeless on any given nip one wine before callers seeking something more permanent longer termhousing lion there is not much of that either but to on one can help get callers on a list maybe o it all depends on how they answer one question and where o outlet first day last night here ruschauna is screening a caller to see if she qualifies as literally homeless you are literally homeless according to the county guidelines if last night you slept in a shelter or in some place not meant for human habitation a ten or a car they last but the caller she is been couch serving for the past few weeks and last night she tells her shwa shes slept in a motel pay for by your sell or yes the caller says paid for by herself for house but that is not the answer rochana needs she cannot forward her on to the next step to get longer termhousing the welcome li this technicality what does and does not qualify some one for housing it is upsetting to the callers it is upsetting to ruschana too she thinks about it even when she is not at work i go we ma don old we your my sister in union city that won else six that is always all time of bastion over there i she this family going in there must see them packing all he is that three or four kids rah and it is lit oh they are homeless but they cannot get help that is fact up ntheiser kind people that will call me and i say cannot help you cause she is stay he own last night that and i that side sidle now i hear you is fill you i know your homeless an not saying you are not but it'll me ta county guy line these are the stipulations callers meet the definition of literal homelessness they can go into the system and be put on the list there they get ranked by how needy they are the people considered most in need might get housing in two or three months but a lot of people just language at the bottom of the list never get anything and end up calling to one one again it can be a maddening cycle and sometimes people get exasperate it that the yellow rushawna she tries to listen not take et personally and move on to the next caller not get too attached but every once in a while a caller will stick with rushawna long after she hangs up have heard her recall name o folk she talk two months ago and in canary of last year she how a call she still thinks about the many the give e finality to cay will on an a you e ism cable a be to county with the per all i ere the caller sounded familiar to rushawna she said she and her son were homeless and looking for help and bike you i i

one number what yer name e my i ten o in my at e now rushing knows why the voice sounds familiar and you can hear her take it in the person she was talking to was her cousin the two had not seen each other in a long time and her cousin did not seem to realize she was talking to rshawna o a one moment she puts her cousin on hold and turns to her to workers fuck this is my cousin she tells them when she gets back on the call she seems not to know what to say at all she is lost the script completely a hey i finally she recovers a bit d makes her way through the screaming questions and be any friend the county i exit wo rushing once to tell her cousin at her ut there deep in the call and she does not know how to say it she sticks to the script at it is now nine minutes into the call and she is finish with the screaming interview i o ka to you have been department cut be bitterly homeward a i have me county i lie you haven to cane to you bitterly homewit rushaunna tells her cousin that since she is literally homeless she can pass her through to the next step she might eventually get some help and in the meantime there is one space available in a shelter in skin that she could go to right away a ti ell i e ti at ere i wont her wait a the or it the the pin it the the in i you we a er am finally rushawna finds the words tit the piny tiny as rushawnas nickname the the i on er ti the ball the it not your mat o me at rig now one i e fer t an o bat e o to happen i y but i get to pick en be for the wort at it o i it i we i i and for the next few minutes the two cousins catch up a little both alluding in vague ways to difficult and complicated family history yet say a be her it men i not i no i talked i i fer the i get get better for you a i tat e be you no year you we me you o be a go literate it i the way to do it a me i tatter may shut is not the only to one one operator to know some one who became homeless nearly all the operators who work for alee to county to one one or women of collar and homelessness is disproportionately affecting black and brown people in the bear one operator named glen told me she would been homeless herself for about five years not that long ago at the end of the call rushauna transfers her cousin to the place where she can get on the list for help with housing agent a connect you i got you can a cut o gan i i i i i her a i a a a rag haven't a can yo ma o gan i can love you have la you to i looking back on that call rushauwa recognizes the some of her hesitancy around telling her cousin it was her had to do with her own doubts round what she was ready to offer i did not really one a fully at that point excide my hand has in a place this day because i did not the i was in the position to do that i just then one to be face with that is in my heart i would have had the heart to be no you cannot come here rushauwa had been in the situation before not with this cousin but with another family member and she knew once you invites some one in you have to be willing to let them stay until they find another situation after that two one one call with reshauna it ended up being about six months before a cousin was able to get herself back into her own place when these operators actually do have something tangible to offer their collars they jump at the chance at the end of one of her workdays rushing answers the phone for a collar who needs a shelter bed to night luckily she is just gotten word that five beds have opened up in a shelter an skin she has something to offer only there is a problem mister see the client is a cross town at a kinky dislike is enter your no needs to be at the shelter by six p m it is currently around ten minutes at her five you need to get over to to s p by six p m is there any one there no come down comedown is looking is there any one there that would be willing to give you ride do not to now six six yes six to night this collar this name is names geese was panicking i if he could not get into the shelter he imagined he would have to sleep outside that night a er o way o o i let me let me place on a click call to see what i can do about transportation of ay then me play to one one operators do not really have a get to help collars with transportation but there is this very small fund rushauna tells me for lift rides although she does not think this situation meets the criteria to use the funding am you do not have a way to even take the best on mistress no i e er o yo heart rushauta puts mister reeks back on hold and opens the act for lift on her computer her brow was for o her curse is hovering over the request ride button she says to me this is where the humanity comes into it most of the day it is do you fit the criteria are not call the number read the script go through the protocols but now she is it to make her own dissent t coquet er mister rest get a get you a li free it is rare having a problem she can solve even if it means pending the rules a bit mister geese has forty minutes to get to the shelter but it is a thirty minute ride with traffic ill you will be getting picked up in three minutes by a ritard he is driving a white gonna court o e a of i e o have a going breshaunta hangs up the phone but on her con peter screen we can see that ritard a driver has pulled up to the address mister rescale he is just sitting there why is ritard just sitting there if mister rest is in his car he is weens wen in o i mister rest he is there to kami wen a hurry mysteries that that he is now left in the ride wits cancel o em at all a second serene she puts him back on hold ism not sure if she is get to get him another lift or if that was his one chance it is five thirty he would already be late but maybe not too late rechaunta tries again roll in a greentoyota pries will be picking you ut in six minute o ism still here mister o an to stay on with you till you get in that a h five more minutes we o tell o for oh he is there he is waiting for you green tooth area the amen ale mister reel you may have to walk around and look for gran tooth pries come on let us look for the a vehicle o yes you can get in there we can see the driver's blue dot hovering on the screen circling the block but they do not seem to be finding each other ill cant let me try to call the driver holt on a second there are four or more agonizing minutes if back and forth on a conference call between reschanna mister geese and roll the liftdriver mister geese is describing landmark describing himself finally they find each other gin the for a you are in the car perfect you are going to be a few minutes late but just calmly explain that you ere told to come he thanks her she hangs up get he is on his way well yes get that is the the birthing a i guess that is what keeps you going even if its one person that gets ta place inside to night in getting mister geese to that shelter was one real thing before the days end one person who rechannel new for sure would not sleep outside that night it does not always go that i had not thought about it that much before this but puracracy's are not just frustrating for the people trying to navigate then they are frustrating for the people working inside of them too no one really has any age envy no power to make a decision that could really help some one all the operators told me the best calls are this one when they feel they actually have something to offer but calls this are rare mostly rest now to be the voice telling people they are not gan a get what they need not right away

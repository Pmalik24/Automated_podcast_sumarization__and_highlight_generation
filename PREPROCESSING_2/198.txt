do for them every day i mi shall they brush the these and i make our they do the mess home work and these is one of those things suddenly that the fact that we have got a very limited period of time to turn this around you know the stencil talk about ten years that to about twenty thirty we have got the next dick and in the next deck i my youngest kids wont yet have finished ho school and it just suddenly say extraordinarily agent medically important and i remember finishing my coffee getting up of the couch and i went straight to my study and i logged in to my i you would describe it as a painting for but wall sinuation and within ten minutes out to a so my superanuishian completely wife from tussle fields and that was one of and a hundreds of different things that i state to from that point on ism trait by that moment rebec actually talked to one of our producers of you to cornfield who in the last two months has interview dozens of people who have had these wake up om as hay the review her these happened in all kinds of different ways an yet foot to all kinds of different people all of whom actually need a point to tell me they did not consider themselves environmentalist in any way prior to their wake up moment owe yet it is more they were just walking around and got bunked on the head and then everything changed people describe it wake not been a bazaar world were everything's the same but the way they feel about it is totally different the wake of reorganizes their priorities completely in fact lots of support groups have popped up in the past two years to hell people deal with the immensity of these new feelings what upper rebec in rebecca's case she totally changed the focus of her career invited it to climate as she is she also cut back on eating me decided she needed to get an elector car or have no car ah and those of the kind of things that would a fact the rest of her family her husband and her kids and what i found in these interviews is that this is where the trouble comes in for many people when their families haven undergone the same transformation that they have ray remind sens ye everyone mention some version of this this one i gland chair i talk to after his wake of themed he tried to convince his whole family brother sisters nieces nephews to all see this the way that he now did and to come to climate rallies with him the common reaction that i got was well i did not know you were passionate about this environmental stuff or your really into this its usually interesting am it is great it is great i really support you it is great that your into this and tat was just that was frustrating to me ism not into this it is just what is happening it is if there was a rock barrelling toward us that i was tried to get is out of the way you would not be why us perpassionate about trucks i just did not know you into tricks was is always the this i think it is really great that you f this interests note this is just what is happening i was i use just keep running back and forth the yelling it people a do you ruin your relationships and i realized to that i was potentially impacting relationships that er the most important thing to me in the world for no benefit no benefit because because it was in changing anyone mind it was in working glen decided to leave his family long but other people told me that they could not back off in the same way and it is how a huge impact on from their closest relationships that idea brings us to to as program a the idea fir show to take came from a levis interest in these families were one person sees something that feels big and important and percent and the try to bring everybody long and t it is just bad for everyone we've one story that what a story about a surprisingly effective way to deal with the problems of the world charge and small do you be easy chico is this america i i mariglass see whet us that one one point five degrees of separation soviet was interested in the told that having a wake up moment this could have on a family and she heard about somebody who had a moment this over a decay go and let him to quit i job dedicate his life to activism he tried to put his family into it and what afforded was the most extreme example of things going badly in a family that if eve heard of the pretty much destroyed his family he did it was strange from them the guy is named michael foster when viva reached out and asked me if he would talk about how his climate active as had damaged to his relationship with his wife and children he was totally up for it be to viva that he let his inside of the story was as she more important than his he hon is crucial that she is talk to them which course of even wanted to do both children are now young dolts they were glad to talk what spit in their family is not nearly typical of a climate activist mike's activism shifted the wholes center of gravity of the family in ways that are definitely a particular to his personality but the immense end of the world stakes of the issue but what sent mike anis wife militia and their kids down the path they went here is area mike and militia were never the kind of couple who saw into eye on the big stuff they met when they were in high school an texts they both did speech in debt and would see one another at the competitions though the weren't early friends mike who was not even logical christian at the time carried a bible everywhere led prayer circles before the tournaments while militia and her friends would smoke weed out back i mean his story is that the first time he rule remembers meeting me was when a he had just finishlating a prayer circle and he met me and i had a button this is back when you wore buttons and it set not saved and his mind just kind of melted that some one would proudly were not saved button that is my story how dare she tell my story at my mind melted it did not know that there were people a there who could just be happy and funny and and saying car not save each felt the other was this kind of exotic bird or something totally foreign to that but also sort of mesmerizing and an they went to the same college near by they started dating mike was no longer an even logical christian at that point but mind says the relationship was still very from come opposites a tract they broke up and got back together all throughout college and then found each other again and their late twenties at that point mike was a child an family therapist taking kids to the out doors to do a kind of wilderness therapy and militia had a corporate job was making good money we were together for a few years he had asked me to marry him a few times and i was i do not think it is a good idea for us to get married we are just too different but mike felt familiar and a way the only first loves can eventually kinda said yes to mike's proposal they got married had two kids and person stellar lived in into at this point climate changed was not a big part of their lives beyond the basic stuff i mean we were we were really green we were kind of cartoon green steal family whatever stereo type you have that was what we were doing they werecychled composted these energy efficient lipewulbs and then one day mike heard about this new documentary he wanted to nosy we n a room of been an inconvenient truth mike convinced militia to go seat with him for their daylight sitting there in the dark mike felt algor had taken all the dots of information about climate change the mike had picked up over the pass couple decades and arranged them into a pointless painting of our future and the picture was grimmer and mere dramatic than he thought and then at the end of it it it has the creditors and during the credits it i on this black screen have these little white letters that say things plant of tree change your libels drive less and that is it rid you haves to spent an hour and a half learning that the world is ending and nobody's doing anything and you are supposed to plaint a tree they rests kind of you mike major man your disconnect of ah wad a minute that is that is not in a do it that is not even class before the documentary mike thought we had time now it seemed clear to him we were just a few decades away a from a radically different planet mike started poring over climate research reading every day he travel to californium to go to a training led by a gore himself were he learned to give a slide show about climate change when he came back from the training mike showed his kids a slide show and presented it at their schools emesis mike solder kid who by the way uses a pronoun stay them remembers being excited by that this wasn't two thousand twelve embers was ten at the time i felt kind o minor celebrity satin right because my dad was a guest speaker than i needed everyone to know the that was my at the presentation were having to day a my dads doing that i i hear that mi dads can becoming next week to do a presentation in class mike an is kid start climate club set their schools mike also teaches emersion stellar the slide shell and they all start going around to teach it together both kids threw themselves into the work refers the importance of the topic immediately resinated but stellar who as eight had a much simpler reason it was a way for me to get his attention if like asked a question he would be paying attention to just me rather than the family which i guess is kind of selfish bid at the time mows dad look over here i i can ask questions about climate change jets mark news of mike's slide who spread and he started being invited to present at their schools pretty early on mike decided that kids were the answer his active ism would focus on them i was already a special the as at the fist and he figured children have the most at stake here there opened the message and a adults will be able to hear the science from them differently they'll hear it from other adult mike's first big step down that path he organized a march with the national kid centered climate group called i matter he says a the fatal police gave the marchers a fourteen motor cycle escort to pike place market ever san stellar both spoke at the marc ever said they would never talked in front of many people before he helped me write my speech in can me practice it a ton we presided to speak the is everybody's attention was on me stellar the younger one found all the attention a little overwhelming the painting i remember a was looking at my dad to kind of folk is mi gaze to steady you yet i really looked at him to kina not free get in is speech and all the ones after id me says that mike gave each of them specific rolls to fill rolls a ever says they naturally fit into stellar was the one that would make the audience ghoul lichee she is cute a o a a a and then i was one who as supposed to make the audience go oh oh ka a it was a one to punch stellar disarmed them and a you an invite kill ya basically ya i think i was a little bit supposed to scare people yo e ask yet and ah in w a by ya ta they say e for marina watching mike in the kids give speeches and spend much time together it was really nice they are having fun and working on something that felt important she was not around much to he she had a big job at a tell communications company they kept are busy and on the rod lot at the time but she jumped in where she cud she made a web sit for mike and did a lot of the behind the scenes we justice staff she is got at mike to more ambitious and brought the kits along they started organizing for plant for the planet a did run organization with a go of planting a trillion trees the whole family recruited friends to join mi quit is job to focus on climate work cameras in stellamat the governor in the mayor they were lead plaintiffs and a law suit against the state of washington to curbamissions they are in an h big documentary about kid climate actives but none of that stuff felt enough to mike he was thinking more about the way he and the family were living at home most and i had an agreement i was the vegetarian i was the one doing they makes the world better staff and she was the one who was working at the corporate jean pay in the bills and i was fine with that i but when ism doing these climate talks and i mean like one day would be five talks and ism hearing myself going over this material and really grasping it what ism saying it became harder for me to be okay wit the trip to for we harder for mike to be o we because airplane mat much carpendioxide i wen out on a lamb and i was this this this has no integrity for me and i cannot just go along with our agreement other he by talk to who wenthrow away tut women they also got to this point thecae to believe that we have to change our behavior and all kinds of ways to avoid the worst case areas and we have to do that knowing individual action will not be enough one family driving an electric car a giving up plastic straws is not going to do the job any serious climate solution will require an overhaul of our energy sources at a global level but it will also require as to live differently without that the situation will not change and not for things get messy deciding where to draw the line in your own family the kids really wanted to get a cat and well i grope with pets i think they'd be great and he said no we cannot do that ism trying t understand why he says that the carbon footprint of a domesticated house pet a ridiculous that is all the process meat the patsy and the cans and plastic the food comes in plus catheter dog toys chips to the bat we are not in support that there ether cannot be pets in this house the family ended up settling on getting chickens which turned out to be a good compromise because the ids loved the chickens and mike was happy the chickens produced eggs because i men they would be supporting factory farms that produce supermarket eggs but flying on plans became a real point of contention in the family militia wanted to take the kids to dismay world for vacation us were not going were not he saiga were never getting on a plane again i were not i miss that gimme what what and i made the mistake of saying but i fly for work and he us exactly and maybe if you did not fly the world would be a better place to mike flying felt an existential threat to his kids futures and tavern ones it was unbearable for me to continued doing the things that were going to makes their life impossible actually impossible in the near future at the time did you have any doubts about the lifestyle changes you were making because your sort of having to balance really believing in the cause and also accepting that you are dated with two kids and maybe one pet doesn't actually make that big of it if french in the grand scheme of things but it does make a really big difference in my kidslives how did you balance that there was really impossible to bounce because ism not talking about a cause because ism talking about their survival and the thinks there gin a suffer when they get older anyway says ism sorry am getting into the preaching mod and we are trying to talk family here but but to me it is the same thing militia cut flying for work but nobody else flew and militia did not all these changes but she did not disagree exactly clime a change is a noble cause that was what i was telling myself this is for the world this is for a better future for my children and their children why am i being such a bitch about it one of the biggest ways climate active as change this family is had a turned mike into a kind of stage tat performing with his kids all the time with all the mention and friction that comes with that it was es specially intents because mike's climate work was all about kids he needed his kind to be the face of it hes emesis i started having issues if my dad when it was he started feeling more a coach than a dad and he was just bringing more and more and more things it is i would wake up in the morning and he would be were even in two hours there is a presentation here is there not you have to speak write a speech now cameras had always giving speeches driving them but mike wanted to see their speeches ahead of time and practise would get angry if they did not let him get mad afterwards if he thought they did not hit the right points in front of crowds mike was always complimentary up their speeches it is when if you were in a theatre production and the director gives a talk after the show or something i was the actor it'd played my little part and then he would come out and be ism proud my didn't amazing job on in is michael foster and i ma crowd pop er it now a i i don't know what to say at blow me way every sing ton a and than once the audience leaves its time for not once they are not looking then you talk about what you did wrong and everything that you've to do better next time an to put it politely since militia was oft working much of the time supporting the family she had no reals sense that increasingly this said become cameras and mike's dynamic until one day the kids had a speech far outside of town militia drove the family to and from the speech since she had a highbred car and mike's elector car could not make at that far cameras had given a speech and i thought it was brilliant at you non the mom and we got in the car and i was driving and mike was in the see next to me an the kids were in the back and he was yelling because cameras had not let him read the speech before they gave it and he was saying you should have let me read that speech before because i would have told you at the time i would have told you that you were missing these points and got down if you would let me see that you would hae done a better job you missed your opportunity you fucked it up and you missed your opportunity ism trey one woke let me just say i thought it was great what do you even listen half the time no sike taking back kinda points to this moment is one of her failures that she letter kids give speeches after this but at the time mike was confident in what was right and milia did not trust the feeling that told her otherwise it'd will maybe this is their dynamic maybe this is how they communicate that they flare up and they not that the kids ever yell but maybe mike yells but move that is how it works and because the next day there worked on it again and he is a family fairest or a how there old in families they are up as you know there is that hanging over my head too of he knows he is the expert this is just the beginning of their family breaking apart and one of the reasons mike was eager to speak with me is because he feels pretty in the dark about what happened but split his family up and left his kids bitter that at this point they've not spoken to him in years he does not get what he could have done that was bad his family still wants nothing to do with him said he feels that he is an apathy crispy novel he knows he is the killer he just as know i dead how he did it when we spoke mike never contested any one's memories of what went down he told me if they said it i believe it he knows he has a temper kinda said he is always had one in college he is have blow ups though she always knew how to calm him down but mike and militia and the kids all agree talbursts ramped up considerably after mike got into climate activism kinda said he was never physically violent with her or the kids but the frequency and the focus of the blow ups changed i would just go for my rot a ninety and you would not see a common and all a sudden it was you know inside me if holt okay the world is on and because of this it because it because of something somebody did or said or whatever if we if we cannot if our family or you and me cannot do this one simple thing then how does the world get to remain living it could li this takes always felt that high ye i sometimes he would just be okay we i am this person who is in this roll trying to it say hearts how we get to live on earth for the next ten thousand years and i cannot persuade my family to let go of the star boy color whatever the thing was at the moment o case within the world went that is what it actually felt you ye more than once me called stellar a fucking bitch and a can stellar said before me got into climate activism he would yell her about the kin of stuff any parent mite for lying about brushing her teeth or saying up at pass bed time but in knows instance is stellar knew read still level her now she worried about that i had a good father for years before the climate change started there were flaws but it was only once lake it it was climate change where he put much of himself into it and wanted me to put much of my sold into it that i really got the feeling that he is love was completely condition stellar remembers when she realize she was over climate activism it was or nine in a hold birthday they celebrate half birthdays in their family and in celebration they would planned a dinner at one of stellar favorite restaurants but before they left the house something hop and visit mike off and he started ranting about the state of the world stellar said that when her dad got into climate talk mod there was nothing to do but listen fifteen minutes tick my then thirty then forty five i just remember thinking i just want talk about what we did at school to day i want talk about this cat i saw on the w home i want talk on my half birthday and feeling it was not an option for me to talk because he was talking stellar never told any one she wanted to quit activism because deep down she felt she had this personal responsibility to stop climate change secretly emirs was feeling the same way the more stay realizing that i did not want to do it the worst a person i was horrible things are going to happen to people because ism not willing to do this it felt i was the worst person in the world it was all guilt all the time and fear is fear of him and fear of the apocalits stellar carbon foot prints started to haunt her when german drove her to school when she drink a glass of milk even when she exhaled sometimes she would think allay doing is putting more carbon dioxide into the air she started having nightmares every night of the world burning or f oceans rising and flooding our house or going to the grocery store and finding the shelves completely bare because drafts had killed off all the clans man militia not told me they had no idea the kiss or feeling this bay at the time which emersions stellar said make sense they were god at hiding when i asked mike about how bad the kids felt he said he never meant to make kiss kids feels bad as they did ut he also defended guilt as a tactic guilt is seriously underrated guilt and shame keep people from murdering each other and honestly guilt may be one of the we tings that could keep life earth going for the next ten thousand years if we cannot feel guild er shame about what we are doing and learn how to do something else it is a it was over a long time ago one way to hear this story is at dies not about climate change but about a dad the sort of goes off the see ben for reasons that have more to do with his own personality than anything else but i cannot dismiss the role climate change plays in the story i thing the grim picture of the future that might carries in his head is actually more accurate than the picture most of us carry around is genuinely hard to figure out the right way to have feelings about climate change it is easy to lose perspective when the problem is vast and woven in to every part of how we live how we get to work what we eat an mistakes are high i talked to other people who had wake up moments many of whom are reasonable and kind and not alarm is by nature who alienated their families and in lots of cases lost their families and the wake up their new found clarity minion the kids see all that but alsoblieve it did not have to go this way militia said that to me in our very first conversation mi could have don is climate work without torturing his family that is he didn't need to cuss out is kids coming out how the most ambitious are you be most successful thing you ever do as a political activist in out to be the worst thing you do for your family that is a minute chico bub a gradual when our programmed continues it is a share from lie from my glass to day's programmed the end of the world as we know it if you just turning ain wherein the middle of a auto cornfields story about mike foster in his family and i was climb active ism which o changes in the family and ultimately divorce and his estrangement from his threw kids we has not spoken with in years we will pick up where we left off both of his kids stellar and emesis what a quit doing activism with her dad again here is o be t h it takes about two years of going to climate meeting and speaking at rallies with their dad before stellar and emesis confided in each other about how they really felt about it what they actually wanted here is emesis i remember we were out on the back porch going inside install stopped me and she was she whispered do you think mamma at or can i get a divorce and i was i do not know but i kind of hope and she was he too and that was really yet after that it was kind of better cause we had that solid rarity stela started doing secret research about parental custody to figure out the odds that she and emesis would get to live wit their mam in the event that her parents did get deforest she started dropping hints she was just beginning six grate around this time and our school offered these electives to port groups here are bunch of different options and one of the groups was for kids of divorce parents that was a group stellasined up for when militia found out which group stellar had going and asked her about it stellar shared in said just in case things continued this for a while even going through the motions until it all came to ahead one night cameras wanted to go to a fall out by concert mi consisted they come to the monthly plant for the planet meeting instead the meeting was over emersion stellar waited by the car for forty five minutes in the cold before he came out we started driving home i think i was very obviously sulking and ultimately i told him that i was annoyed that he had taken long to come back and that i had not really wanted to go to the meeting in the first place and he just lost it he got mad stellar remembers this night too he was shouting in this car just yelling you are ungrateful you do not realize how much i do for you why cannot you just go along with it for one night what is your problem what is important about this fuck in concert and he was driving radically he would pull the car over superbest and turn in start yelling at us again unprompted and what are you got doing at that won you're literally both of us are just sitting in the back seat malls closed eyes wide crying absolutely terrified it'd never seen him that angry and i had seen him get angry a lot and she how when we came home we just got under the cars fast as we possibly could and ran inside to get to our mam because it was the safe on and a game of tag or something it was she meant protection from him i was in the family room in the door flew open the kids came running in crying sobbing and there dad came run sing in after them screaming at the top of his lungs and i won a what it what is happening here what is going on and i went upstairs to talk to the kids and thou said they were afraid they were going to die in the car an mi what the hell happened militia made up her mind not long after that night she told mike she want a divorce my calls it a climate divorce militia says no if anything climate change kept them together longer than they should have been a i i feel i i looked passed and accepted much more of what was bad because it was in service of climate change if he had been a kulinon conspirator it would have been easy for me to say no not doing that but it is climb change i him it the but mike an militia get divorce and mike moves just a few blocks away the kids get to live with their mam full time as he would hoped and she establish some sort of new relationship with mike they tried cup around the family therapy but according to the therapist not the first round crashes and burns because mike keeps interrupting to explain climate change and the importance of his work to the therapist and they try again n months later stellar gets up the courage to tell mike her big secret for the first time that she does not want to be a climate activist any more the she was only doing it because she felt he gave her no choice stellar figured he would say he was sorry and she prepared herself to forgive him but instead mike seemed angry he did apologize but the thing he apologize for was that he had not invited her to more climate events that she would be more emotionally invested in the cause see the way he did a word to listeners who might be sensitive to this this next part of the story mention self harm ut i just remember feeling ism never going to escape him and wanting everything to just be done with because i was tired of having tod explain these things that it'd gone through and having to think about him and having to talk about him and talk to him and having him not be who i needed him to be when i needed it it just all became to much about an hour and a half after the session with her dad stellar attempted suicide she spent the next eight days in the hospital she told her mam to keep her dad away from her she did not even want him to know she was in there for me it was the first time that i said no i mean it was not very dignified i was kind o screaming and crying no do not went a man do not let i an but a i think having a complete break from him were he just stopped being at all a consideration for a week but also having had the power to remove him was really critical for me i told mike what stellar said how their conversation and therapy was a breaking point for her just before her suicide attempt he said he had no idea he did not remember apologizing for the wrong thing for saying he was sorry he did not get her more invested and climate work i wish i could remember saying it ah it sounds the kind of stuff that would have come out of my mouth and ism d what a shitty thing when she needed something else after the at mike stopped trying to contact stellar shan't wat him to and the therapy said it could be dangerous for stellar he laid low hoping the kids croquet and waiting for an invite to return to the family stellar says that with the burden of fixing her relationship with her dad lifted she started doing a lot better freed from climate work she had time to do things that she actually liked greeting fancy novels she also got a great therapist and started taking any to presence which she said of really helped and was stela feeling sturdier seemed mike and the kids might possibly find away to rebuild have a relationship of some kind however fracture until this next thing happened which brought about the end of their world as they knew it it was a fall of twenty sixteen a little over a year after stellar suicide attempt she reached out to ask for a meeting with her dad and emesis and the therapies in the meeting stellar and emesis told their dab that for them to consider having a relationship again they needed him to stop going climate work for a while he stellar he said he would and that it hadn't we really happy it felt can cameras was struck to maybe if he could get rid of that than he really does care about us i he must really love us if he is willing to give that up a few weeks after that after mike told us kids he would stop doing climate activism he did his most extern climate action ever protesters man dually turned our five oil pipe wides to day one of the five protesters can be seen her turning off the pipe li tall the north to cord the trust mi travel to north decode broke pass the fence around the keystone type line and turned a have shutting off the flow of oil he was arrested on sight and at that point charge with six felonies and two misdemeanors which combine could land up in prison for more than ninety years i was mad i was mad here is embers again man i was pissed i i mean it that was the point where he would sink he would stop doing all this for us it is all he is going to prison heres stellar that moment really just was it for me i just did not care any more it felt relief because there was no small voice in my head saying but he is your dead you have got a love him i was complete and whole and did not need him and did not want him a bunch of the charges were either dismissed or amended but mike ended up spending six months in prison he told me he did not realize his kids were asking him to stop climate activism right then he thought they meant some at he said he had no idea this was the last straw for them the halo turning propelled mike to fame in a new way especially in their little green settle community lend says than the story was he is a hero look what he is done he is a hero he is a hero and there was a article the local sale magazine which painted him as this matter and he talked about how he sacrifice his relationship with his children ford the planet and they they tried to say that ow we did not could not flying more in the marriage brook apart and and he had quit sang something you nobationly i just annoyed the fuck out of them ti that is it is such a simple viewpoint he did not annoy the fuck out of us you were as annoying his fuck but you actually wounded us you harmed us you hurt us after the hiatal magazine article came out climate people would come up to militia and the kids and tell them they should really talk to mike again they should forgive him because he is doing such important work but embers does not see his work that way i think it is made it that his name means something but to very few people it is a subset of people who ere already inclined to that stuff but he has not achieved anything i mean with he is climate stuff i said that that turning had no effect the oil got there a couple hours later hum he is made a series of empty gestures and spent years posturing as a hero and a family man and has jest destroyed everything i think that was actually meaning full about his life i think on some level he knows that and that part of why he is distressed about having lost his family i do not know i guess i wish him well but he can fined meaning that he is not family at this point they has were we are done with him it is been nearly six years since mike and militia got divorce there is been essentially no contact between mike and the kids since the valve turning the first time i talked to me our interview lasted nine hours mostly because almost every question i asked about his family he ended at veering into climate change how bad things were hall known was doing enough how many and demit species face extinction this century the fact he told me four times in our interview he oscillated between extreme sadness over his non existent relationship with his kids to anger about the state of the world tho agitated concern that i had not asked him any of the right questions yet because i had not asked him about the science but what it was on o take to change things the morning after our interview i woke up to an meal from mike ane asked for a do over he said he would accidentally gone into climate ransomed instead of speaking as a dad he said quote i cannot live with what i said i cannot i rambling sound monstrous idiotic we tried again he told me he did not agree with his family that the problem was his personality and the way he handled his activism he thought there were things he could have done better but the real problem was that he and militia were not on the same page i told them i did not think having two parents him would have solved things with the kids he did

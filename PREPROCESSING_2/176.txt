fallen is not the real manta pass i in the north pole obviously i said the standing little kids who mi be was tending to me right now that guy in the north pole is amazing fallen is not that guy aliens is ta guy who dresses up is wanna sometimes half does not have satisfying reindeer haven does not have weapons of elves backing him up and most of all fallen does not have his years of experience this is my first year manta my first one wrong on he is driving to his very first chair gig aim i nervous i i ism ism nervous a really really nervous e her gig you idea her took to kids not what they wont for christian one of our producers in you to corn fell rode with him to this job this was an redwings californium an hour or east of will sand to us fallen is an earnest guy the kind face who and he retellyou this himself tenstover thing things of ale really he told o viva he is not your what to expected this gig what could go wrong just been trying to prepare for everything i making him we checking twice last night i made checklists on my falling for all the things that i would been and all the things a potentially need i have a back up for almost everything that i were a am well i it in case a baby spits up i need another sure i if the to get turd i need another o and i have to have exotic gloves in have been kind of manic about trying to anticipy all the i castorfties that gat happening were another an prepare for them is out i worried about his beard is fifty three is natural beard is still must be brown i started a bleaching my beard in tune ans my beard started getting small the bleach was damaging it breaking o yes hes tries to expense of paraproduct stop the damage but he similar shorten any once maybe his greatest anxiety going into this gig is the questions tether kids might ask him would he say the right thing there might be a e know a child with a real problem the the mom is gone or somebody a incarcerated or something that ans i cannot tax cannot bring an one back that they lost and i really were about being ask about that i cannot bring some one home was on ta apoiyment somewhere he frats an drives on his way to the gig woful manta costumes in the bag in a christmast comes round every year always the same bathe same songs in the same stage perhaps since specials on the be yon get numb to it it is easy to lose the magical feeling that many people had as kids round the holiday but one thin he say about plan he is not feeling i just the opposite he is on his work not just as he wants to be a perfect manta for these little kids mainly his that way because it is his first time in the chair and there are all kinds of reasons that that is a big deal for him hat will in to get into in a minute or two but my pride now is when you're trying something for the first time you can just ion's least all the potential an excitement of what it could be you feel feelings which is why this christian here it i shall we thought o be nice to spend an hour with people who are not doing what the have ever done in the past or christian who are not doing the same old same old when spend the hour with people who are trying someone brand new i christian does they have a shot at some deep christian he feeling to babas chico sis medical life i i a glass stay a ana glad to manta believe in himself i a fallen i may ethos a manta fallen it is on his way to his first cheirgig as we said pretty son ta cornfield went with him to see how he would do on that gig but to understand why he is nervous and what he hoped to get out of the gig he can have to understand what job means from the first place and that is whereof leva is ma start before getting into the manta business fallen had a job though a sort of the office of being manta he was a correction's officer at a state prison he gotten into the work because he needed the money and stability and stayed for over two decades but he hated it and felt increasingly queen about the whole says stem and his roll on it and then in twenty seventeen he got a break from it though not under great conditions he i really sick ended up having to take nearly a year and a half off from mark for medical love he got depressed stopped shaving get along beard one day to cheer himself at fallen and his wife errand decided to go to a comic book convention is obviously ism find of a nerved and i enjoy that sort of thing but i went there and it wasn't really having a very good time and i was taking a break from walking around in the convention and ism sitting in a little caff in him having something a drinker eating a sandwich i do not fly remember but there is his guy there he says hey i your beard and i wont oh i thanks an he gave me this little card in what it is a it is a recruitment cart for this fraternal order of real bearded dances there is something very sort of tied to the real world about the idea of recruiting a manta when it feels it should just be some snow falls on your shoulder something than you become manta the had but know this was just a guy i sitting around at a common a take to very dozen first times mantas in reporting the story nearly every one had this in comment it was some one else who first identified than the manta turns out that is the magical snow that falls on your shoulder fallen shows a business card to his life errand the suggests he dress up for there got sons kids christian still months away but it might give him something to look forward to ism thinking a call i i do have the spear now and the have always been the definitely on the road tun side of things have got that working for me and i went well i should could feel in sorry for myself in maybe do something with this now fallen figures he will play manta just as once as a nice thing to do for his family since he is a grandfather to these kids fallen was worried they might recognize him he bleached his beard white an asked a friend who knows how to sow to make him a red suit but and christian eve as he is putting over to the house he realizes he actually is no idea what to do he just tries to imagine but a real manta might do then opens the door makes an entrance and there is free own this ma they have pointy it was the furthest thing from their mind i did not cave tremendous expectations going into it and then one i did it it was just this tremendous rush of emotions in that is not a thing the happens to me a lot of bit a pretty button at person most to my life when it was manta for them it became manta for me it is just one of the most powerful things of ever fill my life when ism him ism a completely different person in all my little serow sees and out and faults and foibles it is all gone and all the proms that fallen has manta does not my of us fallen loved this new version of himself but pretty soon christian was over and is medical leave which mean alien's beard had to go the cause as ta correction's officer he had to be able to wear a gas mask in case a riot broke out at the prison you cannot properly set a gasp makeover a beard fallen could not afford to quiet he grabbed his clippers e made himself shave off his beard this is good a sound really heard i still have that beard in i blocking really yow i mourned that beard why do you still have it i probably should not but it it mental lot to me it was the key to the doors that open that let me do this and when i had to shave that beard off i was pretty unhappy about it i was upset the next year glen bout a fakebeard to play manta but it looks bad he could not bring himself to wear it two years pass without playing manta and then thinks i part to his wife grand hos making enough money as an engineer to support them fallen is finally able to retire and he throws himself into becoming manta the gall is to become a professional manta the kind that some one might hire for say a private party or prayed or the holy grail of manta engagements a char gag first thing glen starts growing his beard back then he signs up for manta school at we cannot intensive were you learn everything from what to say to skeptical kids to how to make an entrance he needs lots of other mantas who off for helpful steps how do seeking a bathroom break while staying in character patently respect to say you to make a call o the north pall finding out there this he tiger world you did not know about it's been the little heard and sometimes you wonder how you got to this place in life this is a deeply heard thing for mile aged and elderly guise to do but it but it is curia wonderful i been it is it is a but i deeply strange at the sake time by the time ism talking to him fallen spend almost a full year preparing for the all he is a diligent and serious student of the manta tradition but there is one part of it he does not believe in the nutty list surprising maybe given his last ja you have been bad you are on the naudulist that is that is no way to be is punitive exactly and that is have seen emanative and i do not thing it works i want a loose be able lift i up rather than put him in a corner somewhere in tell that you're this thing being manta lets i work on the other side of the ledger which feels ta lot better to him i tried to do that job as well as i could but it was really difficult and when you run into a lot of people sort of the nanny list am and he cannot do anything for him an they cannot do anything for themselves it feels cunt of hopeless that is a less my learn for my career people meed reception they need to be accepted back into the fault even if they made mistakes finding the way of too well for g o over the people sort of give you at opening to for you bushel the others lot fleet the day is finely arrive for alien's first ever target we are driving to the event which is tat an abandoned pure one an an outdoor mall about a half an hour from his house we hope out of the car and meet gonna tarsia who hired fallen for the event she lets us in through the back door of the building there is a single clothing rack with teashirts on it alien takes a shirts off he can use the rack to hang all the pieces of hi sandal fit it he nervous he keeps dropping step foe o turd almost us ongoing slap to or som fix a line forms outside while fallen changes into his costume he is got a fur lined red robe and matching hat and a green vest with gold buttons underneath he is wearing big black boots and little half moon spectacles that i have to say really pull the whole outfit together but he still just looks a guyana costume then the doors open and the kits rushed a e on her e e u u i lo or dress suddenly he manta confident arms stretched wide beaming whatever the opposite of erratic is he is that two little girls walk an ans pot and their eyes seem to double in sides there seeing something truly magical it is clear they have no idea this is his first time doing this to them he manta the we ready one to the day begins will not you wont for pristine what monster true i longest e a as he can here as got his invoice on and wit do not know what i expected it is apply but this job requires just much pat it you manta fallen is tappdancing as fast as he can single tels to o els to all way to keep the kits happy and engaged the won all bold up on the photographer say can snap a good picture for the parents a its o a i yo afafafafafafa of o watching manta fallen i thought about this thing another manta a pastor name santadon told me santadon said that back when he was in graduate school for psychology on his first day of class his professor asked how many of you have people who are already coming to for counseling don and a few other students rase her hands then the professor goes ism going be honest with you if people are not already coming to you getting a degree from here proudly will not changed that here either the kind of person people on a confide in or your not don thinks at the same is true for manta there is some an paint manta eosins some manta vide that you either have or you do not and here on his first cheer gag manta fallen seem to have it tho it did not always go smoothly with every kit a in aka son a a on on wo o there we are a lot of crying babies o old in on e for were o ti a off you ant r e to n sometimes kids as manta fallen for things that room for a loop the boy who said he wanted trouble for christian were the girl who just wanted sons tat cur persons it it no dust me e soft off o we hat's good one little girl wanted two hampstairs but as she asked for them her parent stood behind her with wide eyes vigorously shaking her heads no of course there were some awkward moments when manta fallen axidenaly mistake a boy with long hair for a girl and this kid the looks a tiny adult and who was not having it was manta alien's questions i had almost you not on animals ha e i can no the real ranger they have ant words this no i i si be seen rudely an you seen his know i no o no i yet it is likes sup in its red are you going to schooling n no no i may for o some people pile to school in the for manta fallen had imagined field an all these big hard questions from kids but in practice the real work of imitating manta is more working a back try line a quick back and forth snap a picture then on to the next the hard is question he ended up getting was about missus class a forme a you o she looking armmorful carl a for argol barrel o e a i she o ball to miss moon i do not she don't wish she just mot o make som the north poll that well ask and she is important she is to see a of the north pole missuses coss is actually my loss we fallen wanted to sand the little girl shut did not want to promise cookies and set her up to be disappointed on christian day instead he pivoted to a heinous message he later told me he want have date the image of missus class for kids especially for girls he is not the idea that she just makes cookies and letters around the north pole all day a one am the doors or close manta alien's been there for two hours talked over a hundred kids he changes out of his costume and into what is referred to as manta casual red clothing but not the wholshabang christian light he acts a and we get in the car we are bout to drive back to his house when fallen realizes he is left his back packinside the door this is a problem for him because he really does not want to go back and get it and have people see him when he is not in the full manta costume but as we are walking back to the pier one a guying a car notices fallen ta fallen puts his finger up to his lips as if to say s wo o i will not say nothing time says then we are standing in front of the store waiting to be let back in when a girl in the back seat of a car driving by yells manta as an it don't want ta ruin the image for anybody do not the i yet fallen tries to tack himself into the corner of the building by the door to hide from people but it does not work at all for go everyone who passes by double takes him her yells at him i fallen looks miserable it is funny you have transformed back into are in ow the rod sou d you live what yo u storm now i don't but ism ism tracked by the chance formation how different you a i guess som back to being fortune or something other you are literally cowering in a corner i is not the man i saw thirty minutes gat one i i ism not him on me fallen did not play on on ending his first chair gag glue to the side of a pier wan but there is the pare to them tells me

father gets a phone clan it is exactly wet yo think then he picks it up in the first thing the principal same times professorattleman your sons have a lying problem my father said what did they do and the principal said well that do you trying to explain to the children the very delicate topic of christian and outs raised his head and he said we had christian and i meter that he did not have christian and he said whom pry sure we a christmawi stocking snoopy charge brown benin christian and the features data christian conga three wakes ago or nine months er not to penning on er anyway don news believe in the sky called manta class and in my mind's eye i remember aka raising his hand and saying we had manta class that is what i remember but d are conflicting a counts here apparently aka did not raised his hand apparently aka in the words of the teacher lifted two fingers he was ordering a second tomartaning and ait and say we had manta class apparently add is wen we know anti class and the dealers you or manta was my jay and tit is y o us and the other kids who manta class they us all he is amazing he is a fat man and he comes down now just chimneys an the middle of the night and he gives just as young gentiles he is a lira but instead of in is cookies and guess well last night because he is friends s way our dad we cane down our chimney and he let this milkman are not he the greet at my parents pot in the grave and he ate all of the cookies principle said professor adman is this true and apparently father just when no it is not entirely show and the principle said what you mean it is not entirely show and my father's that shorelaniate the cookies i jays wrong want ta did not come to our house and my mommas there was a significant pass on the other end of the found and then the principle went a do not want tat didn't come to your yet christian my father explained he explained that call was bereft and that she and know where to go and that he head reservations about this but he let a tapping cause he thought i was actually really valuable teachable moment where he could explain to his children that doing the thing sanders in jewfish values may not always appear conventionally jewfish and more than anything else doing this for this woman who really a power toot really was a classic example of which use which originally call mitzvah whishmeans good deed principle listens that explains my at finishes the principle said professor leman i understand re coming from but your wrong was what you have actually done is you have introduced this holiday that is foreign and corrosive into your home and you have clearly confused your children and perhaps harm to them permanently we have given him this holiday and next year going to take it away from them what is second do this is not a good deed this is in midst of uts idle worship which is the most grievous sin that you can possibly commit and you and your wife need you begin repenting for that right now and my father to his credit went where clearly rabbi you do not understand the meaning of christian and then he has men the next to is one man show just for us to he can so to onion in canary i know when he is dining to show to your city go to alias adman comedy tot come to mayor except of his story was lettuce for a show by nevi to in could coming up the hottest sexes writes of it is a wonderful life that other revelations about a very old film fromrofirst time viewer that is in a minute om tgogobobogridio won or program continues tismaric a life myraglass to day's programmed baby's first christian steric the people trying something for the very first time at christian and what that does for them we arrived dent three of our show at three buffalo gals cant yo come out to night an stor ay a the new experience s somebody is having at christmais is simple we have a grown man a man who loves films classic film's obscure films new films all kinds of films and hi seen tons of them who somehow has never seen the most evasive move that is out there christian it is a wonderful live the man somebody is been on the show a bunch one of our from producers no drumming i executive aged or a manual burry is in real life friends with nail id took it upon yourself to change his life forever or possibly not at all a shown the film have watched ta lot of move is with mel it is fun because he gets giddy and excited about showing you move you have not seen you always know you are going to have a thoughtful conversation afterwards but i also sometimes hate it when he recites all the dialogue and dazed in confused while your trying to watch it hem how ad he miss this move that is been on television every year since he was born i really i feel the christian christian movies that i love a the movies with christian in the background all brutish movies but like love asshole or i hard or movies would christian in that background christian in the foreground have never seen the one with the little kid with the glasses a christian story yet but the movie that are just christian i just did not have a inclination to see them i think it is because christian for me was always in the background i was as you was witness a christian was a thing that happened around to me no christian tree no christian carols no christian movies give in that what is your favorite a christian move christian in the background move i guess is but ism going them i think hood is clearly my favor christmamovy i mean i i i hate to be traditional as as edition i mess a at o man a lot of people allow men will say that dhotis i i christian it is is it just your favorite my it is in my tat five cons mas stonily need you see is a classic example of the problem i think there is a world a people out there who have not seen it is a wonderful life because the impression is it just some corny hallmark move weirdly i think the most popular christian maybe out there is also somehow the most unrelated by people meal to be a from about this i love it is a wonderful life i love the romance of it the darkness the humor i love jimmy start that actor and his bumbling charm guys paddles the broken bannister i love it all it is not just my favorite christian film it is my favorite film and want real to see what i see what do ago it is wonderful life it is a christian move because it happen it is always unaided on christian but and i know i think i i thing masses is involved something wrong here is what else he thinks he knows jimmy steward it is in black an wite and he saw something on into gran that it is about a person losing everything which makes me think it is maybe it is some kind like you will did re telling of the job story who can and o at a guess another reason it is a wonderful life holds a special place in my heart that ending of the film actually makes me get a little very ism not a crier ism embarrass by the idea of a film making me cry but for lots of people i think it is a wonderful life sneaks up on you do you think ye will cry i mean at old absolutely will not cry thou anththy i can think of that i cry that was there was a willsmits move where he played a poor father once i cam with the man them phase of happiness yes was of happiness you would hide during passive cause he had this thing of be has some long speech above failure as a man and o low i feel i do not know on you might cry e ai man of a was for yous alloy if give if there is a longespeech about failing is a man and make yo of cry that is that is a a a me start the film in case you meal have not seen it the move is about gorge badly a bright goofy and friendly young man ho wants to see the world but keeps getting stuck in his hometown first sits a job that keeps him there his father passes and he takes his place running the family business then it is a romance gorge meets marry at a dance where they fall into a pool ad they are force to walk home in whatever dry clothing they can single together marry is in a bathrobe and gorge is in a football uniform three sizes to bag bag cannot you come out tons i ad meal loves a from come a good meek you yet another most me talk that i tell you with a pettish girl to well why do not you say a o a a be also is i is a this is a wat ours is a me this is a very have i talking to watch wish we do i u a to a de o that why do not u u s t all six this is amazing this is o ha o a to you is is she o a the chemistry between the two leads on this fateful walk home an can tell meals at least somewhat sol gorge and marry get married and just when gorge is about to get out of town travel with his wife there is a bank a then after that a for arable he's time his face with another obstacle stuck he sticks around rise to fix it and till one fateful christian eve his business is about to go under be has of a careless mistake made by one of his impose but gorge is a one he will be held responsible he is lost feels he has no place to turn he goes home marrying the kids are decorating for christian and he snaps i is a long every time while you call is a happy family why we have t have always ki to go not marry christian e is it need we wit i is the does on a a a l who an a is horrible gorge wishes a never been down and an angel name clarence makes his wish come true war he sees what the town would be if he did not exist and is horrible ruled by money grubbing robber baron's nobody has jobs or who he will points out it is very much a film he has seen back to the future only then does gorge realize that impact his life has made and that he in fact had a wonderful life sorry can't help myself a r clarence takes back gorge's wish he runs home to his family and then everyone in town shows up and gives him money his business was survive o s o i s o t i ad look over any no tears but when the film ends he tells me that he liked it and he was surprised by it and recognize that it was not just a christian film i definitely forget of we chrstasta i stop thinking about the christie does not feel that that does not feel whodsable until they sing of i to funny when you are saying at the beginning that you ware oh i christian makes or christmasmes in the beckons is the yet this is this is one of those things acted even the old exams amuse we years thing it is the christian wage does not really come back to christian it is not a bout that wo o yet is along is a a get octet say for they locate the bolt the feme of both of them is to the things are not as bad as you think is that dis your life could that if you to and appreciate your lie o it not even just if you its thought just that you stop and appreciate you it is that circumstance dire circumstance forces you to appreciate you life an my hard assures of ridiculously absurd berries i convince makes it that he appreciates his his marriage in his family more and he fights to say this welled about them that is any the thing i love's the most by them will be howling that is kind of a romantic film it is wat everything i have is great is should go back and save it and this is that same thing o just in the moment when things are bad you can feel it was not worth it but if you stop and look at it it is worth saving it is with for serving it is the in of the year maybe the these kinds of moves just suppose to to mind as they among some things you did long triton thing dislike it is ultimately worth it an enough but maybe that is a common thing like moves at air at the end of the year may be me just want to be reassured going into the next year that what we did was not completely awastence time at one point while we are talking about the film we'll asked by a cry at that moment the towns people come out to support gorge and i say it is nice to think that people might recognize all that you do for them tell tells me maybe that is what am emotional because i do a lot for other people and yells was maybe that is why he is not emotional because well he does not not news to me cabin point what i did for him this christian gave him the gift of watching it is a wonderful what he did for me got me to watch diehard manelbury is i ha sinsentin o that that for single bells such he call i celebrating who christian first of iron this year one that she is still puzzling through hi she my marriage was over by last christian but i did not notice because i was having such nice time one of my at as many radiant qualities was how much he liked t the holidays i was in star contrast to me a misery garland who recently escaped a bog and is allergic to natural sunlit i did not really grow up celebrating christian i was raised hen do by emigrants who just did not really care about the holiday the extent of our decorations was a sparse plastic tree with screwed in branches that looked if a spruce had recently been set plays our family's dedication to the holiday was always cartunishly pathetic but when i met my acts a little over ten years ago i realize that being with him went being with a christian person it was joining a cult where the belief structure was built around a glazed ham being with him met we bought a real live tree year after year felling our apartment with pine needles that it'd fined until we bought the next real live tree does not it smell great he would say and i reply with no because years of cigarette smoking has robbed me of a sense of smell my ex husband was practically competitive about gift giving a was giving me the best gift the thing i wanted sometimes even the several o things i wanted one year he took me to see a another year he bought me and intend consul that had been reliably sold out for months the year after that delicate diamond studs for my non deserving years i got him a bag three times just three different bags i do not know he seemed to need a lot of bags i do not know what ism doing out here o hey and a i was in and as i i i a i too i resented christian and his love for it often we used to fight about how i wanted to go see my family for the holidays even thoughthere was not much of a holiday to speak of and how he wanted to go back to his sleepy little home town with the three carsenta class parade and his stepmother's gingerbread village at the grandchildren scared over and the minsauce with his dad's lamb and the christian brunch with his mother i was always fighting against my instincts to hate everything to be cynical to ask to be left alone i did not christian because it required much sincerity and emotional intelligence i clearly obviously still lack we separated in february and he is now off building a life i know nothing about i was worried about how he would do alone at christian but who is alone in actuality me the christian hater ism french at the top of the mountain looking down at the denizens of hooville asking and the smallest voice possible do they miss me down there because though i was always loth to admit it i did many things about christian with his family i did how i always felt warm and soft between remember twenty third and twenty six i was a big fat baby in a crush blanket i became comfortable with it and eventually i learned to look forward to it christian with him and his people was the closest to cortical zero have ever gotten in my life my ex husband's mother and stepmother always told me they loved me on christian day when we exchanged gifts and i always said at back i meant it too a rarity for me i liked t being a daughter in law and offering to help with the turkey even though i have no idea how to cook a turkey there was comfort in opening the garage door and seeing his cousin's piled in there wearing old bath's wetters chain smoking and fighting over who stole whose lighter all these forty something years reverting to who they were when they were seventeen my ex were up somewhere without the pollution of a big city you could always we the stars i wish i had spent more time looking at them to marry into a family that loves christian is to be conscripted into something that feels pleasingly conspiratorial exactly what you need to do and wear and for whom the days pass and in due closer to remember twenty fourth and you have a precise awareness of what is expected of and for you and when the holiday is done you have all these little secrets to whisper to each other in delight remember that year my mom put brownsugar in the eggs she made for christian day brunch my husband would whisper into my mouth while we lay in bed after we return to our lives in new york to the albatross at increasingly was our marriage it'd laugh and say yes but we ate it because we love her and we love each other right we love each other say it one more time to ism sure that you are our now all i feel is this constant twinge in my gut it is having a tale cut off i was not supposed to even have one but i did for a while and now i do not i thought about spending christian alone this year i could do something devastating and romantic take myself on a solo vacation maybe some ere sunny where it'd swan around an drape fabric and look sad and hot and sad maybe it a resort every one there would think i had a secret but the secret is ah ism sad instead on both hands i count the people i will not speak to this remember his folks his siblings his nieces an nephews the cousin of his that was my favorite the other cousin of hiss who alwayspent too much time touching my lower back his aunt the always called me sash even ten years in it'll add this pain to the several others that hardened from the inside out the first year of divorce is just a march of agonies every notable event the first when you do by yourself first birthday where we do not even speak first family medical crisis where we do not cling to each other driftwood in a sunny and now our first christian apart gamy grief around my divorce remains wildly on predictable i do not have any strategy or plan on how to cope with the holidays i just have to walk through a t j man and glare at the christian display and how i have no use for a santaclas cookachar i never did but now i really do not in the end i decided to just go home this year and lick my wounds amongst my own family my twelve year old niece since the stela celebrate christian with glee there are cookies to be ice and an embarrassment o riches under the tree and a fire place and am any dock sending beans who'll gladly snap a hunk of her the of of your fork even my dad enjoys christian if first he will never say no to a slisif can pie after a dinner that he complains does not have enough nasal i could conceivably find pleasure in this holiday again if i worked at it but i do not want to write now it is not that i or dislike the holiday it is simply that now it hurts my feelings i crave nothing more than in difference to view christian is but another holiday that is not mine e stir nice need you will not see me crying over

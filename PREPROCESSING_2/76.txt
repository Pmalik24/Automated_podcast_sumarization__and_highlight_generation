the menshvarsh responser by expressivepian protect your on mine privacy today at express vepiantacams flashes less than a month ago we saw the worst attack on news since the halocost since then we have also seen the worst globalsbik in antisemitism since the halocost according to orders quote in countries where figures are available from police or civil society groups including the united states triton france germany and south africa the pattern is clear the number of anti memetic incidents as gone up since october seventh by several hundred per cent compared with the same period last year such incidence range from verbal abuse to threats to property attacks to actual assaults some are happening on our nation's cases this one happened at hazard where the editor of the hazard larovyou ubrakim batman joined in ha oundyour student resin your student around again one an people is som the editor of the hazard aroma as ire feminism also extends into the administrative hauls of our universities georgetown just hired the radical antisemite anise johns as new assistants rector of academic affairs here are some of her posts sis jury seventh quit ever since going to annuwive a deep seemed hatred for yo leaps they bring out the worst in me why i call them zyobleaps because their dogs this is the kind of person who apparently gets hired at gorge meanwhile iliaschipero a law professor was thrown out of his job for the crime of suggesting that jobidon was picking judicial nominee based on rase which he said himself meanwhile some jewfish businesses are being boycotted for the crime of being jewfish businesses according to the washington post more than thirty jewfish eateries in markets in philadelphia are now being hit with boycott organize by a procamas group because they are quote owned by pianists even some shops that are not even own by news are being boycotted because they serve has rail food because according to the pily palestine coalition such a food is quote a means of racing palistinian existence on quote but there something peculiar about all the medureports about the extravagant spike an antisemitism every single story also carry's notes about supposedly concomitant rise in his lamaphobia this is odd to say the least what beheld does lamaphobia have to do with antisemitism the answer is precisely nothing precisely nothing that is unless you wish to suggest the response to antisemitism is linked with his lamaphobia that if you wish to oppose radical moslamantisemitism that in fact is in aspect of his lamaphobia which of course is precisely what antisemite are suggesting these days take for example quorrisailor of the council on america islamic relations care is most frequently cited group in america on quote rising is lamaphobia car is also group that by the way was an uninvited conspirator in the trial of comas front charity the holy land foundation sailor himself refuses to canter boycotts on jewfish businesses he told the washington postquote it is one hundred per cent on the table to criticize supporters of is radio parties caritself accuses israel of quotetextbook ethnic cleansing and war crime for defending itself trots out antidromic extraordinary lands are sore and promotes the hamal that ihram boy to hospital of course it was palcinian is policy hod on october seventh the date of the comas masker car national tweet quote we join the america muscle community in reaffirming our support for the palistinian people's right to freedom and calling for an end to the s really occupation which sparks the deadly violence that we see again and again including today on october seventh before any is daily response at all care also called for an end to america eight to israel and the abrahamicords the group has not offered a single word condemning comas in other words cares antiseptic good thing the bide administration infamously invited care to participate in its national antisemitism strategy back in may care is by any stretch of the imagination a giant fomenter of antisemitism but that of course is the point of focusing on supposed is lamaphobia the goal is to treat response to antisemitism as a form of is lamaphobia for example sailor claims it is his lamaphobia to publicized the names of students who signed petitions siding with cams while simultaneously blaming its not antisemitism to bit jewfish business is because their jewfish fascinating colombia university is playing the same game the president of colombia university sent out a letter yesterday rising the quotepersistente and perseverance of students who have signed letters supporting comas after their names and faces have ben shown publicly opposing comas means is lamaphobia apparently the legacy media fill the same way too that is precisely we sin toctober seventh the media have rushed to link antisemitism and is lamahobia was though the two phenomena are part of a cycle of hatred that the disgusting wrong take that excuses antisemitism through false charges of his lamaphobia buts an extraordinary commentate on the left these days one variation on the theme comes from alexandera o cost courtesy we as now emerged as on of the nations leading antisemite she now accuses the america israel public affairs committee of duo being an extremest group at tempting to undermine america democracy antarganing members of color yes those wily news and their dirty shackles are clearly the problem as antisemitism around the nation spikes they must be stopped according to to we the bide administration itself is falling into the trap of linking antisemitism anis lamaphobia a link that has the purposeful goal of demonizing opposition to comas fearful of their own base the bide administration announced yesterday a white house national strategy to combat is lamaphobia again in the middle of the worst spike an antisemitism of my lifetime or my parents lifetime cohesion panics plan quote for too long museums in america an those perceived to be muscle such as grabs and seeks have en cured disproportionate number of hate field attacks and other discriminatory incidents in actuality seeks our targeted far more often than muscles according to the afbiai despite representing just a few hundred thousand people in the united states news represents round sixty per cent of all victims of federally monster hate crime despite representing about two per cents of the america population but is lamaphobia is the real issue here is vice president coal hers announcing the new initiative yesterday as e result of the homateraitacanatria anhumanitan hisisencasa we have seen an attic in antihatenin anti er antisemite anislamaphobi inside acres america including the rudalataof hastened america in lismaslam and the killing of six yer old ta senseless at avaunt the the department is justice is investigating as hey ha ha postman people an oration the past few days and weeks he brought about all to familiar fears fears at they won't be targeted profile or tat simply because of who they are how they work or how they look again linking these two things is ridiculous the case that she sites by the way which is a horrifying crime against a palistinian america at mom and her child horrifying more fine crime condemned by literally everyone you cannot find a new in america who will not condemn it however you can find care national that will not condemn comes why is the white house playing this came because there a tempting to buy back the support of radical muscles across the united states here in rage that the white house has coded with israel instead of compass the latest pulse show that nearly six and ten america muscles agree that commons was justified in attacking israel that part of their struggle for a palisinian state the white house is trying to buy off the comes fans by jabbering about the supposed victimhood to which those comas fans are subjected it is perverse it continues to drive a false narrative that opposition to compass and opposition to comas fans is opposition to muscles more broadly a proposition that muscles themselves should reject although we are still waiting for a lot people to do the modern muscles have been conspicuously silent if the bide administration feels the necessity to keep radical muscles in their electoral collision by pandering it's the something pity nasty about their moral status inviting anti feminism as they claim they actually want to do in just one second will get the situation in brain which is going to become a lot worse one recourse of the next few weeks first i tell you it been very trustful period an traveling a lot it is hard for me to get my fruits and veggies onto not the veggies all it much to begin with this is why i bee relying on balance of nature balance of nature fruits an veggies our great way to mature ouregeting essential nutritional ingredients every single day balance of nature uses in advanced cold packing process than in capsulate fruits in veggies into whole fled supplements without sacrificing their natural antiaccidents the cases are completely void of additives fillers extracts synthetics passivize attend sugar the only thing in balance of nature's fruit and very capsule are well fruits and veggies there is never been an easier way to make sure you are getting your daily dose of fruits and veggies balance of nature sent a bunch of fruit very capslsdown of the studio for my teem to try everybody is feeling brighter more energy healthier i love balance of nature because it helps me make my busy schedule a lot more manageable bout to balance of nature i commit use promo code should pure right now to get thirty five present for first order as they preferred cussomarin and abusing balance of nature myself its great go to balance of nature dot come protocol hour pure for thirty five percent off that first preferred order and get the healthy outrank that you require to get you through the day balance of nature dot come promocode should pure o case over in brain a lot of this is get a come to a head because apparently there is a planned pro comas rally a million strong march in favor of compass and of course against those horrible news who are defending themselves in israel they can do it on remex bran stay according to the up express an m p is now called for the military to be drafted in to keep the peace in onion after emerge that he is protestors are organizing the march on remembrance say thapplan ta of the protest nonmember eleventh will clash directly with these years remembrance stay it comes a day before the annual sends have memorial for remembrance sundae despite the head of the met sir mark rally telling the onion assembly the protesters quit will not be allowed to near the official events or to destruct them they are serious concerns about how such a large protest can take place where maintaining law and order a try m p has told the express that the metropolitan police and city con who is the mayor of onion must ask for military assistant crawled m p hairy smith's ad quote after consecutive weeks of demonstrations where the senator another national monumentshave been grossly disrespected it is completely in appropriate for further protest to be held over remembrance we ken i that i enough confidence the mare of onion or them at police under him to properly handle the situation given their past poor record and that of course is exactly right mean the fact is that the west imported a huge number o radical museums who hate news and hate the west and who've ben taking advantage of the great material benefpicins of the west to live there that's not every muscle they are many muslin who are happy to live in a place triton or the united states and who are happy to engage with western countries and imbibed from the well of western values they are many of those people there just not the people where marching in favor of commons and those people at they are a lad of those people and trying to pretend that what trying pretend that is not happening in the face of images they are extraordinary from places onion or from a merit media's cole campus that is absolutely foolhardy now what is amazing about all this is that because the media have basically taken the side of commssinis conflict which was the most predictable thing they swivel directly from we cannot believe the atrocity the cross created to israel is committing atrocities every single day its absolute terrible the occupation to states that parting every commostolking point because of that your stagnancy wavering inside the began administration and and it is it is only coming from a radical few by the way it does show the power the legacy media and for all the talk about a legs media has been challenged or overthrown it's true them in completely overthrown they sell than enormous amount of weight with members for example of the bid administration all it takes is a radical few people to apparently move the democratic coalition tart placating commons in some way yesterday the jobidon was at a fund razor and at this fund razor he was hellcat by a a a person calling himself a female rabbi on this person again has about as much to do with nudism as a buttered lobster here is a here is quote quote rabbi just cot rosenburg who is neither a rabbi nor apparently a woman a calling for a sense fire jobidon then answered quote i think we need a pause applause means give time get the prisoners out ism the goy the convince by to call for us us fire to let the prisoners out ism the got the talk to c c to convince him to open the door the a the heckler was escorted out by secure while singing sense fire now this by the way is a picture of gonna what rabbi just to cot rosenburg adjust just a just a normal rabbi you came you can see the this person probably has their benin degree from es of university from meets i that this this person obviously is knowledge table in all aspects of hollokha i mean except for every single aspect of hollocha by battue this a postage a a gottlehud door over here i notes a lot of here for people are not inside you orthodox community but everybody who is northodoxdand right now is laughing because ism that is an absurdity piled on top of an absurd what is amazing no is that the democratic party seems increasingly interesting in ignoring it is own it is own voters mean the reality is that young voters in america democratic young voters our against israel but everybody else in the united states is very much in favor of israel whining away homos in fact pulling dater from echelon insights quote who do you think is mostly responsible four civilian casualties in the got a strip total number sixty four per cent comose is in the battleground states sixty four per cent comes fourteen per cent israel twenty two percents on shore i mean that is strong supports that is very very strong support four israel in the battle ground states this a popular position in fact even among demographic groups that the bid administration is on just proportionately rely upon save for example black voters black voters support israel over comose in who is responsible for the the spilling casualties they a homos fourth four percent two twenty per cent in fact even among young voters quart supposedly biding quordemographic thirty per cent of people aged eighteen twenty nine say homos twenty four per cent say israel fourth six per cent key onshore now es for usual arrangement the older you get in the united states apparently eye does can for wisdom if you get to sixty five plus crowd eighty three per cent say moss's responsible for cavilling casualties only four per cent say israel again demonstrating that is a young people in the united states are unbelievably ignorant and stupid but we knew that anyway by the way there is eight there is a hilarious video going around them play for you n a moment demonstrating just how little people know about anything when they say that they support comose or support quote quit free

bland he is going up people people express support for the contact oppressed without thinking about what are the oppressed are actually oppressed or actually good and that is one of the reasons why you see young people constantly resinating to the wrong side of conflicts they constantly do this they look at any conflict and because they have been taught to think in a deconstructionist way because they think of all relationships as relationships of power and his what the have been taught in their schools what them ben taught in their universities because when they the first thing they do is they say whose powerful and who has less power and whoever is powerful must be bad an whoever is power miss must be exploited oppressed and they before good and of course that is lie but they not think about any of that stuff an to they sign onto these movements until it is too late obviously now the thing about this is that the democrats should know better but apparently they do not now you are hearing rumblings that the biding administration is going to try to put pressure on israel for some sort of humanitarian sees fire or to ship fuel in to the gosastrip let men explain something bout this fuel situation come ass pas hundreds of thousands of gallons of fuel they are using it to maintain their presents in these tunnels because when the fuel goes out all their generators go out when t generators like count if underground they would have to come up and artily fight the rallies men instead of rats but instead what they are doing is they are staying down in the tunnels and they are hiding their civilians on top said if israel has to strike the tunnel civilians get killed and the they can go to the compliant press the complacent press the room ass press and then get those people to mini their line that israel attempting to kill civilians when israel is the only party in this conflict attempting to minimize the killing of civilians i should point out at this point the commons is the governing power he got strip any governing powers first responsibility es to protect its citizens that is the first responsibility in hi not because israel for it for example right now cause below threatening on the northern border is real oo thirty thousand of its own citizens and move them inland from the northernmost known talks about that of course that is a population movement of news do not cares about that by thewaysbeing of other population movements pakistan is now expelling one point seven million off gas from pack stand back into have canister now on carrskos slimy muslin the matter because when museums do horrible things museums no one cares at all in fact that the turns out when muscles do horrible things to just old people do not seem to care very much it is only when choose defend themselves that people really seem to start carrying lot in any case gaze is filled with fuel it just all control by commons when you ship in more fuel it is not going to power the hospitals it is going to power commons in fact there is a reason why commons apparently has station virtually all its fuel sources under all she a hospital notes power the hospital they ben planning they'll shove a hospitals running out of fuel and literally a few yards underground is the fuel why because t v full is not going to the hospital that is the whole point s when you have people jo biding telling israel to ship fuel in that is immediately an be stole by comas to power their tunnels all you a doing is prolonging at this conflict all you r doing is making the situation worse meanwhile soave tony blinking trying to tell israel that maybe maybe maybe there should be some seize firers they do not to stray let me make the s la israel on a time line has been engaged in the ground conflict part of this war for less than a week for less than a week and and already the west is starting to lose its nerve again no shock from some of the usual suspects in of course prompted by the procomas media it's already he's starting to see the wavering members of the democratic coalition they were on to be that is all the the most left wing members of the democratic coalition it is senteredic urban from illinoi that is an herdic urban is the same guide who once compared america soldiers in a rock to poll pot and now this moral genius he is suggesting that he want a sense fire by the way a seas fire helps only one party in this conflict come ass the reason the they are begging screaming pleading for s he is fair annoys because israel toxically speaking is now surrounding gosh city a huge percentage of compass's leadership is in goes a city the reasontht want a see fire right now is to estop to re supplied to maybe smuggle people out that is the whole reason for the sense fire by the way there was a seas firing place better israel compass until october sixth than on october seven that disease fire was violated by the worst antiseptic killings presence the polices all the is moral dementia patient did urban calling for a seas fire on to have a comas truly truly vile cargo it this this fire needed now i think it is that we a under a in the conflicts o sides agree for example the rely of this an con soul art o s immediate cremes that is to de agita o whatever could be mad can gain cessation between the isralelysan the poistonans es fasten the is on on for tacos o whatever the rationoon beginning no re on tolerable level o we meed to have a radiation an the teslas that give some promise o future what it is it is reaching intolerable level which paras the intolerable pare the parer thy slaughtered fifteen hundred news and took another two hundred prisoner till munch foreign people is well is it what our holding america citizen's killed wench of america was at which parr that which is how what was the level at which it reached in tolerable for dicturban was it when there are some ugly pictures on to because wars ugly and terrific especially when your enemy is propping up winning in children in front of bones to try to protect their terrorists in i get of that the insane lack of people who are now suggesting that it's up to israel to stop killing terrorists betas those terrorist have chosen to hide themselves among civilians that is insane that is literally saying to terrorists the best thing you can do to protect yourself as hided with civilians that is what you are saying you are saying these smartest thing you can do is murder civilians on the other side and then run and hide behind civilians on your own side the more another its the more of lass of war you violate the more we can call on the other side to not kill you which is totally reverse of the invent of structure you want set up if the whole point of the rules of war is to get people into uniform on a battlefield away from civilians then you cannot reward them for hiding behind civilians which is exactly what did urban wants to do same than with christy murphy chis murphy of course is the ridiculous senator from connecticut he is always been he is always been really soft when it comes to israel he says as have said consistently israel has a right an an obligation to defending people from terror attacks the terrific events october seven the compass terra who plane and executed those attacks must be held accountable and the ability of comes to carry out similar attacks in the future must be eliminated it is time for israel friends to recognize the currents operational approaches causing an unacceptable level of civilian harm and does not not appear likely to achieve the goal of permanently ending the threat from comas get from chis murphy o gelid military advice from christy murphy ism just wondering who knows more about military battle in the middle east chis murphy or the entire idea i mean let us be fair he did get his see from university of connecticut playschool i mean that is that is pretty impressive in terms of his military credentials to talk about what is going to be successful militarily and what is not when he says this is not dedicated told eliminating compass or unlikely to limited then why's compass standing for the sea's fire why is compass want the sea's fire why is class on christy murphy side presumably if learn the best interests of israel to primulas he is fire who be compass not wanting a sense firing israel wanting a seas fire trying to pretend that he is a friend of israel law under cutting israel military policy is ridiculously stupid or corrupt or both he says that we have learned from america own count a terrors om campaigns just proportionately large number of civilian casualties come with a moral cost but also as star teach a cost as terra cups feed off of grievance is cause by civilian harm israel is doing its best to distinguish between civilian and terrorist in the gosh trip compass is attempting to obscure that and he is now declaring the comes should effectively have him immunity he is share israel that desire to destroy the threat from mass now you don't is the know israel cares about the impact of this warn innostan palstinians even as they track comma's hide outs inside hin below mass apartment buildings in schools but the way in which the current campaign is being wage suggest they have not struck the right balance between military nhecessidary and military necessity and proportionality he says he urges israel to shift to a more deliberate and proportionate counter arris am campaign surgically tag and compassion as lemmata ho leaders and terrors inform structure while more highly prioritizing the safety of civilians ism him just wondering what exactly is outline i him what he means he wants more jewfish soldiers to die in gaze going house to house i presume lout that we mats the should just say that out loud that he thinks that the the jewfish army has an obligation to get many many many of its soldiers murdered on the streets of gaze by terrorist and some civilian quasi civilian supporters i mean by the way the distinctioning civilian and and non civilian is very real but it is very difficult when people blur the line there many i civilians people who are not formal members of compass took part in the actual attacks of october seven there is film of them doing but of course cristmurphy it is not about principal here trying to argue with people christy murphy it is very difficult because frankly cristmurphy does not care about the truth an he does not care about the reality he cars about the outcome and the outcome for him is that he wants pressure on israel the media want that to which presumably is why they are constantly blasting out but truly blasting out come ass propagandist just couple days ago i played on this so a video report from the washington post that featured some social media influences from gaze one of them was a woman named plastic sliced what turns out that a lot of these quotenquote social media in fencers from gaze it turns out a huge number of those people a actual propaganda o front for comas shocker according to the jerusalem post plenty alicott has more than a million followers and calls herself an independent journalist but spread the lie on instagram and in an interview with brutish t v that israel bomb the all only hospital and killed more than a thousand people she told prison's go news quottagenacide literal age en aside an not a massacre in her post she has not provided any explanation for the commencement the air strikes gaze namely the october son of massacre another influential figure is son idea who presents herself as a fill maker hailing from gap philistine wit the substantial following numbering in the hundreds of thousands her posts have received indorsement from well known figures associated with antisemitism and conspiracy theories following thoctoberseventh massacre she posted a note in arabia on social media for every action the is a reaction this means whole is expected after seven five years of occupation and seventeen years of siege what was expected of us she is ben quoted as a quit ambassador of good will on a c news and legitimized on the b b c and this is very common me again they are still using the council on america is comic relations which was once labelled an uninvited to conspirator in a conspiracy to funnel money from e false charity call the holy land foundation to comas and they are being quoted by the media as a source on is lamaphobia i search the entire caranational feed yesterday they have not once condemned comas not once ever literally ever and yet they are there scene is some sort of moderate force the mediate perfectly willing to overlook the actual extreme antesmetic radicalism of many of the sources they re using an operate israel that is their favorite thing to do and again this is the game the media ignore context the ignore realities of war the ignore who exactly is hiding civilians in front of their boys calling coins on sign ingoing a terrific job on this here she us yesterday asking an invited to benjamin at nah how many passing ins were killed in a strike on a refuge cam and he says well we we do not know the answer to that by the way comosaesn'tknow either there just lying the america media but heres calling contasunlic six times why did is real strike again here an you know how many civilian had been killed in theteria as a result of the strike yesterday to day the we taking at send unless command tank is the main to in e mass tin to the san as you wouldn't to they a make the we be any to they we people ben the lad an a san any we and to the an we on had not any bad's tat we and an making nae they have a the distastes and anyone who as in boy this is a commander of the oration we haven deed to find then and to being in the testis i cant that you are not acknowledging how many i sin israel do have an estimate of how many civilians or celt i sing you have an estimate of how many civilians a there when you make a calculus on went to strike tell if that throng but when you defied on striking target thing you say a military targets but are also where civilians are and how many civilian dead ti israel believe are acceptable and an air strike if it is a military try get shows to be wrote e any potato tan to a even as en a us the an ane o is reticular station is that i thing tasty not half ben la e tat ate because we wan tain people the to we go non a the the idea wat a again see an that putting the pressure on and this is the goal of the media put the pressure on is rail why's an israel taken care of the civilians that are is not israel to a better job wit this villains there reports that during that job ye strike that they are women and children who literally marched out by compass literally march up by comes in order to get them killed this is not a surprise they say this crap openly again who'd be one thing of our lodging it it is another thing for commas o just say it and they constantly say it ad the ever by just ignores it it is unreal it is unreal this is why you can hear this frustration in my voice has been frustration my voice for month why because usually am in the business of trying to provide what i thing our reasonable arguments to generally people i think our reasonable and are able to here reasonable arguments an if ism wrong ism wrong but we can make reasonable arguments an we can disagree these things when commas says a thing and then i repeat that they have said the thing and then people say i do not care other ma ai the thing done matter it is israel fault or sure come say that thing that they do not really mean deep down or sure coma said it and they really mean it but the real reason is that it is it is the news from you are no longer engaged in anything remotely resembling a rational con vernation you're engage in a propagantistic effort to propagate genocidal due hating group that openly declares its desire to exterminate just and then you expect people to have arguments with that there is noway to have an argument with that position he's that is not that is not a rational position and it is not a position that is capable of being breached by rational thought that is the part that is extremely hard but you sing it all over the media from supposedly rational people you got era cline who is declaring what is going on a gossips four hundred nine elevens what ism sure the statistically that is true you now would stop that commas tomorrow why do not any of you people to call for compass to surrender it is amazing you cannot get a single one of the people hoard to crine the horrors happening in goa to say the commas just surrender it'll end literally tomorrow of comas surrenders they are holding two hundred and forty two hostages right now including dozens of small children babies nine month old and they murdered fifteen hundred people in their beds in peaceful civilian villages and your idea is israel fault and all worse for to look out or the casual tea numbers they are created by commas specifically you will do this is just commas ache prop out of the mouth of mainstrmedia reporters golstineant health official say that more than eight thousand thoustinnians an gosh have been killed since october seventh and i want a note here that there is a fog of war it is possible's numbers are wrong it is also of course possible the prickly by the end of this these numbers would be much higher but if you take something the eight thousand numbers right well than one way the for of october seventh was driven hole one way it is scale was driven home to americanths was to put it in terms of nine elevenths i just think for population jobiitin said it was fifteen nine elevenths if i take got same math than goes experience far around four hundred time elevenths yen descriptive contacts just give casual the numbers without noting whose responsible for the thing get as have sad i said the sat oxford sad this at cartridge now if all you look at is just proportion in casual to numbers then every america war every western war of pretty much all time the west was wrong because it turns out that during world war to who died the most german if you look the brutish and theamericans first of the german lots more german did then brutish and america because that sort of the point of the war is to win the war you do not ten to win the war by losing more people literally the alienation on earth that tends to lose more people and whin wars is russia because they just throw endless masses of bodies at every single war historically speaking but generally speaking when you win a war that does it involve a lot of death on the other side and that is even when the other side is not hiding in civilian areas how much worse it when the other high aside is deliberately hiding in civilianareas and yet the media strip it

one of the truly amazing things about our disgusting legacy media is that the is supposed objective arbiters of truth and reality they just mirror the perspectives of the most radical members of the de colonize coalition s have talked on the show over the past couple of weeks about the philosophy that links for example black lives matter with the from the river to the a people what those people haven common why are their queers for plan why a all these people marching the same collision and the answer is beau they hate the less anything the west he is truly truly a horrifyingly bad place the leader of that coalition in the united states for a long time was tonahossi coats and hots treated with the sort of bazar reverence and respect despite the fact that hes a garbage writer ism sorry ism just on put it out there he is not a good writer he is incredibly purple he is been wildly overrated i i wont an't say the a poor man's names balding he is lake a dead mans names balding he it he does not have any of the skill he is not a good debater he is not he is not a good thinker he is not a good writer there is literally nothing appealing about him other then he uses purple language also dud really really stands for commons why because again a presservice is appressed colonize services colonized and all the rest of this yesterday and n as have said before the broader philosophy that is worth noting here the broader philosophy is hatred of the west you will notice that replete throughout what what this tonahossy coats person says not a shock again he wrote in his own book a book celebrated by our legacy media wore on the same side he wrote in his own book that on nine eleven an he sat at the top of his dormant building and watch the towers burn and smoked t blunt and felt nothing he literally writes tat in his own book becasethat is how much he hates the country and yet this person his seen is some sort of bazar moral exam play because he writes garbage between the world and me all between the word or real intellectual in any case here is auto intellectual tonahossy coats and again that the stuff that he spouts is almost indistinguishable from our will not objective media we have this thing or pen o boy if om a late come it to the calls thing an was om also a late come to cause of no violent what ism hen now know a n knowing what that is a men to our history starring him taste the rs a can know he is a late comers the cause of non violins he is literally standing for the most violent terror group on the planets in come ass right now en literally every governing body of the palicinians he's a violent teragroup the passing an authority is loach hod fat which is military wing withe p he is our all evil but do not were he is an advocate non violence hest it is beyond party retold be beyond party except that people are stupid people are to masonic that they have no clue the what he is saying is garbage and yet shallhave to know a few things to know how due he is but it does matter people do not know things he gets away with it there is no way in the world that we can liverinto the memory doctor baton he can is no wan to where we can lave it o the wait the ancestry of our movement defense of a war defense of indiscriminate banks or refuge you get we gins i criminal cannot do that we cannot do that we would be a disgrace too to our ansestis stories an o in look out and i would see roads that palistinians a use and roads that only israel just can us said i know this is caposifer a second past for second ha a he says that he went to he went to israel which he calls palestine is that i saw only roads that israelies could use in only roads the passion us can us actually that is not true they're roads that both palsonians and israelies can use those of the ones own by israel yo you have to get though a check point israel can make sure that you are not a terrorist and then you're free to use it as his palsonian or and then they're only roads the palsonians in use in fact there is no road that only is rallies can use there are roads that is rallies and palsnians can use if yore to a terrorist and then there roads that only parson us can use why because there are no news living inside the pain an authority none hat will be murdered there are none living under compass cause they would be murdered he is lying right off the bad is i how different colored license plates for different class people tat i know this is yes but stop it there different color liceneplace because palistnian authority people people living under the species the palsinour authority live under a different government of course that is saying you saw canada license plates and united states license plates a yes that is correct why would thy have is daily license plate thy are not his daily citizens is i sow communities that i can only describe as as secretary and what a out was a tremendous wait i thought the over thing i thing all of us feel that our actors insectile subsidizing apart time us subsidizing a segregation's water a him crossing cake he went on you say that islands a democracy america is the world's oldest democracy and that was the see point because again he hates america he hates the west he thinks that they are bad he benefits from them he plays on suckers in the west to pay him noodles of money to right his absolute dumpster fireworks and and they came tons of money to give stupid speeches and the he its on the west is the west has a suicide wish that is the only reason why the wet has ever tolerated people who spend all day just ripping on them and i say tolerate i mean people who they have imported because obviously citizens in the united states have free speech i will say however that making those people rich is at insane thing ton horsey coats is respect the deny comic had e button haricots that human was writing the super ho we actually until a ergo writing a superman move for j j arums that my that is how deeply imbedded in or culture the garbage if you only its a threat to america you got a totally wrong the threat does not have to come directly from comas can come from the entire decolonize coalition which just perfectly fine with violence do not be for by is garbage about non violent he is literally supporting people who do terrorist violence that is what he does and the media their view is almost indistinguishable and meanwhile israel defense minister gallant he says that compass has one choice here you can u the surrender or you can die which by the way is the proper answer to wen people slaughter an mas civilian citizens because their evil there is you gallant ten the defense minister of israel saying thus yesterday o we to going to stop cure we seine pop levels of can another enemy has to poptionsoite to i or to give a so the without anycodation g that right meanwhile hassanasralla who is the head of cabala hos supposed to make his first sort of wive in person appearance lebanon in years because is been hiding in a in a bunker somewhere why watch is people get killed on the norther on the northern word of israel for very long time he did not he gave his speeches a recorded speech from a suer somewhere and in his speech he of course called the attacks on israel heretic shul just reminder his babies and baronial back tarrogroup armed with a hundred fifty thousand rockets minimum pointed into the north of israel which is why their currently thirty thousand israelies for not living their homes in northern israel the big question of the day was going be whether fossa and oral led off a new husbalaled war my prediction had always been that that would not happen because cusballa understands that especially with two america air craft carrier stationed off the coast if they start a war in israel north they just will not exist it will be bloody horrible for israel and also lebanon will be destroyed because israel will be stretched and israel will have to whatever it have to do to maintain the safety of tone citizens son impala is basically mouthing off from what i can tell this point he is gin to continue to try to draw forces north away from the gnosis trip but it seems unlikely that he is going to push to hard to i the that he is been push to hard to go directly into war that is the that is the situation in terms of israel and the palcinians and hesballa and all the stall see how it develops over the week and meanwhile in the house of the united states government there has been a a vast disagreements about how to fund israel you have the bin administration which is trying to on together a bunch of things here trying to one together you crane the on sixty billion more dollars in you cranage some fourteen billion dollars in right to israel a few billion dollars for word security and seven billion dollars four ti on n there tying to lump all that together in a hundred an five billion dollar package well it johns new speaker of the house he push forward and then passed and israel only bill and the israel only bill is just ais israel and he does it by taking money away from the tiaras now the democrats are claiming of course tat this is a poison pill this house proposal is going note easily we have now game of chicken the game of chicken is that the democrats our hoping to wrong foot the republicans by getting them not to fun to israel in favor of not funding you crane and the republicans are trying to wrong to demo craft by saying guys why cannot joust give a directly to israel obviously ism on the right ringside of that argument aren't understand by these issues are the same they are not the battle in you crane ism fully in favor by the way off continuing to pride you crane the aid to maintain it is on security inside of the post twenty fourteen borders i we post twenty fourteen because right now you crane is trying to push into t donnas and crime i be fully in favor of them doing that if there is an natural possibility of the winning they have shown over the course of last year that that probably is not a possibility and the in fact that is extraordinary landlikely in fact you crane and ministers are now saying that is extraordinarily unlikely to the question becomes what the end of that word looks that does not mean they are in favor of undermining you crank security you crane should be funded to the point where it can certainly prevent you rush up from from doing this again plus ism very much in favor of degrading the russia military capacity since their aggressive on every front they can find including the desist drawing russia resources into battle in don bass a crime is fine with me in have a generalized problem with that but sixty billion out along money i that is not to furnish you and says slightly more complex assume then the issue of running israel and attempting to exterminate a in actual terror group commons which you can do and is achievable very achievable he is ta separating off the two causes makes a lot of sense but poolsides a now accusing each other of putting poison pills in their bills to wrong foot the other the poison pill for the republicans is apparently that they're trying to don the reason or to do this a democrats a mat about that here was chuckshumer saying that the democratic majoriteter is already declare his her the house to h proposal is not going anywhere it is it is it it is going that it is t effort even is coded gat he says that is going nowhere but the question is going t be whether the reverse is true whether the senate proposal which is the giant one hired fie billion dollar proposal we that get's rejected by the house and basically be now have a game of chicken as i say i thin the next step for my johns is probably to disconnect the israel aid from the is funding and i think that that again would wrong for democrats and if they go fin you do not want us that you love your tires much final just take that out and om and here is the israelate just passim no poison piss nothing a clean israel handbill the be very hard for democrats reject sone that is the next step that johns is going take if in fact the senate and present inbidin decide to veto biding his threaten to veto this particular proposal it will be interesting see whether he does veto that particular proposal in favor of we need to cram down said for you crane in the middle of all this no cam in other non middle east related news apparently say banker free you remember him he was the a to founder who basically bilked people of billions and billions of dollars i road peter to pay pals essentially time pyramid see la jury has now found say banker freed guilty and all seven criminal accounts against him the f ten founder faces de maximum sense of a hundred and fifteen years in prison a turning general maricarlan sand the statements em banker free thought was above the lots day's verdict proves that he was wrong he was ay he was a person who believed that his political connections we are going to allow him to get off shot free he was the biggest single democrat done in the last election cycle other members f tax gave some money to republicans as well the government flip a bunch of people against him including his ex girl friend caroling hellion and the former head of alameda and it x confounder marry wan who is hangman feed's child to run from man camp both pled guilty in remember and then cooperated his witnesses for the prosecution to get off easier as t an b c says the central question for juries to considerate was weather banker free to acted with criminal intents in taking customer sons from friar and using that money to pay for real estate venture investment's corporate sponsorship's political donations and a cover losses at climate after script prices plunge last year there is ten billion dollar in customer money that when missing hangman freed now awaits sentencing we will see how long he has of going to jail to one of the things that funny about to hold sambankmen free situation as he talked about when the story for broke is that ten hangman freed had built his entire persona around con duo effective asterism and the idea was if you give me a lot of money if you give me tons of money and i spend a lot it'll spend a lot that money on posies it'll spend a to of that money on the clauses that you love most it'll be really rich and s now the basic idea which is that one of the great aspects of capitalism is that when people become rich thing give a lot for charity that is true i give a lot for charity now when i make a other money then i did fifteen years ago and made a lot less money however the basic hiding behind altruism in order to justify his own business man practice and his political pay offs an all the rest was one of hangman feed's favorite things and he was made a year old for this who is put on the cover of magazine to him crammer praising him to the skies and he briefly held the title of the world's richest thirty year old he had an estimated noteworthy of twenty billion dollars in one ways he distinguished himself from his competitors was how i'lteruistic an magical he was going to be he was going to he was going to spend money on the things that mattered most and he took a bunch people in according to a columnist at coin dusk despite the wreckage he cause and the accompanying failure to do good there may numerous voices sympathetic taspiaf chief among them is one on author mi cellewis throughout his new book on ask fan tax going infinite he pains a portrait of asked his a misunderstood genius whose intentions were pure on his booster use continues to say things quote i think of him as a creature of modern finance and almost any period in history he's a a high school physics teacher well if louis is rights as this colonist he should be inviting modern finance wholesale after all as b f by s kipping the effort of honestly earning the money he gave away never action performed a genuinely altruistic need see this is one of the things the people shuldalso notice about altruism when it comes to the business world we ten to think of business and asterism as in opposition to one another or as though business is not a form of asterism if business is done right it is in fact the best form of asterism mi money's one of the great jewfish thinkers of all time my one's suggested the highest form of charity was giving somebody a job there's the highest form of charity not giving the money given him a job why he is turns out that the most goo that you do for the world is a sustainable method for generating things that are good for other people you not we usually call those markets an markets are usually where you generate as sustainable repeatable method of doing god thing for another person if i give charity eventually if i do not earn more money the charity runs out if i give you a job and that means that you can earn a living and meanwhile you are providing with good or services that i can use to generate more goods and services and then i can pay other people nodi can buy other things have helped many many more people that way that i would have i just gave away the money just giving away the money in some cases obviously justify their people who cannot work they are people children orphans what this is why the bible focusses when it talks about the sort of class of people who require charity on widows and orphans why because the ideas that widows a in to have a hard time to earning a living and orphans do not have anybody take care of them what it does not focus on are people whore capable of working and somehow you should give them charity be cause they they will not work or the idea that that charity is supposed to be specifically designed at at causes that could be better done in a sustain bleat you toilet sustainability markets create sustainability charity is generally unsustainable is interesting for example socialism and capitalism socialism is how do i redistribute everybody ease's money capitalism is how do i create entire and entirely new lines of business thus to support money earning by millions more people which is why when capitalism is tried it succeeds am i when socialism the best you can told about it with socialism is redistributing the gains that is all toucan talk about that is who the quote clod social democratic nations in northern rope are very capitalistic in the way they pursue business an then they just have they very strong welfare structures on top of that but if the entire system obviously where nationalized systems the entire thing would collapse who look t you us us a which is why it is always been alive to suggests that countries in northern rope are predominantly characterized by their socialism they are not they areprodominantly characterized but their capitalists business structures the dad's of of the the government of denmark have set as much when you call the socialist tho get annoyed it what are you what you talking bout as o nationalization of resources here there is redistribution of some resources at the top level in the same way that they have a mixed economy in other words the same as the united states its just that there mixed economy happens to be significantly smaller they're there population has to be significantly morhmoginis and they're redistributive weight tends to be greater but the the sort of point of sambakemen freed is that when you when you place asterism in differentiation from business you and up being a bad business person in re treating business as though business is the dirty part naturism is the good part when that is wrong have said this beforeinal thin again bill gates did more for the world by creating microsome than he has in giving way his billions of dollars to charity why because he is led to the employment of probably hundreds of thousands of people not just directly microscope but indirectly though his soft ware that ts a massive good to the world and we we pretend to think of the only that we judge people based on their intent and the intent if you are intense is purer that means that your action is more beneficent and that is wrong that just not true if i intend with this one dollar donation to do something good it just out of my pocket no benefit to me here is one dollar have done significantly less good than we do at this company which is employed three hundred people already folks thereat

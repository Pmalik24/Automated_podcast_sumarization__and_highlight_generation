welcome to the superman japonicas to science science pace to i meander supermen and ism a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine this podcast is separate for my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire to bring you zero cost consumer information about science and science related tools in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens at lentic greens is an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens on the reason i still take athletigreens once or twice to day is that helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which our vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called got microfilm and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens it get the vitamins i need the minerals i need and the phobics to support my microbic if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock come slash supermen and claim a special offer they'll give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitemend three k too there are ton of at and ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if wore getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient in vitamin d three and k too is also important because it regulates things carevascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic green stock om slash supermen to claim the special offer of the five travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar have talk many times before on this podcast about the key role of hydration end electrolytes for nerve sell function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium an potassium present in the preparation all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the preparations of electrolytes if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element do come slash supermen and you will get a free element sample pack with your purchase there all delicious again if you wan a try element you can go to element element do calm slash he firemen to day we are going to talk about dreaming learning during dreaming an unlearning during dreaming in particular unlearning of troubling emotional events now my interest in dreaming goes way back when i was a child i had a friend and he came over one day and he brought with him a mask that had a little red light in the corner he had purchased this thing through some magazine add that he had seen and this mask was suppose to dis a trigger lucid dreaming use a dreaming is the experience of dreaming doing sleep but being aware that one is dreaming and in some cases being able to direct ones dream activities if you were in a lose a dream and you want a fly for instance some people report being able to initiate that experience of flying or to contort themselves in to an animal or to transport themselves to wherever they want within the dream i tried this device am the way it worked as you put on the the mask ye a during waking state wide awaken you would look at the like light flashing in the corner then you would also wear it when you went to sleep at night and indeed while i was asleep i could see the red light presume through my eyelids although for all i know i d open my eyes i do not know i was asleep and then because i was dreaming and i was experiencing something very vivid i was able to recognized that i was dreaming and then tried to direct some of the events within that dream now us a dreaming occurs in about twenty percent of people and in a small percentage of those people they use dream almost every night much that many of them report their sleep not being as restorative as it would be otherwise now all this is to say a that use a dreaming and dreaming are profound experiences we tend to feel extremely a attached to our dream experience am this may explain the phenomenon of people who have a very intense dream they need to somehow tell everybody about that dream or tell some one about that dream i do not really know what that behavior is about but sometimes we wake up and we feel attached to what happened in this state that we call dreaming that there seems to be an intense need to share it with other people presume we to process it and make sense of it now numerous people throughout his try have tried to make sense of dreams and am in some sort of organized way the most famous of which of courses a sigmanfroid who talked about symbolic representations in dreams a lot of that has been kind of debunked although i think that a there is some interest in what the symbols of dreaming are and this is something that will talk about in more depth to day although not radian a theory in particular i think in order to really think about dreams and what to do with them and how to maxim eyes the dream experience forsake of learning and unlearning the best way to dresses is to look at the physiology of sleep to really just what do we know concretely about sleep first of all as we get sleepy we tend to shut our eyes and that is cause there are some autonomic centers in the brain some morons that control closing of the eyelids when we get sleepy and then we transition into sleep and sleep regardless of how long we sleep is generally broken up into a series of ninety minutes cycles these ultradian cycles early in the night these ninety minute cycles tend to be comprised more of shallow sleep and slow wave sleep stage one stage too et camera and what we call slow wave sleep it'll going to detail about what all this means in a moment and we tend to have less called red sleep r e m sleep which stands for rapid eye movement sleep and it'll talk about rapid eye movement sleep in detail early in the night a lot more slow wave sleep and less red for every ninety minute cycle that we have during a night of sleep we tend to start having more and more red sleeps a more of that ninety minute cycle is comprised of red sleep and less of slow wave sleep now this is true regardless of weather not you wake up the mill the night to use the restaurum or your sleep is broken the more sleep you are getting across the night the more red sleep you are going to have and red sleep and non red as it'll refer to it have distinctly different rolls in learning and unlearning and they are responsible for learning and unlearning of distinctly different types of information and this has enormous implications for learning of motor skills for unlearning of dramatic events or for processing emotionally challenging as well as emotionally pleasing events and as we will see one can actually leverage their daytime activities in order to access more slow wave sleep or non red sleep as will call it or more red sleep depending on your particular emotional and physical needs through a remarkable stage of life that we have a lot more control and power over than you might believe we will also talk about luce a dreaming resign talk about hallucinations and how drug induced hallucinations have a surprising similarity to a lot of dream states and yet some really important differences o q let us start by talking about slow wave sleep or non red sleep now realize that slow wave sleep and non red sleep are an exactly the same thing for your sleep of fycionatos out there i am lumping right now as we say in since there are lumpers and there are splitters and i am both sometimes a lump sometimes i split for sake of clarity and ease of conversation right now ism going be a lumper am when i say slow wave sleep i me none sleep generally although acknowledge there is a distinction slow wave sleep slow wave sleep is characterized by a particular pattern of brain activity in which the brain is metabolically active but that there is these big sweeping waves of activity that include a lot of the brain if you want a look t his up there you confined evidence for sweeping of of waves of neral activity across a location cartels across big swaths of of the brainstorm the called pons geniculate occipital a pathway this is brainstorm a thalamus and then cartel for for those of either interested although more of that is going to occur in remsleep now the interesting thing about slowwave sleep are the neromodulators that tend to be associated with it that are most active and least active during slowwave sleep and hers why to remind you neromodulators are these chemicals that act rather slowly but their main roll is to bias particular brain circuits to be active and other brain circuits do not be active these are the music playlet think of neromodulators and these come in the names of asedtocoling nor apineference eratonan and dopamine think of them as a suggesting playlets on your radio divisor classical music is distinctly different in feel and tone and a a number of other features from third wave punk or from om hippo right think of them is rising toward particular cobras of curl circuit activity one mellomusic verses really aggressive fast music or rhythmic music that includes lyrics verses rhythmic music that does not include lyrics that is at that is more less the way to think about these demodulators and they are associated as a consequence with certain brain functions we know for instance and just to review used coming in waking states is a neromodulator that tends to amplify the activity of brain circuits associated with focus and attention nor apineferan is e neromodulator that tends to amplify the brain circuits associated with alertness and the desire to move serotonin is the neromodulator that is released intends to amplify the circuits in the brain and body that are associated with bliss and the desire to remain still and dopamine is the neromodulatr that is released and thees associated with amplification of the curl circuits in the brain and body associate with pursuing goals and pleasure and reward ache in slowwave sleep something really interesting happens there is essentially no aseity coming asedocoling production and release and action from the two major sites which are in the brain stem which from a nucleus give it s apparbygeminal nucleus if you really want o no or from the forebrain which is nucleus psalms and you do not need to know these names but if you that is why i put them out there asedocoling production plumes it is just almost to zero and asedocoling as i just mention is associate with focus scans think of slowwave sleep as these big sweeping waves of activity through the brain and a kind of distortion of space and times that were not really focusing on any one thing now the other molecules that are very active at that time are nor epineferan which is a kilobit surprising cause normally in waking states nor up an affront is going to be associated with a lot of a heartless and the desire to move but there's not a ton of nor up an errand around in slowwave sleep but it is around there is something associate with the movement circuitry going on in slowwav of sleep and remember this is happening most sleep at the beginning of the night your sleep is dominant by slwwavef sleep very no sit calling very little nor up an efferent althoughthere is some and a lot of serotonin and ceratonan again is associate with this desire ah the sensation of kind of bliss or well being but not a lot of movement and during sleep you tend not to move now in slowwave sleep you can move you are not paralyze s you can roll over if people are going to sleep walk typically its going to be during slow wave sleep and what studies have shown through some a kind of sadistic experiments where people are deprived specifically of slow wave sleep and that can be done by waking them up in the as soon as the electrode recording show that there in slow wave sleep or by a chemically altering their sleep that it bises them away from slowwve sleep what studies have shown is that motor learning is generally occurring in slow wave sleep let say the day before you go to sleep you were learning some new dance move or you a learning some specific motor skill either a fine motor skill or a coarse motor skill let ay am its a new form of exercise a a some new cordninnated movements thiscobep am cordate movement at the level of the fingers or to be coronae movement the level ha whole body in and large him movements it could involve other people are to be a follow activity learning of those skills is happening primarily during slow wave sleep in the early part of the night in addition slowwave sleep has been shown to be important for the learning of detailed information now this is an always cognitive information were can talk about connive information but the studies that have been done along these lines involve having people learn very detailed information about very specific rules an the way that certain words are spelled they ten to be challenging words if people are tested and in terms of their performance on these types of exams and they're deprived of slow wave sleep they tend to perform very poorly we can think of slow wave sleep is important for motor learning motor skill learning and for the learning of specific details about specific events and this turns out to fundamentally important because now we know that slow wave sleep is primarily in the early part of the night and motor learning is occurring primarily early in the night and detail learning is occurring early in the night now for those of you that are waking up after only three four hours of sleep this might be informative this might tell you a little something about what you are able to learn and not able to learn if that were to be the only sleep that you get although fully that is not the only sleep that you get but we are going to dive deep into how it is that one can maximize motor learning in order to extracts ay more detail information about coordinated movements and how to make them faster or slower that might be important for certain sports i might be i almost certainly important for certain sports a it is going to be important for any kind of coordinative movement likes the learning to play the piano or am for instance how to a learn synchronized movements with somebody else may be i i mention the example of dance earlier if you have a me a a few years ago i set out to to learn tango because have some argentine a relatives in t if i was abysmal i need to return to that at some point am a the i was just abysmal and one of the worst things about being abysmal at learning dances that the somebody else has ta suffer the consequences also am i non now maybe in the month in narrow plactisiall explore that again as as a a self experimentation but the anythings to know are slowwave sleeps involved in motor learning in and detailed learning there is now a but of culling around at that time has the big amplitude activity sweeping throughout the brain and that there is the release of these normageles nor up in efferent and ceratonan and again that is all happening early in the night athletes people that are concerned about performance if you happen to wake up after just a couple hours of three four hours of sleep because your excited about a competition the next day a presumably if you already trained the skills that you need for the event you should be fine to engage in that particular activity now it is always going to be better to get a full night sleep and t what full night sleep i for for you at six hours than s always can be better to get more more sleep than is to get less however i think some people a get a little bit a overly concerned that if they did not get their full nights sleep before some sort of physical event that their performance is going to plum it presumably if you have already learn what you need to do and it stored in your curl circuits and how to make those coordinative movements what the literature on slowwave sleep suggests is that you would be replenish that the motor learning and the recovery from exercises going to happen early in the night we will just pause there and and can a shell of that for a moment than were into come back to it but i want to talk about red sleep a rapid i movement sleep red sleep and rapid i movement sleep as i mention befoul occurs throughout the night but you are onto have more of it a larger percentage of these ninety minutes sleep cycles is going to be comprised of remsleep as you get toward morning red sleep is fascinating it was discovered in the fifties when a sleep laboratory an chico am the researches observe that people's eyes were moving under their eyelids now something very important that we are going to address when we talk about drama later is that the eve movements are not outside topside their very erotic in all different directions something that i do not think any one i never heard anyone really talk about publicly is why i movements during sleep i eyes are closed and sometimes people's eyelids will be a little but open and their eyes are darting round especially little kids don't suggest you do this om nice manure's ethical but it has been done we you do not pull back the eyelids of a kid while their sleeping and their eyes are kind of darting all over the place think people do this to there passed out friends that parties and things that again i do not suggest you do it but a ism tell you it because it is been done before and therefore you do not have to do it again but rapid i movement sleep is fascinating and occurs be because there are connections between the brainstorm an area called the plans an areas of the phallus and the top of the brainstorm that are involved in generating movements indifferent directions sometimes called cicadas although sometimes during rapid give movements sleep its not just rapid its kind of a gentry side tesidething and then the eyeballs kind o roll it is really pretty creepy to look at if you see what is happening there is the circuitry that is involved in conscious eve movements is kind of going hay wire but it is not haywire it is these waves of activity from the brainstorm up to the called famous which is are that it is filter sensory information that up to the quarter and the cartel of course is involved in conscious perceptions rapid see movement sleep there couple things are happening besides repand i movements the main ones are that there in con should say in contrast to slowwave sleep in red sleep ceratonan is essentially absent kiss this molecule this nromagelayer that tends to create the feeling of bliss and well being and just calm placidity is absent that is interesting in addition to that nor epineferan this molecule that is involved in movement and alertness is absolutely absent it is probably one of the few times in our in our life that epinephrin is essentially i at zero activity within our system and that has a number of very important implications for the sorts of dreaming that occur during remsleep and the sorts of learning that can occur in remsleep and unlearning first of all in red sleep we are paralyzed we are we are experiencing what is called atonic which just means that we are completely laid out and paralyzed we also tend to experience whatever it is that we are dreaming about as a kind of hallucination ere a hallucinatory activity long ago i looked a into hallucinations in dreaming i was just fascinating by this and in high school and there some great books on this if you are interested in o exploring the relationship between hallucinations and dreaming o the m most famous of which our fromaguy a research r hazard am alanhobson now i wrote a book called a dream drug store and talked all about the similarities between drugs that induce hallucinations and dreaming in red s we can explore that if you in red our eyes are moving but the rest of our body is paralyzed and we are hallucinating there is no epinefran around epinefran does not just create a desire to move and alertness it is also the chemical signature of fear and anxiety it is what is released from our renal glands when we experience something that is fearful or alerting set facer suddenly screeches in front of us or we get a troubling text message a adrenalin is deployed into our system a adrenaline is epinephrin those are equivalent molecules and epinephrin is not just released from our adrenals it is also released within our brain there is this weird stage of our life that happens more toward morning that we call remsleep where were hallucinating and having these outrageous experiences in our mind but the chemical that is a located with fear and panic an anxiety is not available to us and that turns out to be very important and you can imagine why that is important it is important because it allow us allows us to experience things both replay of things that did occur as well as elaborate contortions of things that did not occur and it allows us to experience those in the absence of fear and anxiety and that it turns out is very important for a busting our emotional relationship to challenging things that happen to us while we were awake those challenging things can sometimes be in the form of social anxiety or just having been working very hard or concern about an upcoming event or sometimes people report for instance dreams where they find themselves late to an exam or naked in public or in a in some sort of situation that would be very troubling to them and that almost certainly occurs during red sleep we have this incredible period of sleep in which our experience of emotionally laid in events is dissociated chemically blocked from us having the actual emotion my immediately some of you are thinking but what about nightmares i have nightmares and those carry a lot of emotion are sometimes awake up in a panic let us consider each of those two things separately because they are important in understanding remsleep there is a good chance that nightmares are occurring during slow was f sleep there are actually some drugs that i do not suggest people take in fact much i am not in o mention them that give people very an boss drier ere dreams in this kind of a feeling that o things are pursuing them or that on they cannot move when they are being chased that is i shay a common dream that have had i guess it more or less a nightmare the feeling that one is paralyzed and cannot move and is being chased lot of people have said oh that must be in remsleep because your paralyzed and your dreaming about being paralyzed and you cannot move i think that is probably false the research says that because norapinefran is absent during remsleep it is very unlikely that you can have these intense fearful memories those are probably occurring in slow wave sleep although there might be instances where people have nightmares in remsleep the other thing is some people experience certainly have had this experience of waking up and feeling very stressed about whatever it was that i happen to be thinking about or dreaming about in the moments before and that is an interesting case of an invasion of the dream state into the waking state and the moment you wake up epinefran is available the research on this is in fully crystallized but most of it points in the direction of the experience of waking up and feeling very panic may be i want a highlight may but may be that you were experiencing something that was troubling in the daytime your repeating that experience in your sleep apinefran is not available and therefore the brain circuits associated with fear and anxiety are shut off and you are able to process those events and then suddenly you wake up and there is a surge of a adrenalin of epinefran that is now coupled to that experience nightmare is very likely in slowwave sleep and that kind of panic on waking from something very likely to be an invasion of the thoughts and ideas however distorted in remsleep invading the waking state in fact that brings to mind something that have mention once before but i want to mention again this atonic this paralysis that we experience during sleep can invade the waking state many people report the experience of waking up and being paralyzed there legitimately waking up it is not a dream waking up and being paralyzed and it is terrifying have had this happened before it is i can tell you terrifying to be wide awake and as far as i could tell fully conscious but unable to move and then generally you cannot yourself out of it in a few seconds but it is quite frightening now some people actually experience waking up being fully paralyzed and hallucinating and there is a theory in the academic and scientific community at least that what people report as alien abductions have a certain number of door characteristic that map quite closely early similarly to these experiences lot of reports of alien auction involve people being unable to move seeing particular face is a hallucinating extensively feeling that their body is floating or they were transported this is very similar to the experience of invasion of atonic into the waking state waking up and still being paralyzed as well as the hallucinations that are characteristic of dreaming and red sleep now ism not saying that a peoples alien abductions were not legitimate alien abductions how could i i was not there m and if i was there i would not tell you cause that would make me an alien om and i wouldn't want you to know but it is quite possible that people are experiencing these things and they are an invasion of the sleep state into the waking state and they can last several minutes or longer and because in dreams space and time are distorted our perception of these events could be that they lasted many hours and we can rely feel as if they lasted many hours when in fact they took only moments and wireman a return to distortion of space and time in l bit to just recap where we have gone far slow way sleep early in the night been own to be important for motor learning and for detail learning red sleep has a certain dream component when which there is no epineferon therefore we cannot experience anxiety we are paralyzed those dreams tend to be really vivid and have a lot of detail to them and yet in red sleep what is very clear is that the sorts of learning that happen in red sleep are not motor events it is more about unlearning of emotional events and now we know why because the chemicals available for really feeling those emotions are not present now that has very important implications let us address those implications from two sides first of all we should ask what happens if we do not get enough red sleep and a scenario that happens a lot where people do not get enough red sleep is the following it'll just explain the one that a unfamiliar with cause it happens to me a lot although have figured out waves to adjust i go to sleep around ten thirty eleven o'clock have fall asleep very easily and then i wake up around three or four i m i now know to use a anestiaranon sleep deep least protocol and that allows me to fall back asleep even though called non sleep deep rest its really allows me to relax my body in brain and i tend to fall back asleep and sleep till about seven a m during which time i get a lot of red sleep and i know this because have measured it and i know this because my dreams tend to be very intents of the sort that we know as typical of red sleep in this scenario have got in my slow have sleep early in the night and have got my red sleep toward morning however there are times when i do not go back to sleep may be have of flight to catch that is happen sometimes have got a lot on my mind and i do not go back to sleep i can tell you and you have probably experience that the lack of red sleep tends to make people l emotionally irritable it tends to make us feel as if the little things are the big things it is very clear from laboratory studies where people have been deprived selectively of red sleep that our emotionality tends to get a little bit unhinged and we tend to catastrophism small things we tend to feel the world is really daunting were never going to move forward in the ways that we want we cannot unlearn the emotional components of whatever it is been happening even if it is not dramatic the other thing that happens in red sleep is a replay of certain types of spacial information about where we were and why we were in those places and this maps to some beautiful data and studies that were initiated by gaining mat willow at elite years ago showing that in romance and it turns out in other non human primates and inhuman there is a replay of spacial information during red sleep that almost precisely maps to the activity that we experience during the day as we move from one place to another here is a common world scenario you go to a new place you navigate through that city or that environment this place does not have to be yuan the scale of a city it can be a new building can be of finding particular rooms new social interaction you experience that and if it is important enough that becomes solidified a few days later and you will not forget it if it is unimportant you probably forget it during red sleep there is an it is a literal replay of the exact firing of the anurans that occurred while you were navigating that same city you are building earlier red sleep seems to be involved in the the generation of this detailed spacial information but what is it that is actually happening in red sleep there is this uncoupling of a motion but most of all what is happening in red sleep is that we are forming a relationship with particular rules or algorithms were starting to figure out based on all the experience the we had during the day whether or not it is important that we avoid certain people or that we approach certain people whether or not it is important that om when we enter a building that we go into the elevator and om turn left where the bathroom is for instance these general themes of things and locations and how they fit together and that has a word it is called meaning during our day were experiencing all sorts of things meaning is how we each individually piece together the relevant of one thing to the next right if i suddenly a told you that o this pen was downloading all the information to my brain that was important to deliver this information you would probably think i was of pretty strange character because typically we do not think of pens as downloading information into brains but if i told you that i was getting information from my computer that was allowing me to o say things o to you you would say wit that is perfectly reasonable that is because we have a clear and agreed upon association with computers and information and memory am and we do not have that same association with pends you might say well do but something in our brain needs to solidify those relationships and make sure that the certain relationships do not exist and it appears that remsleep is important for that because when you deprive yourself or people of red they start seeing odd associations they tend to lump or batch things i know this for my own experience if have ever been sleep deprived which unfortunately happens too often because of a ism terrible with dead lines to pull in all night are the word the starts to look it spelled in correctly and thus a very simple word to spell but things start to look we distorted and we know that if people are deprived of red sleep for very long pairs of time they start hallucinating they literally start seeing relationships and movement of objects that is not happening and red sleep is really where we establish the emotional load but where we also start discarding of all the meanings that are irrelevant and if you think about emotionality a lot of overemotionality or catastrophizing is about seeing problems everywhere and you could imagine why that might occur if you start linking the web of your experience too extensively it is very important in order to have healthy emotional and connive functioning that we have fairly narrow channels between individual things if we see something on the news that is very troubling well then it make sense to be very troubled but if we are troubled by everything and we start just saying we know everything is bothering me an unfeeling highly irritable and everything's jo distorting and troubling me chances are we are not actively removing that the meaning the connectivity between life experiences as well as we could and that almost always maps back to a defies it in remsleep red sleep is powerful and has this amazing capacity to eliminate the meanings that do not matter it is not that it exacerbates the meanings that do matter but it eliminates the meanings that do not matter and that bears a striking resemblance to what happens early in development this is not a discussion about early in development but early in development the reason a baby camp generate coordinated movements and the reason why children can get very emotional about what seems trivial events are what adults know to be trivial events ah the ice cream shop is closed and they just cut in then the kid just dissolves into a puddle of tears and the parents canoe well it will be open again another time they children one of the reasons that they cannot generate coordinated movement or place that event of the ice cream shop being closed into a larger context is because they have too much connectivity and much of the maturation of the brain and nervous system that brings us to the point of being emotionally stable reasonable rational human beings is about elimination of connections between things red sleep seems to be where we uncouple l the potential for emotionality between various experiences and that brings us to the absolutely fundamental relationship and similarity of red sleep to some of the clinical practices that have been designed to eliminate emotionality and help people move through drama and other troubling experiences whether not those troubling experiences are a death in the familiar of a close loved one something terrible that happened to you or somebody else or an entire childhood or some event that in your mind and why is felt as in experienced as bad terrible or concerning many of you perhaps have heard of drama treatment such as e m d are give movement desensesation reprocessing or ketene treatment for drama something that recently became legal and is in fairly widespread clinical use interestingly enough e m i a an examine at kind of a door level bear very similar features to remsleep lets talk about i m i a first e m dear i movement tosensesation reprocessing something that was developed by a psychologist frenzy in chipiro jacks was in palwalto am and the story goes that she was walking not incidental in the trees and forests behind stamford and she was recalling a troubling event in her own minds this would be from her own life and she realized that she was walking the emotional load of that experience was not as intents or severe she extrapolated from that experience of walking and not feeling as stressed about the stressful event to a practice that she put into work in with her clients with her patients and that now has become fairly widespread taste one the few behavior the behavior treatments that are approved by the america psychological association for the treatment of drama what she had her clients impatience do was moved their eyes from side to side while recounting some dramatic or troubling event now this was of course in the clinic and ism guessing that she removed the walking component and just took the ye movement component to the clinic because awhile it would be nice to go on therapecessions with your therapist and take walks it has their certain a boundaries to that such as a confidentiality enough their lot of people around the person might not feel as open to discussing things or weather barriers and things a run of its raining or hailing outside it gets tough to do why i movements well she never really said why i movements but am soon it'll tell you why the decision to select these literalized my movements for the work in the clinic was the right one these my movements they look silly a it'll do them because i that is why ism here a they look silly but they basically involved sitting in a chair and moving one's eyes from side to side not will talking but for me and then recounting the events it sometimes talking while moving the eyes but usually was moving the eyes from side to side for thirty sixty seconds then describing this challenging procedure no as a vision scientist who also works on stress when i first heard this i thought it was crazy frankly a people would ask me about m day and i just thought that is crazy i went and looked up some of the theories about why m dear might work and there were a bunch of theories oh it mixed the my movements during red sleep that was one turns out that is not true and it'll explain why the other one was oh it synchronizes that the activity on the two sides of the brain wen all sort of i mean when you look into both sides of the binocular visual field you actual the visual quarters but this whole idea of syncing between the two sides of the brain as something that i think modern hero science is starting to a less you say a gently ore not gently a move away from this whole right bring a left brain business turns out however that i movements of the sort that i just did and that fencing chaperon took from this walk experience and brought to the her client in in the a clinic are the sorts of eye movements that you generate whenever your moving through space when you are self generating that movement not much whenyou are driving a car but certainly if you were riding a bicycle or you were walking or you were running you do not realize that but you have these reflects give subconscious eye movements that go from side to side and they are associated with the motor systems when you move forward your eye go this there been a number of studies showing that these literalized i movements helped people move through or dissociate the emotional experience of particular dramas with those experiences such that they could real recall those experiences after the treatment and not feel stressed about them or they did not report them as dramatic any longer now the successor it was not a hundred per cent but they were statistically significant in a number of studies and yet there still some critics of m dear and frankly for a long time i i still thought well i do not know this just seems kind of a jacket but seems kind of a titis something t for which we do not know the mechanism when we cannot explain but in the last five years thereat been no fewer then five and there is a sixth on the way high quality pure reviewed manuscripts published in journal of hero science neuron sell press journal excellent journal nature excellent journal these are very stringent journals and and papers showing that lateraled my movements of the sort that i just did and if you are just listening to this is just sweet that moving the eyes from side to side with eyes open that those eye movements but not vertical eye movements suppress the activity of the emigdula which is this brain region that is involved in threat detection stress anxiety and fear there some forms of fear that are not a gala dependent but the emigdula it is not a fear center but it is critical for the fear response and for the experience of anxiety that is interesting we have got a clinical tool now that indeed shows a lot of success in a good number of people where i movements from side to side are suppressing the emigdula and the general theme is to use those eye movements to suppress the fear response and then to recount or repeat the experience an over time uncouple the heavy emotional load the sadness the depression the anxiety the fear from whatever it was that happened that was dramatic this important to understand because it'd love to be able to tell somebody who had a dramatic experience that they would forget that experience but the truth is you never forget the dramatic experience what you do is you remove the emotional load eventually it really does lose its potency the emotional potency is alleviated now e m dear should just mention tends to be most successful for single event or very specific kinds of drama that happen over and over as suppose to say an entire childhood or an entire divorce it they tend to be a it tends to be most effective for single event kinds of things carcrashis et camera where people can really recall the events in quite a lot of d tail it is not for everybody and it should be done of if it is going to be done for drama it should be done in a clinical setting with somebody whose a certified to do this but that bears a lot of resemblance to remsleep right this experience in our sleep where our eyes are movement moving excuse me although in a different way but we do not have the chemical an epinephrin in order to generate the fear response and yet were remembering the event from the previous day or days sometimes in remsleep we thing about things happen a long long time ago that is interesting and then now there is this new treatment this chemical treatment with the drug redefine which also bears a lot of resemblance to the sorts of things that happen in remsleep redefine is getting a lot of attention now and i think at lot of he would do not realize what redefine is redefine is a dissociative an esthetic it is remarkably similar to the drug called pa p which is certainly a hazardous drug for people to use redefine and pa p both function to disrupt the activity of a particular receptor in the brain called the n m d a receptor n methyl de esparto receptor this is a receptor that is in the surface of anurans are on the surface of anurans for which most of the time it is not active but when something very extreme happens and there is a lot of activity in the hurry pathway that impinges on that receptor it opens and it allows the entry of molecules ions that trigger a cellar process that we call long tern potentiation and long turn potentiation translates to a change in inactivity that later you do not need that intense event for the a for the anuran to become active again let me clarify a orbit of this the enemy a receptor is gaited by intense experience one way u you could think about this is typically i walk in my home i might make some food and sit down at my kitchen table and i do not think anything about a explosions but were i to come home one night sit down to a bull of chicken soup and there was a massive explosion the neurons their associate with chicken soup in my kitchen table would be active in a way that was different than they were previously and would be coupled to this experience of explosions such that the next time and perhaps every other time that i go to sit down at the kitchen table no matter how rational i am about the origins of that explosion maybe at as a gas truck that was down the road and there is no reason to think it is there to day but i would have the same experience those neurons would become active an i get an increase in tartrate again increase in sweating et camera redefine blocks this enemy a receptor and prevents that crossover and the addition of meaning to the kitchen table kitchen soup a excuse me chicken soup explosion experience how is redefine being used redefine is being used to prevent learning of emotions very soon after drama redefine is being stocked in a number of different emergency rooms where if people are brought in quickly and in o these are hard to describe even but a horrible experience of somebody seeing a loved one next to them killed in a car accident and they were driving that car this is in for everybody of certainly you need to talk to your physician but redefine is being used they might infuse somebody with redefine that their emotion is it can still occur but that the that the plasticity the change in the wiring of their brain will not allow that intense emotion to be attached to the experience now immediately you can imagine the sort of ethical implicatchiens of this right because certain emotions need to be coupled to experiences ism not saying that people should be using redefine or should not be using ketemean certainly not recreational it is quite dangerous a it does it can be gleeful and piece p it can cause pretty dramatic changes in perception an behavior but in the clinical setting the basis of redefine assisted therapies ares really to remove emotion and i i think the way of been hearing about it talked in about in the general public is a lot of people think its elicit more the kind of sylisiben trials or the media trials where its about becoming more emotional or getting in touch with a certain experience chedemine is about becoming dissociative or removed from the emotional component of experience now we have rhodamine which chemically blocks plasticity and prevents that the connection between an emotion and in experience that is a pharmacologic in event we have e dare which is this i movement thing that is designed to suppress the imigdula and is designed to remove emotionality while somebody recounts in experience and we have remsleep where the chemical epinefran that allows for signaling of intense emotion to and the experience of a tends emotion in the brain and body is not allowed and were starting to see a organizational logic which is that a certain component of our sleeping life is acting therapy and that is really what red sleep is about we should really think about remsleep and slowwave sleep as both critical slow a sleep for motor learning and detailed learning remsleep for attaching of emotions to particular experiences and then for making sure that the emotions are not attached to the wrong experiences and for unlearning emotional responses if they are too intense or severe and this all speaks to the great importance of mastering one sleep something that we talked about in episode to of the podcast and making sure that if life has disruptive events either do to travel or stress or am changes in school or or food schadual somethingthat we talked about in episodes three and four that one can still grab hold and manage one sleep life because fundamentally the unlearning of emotions that are troubling to us is what allows us to move forward in life and indeed the red deprivation study show that people become hyperemotional they start to catastrophism and it is no surprise therefor that sleep disturbances correlate with many emotional in psychological disturbances it is just it by now it should just be obvious why that would be the case in fact the other day i was in a discussion with a college of mind a who down in australia doctor tarmacked have known her o for two decades now from the time as she was at oxford and para studies am among other things menopause in the brain and she was saying that a lot of the emotional a effects of menopause actually are not directly related to the hormones there been some really nice study showing that the disruptions in temperature regulation in menopause map to changes in sleep regulation that then impact emotionality and in inability to correctly adjust the circuits related to emotionality and i encourage you to a look at her work will probably have or as a guested on the podcast at some point in the future use she knowledgeable about those sorts of issues as well as issues relate to testastron and in am people with all sorts of different cromizomal backgrounds sleep deprivation is not just deprivation of energy it is not just deprivation of amount function it is deprivation of self induced therapy every time we go to sleep a these things ye m d are and beaming therapies are clinic therapies but red sleep is the one that you are giving yourself every night when you go to sleep which raises i think the other important question which is how to get and how to know if you are getting the appropriamount of remsleep and slowly of sleep that is what will talk about next how should one go about getting the appropriate amount of slave sleep and red sleep and knowing that you are getting the right amount well short of hooking yourself up to an e g it is going to be tough to get exact measurements of brain states a from night to night some people now days are using things the ora ring or a whoop band or some other device to measure the quality in depth an duration of their sleep and for many people those those devices can be quite useful some people are obligation their sleep by way of whether not they feel rested whether r not they feel their learning and their getting better or not there are some things that one can really do and the first one is might surprise you in light of everything have said and probably everything you have heard about sleep there was a study done by a hazard undergraduate an me family homeland am who as in robot strict gold slap at the time and that study it explored how variations in total sleep time related to learning as compared to total sleep time itself and to summarize the study what they found was that it was more important to have a regular amount of sleep each night as opposed to the total duration in other words and what they showed was that improvements in learning or deficits in learning were more related to whether or not you got six hours six hours five hours six hours that was better than if somebody got for instance six hours ten hours seven hours far for or five hours you might say while that is crazy because i thought we are just also s to get more sleep and the more red towards morning turns out that forsake of learning new information and performance on exams in particular that is what was measured limiting the variation in the amount of your sleep is at least as important and perhaps more important than just getting more sleep over all and i think this will be in people great relief many people great relief who are struggling to quote get enough sleep remember a few episodes ago i talked about the difference between fatigue and in sonic fatigue is tends to be when we are tired in sonic tends to lead to a sleepiness during the day when we are falling asleep and you do not want that you do not want either of those things really but i found it striking that the data from the study really point to the fact that consistently getting about the same amount of sleep is better than just getting more sleep and i think nowadays many people are just aiming for more sleep and they are rather troubled about the fact that they are only getting five hours are their only getting a six hours in some cases it may be the case that they are sleep deprived and they need more sleep but some people just have a lower sleep need and i find great relief personally in the fact that consistently getting for me about six hours or six and a half hours is going to be more beneficial than constantly striving for eight or nine and finding that some nights ism getting five and sometimes ism getting nine and varying around the mean as i recall and i i think him can get this precisely right but if not i know that ism a at least close for every hour variation in sleep regardless of whether n i was more sleep than one typically got there was a seventeen per cent reduction and performance on this particular examtype and this is powerful this means that we should strive for a regular amount of sleep and for some of us that means falling sleep and waking up and going back to sleep for some people means falling asleep and waking up and not getting back to sleep now ideally you are getting the the full compliment of slowly sleep early in night and sleep toward morning which is remsleep which brings us to how to get more remsleep well there couple different ways but am here is how to not get more remsleep i first of all drink a lot of fluid right before going to sleep one of the reasons why we wake up in the mill the night to use the bathroom is because when our bladder is full there is a normal connection literally and a set of neurons and a nerve circuit that goes to the brainstorm that wakes us up and a actually some people a that i know and i will not be mentioned i shall use this to try and a just that for their jet lag when the thing toe stay awake having o use the bath or have any prana is one of the most anxiety evoking a experiences any one can have if you really have to go to the bathroom it is very hard to fall asleep or stay asleep and bed wetting which happens in kids a very early on is a failure of those circuits to maturate it to mature until a ma i think we all assume that babies are going to you are going to pein their sleep but adults are not posed to do that and the a the circuits take some time to developed and some kids they develop a but later than others having a full flatter is one way to dis rust your sleep you do not want to go to bed dehydrated but that is one way untie other hand there is evidence that if you want to remember your dreams more or remember more of your dreams there is a tool that you can use i do not necessarily recommend it which is to drink a bunch of water before you go to sleep and then what happens is you tend to break in and out of red sleep it tends to be fractured and with a sleep journal i tendons these laboratory studies believe d or not people will recall more of their dreams because they are in this con of semi conscious state because their constantly waking up throughout the night i suggest not having a full flatter before you go to sleep that one's kind of an obvious one but none the less the other one is if you recall that during red sleep we have a shift in negro transmitters such that we have less ceratonan i done may shrug to their rights gives me less ceratonan there are a lot of supplements out there gear toward improving sleep have taken some of them and obtain many of them if not all of them at this point am i could report back to you and i think i mention on a previous episode that when i take trip to fan or anything that contains five ah k p which is a ceratonan or precurserdise teratogen sermon is made from trip to fan i tend to fall very deeply sleep and than wake up a few hours slater and that make sense now based on the fact that you just do not want a lot of red sleep early on what was probably happening as i was getting a lot of red sleep early on because low levels of season and are typically associated with slow wave sleep and that comes early in the night for some people those supplements might work but beware ceratonan supplements at a could disrupt the timing of red sleep and slowwave sleep and in my case led to waking up very shortly after going to sleep and not being able to get back to sleep now if you want to increase your slow wave sleep that is interesting a there always to do that one of the most powerful ways to increase slowwave sleep the percentage of slowwave sleep apparently without any disruption to the other components of sleep and learning is to engage in resistance exercise it is pretty clear that resistance exercise triggers and number of metabolic and endercran pathways that lend themselves to release of growth hormone which happens early in the night and resistance exercise therefore can induce a greater percentage of slow wave sleep it does not have to be done very close to going to bedtime in fact for some people that the exercise can be disruptive for reasons have talked about in previous episodes but resistance exercise unlike aerobic exercise does seem to increase the amount of slowwave sleep which as we know is involved in motor learning and the acquisition of fine detailed information not general rules or the emotional components of experiences for those of you that are interested in lucid dreaming and would to increase the amount of lucid dreaming that your experiencing i have them enable a tract down that device with the red light that i described at the beginning but there are a number of just simple zero technology tools that one could use in principle one is to set ace the way this works is you come up with a simple statement am about something that you to see or experience later in dreams am you can for instance write down a something a i want to remember the red apple anyone sound slain trivial and you look at that you would probably want o write it down on a piece of paper you might we one o draw a red apple and then before you go to sleep you would look at it and then you would just go to sleep there are some reports that doing that for several days in a row can lead to a situation in which you are suddenly in your dream and you remember the red apple and that gives you a sort of tether to reality between the dream state and reality that allows you to navigate in shape and kind of adjust your dreams us a dreaming does not have to be or include the ability to alter features of the dream a to be able to control things in the dream sometimes its just the awareness that you are dreaming but am none the less some people en joy lose he dreaming and then for people that have a lot of loose of dreams that feel kind of overwhelmed by those that going to involve trying to a embrace protocols that can set the right duration of sleep there is a little bit of literature not a lot that that shows that keeping the total amount of see a per night to the bet say six hours such that you begin sleep an end at the beginning and end of one of these altradean cycles a can be better than waking up in the middle of one of these ultradian cycles try and find the writhe amount of sleep that you need a that is right for you and then try and get that consistently night to night if you are lose ad dreamer and you do not it then you may want to start to make sure that your waking up at the end of one of these altradean cycle in that in this case it would be better to wake up after six hours than after seven and if you did sleep longer than six hours may be done to get to seven and a half hours calfskin a reflect the end of one of these nineumenute cycles as supposed to waking up in the middle alcohol alcohol and marowana are well known to induce states that are pseudo sleep especially when people fall asleep on while after having consumed alcohol or am t c the act of component one of the active components in marijuana alcohol ts and most things them meaning things that increase serene and am or gala are going to disrupt the pattern of sleep they're going to destruct the depth there going to destruct the over all sequencing of more slow wave sleep early in the night and wore red sleep later in the night that is just the the reality the a there are some things that it least in a few studies that i to find seem to gest that you could increase the amount of slow wave sleep using things argentine the eminoacidel argentine although you really want check arguing can have effects on heart et camera has other effects but alcohol ti s not can be great for sleep in depth of sleep you might feel you can fall asleep faster but the sleep that your accessing really is not the kind of deep restorative sleep that you should be getting of course if that is what you need in order to sleep and that is within your protocols have said here before ism not suggesting people take anything o nautomedical doctor ism not a cop ism not turning regulate any one's behavior ism just telling you what the literature says some of you may want to explore your dreams and meaning of dreams et camera there is not a lot of hard data about how to do this but a lot of people report keeping a sleep journal were a dream journal can be very useful they mark when they thing they fell asleep the night before when they woke up and if they wake up in the middle the night early in the morning they will just write down what they can recall of their dreams and even if they recall nothing many people have the experience of midmorning or later afternoon that suddenly comes to them that they had a dream about something in writing that down i kept a a dream journal for while tin really afford me much i i did not really learn anything except that my dreams were very bazaar but there are some things that happen in dreams that are associate with red sleep as a compared to slow wave sleep which can tell you whether not your dream likely happened in remsleep or slowly of sleep and the distinguishing feature t turns out of something called theory of mind theory of mind is actually an idea that was developed for the study and assessment of autism and it was a initially that phrase theory of mind was brought about by am simony baron con who is dacha baron con the comedians brother simony baron con is a sychallogist and a to some extent the euro scientist in at oxford and theory of mind tests are done on children and the theory of montes is some what the fallowing a a child is brought into a laboratory and watches a video of a child playing with some sort of toy and then at the end of playing with that toy a they put the toy in a drawer and they go away and then another child comes in and is looking around and then the experimenter asks the child whose in the experiment the real child says what does the child think what are they feeling and most children of a particular age five or six or older will say oh he or she is confuse they do not know where the toy is or they will say something that implies what we call theory of mind that they can put there ideas into and their mind into what the other child is likely to be feeling or experiencing that is theory of mind and it turns out that m this is y used as one of the assessments for autism because some children not all but some children that have autism that go on to develop autism do not have this theory of mind they tend to fixate on the fact that the first child put the toy in the drawer they will say it is in the drawer as opposed to answering the question which is how does the second child feel about it or what are they experiencing theory of mind is something that is emerges early in life as a part of the maturation of the circuits in the brain associated with a emotional learning and and social interactions and we experience this uncertain dreams if you had a dream that your puzzled about or that your fixated on and you are thinking about you might ask in that dream was i assessing somebody ease's emotion and feeling or was i very much in my own first person experience and that the tendency is that theory of mind tends to show up most in these red associated dreams ow this is into hard and fast rule but chances are if you were in a dream and you were thinking about other people who wanted to do something to you you were thinking about their desire to chase you or help you or something that was regelate to someone ease's emotional experience it was probably a red dream that dream occurred in rapid movement sleep as supposed to slowwave of sleep and that make sense when you think about the role of red in emotional unlearning of associations with particular life events that red is rich with all sorts of exploration of the emotional load of being chased or the emotional load of having to take an exam the next day or being late for something but again if your fixated or you can recall thinking a lot about or feeling a lot about what somebody ease's motivations were than chances are it was in red and if not chances are it was in slow wave of sleep to day we have been in a deep dive of sleep and dreaming learning and unlearning and i just want a recap of few of the highlights and important points a lot more slowwave sleep in less red early in the night more red and less slowwave sleep later in the night remsleep is associated with it intense experiences without this chemical apineferon that allows us the anxiety or fear and almost certainly has an important roll in uncoupling of emotion from experiences self an do therapy that we go into each night that bears striking resemblance to things eddy are in cedamintherapes and forth slowwave sleep is critical however its critical mostly for motor learning and the learning of specific details a red is kind of emotions and general themes and meaning and slowwave sleep motor learning and details i personally find it fascinating that consists n see of sleep meaning getting six hours every night is better than getting ten one night eight the next five the next for the next i find that fastening and and i think i also it because it is something i can control better than just trying to sleep more which i think ism not alone and agreeing that that is just hard for a lot of people to do this episode also brings us to the conclusion of a five episode street where we have been focusing on sleep and transitions in and out of sleep non sleep deep rest we have talked about a lot of tools morning light evening light avoiding lights blue blockers supplements tools for measuring sleep duration and quality we have been covering a lot of themes i to think that by now you are armed with a number of tools and information things knowing when you are temperature minimum is knowing when you might want of you light or not when you might want to eat or take hot showers or god forbid a cold shower something that most people including me more less loth but can have certain benefits and that will low you to shape your sleep life and get this consistent or more or less consistent amount of sleep on a regular basis nobody's perfect fact i have this little joke that i sometimes tell its not funny most o the jokes i tell ism told there not funny but there is much excitement now about intermittent fasting sometimes i think that a some one should startling on intermittent sleep deprivation although we are already doing that were we are all experiencing lack of sleep from time to time and i do not think we should catastrophic that too much i think that what we want to do rather than accumulate a sleep anxiety is too if we get a bad night sleep we want to adjust we want to get back on track and just get the consistent amount of sleep use those non sleep deep least protocols to help us relax when we are feeling anxious or having trouble waken up an mill the night there are a lot of tools out there and most of them arezero cost and i hope you will find those beneficial if you have been hearing costello snoring throughout this episode i apologize in his behalf as i said in the welcome titis to this podcast he risen into real part of the podcast a few people have said hey that noise in the background is really disruptive ah hey what can i say a hostelled is a ten year old bulldog mast if a the life spend on those animals is about ten years i much i make you feel guilty but will not after he is gone there will not be any snoring although probably get a different dog sort of a what would the couldst sorry not sorry ah sorry not sorry about the snoring and ism sorry if it is disruptive genuinely but i he he is here for for the hall that is what that is about as we close out this segment on sleep we are moving into a new theme in topic for the next fortified episodes we are going to discuss the science and the tools related to narrow plasticity negro plasticity is a remarkable feature of the nervous system in fact it is the defining feature of the nervous system which is it is ability to change itself and response to experience that is unlike every other tissue and collection of sells and organ in our body it is really what makes us us as a species and is what makes us us as individuals and it is really wear our potential lies everything that we know everything we can do and our true potential and terms of what we will ever be able to know do say in life is set by the limits of neural plasticity we are going to explore learning in childhood learning and adulthood we are going to discuss detailed protocols as they relate to sensory plasticity learning new sensory information verses motor plasticity or sensory motor integration we are going to talk about language acquisition we are going to be talking about emotional acquisition and breadth as well as i think a topical lot of people r get fine fascinating is the relationship between plasticity set during childhood attachment to parent or other caregiver and how that maps on to adult relationships of there is many of you probably heard about secure attach or insecure attach the a b an c d at babies as there called from the classic studies of bully and others but now there is i usual neural science that can say which circuits were active during those early life attachment and how those map to adult attachment styles challenges and what makes us more likely to select certain partners and styles of attachment as well as how to change those it is really fascinating and i think neural sciences time has calm for neural plasticity we are also in a to of course about supplements and chemicals and machines and devices that can assist in speeding up the plasticity process or believe or not there some cases where you might want to delay plasticity in order to get more depth of learning and have that learning last longer something that is just absolutely spectacular literature some very excited to move on to that topic soon i hope that the tools that you have acquired far in the knowledge that have required far as helping you with yourself i valuation and experimentation as you see fit and is allowing you to not just sleep better but feel better while you're awake and hopefully as set the stage for you to learn better as we start to marching to the month on nerd plasticity many of you have asked how you can help support the superman lab podcast and we greatly appreciate the plastic you can help support the podcast by subscribing to the ut channel if you have not already and leaving comments and questions in the comment section if you could subscribe on apple and or notify that is helpful and there is a place on apple podcast to leave a rating as well as comments about how you feel about the podcast if you could suggest the podcast to friends and to workers and anyone else that you think would benefit from the information that also really helps us get the word out and of course check out our sponsors because that is a very direct way to help us continue to get this information out to the general public and as mentioned the beginning of today's episode we are now partnered with momentous supplements because they make single ingredient formulations that are the absolute highest quality end teashop international if you go to live momentoustoc calm slash supermen you will find many of the supplements that have been discussed on various episodes of the superman lad podcast and you will find various protocols related to those supplements last but not least a few people wrote to me with some questions slash corrections about things that i said in previous podcast in keeping with my goal of making the information accurate and clear i just want to correct myself about a few things that i said one of those and ism guessing it probably came from an end of chronologist or somebody else that knows a lot about festivals said supermen you mention that testosterone is made by the her told cells of the testes and it is not it is made by the living cells of the testes and indeed you are correct and so want to i make sure that i clarify that testosterone is made by the living cells of the testes not by the certify cells the certolycells make a five out for reduces and roads and some other enzymes involved in conversion of testosterone into things the eight t an estrogen thank you for that correction i genuinely appreciate it i misspoke the other thing i said was at one point i said typical temperature is ninety six point eight when i actually meant to say ninety eight point six it was a dialectic slip on my part and i apologize i do not know that ism dialectic i in clinically diagnose with the siesta but i swap them which sometimes happens when ism going fast i apologize i us is as a moment to just say temperature varies a lot across the day and night that was the theme of previous podcast we cant really talk about average temperature anyway but i do want to be clear that most people think about average temperature as ninety eight point six i misspoke my error and i apologize thank you for joining me in this journey of the nervous system an biology and trying to understand the mechanisms that make us who we are and how we function in sleep and in wakefulness it is really an incredible landscape to consider and i hope that you're getting a lot out of the information as always thank you for

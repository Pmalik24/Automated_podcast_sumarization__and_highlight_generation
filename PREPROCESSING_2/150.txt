a quick warning there are curse words that are beeped in to days episode of the show if you prefer a beat version you can find that at our website this america life out work the question started re vet token and his husband moved to the malaria got a house together down founders pretty excited about this they will wive within an hour and they brought meals over to weeks his on bought them shads but this question popped up and the first time i notice it happening it was with my aunt ki not o knower she was oh which one of you was handles one of you handy and i was just why to she one to know that watch care ye et i had i had feelings about it and i could not tell why am and then it just kind of kept happening with other family members they would be talking about all you gas moved in together into this house is one which one of house handy and on it is face it was kind of a oh we know when you are in a house there is a lot of things to fix in a lot of things to do but it felt there was something else happening there and a kind of bothered me something else there there was a question underneath the question that they were trying to get the answer to yet like there was something else trying to be figured out and i do not know the more i thought about it and why i was having feelings about it it was kindly this heard a moment of oh i think you are asking who the man is in my relationship right you are both men yes for one of you is really the man yes yet then ut de would tell them the his husband who was the handy one tell yo was is giving hem ammunition but pit your the relationship that just buggedhim ut they were being sized up an to familiar categories would you use the husband would you es the wife it was weird because when whenever they would ask it i could feel myself getting defensive i did not want to give them that picture and i think part of my defensiveness came from i think well o man not to take us in a whole other direction but if you spent any amount of time in the closet in the closet for debenamen's middlescool and high school i think you are afraid of being found out at all as being a femineity in any way y i know for me i was very conscious of if any one could detect quote in quote feminine traits about me and then figure out if i was gay or not and i do think that myself and a lot of gagmen carry that around for a kind of a rest of your life and i think that comes up in having to answer a question this also ye ye is it it is funny cause it is this innocent question and then and them really look underneath it it is this a bomb waiting to go off actually this many feelings yet it feels it hits on a thing at least for me that i spent a lot of time is a kid running from or spent a lot of time trying to not have to answer yet how masculine am i end is somebody else more masculine than i am and i do won i make room for the idea that they could have meant none of this absolutely none of this did you address it directly with any of them no cause that would be bonkers to oh you asked me whose handy you are trying to say ism not a man that the leap in logic to say that outright is he much would it inn a programmed questions that contain other secret questions inside of them questions that our wolves in sheep's clothing in all kids of situations that we have all been in dating in talking the strangers in dealing with the saddest things that ever happened to us and more tebesychica goes this america live a mara glass say with us a also instead of fordifferant acts today we be going o to going to present to show us four questions here istle first one question tell me how you feel bat this stolen who just heard is one of the editor heritor show and a really the idea for to day's program came out of a conversation that happened to the staff meeting and what have is we all got talking about these kind of question traps where seems a somebody is asking about one thing but the question is a proxy for trying to figure out something else token well explain more the conversation was about the questions people ask on first states the kind that forced through some one really is out in the open maybe even without them realizing once such question i did not even knows a thing but a few of my coworkers said that for black women of a certain age it is having a kind of renascence manual are executive editor asks it this way what do you think of beyond say it was a question that i found myself trying to ask barely a la on fir states because it told me a lot about them the question that tells you one in some is how they feel about a power who black woman it is the question that tells you how they think a bowed black woman in get kind of a little bi to me and that if you feel the neat to her down or see something negative about her it it is a real turn off it is a red flag basically i they describe a singing style of kind of castlewooling a us she just scraping been another producer has also asked this question on many a day all the weds that stop half double meanings of your woman and all of you black woman ism just arms that you do not loud people yo can think is you do not me could you tell me about some specific times that you have asked the beyond say question and what the guys response was in what it told you first a bard pretty standard beyond they actually came on in the bar in the background s a go what you think about beyond say and he was i do not i do not understand what the big deal is about her you women act there in a alter something and at they seem crazy i was all i really her n i do not newly think ism in a cold manual watch the guy through a the reasons beyond say is in fact pretty gray but the guy did not budge no he he did not did not care to and mere did not care to hear me talking generals what i seems they did not go out again because well you could say he was unapologetic when he fucked out the night that is a play up beyond say lyric by the way sorry could not help myself anyway b parked whose also been on the show yo said for her it does not even have to be beyond say andyou well known black woman dos the track yo say sit willies ill say a is operable y it you'll say sea polcetilsusti lassalasons a robin loses life iota y i a lit a lira asses covers it'll bring up a blacks a celebrity sin it there a polar i it usually because a little less for how they would sing as a part a how they with meme as a person but the beyond question she agrees is the most potent because the answer can really tell you if you should be crazy in love or putting everything he owns in a box to the west again i am sorry the thing about bunch of people using the same trick though is that eventually people in this case men my cachou are you aware of the beyond say question yet am era be real the question manual duchy producer and man at the show have you experience this yet i e e many he told me about a date of on where they started talking about musicals a move verge on a dream girls came out and thinking he was just answering the question about the move manual was honest said beans was just dopey in that an hen realized he was answering the wrong question i n body up all of you would deli e neon bee o tat been say e ai yet he e ma e eye main no e do ye to it was only later that he learned from another my friend why he is a black man should really only answer one way i mene ma ma ban a be ta o be a you that women won you he de can i yo ready li take wet we man e by i oboe e ma people were in o an e wo tat that quit you a in some cases that beyond question is an agreed upon first or both parties know their talking and cod parked was recently on the date she mentioned been says blacks king fell an he i c e he he was i soft oat to say he was i i i this i talking to you but i do love beats a and i doorways you to be ma lie he knew it was a trap e did to was it trap and add you respond is bat he talking about what ye at has i i no i o this was yer your i i i on a i it i is ta kilos the right answer we a home a dates of course there are other questions the beyond say one little traps we sat on dates hoping the other person does not fall in or hoping they do one that made the news recently which mayor may not be true according to an old classmate governor onto mantis would ask states if they liked to food but and this is key he pronounce it my food and if they said no it is big food not i he ditch the date it was his way of testing if they correct him which he did not not and some a test it'd be grateful o far but that just me anyway i take to a bunch of other people about their question traps palsy in minnesoda asked her dates about their favorite tom hanks movies she said he is been in many movies acrossmultipl cobras the answer is kind of a personality test toy story for example tells her there's a stunted adolescence thing going on saran an tamp said when she started to get a weird vibe she would ask what is your favorite conspiracy they most people would keep their answers light hearted but occasionally some one would go all in on i started talking all about not see separates she is jewfish say now kind of a deal breaker but not all question traps her subtle there is another gonna that i was surprised any one fell for the kind of question that seemed covered in yellow caution tape the sign that said this is a trap this one comes from vision angora after her husband died in twenty sixteen she found herself back out on the dating scene her question on ta date was if your ex wack by right now with her new partner what would you do which was her way of asking much more interesting question how locked up was your last relationship for if then i didst that guy aid i would tore him and gave her a piece of my mind oh my got exactly we had just got down to have nice lunch on a funny afternoon to on like do i get up and go or a and that lend a theory came out of how you to about a couple week away from going to port for find life hid the for and it had been a thirty eight year relationship an he found out she had been cheating tremble of the time in a completely therein devil way she gave him an old pone and that she had wife an when she fond o did the cloud it down noted into i one to and not a he found out we you got much information an that one question you get a make it a lichen to why draw it out i was shocked this question is clearly how bad was your last break up do i have anything to worry about but something about turning it into a final lice baker an these guides open up there with another guide that fid well we would have to leave immediately cut ghetto want to feel ut an my repay was you do not want to he do or you do not want get he out and what was his response i no he never answer directly be i knew tan tat he gillie a i kinship with her now husband they met at a widows support group he talked about his loneliness and being single parent the and a ingot each other she knew the question what would you do for an authored up would not be right for this nice guy who had just lost his life she was at at at that the last person i talk to was justice she to to see vassal classes in at manta run sher goes you question a do you believe in go ghosts bet you did not see that one coming did you do you believe in ghosts her saw justicasas of works there is no one right answer it just matters that you in you price er hap the faint answer eventually an at the core your mind kind of work in a to her way was there ever time that you asked the ghost question the person answer differently than you and you when i had dated that person anyway and how do that go ye a ye i was engage before i married my amen now and got question really would have been my get the fuck out i really ye her answer to the question as i do not really believe in ghost but if there was evidence to the contrary i could be convinced i m open to changing my mind n his recon to no and there is no information that you could get me to think my mind an i de don't we my anyone wen very think that at the time she did not think much about the difference in their answers but then she got to know in better other things would come up and i would frustrated about the factory everything with you wit no black an wite not a enter clack and life from time her gray a and then i kind of go back your can the re question his rigidity was one of the big things that broke them up now she tells every mention of here seeing some one knew asked them the ghost question i could save you a lot of time the thing about any trap of course is there are ways to side step at disarm e and then a person who laid the trap has to decide what to do manual had to make such a decision ironically enough my current waveband had no idea who beyonsay was who is the only person who had that response what did that tell you that he just needed of education he is older and he is not from this country and doesn't was not a music really and mike by the second d he had read the entire wirkapety of have for me and he knew beyonthis birthday and that she was married to daisy and he knew about the elevator i as that he was tent to your opinion yet intended of being a green flag now i talk to him about be nosing all the time and i do not necessarily think he is he is not going out to once a concenter anything that he understands how important he is and how punch is to me and lets me rant about her is algal you ever really want a it is all i think anyone wants some one you do not feel you have to set a trap for some one who you can look at them and say you are everything i need and more it is written all over your face baby i can feel your halo pray it will not fad away si in as time now tepenlel is an editor on a program question to how old are you kids this a particular piece of small talk that happens all the time whether some people is the most normal thing in the world and for others is a super delicate minefield this a story that you bet hears abut a couple for whom it is minefield and how one day a question this comes up and it goes completely differently from how it is ever gone before for them and he spectacularly wild way you will hear what ism talking about quistbenderov tells the story stack's doberman is the real estate age southern californium and she is well suited to the job because she is excellent at making conversation with strangers about anything but for the past six and a half years there is been this classic gonna of get to know u banter that is become a lot more complicated for her in her husband michael and that is questions about their children a yes all the time talking y people getting introductions it is always asking about our kits how many kids to you have locale how old a that the answers to these questions are complicated for stay because her older child man died in twenty seventeen it has been siren a yours because i have a doc get to for every six months this is stack's husband michael max's dad he is is s p e straight laced kind guy for the most part i man always wanted us to get get es we never did and i feel read he had some the has hat wonderful sleeve and lots o fetus but i i am covered in tarts and my right arm is re tired memorial for many have got ta the kids to to up her on my right shoulder sir did you have totes before he nor but it is get of of her interesting thing its it is it is it is less than the least i can do but it does help me through the pain in the going really how i see it from my perspective is just a socially acceptable cutting man was a funny kid always loved playing pranks who by fifteen was struggling with druggadiction going in and out of treatment he overdoes me was twenty five in his parents house and after he died for a while michael and stay where ran friends an family who knew what had happened nobody asked this do you have kids sort of questions then stay travelled to a conference in albakirkey she was sitting down for lunch next to a couple friendly bondwoman in her husband he began asking stay where she was from which she did and then finally those questions do you have kids how old a that and e woman was you don't kind o father very sweet very bubbly in when people are that with me it all pretty open and i felt being authentic and i told her won o my children died of an overdo two years ago and now i have one this did not go oversell this woman and er husband it it really upset them they could not they just could not handle the conversation i just saw the major pity face with the open mouth and the oh a and there is the conversation with them kind of stall out at that point and than they kind of totally stay out they never talk to me again of course overtime this happened again and again strangers would ask them these sorts of questions and when they would answer it suckle the air out of the room she made michael especially in comfortable he never sharing this staff with strangers he is more of a private person but together he and stay came up with the strategy for had a handle things were we are out an about and the question comes up we were sure to look each other just a little u and perceptibly shollshon a we really pick up what is going on ah and then usually state will answer however she an tor an the supporter unreservedly a lot of the times actually lie with two kid sir this is their ages totulater and keep it short in sweet because sometimes the white lie is matter for that person cause they are but a party there out having fun and they deftly do not want to here about your dead child and on they went answering some questions about their kids and bobbing and weaving rand others for six and a half years till this one day last nonmember and the got themselves into a situation that was very different for many that they would been in before and very public one thing to know about stay an my chapel as they both spend a lot of their time working at a re cover center for people struggling with a diction sometimes they hang out with the other staff and clients there and i saw that they were going to a show at the hollwadam rob where para silvered was performing and i mi go my got a love para silvered i want to go i want to go and i said when we got they are go i want to set front rob enter i want to get heckled i want i i want o be right under para silvered i wanted to heckle me if possible or me hi o gas we hacked them i do not know i just wanted to be a part of it they get senses front rest sinter but before para silvern came on stage that night at the hollywood i pray there was this opener kind him madam ray early forties wearing a mariner's cap he is got this backing ban drums keyboard back up singers ane ends in said with the song about how all his friends with kids are miserable an boring t on the song shifts madam race says sings that he and his wife are still deciding about having kids suddenly he turns to the crowd once to find some one with kids who can make an argument for having them madam starts in the front roll the guy a few seems away from staying s mid the word kids came up i went on killer and i just had a feeling all mi gotwere shoot in the front row is he can come to us we r i under cause i don't know what hemin to say on o rede with it and remember when comicloe you not station i ta conch the communicate with one another a we cannot do that here in is genu look at each other and getting idea know what you think what you think without talking on there serve in a desert waiting and then i saw him come into me of course he comes to me you a deny kids e we o get the assertive for the guy he does not my talking about this i was think of what you fucking non it visit that the properly should shut the pump up and get out right your probably was a little attitude perhaps you think and ah i think et that would bet but the comedians not done with him oo o oo o o and he still not done o o o o a oo o oak o o to a a a o o he finally comes down to me with the mike wan hold your kids and that is where i was having difficulty calculating there's nobody asked s me how old the artificially the first thing it went through a mind was well her bring is twenty son by that time i was locked because there was no time to forget som execrate what that did not happen while michaels thinking at am the comedian keeps holding the microphone waiting this dad is taking too long to answer and finally oi o the o wit yo a o other o o his myself protective over hem in that moment that is a loved question and it's why cant answer you o then the comic turns to stay i o other is o o do i you a is ta the a oo o o is oo and then i thought to myself o now have got a tell the truth and and it as split sika very impulsive moment i sad ism sorry tie is but one of our kid is actually did o o good o a a o on stage no one quite knows what to dead when of the back up singers but for hands of our face the keyboard play i just shakes his head no and then i realize i just served the shell so s this moment for the comedian seems pretty surmountable real what could he possibly do to say to set after that i called him up madam ray he said he considered changing the subject but chose not to and finally it is act she stay who save the day she motions for madam the comedian he bends down in points might at her and then she says i sad our dad son would think this was hilarious isn't a li at all ours dad son would have thought this was wholarius he would have been all my guide of course my on stepped in a big pile of she then madam gets an idea was file the video of madam sat at she made the rounds on tie to and instagram afterward stay says she read every last comments all these people rejoicing for and remembering her son i have listened to that thing a hundred talking i think as i keep ben joying it it was what yours was credible just was incredible women alarm bots of people have asked them questions putting them in this complicated spout this time front of all those people that ended with a roomful of strangers cheering for macs this time is their favoritecrispender a s one of the produces on a show coming up the question about a four hundred year old play add the personal question underneath that question it is a minute cicagopobogridio when a program continues this lexicon lie fro eyeglass day's program the question trap we were tub him that today is those questions that can seem benevolent innocent harmless and occurs could not heart a fly but underneath the really asking something else we quietly making a point about something else were arrived to question three of our program question three has your mam sh we spout of this next thing we went to play you in an academic journal as originally a paper in medical anthropology quarterly read by anthropologists named enow tailor who adapted it to read here on the radio this one question the general tell is writing about it kept showing up all the time in a personal life she s as is anthropologist she knows when lots of people or asking the same question over and over hit mean something she rode the was say to think through what is underneath that question my mother is living with progressive dimension because ism reading these words on the radio i cannot hear your response but ism listening for the question that as have learned always comes every one almost without exception responds with some version of the same question does she recognize you there are variance of course does she still know who you are but does she still know your name however it may be praise the question is always whether my mother recognizes me meaning can she recite the facts of who i am what my name is than how ism related to her when every one keeps asking me does she recognize you i find myself thinking that is the wrong question i believe the question really is or should be do you do we recognize her as a person who still here does she recognize you the weirdness of the question becomes more obvious if you think about what would be required to answer it lets say i ask my mother what is my name who am i how old am i how do we know each other testing her that way what is it prove what is it actually accomplish i read a book by a journalists name lore nestler she wrote about how she would correct her own mother when her mother called her by the wrong name every time she would visit her mother she would take framed photos from the dress a in point to them and quit her mother who this is do not you mam of course she did not kettle writes i told her again and again each visit who is who and then quizzed again thinking back on this now i am appalled at my insensitivity what did i think i was doing i manage to accomplish only two things i made myself miserable and i made my mother irritable i do not need my mother to tell me my name or how ism related to her ready know these things and i know that she has dementia why then when i make a point of asking her these questions that i know she cannot possibly answer it seems rude or just mean i cannot bring myself to do it i guess she could say that my mother raise me better than that dodoes she re cognize you ism not convince that the inability to remember names necessarily means that a person with dimension cannot recognize or care about other people but very often it does mean that other people stop recognizing and caring about them my mother was close to lots of people but only one friend remains present in her life every month or two elf dais drives an hour and a half from her home to little to visit mam bringing treats and hugs and are always cheerful self i love her dearly for it and i wonder where are the others wherever the couples with whom i parents socialized the women with whom mam spent hours and hours on the phone all through my childhood this should not surprise me as much as it has maybe it is not fair to expect friends to step up even close family drop off friendships in america are not usually expected to survive dementia friendships are often more pleasure grafts than life rafts not built to brave the really rough waters then does she recognize you when people ask me whether my mother still recognize me they are often expressing concern for me asking me how ism bearing up under the burden of suffering that her dimension must place on me and are quite ready to hear about my burdens in my suffering what they find harder to hear i think is it being around my mother is not a nightmare or a horror is not any of that here is what it is in a came as we share scone mama and i make what passes for conversation have learned to ask only the sort of question that does not require any specific inform nation to answer things going o say with you these days how is my favorite mam doing you are doing all right i tell her funny little stories about my kids sometimes we leave through a magazine looking at the pictures and commenting on them sometimes we look out the wind dow and i make general observations that require no specific response looks spring is coming look at those leaves coming out on the trees back's hare is really curly with each exchange mama smiles on me beaming affectionately and that familiar slightly conspiratorial way as if we are both in on the same joke our conversations go nowhere but it does not matter what we say really or whether we set it before or whether it is accurate or interesting or even comprehensible the exchange is the point mama and i are playing catch with touches smiles and gestures as well as words lambing them back and forth to each other in slow easy underhand arks the fact that she drops the ball more and more often does not stop the game for being enjoyable it is a way of being together does she recognize you she may not recognize me in a narrowly cognitive sense but mama does recognize me as some one who is there with her someone familiar perhaps and she does not need to have all the details sorted out in order to care for me the impulse to care the habit of caring these are things that run deep in my mother some one who for most of her life was very engaged in caring for other people her children or a husband her grandchildren and her friends even some of the behavourold works of my mamma's develop make sense to me in those terms as expressions of care here is an example people with do men shall often engage in repetitive behaviors and mamma is no exception when i take her out to a came i usually get a cup of black coffee for myself and order a cup a hot chocolate for her not too hot and do not forget the whip cream on top as we drink them she checks constantly to see whether my cup and hers are even whether the liquids have been drunk down to the same level and if not she will hurry up and drink more to catch up or else stop and wait for me or if we share a cookie she is concern to make sure that the haves be the same sizes and that we eat them at the same rate i think keeping track of whether our drinks and cookies are even comes naturally to my mother a woman who is always had to carefully divide quite limited resources first with her own brothers and later among her four children she is cared about such details all her life and caring about them was also a way in which she cared for other people mama also does still take care of me in some small but important ways one time a little more than a year ago i stopped by the assisted living facility where she was living at the end of a very busy day and in especially hectic week i had stayed up very late the night before trying to finish grating student papers then spent the whole day teaching and in meetings i went with her up to her room i turned on the t v and we sat down together on the couch i was exhausted i leaned back and yawned mam patted my hand and said to me you are tired just go ahead and sleep you can just lay down right here and i sat there next to my mum holding her hand feeling her warmth against me all long one side of my body and i leaned my head on her shoulder and slept does she recognize you for a while after we first move my mother into an assisted living facility she often said that she wanted to go home i understood this to mean that she wanted to move back to the house where she had lived for forty years until my father's death the house in which i grew up usually i responded with my own mild version of reality or plantation explaining as gently as possible that that house was all empty and cold now and nobody was there to keep her company or help er do stuff t was probably better to stay here one time though i asked her a question in stead you mean home to the house up in demon's no on the farm she answered you go down with her raised arm she traced out the curve of a long ago road for the first few years of her life my mother had lived on a small farm in southern itch before her father moved the family to settle during worker too to seek work on the docks there inside there she added who i asked my mam an my dad my mother's in her seventies her parents are not waiting for her inside an do farm house you could use that evidence to draw clear line between us me here on the side of reality confidence personhood recognition her over there on the side of delusion incapacity not quite fully human but what she was longing for was her childhood home she missed her mama and dad she was trying in her own way to hold on to them just as i was trying against the odds to hold on to her our predicament is exactly the same cannot tell her she is professor of the university of pronto ti you medical anthropology german sherry an teller died in ti an tan you knows electing ti i say another about to mention into a book you can fine cling to the original ecademicortical that show wrote had or messed that for can i help you oo he here's one last example of a question that is another question working behind it question goes this if

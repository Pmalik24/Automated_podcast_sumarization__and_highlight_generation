farther i probably about at twelve minute walk fifteen minute walk from the live but on close to nottoud don too but have never gone in there either they're just as an interesting i man not think many people come here and they feel they have to do certain things because somebody told and do what i they bent go home and people o say what do you mean you did not see the pantheon what d you mean you did not going to the love in guessing t a good number of these people are standing here because somebody told them that they should do it we con we do not think that they are all museum towards at home i do not know do people o look back and remember the experience of standing in front of a painting were might remember eating something or buying something or seeing something an accident or somebody who's really twisted up in some way but not looking at a painting de beam wrong we may be this disqualify that for them that doesn't getting i better than this but i do not know i just from people that i know that have come here they go to live because somebody told them tat they a dit day in a ready program where you might go in parts instead of the wove i spent three days wit avid ceder's who writs a lot about what it is to live in france we never saw the if power or there damn museum the famous cemetery were marshal purse and gemarsonar buried no historical sites nothing

sixty dollars which or si is a great price for back but for ayin our program america in parts and how our parts sometimes has very little to do with the one familiar to the locals tho you be easy chico this this america life acari glass the french government says that three and a half million america visited parts last year the u s government says it was more two and a half million either way it is a lot more than the actual population of parts which is two point one million america have dreamy and romantic ideas about parts more than other places i think in nineteen forty four at the liberation of parts from the notes e b white road probably one of the dullest stretches of pros in any man's library is the article in parts in the encyclopedia bretanaca yet when we heard the news of liberation being unable to think of anything else to do we sat down and read it straight through for beginning to end parts we began capital of france and of the department of a n situated on the ill delay ta the ill saint louis and the i lovelier in the san as well as on both banks of the san the words seemed the beginning of a great poem a feeling of simple all overtook us as we slowly turned the page and settled down to a study of the city's weather grab and the view of the san looking east from netradom the rainfall is rather even we distributed continued the encyclopedia heavenly distributed we thought to ourselves the tears of those who loved parts but what is it actually in parts really without the most colored glasses if you are america well are this america live team

parts as it was it the payday of names basin in kidney beat answers stay with us turn him talk pretty three days two years ago at the age of forty one barely speaking french avid safaris moved parts he had no special feelings about france no particular interest in the french he would be the same if it is core he said to me a sentence that i think if the french ever heard that he said it they would deport him he moved for two reasons one his boy friend huge had a run down house in normally at two why not and over the course of two years he has written extensively about his experience hi stories for the radio for magazines for his newest book in is stories avid betrays life in parts as a series of humiliations and near humiliations and if you h had with him for a few days you realize he is not exaggerating much this is my worst night mar are here he barely gone three box from his apartment on our walking toward of parts when he stopped on the sidewalk i my liter has thrown out of guard fruit which would mean that i would have to ask somebody if a for a match and to what i would say is hello you have some fair but i i hate saying that that i usually carried four lighters on me i always have a back of doing into be e e grab an no one mist o the lie and here i will not end the astern alienor the a fire o or us curious but davits thoughts about parts precisely because he was never somebody who had any special feelings for the place he did not move here with his head full of earnest hemmingway bestride skin and sarrture at purse he was a blank slate and for several hours every day was in parts avid would walk me to the places he finds most interesting and the first thing i learned was this it is dramatic to learn a new language that a lot of davit's experience of city a lot if his personal geography of parts has to do simply with wear people are cruel to him when he speaks and were they are not this is a hard for store where the owner and the people who work there are really really nice to me i by things here all the time i by things that i do not even need just because there is kind and may generally jo start laughing right when i walk in the door then the owner will call his assistant out of the back room and say he is back he is back and i by things i bought a heating element for i can make tea in my hotel room cause i had to get to germany i can go

shopkeepers do not notice him here been buying his newspaper from the same women in his neighborhood seven days a week for over a year e recently she said to him out of the blue are you a tourist here i vacation i said i have been coming here and buying my newspaper every day for the last nineteen months no ism not on vacation i have an apartment around the corner but it took i took that long for

place we go f this a little conversation just normal small take and goes you a he is really delighted and can decide it off for me afterwards fine by line when he first moved here when his french last was not going well he was constantly being scolded by people for not understanding the simplest things direction prices but the proper change people here are crazy about exact change scares to me he realize it some point tat he could make it all feel better if he transformed himself from the inept foreigner to the inept foreigner with a charge card people would be really nice to you if you spend a lot of one then i just started going out in blind things and have a bad a in school and go out after school and by a best or i crisp lamp because people were unfailingly nice while i was writing out that check i would say the most screwed up thing and that would say you speak well and t would compliment me and i would feel good and then i would leave an i would think wait a minute i took a while to get that under control si felt you i just observing your dad as an outsider i thought you would put yourself into this position were the smallest human acts of kindness have turned out to mean much they have words before there were things that i did really think about does not take much to make me happy now where is before i feel at took quite a bit i set maser more over feeling of adventure or more feeling of humiliation it is more a feeling i humiliation it would be a feeling of adventure if i were a different tired person if i were a more adventurous person but for me to get on a train and go to switzerland i do not think oh good i get to have an adventure i think oh great i get to make and ass out of myself in two different languages that to what i wind up doing in germany they always include breakfast with your hotel in ism not a breakfast heater but i want a cup of coffee or something n we stayed at this i i stayed at the hotel in germany i it remember town the last time i was there and i go down stairs to have my breakfast the news six people seemed at table and usually they have got lots of table but here there is only one table and ism thinking endearingly wont to sit with six people but if i turn around leave then he'll think i that ism being rood i have got in this far i have to sit down an the table with these six people i pull out of chair and the man said something to me in german and i say oh no just coffee for me ism find with that when he was trying to tell me was hat i was in his kitchen this was the kitchen of the owner and this was the owner of the hotel in his and his family sitting down to breakfast i just saw this door and i opened it and i was in their quarters and then he had to go and wake out his nine year old and his nine year old come an explained to me in english that in fact the dining room was downstairs i do not see to that and i did not see it is an adventure it just happen they eve been moved here at a particular moment in slide halter years of making us living quaking apartments carrying furniture he finally published books made the best sellers was on the radio one on tours unfilled two thousand and five thousand see halls with people who wanted to hear an read and i think most people are built to take only much of that to have people think that were somebody i think for most people for people who were not hopeless egomaniac s there is a normal balancing that has to happen have believing that there is somebody to believing that there are nobody there is a ratio a balance that has to happen in most people's heads have know night for ten years and i think that what happened to him is that the somebody side of that actuation got crazily invited fantastically inflated and the nobody side had hydrant flat to catch up they had to balance out have b a nation of book buying a adults was going t tell him how great he was back home he needed an entire second nation of adults reminding him that really how important was it then that is ex back to the case when i do go back it is not going from i do not know having an audience to being anon ament since beneath i in its beds beneath the plan to the edge it is going from having an audience to being to being a foreigner which is the lowest life or is to be a foreigner when you were ai we going humiliated about yet made i always had did not open my mouth because i let and i sounded a girl is om its notes the feeling that ism you still the really the feeling that i yet here is more comfortable to me one day avid takes me to a came that he goes to all the time often alone and ism surprised when he tells me that he somebody who until recently had trouble going to a restaurant our came by himself just to get a cup coffee because ism always afraid that there not can to see me there an tin them just be stock there and other people will say look there in an know one's waited on that find he is been ne for and an hour and he is not no one to do with himself i can terribly self conscious in he situations me you ism not scared tat from sitting in the restaurant along that that they want see me tut i soon that that ell see me and that the way on me you on mean to business in they me the money and to though you usually wit on you not but ism always convince that they do not see me and tat they are join always on me and did you seem to happen to me many times in my life that i would going to a place and then you to be ten your leaving of your own relation you been waiting for somebody and in that you look at your watching i do not by guess or not can a shell an not can aside found here and wait any longer and you make this home it is little play the you do ut really nobody's watching it but it very abroad and then you can get out get up and leave things li gold you are striking is that your sitting there and you think that other people are watching in such a way that they will think of that guy has no on waiter or it is that's what i i i look at deal that and i notice when it happens to other people ans because i look that things that that i imagine that everybody else in itstren' to to be quite a burden to carry into a foreign country it is somebody does something stupid in front of him avid says he goes hon rites it down tells his friends sometimes turns it into a s try that he reads in front of thousands or tens of thousands of strangers and when he says somethings stupid in french which he does daily he believes that it is possible the shop keepers or waiters to strung it off never think about it again but it seems just as possible that they go tell their friends and laugh at him that is why i get embarrassed to the way that i speak is because i go home and i write every thing down that is he we i am i as some that everybody else on that way it is well you out to the places the avid by expect in parts and is copping from one discreet island that avid had already explore around to be safe for human habitation to the next discreet island things is the way that anybody gets to know any new sit especially a city we do not speak the language you try one place and they tries second place and you return to those places over and over slowly expanding your territory to gradually include more little spots it you return to the paces avid takes me to usually have one of these characterestates the were fantastically unusual and interesting things to buy they were places of a type which sip we do not exist in the united states there places where the french was usually very simple often met the present of children i looks of yer gardens eyes an old pure theatre where see treasure of the solar it dislike watching an art form as sturdy and indestructible as the cock roach

glass it is hi sericin life the radio program the dares to ask the question w no after you madam if i can lay my cards on the table at this point in the program i have never understood why anybody cares much about france i mean it is fine it is lovely but there is just this thing that some america have for parts though is they are the first to admit it can be kind of ridiculous well when people ask me where i live i sometimes say parts and they say will i mean you live in parts a me but but that is my dream christian hoanatdo has lived in parts for five years you know why do you live in parts and i swollen i i just sort of wanted to all the reasons that you give sound really embarrassingly say i ridiculous tat this point i in parts as a stale dream and a and it is kind of fortune

week long i really love them i think he loves mantel no e something tit to come here and they sort of get off on that feeling of beam they think they are unusual because they put themselves in this position to me that that is really countaffunin parts the very special yet they think it makes them special to live here as if it ay as if it is original and be an part of the horrifying thing about moving here now it is it is a shut a sort of disappointing experience to realize that your your dream is banal i mean this is a dream i had my whole life and it seems ridiculous to me now that it meant much to me with importantthe thing about loving a city christian says is it a city does not really love you back whenever i asked america who love france what it was about france that just got to them much when did o begin for them er feeling about france they all talked about scraps of french culture that made to them when they were very young the madelane books the red balloon french films montesory french class in grade school i think there is still a part of america were the idea of parts parts not the space programmed by the intrinette or moving to new york city parts represents reaching a world outside oneself which you clime for start to coming here as a tea ago from a small town of pennsylvania an is essentially cons trusted an entire life round the feeling that he got parts he went on to become a scholar and director of the romance studies department porno university father of several books get fat it cigarette a sublime which are deeply suffused with a sensibility that is partly just on america or anyway see paresis e sensibility that is all about the small pleasures of everyday life no ism the french have a much more much moon complicated and much what guilty willishenship to their body beginning wit of eating on not only the way they the can pleasure that they take an eating i mean the america notion the food is medication from see is totally repulsive to to the french and yet increasingly i man in america i mean saw you here man people et only the function of what they think is good for them and i mean nobody in friends what he strictly

came to parts he felt it slip off his back did you have i you to the contofeeling yet i really have to say that i have felt that way ever since i got here and is a lot of my friends saying o why you living there in fact a friend of liniment to loschoo it he said what is it about speaking french that makes white people not races he who isn't very skeptical but it really it goes beyond that it is it is not just that we feel free of the burden of race because we are still black i still experience myself as blanket's just it that is not the center of my identity it is not the first thing people relate to when i meet them here jane first came to parts an nineteen seventy five and moved here in ninety five she is a lawyer in the french office of the being america company she grow up in the

and i grappled a lot with that the racial identity what would my posture be on from the projects but you people say i talk a white girl and hen the white girls are i your project and then when i got here no that matter because if i spoke three words o french that made sense people me an they celebrated me i did not have to worry about talking a like girl or project girl or anything to was an incredible relief the central conflict of her life suddenly vanished in parts all the distinctions about what kind of while person she should be they were all moot if i the most distinguishing fact about hand it was not that she was black it was the she was an america which surprised her i associated the word america is white eyes with flags on their lawns who did not particularly me and people would call me america did sound not america am black and these were black french people i you are america and they i remember these french west india friends of mind this one in particular from martinique was saying you even walk an america a like what do you mean what does an america walk and she said they kick their legs when they walk that kick their legs forward i do not know i tell my friends cause o i was in brook then just i a few weeks ago an this woman who never been to rope was saying what is it and in france are they wan other people ow they prejudice i said no they us it is incredible a country full of white people and they us but it is still it is a difficult thing because they us but they do not other people who look us and that sort of the french paradox parts of course has its own housing projects in the suburbs surround the city now with generations of african who were born on french soil if fay probed discrimination housing discrimination and they are not well receive they are not welcome than they are french and in a way for african america were in a very bazaar position it is almost being an honorary white an apart south africa and i notice that you now as my french got better and better that sometimes i was not as well received as i would be if i played up my america accent when french people if i walking to a shop and people would think i was just not based tho i say just another all just one of their own from martinique or gladly it would not be the same reception if i came on with a very heavy america acts n or even spoke english i i would the yo you ti i ti hat you ere an african wile a little bit of a chill in the air mike a know yes when i help you not much oh was tat ti merely gin oh i love of i love to speak english it is it is very vicar it is a it is a hard thing to reconcile because i mean good feeling is good feeling and when some one receives you and makes you feel good you it is a positive experience when when you are in a shop and i oil the ti chilling the a and they think of you as an african will you actually pay up your america act well what happened was i started o experiencing that and i actually adjusted my my speech that at least i would get the benefit oh b i mean ism here in this country i want to get the benefit of being an african america instead of walking and a we madame moment tells i she saw it'd say we a sivouplaescovoupuve me de o maybe make i card do that at at works went was a friend of wants is suggested to her than may be partisans preferred black people from america was only a certain class of black america usually comes to france educated cultured interested in france when jane asked the river corneal west about this that a speed she gave this summer in parts that was his argument basically suggest was a class thing and he said well look at you your professionally articulate i made if she brought fifteen of your cousin i red a different thing basically you was saying if i brought all my home girls from the hood who did not go to valor an where at lawyers and who did not speak french olresepsion might be a little collier even though they also are black america but i think if that is true that is not about races n and that is about class before i met nonet i read the book that she ware by what it was for her growing to it miscalled project girl and was remarkable about it is how franc she is about all the compulsive things that she found herself doing during the years when she was regularly traveling bestowing the projects and word of the aspiring up her mental class ire's a struggle at er first your adviser for instance she felt out of place that she started taking the train down to new york city to score heroine think she never even done when she lived in the projects just got ticked tout a school for that there as if the further that she travelled into the world of college the more the project side of her personality was compelled to express itself somehow shed picks herself a somebody was depressed and in battle and loss for years and the most striking thing about meeting her if you read the book is how completely happy she seems to day she is one of the happier seeming people i ever met just relaxed and funny and at ease and her feeling about france the country with this trains formation took place it can be ta shocking to actual french people when be just one the euro two thousand you was i came to work and i was telling the maraca and secretary we won now's been gave and she you just glass at me because she was not born here and she says ism not french in marc and its just black america ism not america in black and i was we on we on and she is what do you talking about you not even french but you mean we one i ism french in my heart and this black friend of mine was saying now your the only person i know who could sing the mousy es that sons i to i you are why it is because i say to them i never had a country i never had a country i had o good i had broken but i never felt i had a country now i have a country it is a little one we always come in third or fourth place in the lentils but it is france there is something else there is certain things about french culture on says but just make life hear very pleasant one think people do not ask you personal questions for ye grew up we work which her family which your story you were not constantly explaining herself she says she has one friend which she knew for five years before she knew this woman had a grown son also there is not the same striving the same ambition to be number one is in the states especially compared with the corporate lawjob she used to have everybody was expected to put in sixty and seventy and eighty hours a week here that would be seen this very strange work just is not t an important to most people i it'll get tears in my eyes just sometimes i look around the subway and i look at only french plan thank you for letting me live here in your country we had outside but you i get your country bit your affinity here sin that a french person tide of an outside i in and i think that is what it is to be project girl i was always an outsider and i feel most inside right now where i most outside go figure you that is what freedom it to it is not about nothing left to lose it is about nothing left to be you will have to be anything i was i was just thinking about it this morning it side ism an outsider i will always be a partner no matter how good my french gets i will never really be french no matter how much of a want be i am and yet i feel that ism home ism just home around the corner from the coffee floor that were the author names balding look for a while jennet says she feels shanderstands a
